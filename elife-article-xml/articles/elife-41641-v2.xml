(SLE)-prone mouse models, the role for IFNÎ³ signaling in human antibody responses is unknown. We show that elevated levels of IFNÎ³ in SLE patients correlate with expansion of the T-bet expressing IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>neg</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>neg</sup> (DN2) pre-antibody secreting cell (pre-ASC) subset. We demonstrate that naÃ¯ve B cells form T-bet<sup>hi</sup> pre-ASCs following stimulation with either Th1 cells or with IFNÎ³, IL-2, anti-Ig and TLR7/8 ligand and that IL-21 dependent ASC formation is significantly enhanced by IFNÎ³ or IFNÎ³-producing T cells. IFNÎ³ promotes ASC development by synergizing with IL-2 and TLR7/8 ligands to induce genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming of B cells, which results in increased chromatin accessibility surrounding IRF4 and BLIMP1 binding motifs and epigenetic remodeling of <italic>IL21R</italic> and <italic>PRDM1</italic> loci. Finally, we show that IFNÎ³ signals poise B cells to differentiate by increasing their responsiveness to IL-21.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>interferons</kwd><kwd>B

progressive dysregulation of the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, which ultimately leads to loss of immune tolerance in B and T lymphocytes and the production of autoantibodies (Abs) by Ab-secreting B cells (ASCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsokos et al., 2016</xref>). The hallmark SLE autoAbs recognize nuclear proteins and nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gatto et al., 2016</xref>), which are also ligands for TLR7 and TLR9 that are expressed by innate immune cells and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avalos et al., 2010</xref>). SLE autoAbs bound to their autoAgs form immune complexes, which are responsible for many of the clinical manifestations of SLE, particularly those associated with organ damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gatto et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with the important role for B cells and ASCs in SLE pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanz, 2014</xref>), the only new drug approved to treat SLE in decades, Belimumab, targets B cells.</p><p>Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines also contribute to SLE pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apostolidis et al., 2011</xref>). SLE patient PBMCs often exhibit a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature and systemic IFNÎ± is elevated in many patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Obermoser and Pascual, 2010</xref>). It is less well appreciated that IFNÎ³ is also increased in some SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">CsiszÃ¡r et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harigai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pollard et al., 2013</xref>) and that a distinct IFNÎ³ transcription signature can be detected in PBMCs from a portion of SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Welcher et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, elevated serum IFNÎ³ can be observed years before IFNÎ± or autoAbs are detected in SLE patients and much earlier than clinical disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Munroe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these observations, B cells from SLE patients can exhibit signs of prior IFNÎ³ exposure. For example, two IFNÎ³-inducible proteins, CXCR3 and T-bet, are more highly expressed by circulating B cells from SLE patients compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harigai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nicholas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, data from mouse SLE models show that clinical disease is dependent on B cell-specific expression of the IFNÎ³R and the IFNÎ³- induced transcription factors (TF) STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domeier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thibault et al., 2008</xref>) and T-bet in some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rubtsova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) but not all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2019</xref>) models. Taken together, these data suggest that IFNÎ³-driven inflammation may contribute to SLE B cell-driven pathophysiology.</p><p>Two interrelated populations of circulating B cells present in SLE patients, namely the CD11c<sup>hi</sup> B cells, which are also called age associated B cells (ABCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karnell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rubtsov et al., 2017</xref>), and the IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>negÂ </sup>B double negative (B<sub>DN</sub>) B cells, which are often referred to as âatypicalâ memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Portugal et al., 2017</xref>), are reported to express the IFNÎ³-inducible TF T-bet. These B cells, which may have been exposed to IFNÎ³ at some step in their developmental process, are present in low numbers in the blood or tonsils of healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ehrhardt et al., 2005</xref>) and are reported to be expanded in chronically infected, aging and autoimmune individuals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Naradikian et al., 2016</xref>), including patients with SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>). The CD11c<sup>hi</sup> population found in SLE patients is heterogeneous and contains CD11c-expressing IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> switched memory (B<sub>SW</sub>) cells, IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>neg</sup> naÃ¯ve (B<sub>N</sub>) cells and B<sub>DN</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The B<sub>DN</sub> population is also heterogeneous and can be subdivided using CD11c and CXCR5 into the DN2 (CD11c<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>neg</sup>) subset, which express T-bet, and the DN1 (CD11c<sup>lo</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>) subset, which does not express T-bet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite extensive data showing that these overlapping populations of CD11c<sup>hi</sup> B cells and B<sub>DN</sub> cells are expanded in a number of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Naradikian et al., 2016</xref>), our understanding regarding their origin and function is incomplete. Although initial studies examining B<sub>DN</sub> cells from malaria or HIV-infected individuals described these B cells as anergic (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Portugal et al., 2017</xref>), more recent studies reported that the CD11c-expressing IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>lo</sup> activated B<sub>SW</sub> cells from influenza vaccinated humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lau et al., 2017</xref>) and HIV infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knox et al., 2017</xref>), as well as the CD11c<sup>hi</sup> cells from SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) and the CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells from SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>) possess phenotypic and molecular characteristics of pre-ASCs. Both the CD11c<sup>hi</sup> B cells and the more narrowly defined DN2 subset from SLE patients differentiate into ASCs following stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 subset from SLE patients can produce autoAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that these cells can potentially contribute to disease.</p><p>Since T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 pre-ASCs produce autoAbs and correlate with disease severity in SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>), we set out to identify the signals that control the development and differentiation of this population into ASCs. Here we show that expansion of the DN2 cells in SLE patients correlates with systemic concentrations of IFNÎ³ and IFNÎ³-induced cytokines. We demonstrate that activation of naÃ¯ve B (B<sub>N</sub>) cells from healthy donors or SLE patients with IFNÎ³-producing T cells or IFNÎ³+TLR7/8 and BCR ligands induces formation of a T-bet<sup>hi</sup> pre-ASC population that is phenotypically, transcriptionally and functionally similar to the SLE T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 subset. We show that IFNÎ³ signals significantly augment ASC differentiation by sensitizing B<sub>N</sub> cells to respond to BCR, IL-2 and TLR7/8 signals and by promoting global epigenetic changes in the activated B cells that lead to significantly increased chromatin accessibility surrounding binding sites for the key ASC commitment TFs, BLIMP1 and IRF4. We find IFNÎ³-dependent differentially accessible regions (DARs) within the <italic>IL21R</italic> and <italic>PRDM1</italic> (BLIMP1) loci and show that early IFNÎ³ signaling promotes increased IL-21R expression and responsiveness. Finally, we observe that the key IFNÎ³-regulated epigenetic changes in the <italic>in vitro</italic> generated T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> pre-ASC subset and the molecular signals required to induce ASC development are conserved in the SLE patient DN2 cells. Collectively, these data suggest that IFNÎ³ signals can augment ASC development and may regulate the formation of pathogenic autoreactive pre-ASCs in some SLE patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expansion of T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells correlates with systemic IFNÎ³ levels in SLE patients</title><p>Recent studies from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stone et al., 2019</xref>) revealed that differentiation of mouse B cells activated in the presence of IFNÎ³-producing T cells was dependent on B cell intrinsic expression of the IFNÎ³R and the IFNÎ³-induced transcription factor (TF), T-bet. This result fit well with data from our group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rubtsova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) showing that B cell intrinsic expression of T-bet is required for the development of autoAb-mediated disease in SLE mouse models and suggested that IFNÎ³ signaling in B cells might also regulate development of ASCs from autoreactive B cells. Consistent with this possibility, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>) identified a population of circulating T-bet-expressing B cells in SLE patients, referred to as DN2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>), that express high levels of T-bet and exhibit phenotypic and functional properties of pre-ASCs. Based on these data, we postulated that the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 pre-ASC population that is expanded in a subset of SLE patients likely arises in response to IFNÎ³-dependent signals. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed whether expansion of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 pre-ASC subset in SLE patients correlated with IFNÎ³ levels in these patients. Consistent with our prior studies using a different cohort of SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>), we observed that a subset of our SLE patients presented with an expanded population of circulating IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>neg</sup> (double negative, B<sub>DN</sub> cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1aâb</xref>) that could be subdivided into CD11c<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>neg</sup> DN2 cells and CD11c<sup>neg</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup> DN1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The DN2 cells, but not the DN1 cells, uniformly expressed high levels of T-bet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and also expressed high levels of CD19 and FcRL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2a</xref>). In agreement with our prior studies, the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells (gated as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2b</xref>) expressed intermediate levels of the ASC-promoting TFs, Blimp1 and IRF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1eâf</xref>,) and their presence correlated with anti-Smith autoAb titers in the patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Next, we measured cytokines in plasma from the SLE patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h-k</xref>).

To address which signals were critical for the <italic>in vitro</italic> development of T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells we set up âall minus one culturesâ by activating B<sub>N</sub> cells for 3 days with or without individual stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). As expected, when HD B<sub>N</sub> cells were activated for 3 days in the presence of anti-Ig and all cytokinesÂ +Â R848 (ALL condition), essentially all of the cells upregulated T-bet and IRF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4fâg</xref>). Similar results were observed when the B<sub>N</sub> cells were activated for 3 days without anti-Ig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>) or without R848, IL-21, BAFF or IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). By contrast, when the cells were activated without IFNÎ³, more than 80% of the cells were T-bet<sup>neg/lo</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). While this wasnât particularly surprising, given that T-bet is IFNÎ³-inducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stone et al., 2019</xref>), the cells also failed to upregulate IRF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>), indicating that IFNÎ³ signals are obligate for the <italic>in vitro</italic> generation of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> pre-ASC like population.</p><p>Although HD B<sub>N</sub> cells activated with anti-Ig, cytokines and R848 developed in an IFNÎ³-dependent fashion into T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> pre-ASC like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>), CD38<sup>hi</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> ASCs did not accumulate in the cultures containing all stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). This suggested that our defined cultures lacked a factor that was necessary for the differentiation of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> pre-ASC-like cells into ASCs. Alternatively, it was possible that one or more of the stimuli present in the cultures either blocked differentiation or needed to be provided transiently during a discrete temporal window. Since anti-Ig was not added in our original <italic>in vitro</italic> Th1 and B<sub>N</sub> co-cultures, we first examined whether BCR signaling was blocking ASC development. We therefore stimulated B<sub>N</sub> cells for 6 days with the complete activation cocktail (+,+) or removed the anti-Ig from the activation cocktail for the first three days (-,+), last three days (+,-), or throughout the entire culture period (-,-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). Consistent with our prior results, few ASCs were recovered when anti-Ig was included throughout the culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). Similarly, excluding anti-Ig from the culture for all 6 days or for the first 3 days also resulted in poor ASC recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). However, when anti-Ig was present only during the first 3 days of culture ASCs accumulated in the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). These data therefore argued that early but transient BCR signals were important for the development and recovery of ASCs from cytokine and R848 stimulated B<sub>N</sub> cells.</p><p>Next, we asked whether IFNÎ³ signals were required for the development of ASCs in the culture. We therefore activated B<sub>N</sub> cells with the cytokine cocktail and R848 for 6 days, including 3 days in the presence of anti-Ig and 3 days without anti-Ig. In individual cultures we excluded specific cytokines or R848 for all 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>). In agreement with our earlier experiment, ASCs were recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>) when B cells were transiently activated with anti-Ig in the continuous presence of R848 and the complete cytokine cocktail. Although elimination of BAFF or IL-2 from the cultures decreased the number of ASCs recovered from the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>), neither cytokine was obligate for ASC development. By contrast, and consistent with prior reports showing that ASC development from B<sub>N</sub> cells requires IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ettinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tangye, 2015</xref>), no ASCs were detected in the cultures lacking IL-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>). Likewise, ASC recovery in cultures lacking R848 or IFNÎ³ was also at background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>). Collectively, the data indicated that formation of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> pre-ASC like population required IFNÎ³ signals while the development and recovery of ASCs were dependent on transient BCR signals, IFNÎ³, R848 and IL-21.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Temporal control of ASC development from T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> pre-ASCs by IFNÎ³, R848 and IL-21</title><p>Although the number of ASCs recovered from cultures lacking IL-21, R848 or IFNÎ³ was equally low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>), the frequencies of ASCs and number of total cells recovered from each culture differed dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggested that the different stimuli were likely to play distinct roles in the development and recovery of ASCs. Since IFNÎ³, but not R848 or IL-21, was required for the formation of the pre-ASC population, we postulated that IFNÎ³ signals would be required during the initial activation (Days 0â3, priming phase) while TLR7/8 and IL-21 signals would be more critical later in the culture period (Days 4â6, differentiation phase). To test this hypothesis, we activated CTV-labeled B<sub>N</sub> cells for 3 days in the presence of anti-Ig and 3 days without anti-Ig â while adding the various stimuli minus one during the priming phase (+,-), during the differentiation phase (-,+) or throughout (+,+) the culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We then measured proliferation, cell recovery and the frequency and number of ASCs present in cultures on day 6 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref> for representative flow cytometry plots). Eliminating IFNÎ³ from the cultures during the first 3 days prevented formation of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> pre-ASC like population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). Moreover, consistent with our prediction, CD38<sup>hi</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> ASCs, whether measured as the frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) or number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) were essentially undetected in cultures lacking IFNÎ³ in the first 3 days. B<sub>N</sub> cells that did not receive an IFNÎ³ signal during the priming phase proliferated less over the 6 day culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), resulting in minimal cell recovery on day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). By contrast, adding IFNÎ³ only during the priming phase was sufficient to induce formation of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> pre-ASC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1a</xref>)Â and to promote proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) and cell recovery on day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).

This was due, at least in part, to the fact that proliferation was severely stunted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>), resulting in greatly reduced cell recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>) in the day 6 cultures. When R848 was only added to the cultures between days 3â6, we observed no impact on pre-ASC formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1d</xref>) or the frequency of ASCs in the day 6 cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). However, the number of cells recovered on day 6 was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>), which affected the number of ASCs recovered in the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Despite the poor recovery of cells in the cultures that received TLR7/8 stimulation only between days 3â6, proliferation of the cells was not impacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). These data therefore indicated that R848 played both early and late roles in the development of ASCs, with early TLR7/8 signals appearing to promote B cell survival and late TLR7/8 signals promoting proliferation.</p><p>Finally, we assessed when IL-21 signals were required for ASC development. When IL-21 was only included for the first 3 days of the culture, pre-ASCs formed normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1g</xref>) but ASCs could not be detected whether measured by frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref>) or number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5k</xref>) of ASCs recovered. The lack of ASCs in this culture correlated with greatly decreased proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l</xref>) and cell recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5m</xref>) on day 6. By contrast, the proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l</xref>) and recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5m</xref>) of cells stimulated with IL-21 only during the late phase were not significantly different from cells that were stimulated for all 6 days in the presence of IL-21. Moreover, the frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref>) and number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5k</xref>) of ASCs recovered from the cultures that were exposed to IL-21 between days 3â6 only were very similar to cells that were stimulated all 6 days in the presence of IL-21. Therefore, late IL-21 signals were sufficient to drive ASC formation. Thus, while inclusion of IFNÎ³, TLR7/8 ligand and IL-21 throughout the entire culture period promoted optimal ASC recovery, IFNÎ³ and BCR signals were required during the priming phase, IL-21 was necessary during the later expansion and differentiation phase and R848 was important throughout the culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5n</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>IFNÎ³ synergizes with R848 and IL-2 to promote proliferation, IL-21 responsiveness and ASC recovery</title><p>Our data indicated that IFNÎ³ played a non-redundant and critical role in the formation of the Tbet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, and was necessary for development and recovery of ASCs, even when IL-21 and R848 were present. These data led us to hypothesize that IFNÎ³ signaling might sensitize B cells to respond to other stimuli, like IL-21, IL-2 and TLR ligands, that promote B cell proliferation and differentiation. To test whether IFNÎ³ signals promoted B cell responsiveness to R848 we activated CTV-labeled HD B<sub>N</sub> cells with anti-Ig, IL-2 and increasing concentrations of R848 in the presence and absence of IFNÎ³ for 3 days, washed the cells and then re-cultured them for an additional 3 days with IL-21 and the same concentration of R848 that the cells were exposed to during the priming phase. On day 6 we measured cell division and ASC formation. Consistent with our earlier experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the B cells remained largely undivided when R848 was completely excluded from the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). By contrast, when high dose R848 was included in the cultures, the cells proliferated regardless of whether IFNÎ³ was included in the cultures for the first 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). However, when we activated B<sub>N</sub> cells with a 100-fold lower dose of TLR7/8 ligand, proliferation was only seen in the cultures that contained IFNÎ³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Moreover, we observed that the frequency of ASCs in the cultures that were activated with low dose TLR ligand in the presence of IFNÎ³ was approximately 10-fold higher than that observed for the cultures that lacked IFNÎ³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Similar results were seen when we cross-titrated the IFNÎ³ and R848 in the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

We activated HD B<sub>N</sub> cells for 3 days with anti-IgÂ +R848 (Be.0 conditions), anti-IgÂ +R848+IL-2 (Be.IL2 conditions), anti-IgÂ +R848+IFNÎ³ (Be.IFNÎ³ conditions) or with anti-IgÂ +R848+IL-2+IFNÎ³ (Be.Î³2 conditions). We then washed and stimulated the cells for an additional 3 days with R848Â +IL-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>) and evaluated cell recovery and ASC formation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>Â for representative flow cytometry plots). As expected, we recovered very few viable cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6fâg</xref>) and no ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6hâi</xref>) from the Be.0 cells on day 6. B cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>) and recovery of total cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>) and ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>) were also very low in the Be.IL2 cultures. Consistent with our earlier experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), ASCs were easily detected in the Be.IFNÎ³ cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6hâi</xref>). However, when B cells were exposed to both IL-2 and IFNÎ³ during the early priming phase, the number of ASCs recovered on day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>) was significantly more than seen in the Be.IFNÎ³ or Be.IL2 cultures. This was due to an increase in the number of cells recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>) and to an increase in the frequency of ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>) in the cultures. Thus, early IFNÎ³ and IL-2 signals cooperate to induce formation and recovery of ASCs.</p><p>Finally, since IL-21 signaling was obligate for ASC differentiation in our <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, we hypothesized that early IFNÎ³ signals might program the B cells to respond to IL-21. To test this hypothesis, we measured phosphorylation of the IL-21R associated TF, STAT3, before and after IL-21 stimulation in day 3 Be.0, Be.IL2, Be.IFNÎ³ and Be.Î³2 cells. Day 3 basal levels of phospho-STAT3 were similar and low in the Be.0, Be.IL2 and Be.IFNÎ³ cells and modestly higher in the Be.Î³2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref> for flow cytometry plots). However, following a 20 min exposure to IL-21, phospho-STAT3 levels were increased significantly in the B cells that were exposed to IFNÎ³ during the priming phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k</xref>), indicating that early IFNÎ³ stimulation enhanced IL-21R signaling. Collectively, these data show that early IFNÎ³ signals sensitize human B<sub>N</sub> cells to respond more robustly to stimuli, like TLR7/8 ligands, IL-2 and IL-21, that promote B cell activation, proliferation and differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Early IFNÎ³ signals cooperate with IL-2 and R848 to initiate ASC epigenetic programming and IL-21R expression</title><p>Our data showed that early IFNÎ³ signals cooperated with both IL-2 and R848 to promote IL-21 dependent ASC formation and recovery. Given the importance of IFNÎ³ in driving the development of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> pre-ASC like population, we hypothesized that IFNÎ³ might induce molecular and epigenetic changes that would initiate early commitment to the ASC lineage and/or regulate IL-21R expression and responsiveness. To test this possibility, we used ATAC-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) to identify differentially accessible regions (DAR) in the genome of Be.0, Be.IL2, Be.IFNÎ³ and Be.Î³2 cells on day 3 â a time in which cell recovery was similar in the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7aâb</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref> for representative flow plots) and the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> pre-ASC like population was easily detected in the IFNÎ³-containing cultures. As expected, distinct sets of DAR were found in all 4 groups of activated B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), however the largest number of chromatin accessible regions was seen in the day 3 Be.Î³2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Moreover, the chromatin accessibility pattern in the Be.Î³2 cells appeared to reflect cooperation or synergy between the IFNÎ³ and IL-2 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Examination of chromatin accessibility within 100 bp surrounding consensus TF binding motifs revealed significant (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> for statistical analyses) enrichment in accessibility near T-bet binding sites in the B cells that were exposed to IFNÎ³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Similarly, accessibility around STAT5 binding motifs was enriched in IL-2 exposed B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). However, the Be.Î³2 cells exhibited the greatest enrichment in chromatin accessibility surrounding both T-bet and STAT5 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7dâe</xref>), suggesting that IFNÎ³ and IL-2 cooperate to remodel the epigenome. Consistent with this, binding motifs for NF-ÎºB p65 and REL, TFs activated by anti-Ig and TLR7/8 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaileh and Sen, 2012</xref>), were most accessible in the Be.Î³2 cells compared to all other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7fâg</xref>). Moreover, chromatin accessibility surrounding the HOMER-defined IRF4 and BLIMP1 binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) was also highly enriched in the Be.Î³2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7hâi</xref>). These data therefore suggested that these key ASC initiating TFs were already exerting epigenetic changes to the genome of the Be.Î³2 cells, even before these cells were exposed to IL-21. Consistent with this finding, when we examined the <italic>PRDM1</italic> (BLIMP1) locus, we identified 4 DAR that were each more accessible in the Be.Î³2 cells relative to the other cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7j</xref>).

One of the DAR contained two putative T-bet binding motifs and was directly aligned with a T-bet ChIP-seq peak from GM12878 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7k</xref>).

Although day 3 B cells from Be.IFNÎ³ and Be.Î³2 cultures expressed slightly higher levels of IL-21R compared to B cells from Be.0 and Be.IL2 cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7l</xref>), IL-21R expression were comparable between all groups at this timepoint.

Taken together, the data suggested that early IFNÎ³ signals synergize with BCR, TLR and IL-2 signals to induce global changes in chromatin accessibility and promote increased TF binding at T-bet, NF-ÎºB, STAT5, BLIMP1 and IRF4 binding sites as well as chromatin remodeling at the <italic>PRDM1</italic> and <italic>IL21R</italic> loci.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>SLE patient T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells differentiate into ASCs without a further requirement for BCR stimulation</title><p>Previous data from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>) showed that the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells from SLE patients were transcriptionally distinct from conventional memory cells and, like B<sub>N</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tangye, 2015</xref>), require IL-21 signals to differentiate.

First, we postulated that T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells isolated from SLE patients should differentiate without a requirement for BCR stimulation. Second, we predicted that SLE patient T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells should differentiate more rapidly than B<sub>N</sub> cells. To test these predictions, we sort-purified (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref> for purification strategy) SLE patient-derived T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells, T-bet<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>N</sub> cells and T-bet<sup>lo</sup> memory B cells, including the IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>neg</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> memory (DN1 cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>) and IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> memory (conventional B<sub>mem</sub>) subsets. We stimulated the cells for 2.5 days with R848, IFNÎ³, IL-21 and IL-2 and then enumerated IgG-producing ASCs. As expected, the conventional B<sub>mem</sub> and DN1 memory cells efficiently formed ASCs in this short timeframe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>), while B<sub>N</sub> cells failed to differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). Consistent with our predictions, ASCs were easily identified in the day 2.5 cultures containing T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). Indeed, ASC recovery was at least 50-fold higher in T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cell cultures compared to the B<sub>N</sub> cultures and only 2â3 times less than that seen with the memory B cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). These data therefore suggested that the expanded population of T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells present in some SLE patients likely represent a population of IFNÎ³, TLR ligand and antigen programmed primary effectors that can rapidly differentiate in a BCR-signaling independent manner into ASCs following IL-21 exposure. The importance of IFNÎ³ in driving human ASC commitment and differentiation in the context of autoimmune disease is discussed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we show that IFNÎ³ promotes the <italic>in vitro</italic> formation of a T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>neg</sup> (B<sub>DN</sub>) population that is similar to the T-bet expressing CD11c<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>neg</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> (referred to as DN2 cells) subset found in SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>) and the CD11c<sup>hi</sup>Age-Associated B cells (ABCs) that accumulate in aged and autoimmune mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rubtsov et al., 2017</xref>). Both the <italic>in vitro</italic> generated T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells and SLE patient-derived DN2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>) exhibit transcriptional and functional properties of pre-ASCs, suggesting that B cell intrinsic IFNÎ³R signals could regulate human ASC responses. While this hypothesis is supported by mouse experiments showing that IFNÎ³ signals enhance autoAb responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domeier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) and recent studies from our group demonstrating a role for B cell expression of the IFNÎ³R and the IFNÎ³-inducible transcription factor T-bet in ASC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stone et al., 2019</xref>), the role for IFNÎ³ and STAT1 signaling in human B cell differentiation is less clear. In fact, prior data showing that IFNÎ³ has only very modest effects on activation and differentiation of human B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakagawa et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Splawski et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rousset et al., 1991</xref>) and that patients deficient in the IFN-activated transcription factor STAT1 produce Abs in response to some vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapgier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapgier et al., 2006</xref>) argue that IFNÎ³ signaling is not obligate for the formation of human ASCs. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies do not contradict this conclusion as we also find that human B cells can differentiate in the absence of IFNÎ³-induced signals. However, we show that B cell intrinsic IFNÎ³ signals significantly enhance ASC differentiation induced in response to stimulation with anti-Ig, TLR7/8 ligand, IL-2 and IL-21. Indeed, we routinely recover 5- to 10 fold more ASCs in the B<sub>N</sub> cultures that contain IFNÎ³ or IFNÎ³-producing T cells compared to cultures that lack IFNÎ³. Thus, we argue that IFNÎ³ signaling has the potential to augment ASC development in settings, like autoimmunity and viral infection, where IFNÎ³ and TLR ligands are present.</p><p>Our data show that IFNÎ³ signals, when delivered in conjunction with IL-2 and BCRÂ +TLR7/8 ligand during the initial activation of B<sub>N</sub> cells, greatly increase ASC recovery <italic>in vitro</italic>. The co-activation of B<sub>N</sub> cells with IFNÎ³ and IL-2Â +BCRÂ +TLR7/8 ligand results in IFNÎ³-dependent chromatin remodeling and the formation of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> pre-ASC subset. These early IFNÎ³ signals are required for subsequent proliferation and differentiation following stimulation with IL-21 and TLR7/8 ligand. IFNÎ³ is not, in and of itself, a B cell mitogen and is reported to induce apoptosis of human B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernabei et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sammicheli et al., 2011</xref>). However, we find that IFNÎ³ synergizes with TLR7/8 ligand to promote multiple rounds of B cell proliferation â an important prerequisite of human ASC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tangye et al., 2003</xref>). Although <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments using human B cells show that IFNÎ³ can synergize with TLR7 and CD40 signals to promote upregulation of Bcl6 and the acquisition of a germinal center-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>), our data extend these studies to show that IFNÎ³ and TLR7/8 signals also cooperate to promote human B cell differentiation. These results are analogous to studies showing that IFNÎ±-directed signals can enhance TLR7-mediated human B cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jego et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekeredjian-Ding et al., 2005</xref>). Given the considerable overlap between genes regulated by IFNÎ± and IFNÎ³ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pollard et al., 2013</xref>), it is possible that IFNÎ± and IFNÎ³ may augment TLR7 signaling in human B cells by similar mechanisms.</p><p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest multiple ways in which early IFNÎ³ priming signals promote subsequent ASC differentiation and recovery. First, we show that IFNÎ³ cooperates with IL-2, BCR, TLR7/8 ligand to globally alter the epigenetic landscape of the activated B cells and to specifically increase chromatin accessibility surrounding NF-ÎºB, STAT5 and T-bet binding sites. While it is not particularly surprising that IFNÎ³ signaling induces increased T-bet expression and alterations in chromatin accessibility around T-bet binding sites (see forÂ example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iwata et al., 2017</xref>), the finding that chromatin accessibility surrounding NF-ÎºB and STAT5 binding motifs is also regulated by IFNÎ³ suggests that IFNÎ³ must augment TLR7/8 and IL-2-dependent signaling. This is consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data showing synergistic effects on ASC recovery when IFNÎ³ is combined with IL-2 or R848. Second, we show that IFNÎ³ promotes commitment to the ASC lineage by inducing expression of IRF4 and modifying chromatin accessibility surrounding IRF4-binding sites within regulatory regions in the genome of the activated B<sub>N</sub> cells. Third, we find that IFNÎ³ signals promote chromatin accessibility within the <italic>PRDM1</italic> (BLIMP1) locus and initiate chromatin remodeling around BLIMP1-binding sites within the genome of the activated B<sub>N</sub> cells. Finally, we demonstrate that IFNÎ³ signals alter chromatin accessibility within the <italic>IL21R</italic> locus of the activated B<sub>N</sub> cells and that this change in accessibility is associated with IFNÎ³-dependent, increased expression of the IL-21R by the activated B<sub>N</sub> cells and with increased responsiveness of these cells to IL-21, as measured by phosphorylation of STAT3. Collectively, these data suggest that IFNÎ³ signals, when combined with BCR, TLR and IL-2R signals, poise human B<sub>N</sub> cells to differentiate in response to IL-21.</p><p>One key finding from this study is that IFNÎ³-augmented ASC formation and recovery is highly reliant on TLR7/8 activation by its RNA and RNA/protein ligands, which are derived from viral pathogens and dead and dying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avalos et al., 2010</xref>). Signaling through TLR7 is known to be important in SLE as prior studies reveal that SNPs in the human <italic>TLR7</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) and overexpression of TLR7 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pisitkun et al., 2006</xref>) are associated with increased SLE susceptibility while deletion of TLR7 protects mice from the development of SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christensen et al., 2006</xref>). Our data show that deletion of the IFNÎ³-inducible transcription factor T-bet in B lineage cells prevents autoAb responses in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pisitkun et al., 2006</xref>) of TLR7-dependent SLE. Moreover, our data demonstrates that B cell intrinsic IFNÎ³ signaling induces a TLR7/8 hyperresponsive state in human B cells. This finding does not appear to be due to IFNÎ³-dependent changes in the expression of TLR7 by the B cells (data not shown). Rather, we find that IFNÎ³-exposed B<sub>N</sub> cells can respond and differentiate into ASCs when exposed to 100-fold lower concentration of TLR7/8 ligands than normally used to activate B cells. Given that we observed that even low levels of IFNÎ³ are sufficient to synergize with suboptimal concentrations of TLR7/8 ligands, we predict that B cells from autoimmune patients with detectable systemic levels IFNÎ³ will be highly sensitive to the presence of endogenous and exogenously derived TLR7 ligands.</p><p>Our data predict that TLR7-driven ASC responses are likely to be further enhanced in individuals who have increased levels of circulating IFNÎ³. Consistent with this, we show that SLE patients who have higher systemic levels of IFNÎ³ also have more T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells and higher autoAb titers. We and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>) also report that the size of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 population correlates with disease activity, particularly in African-American SLE patients. However, it is important to note that T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells are unlikely to represent a purely âpathogenicâ population as we also find an inducible population of vaccine-specific T-bet<sup>hi</sup> CD27<sup>neg</sup> DN2 cells in healthy individuals who were immunized with inactivated influenza virus (data not shown). Similarly, others report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knox et al., 2017</xref>) a T-bet expressing CD27<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>lo</sup> switched memory subset with pre-ASC attributes, which is induced following vaccination or infection. Thus, we speculate that the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B cells, which are found in HD and autoimmune patients in the settings of acute and chronic inflammation driven by vaccination, infection, autoimmunity and aging, are formed in an IFNÎ³-dependent manner and likely represent a pool of primary and secondary pre-ASCs as well as effector memory B cells that are epigenetically poised to differentiate.</p><p>The IFNÎ³-induced T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> pre-ASC population that we characterized in our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies is similar to the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 subset that is expanded in SLE patients. Since the expansion of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells in SLE patients correlates with systemic levels of IFNÎ³ and IFNÎ³-induced cytokines, we postulate that the DN2 cells likely arise in an IFNÎ³-dependent fashion in these patients. In support of this possibility, we demonstrate that the IFNÎ³-directed changes in chromatin accessibility within the <italic>IL21R</italic> and <italic>PRDM1</italic> loci seen in the <italic>in vitro</italic> generated T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> pre-ASCs are also found in T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells isolated from SLE patients. Moreover, we show that the molecular properties of the SLE DN2 subset and the <italic>in vitro</italic> generated IFNÎ³-dependent T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells are similar and unique when compared to conventional memory B cells or B<sub>N</sub> cells. For example, as discussed above, IFNÎ³ primes the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells to respond to subthreshold concentrations of R848. Similarly, SLE DN2 cells make augmented responses to TLR7/8-stimulation compared to other B cell subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>). We also show that SLE patient DN2 pre-ASCs and the <italic>in vitro</italic> generated T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> subset can differentiate without a need for additional BCR stimulation. This is similar to memory B cells but unlike what we find for B<sub>N</sub> cells. However, like B<sub>N</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deenick et al., 2013</xref>), both the SLE DN2 subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>) and the <italic>in vitro</italic> generated T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> subset require IL-21 to differentiate into ASCs. Thus, given the many shared phenotypic, molecular and functional properties of the <italic>in vitro</italic> generated T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> subset and the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells found in SLE patients, we think that the <italic>in vitro</italic> pre-ASC cultures described here could be used to better understand the development, maintenance and functional attributes of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells that are expanded and associated with more severe disease in SLE patients.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that IFNÎ³ is critical for the <italic>in vitro</italic> formation of a T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> pre-ASC population that is remarkably similar to the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells that accumulate in SLE patients who present with high autoAb titers, elevated disease activity and increased systemic levels of IFNÎ³. We show that IFNÎ³ signals, particularly when combined with IL-2 and TLR7/8Â +Â BCR ligands, initiate epigenetic reprogramming of human B cells â changes which poise the activated B<sub>N</sub> cells to respond to IL-21 and fully commit to the ASC lineage. Based on these results, we argue that blocking IFNÎ³ signaling in SLE patients should curtail development of T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 pre-ASCs from primary B<sub>N</sub> cells, which would result in decreased autoAb production and reduced disease activity. However, results from a phase I trial examining IFNÎ³ blockade in SLE patients did not reveal a therapeutic benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boedigheimer et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, no African Americans SLE patients with nephritis were included in the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boedigheimer et al., 2017</xref>). Given the data showing that T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells are most expanded in African American patients with severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenks et al., 2018</xref>) and our data presented here showing that the DN2 cells likely develop in response to IFNÎ³, we propose that future studies evaluating the efficacy of IFNÎ³ blockade in SLE patients should focus specifically on the subset of patients who present with elevated IFNÎ³ levels and significant expansion of the IFNÎ³-inducible T-bet expressing DN2 pre-ASC population.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Cells were lysed with 25 Î¼l 2x Lysis Buffer (300 mM NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 0.6% SDS, 1.6 Î¼g Proteinase-K) for 30 min at 40Â°C, low molecular weight DNA was purified by size-selection with SPRI-beads (Agencourt), and then PCR amplified using Nextera primers with 2x HiFi Polymerase Master Mix (KAPA Biosystems). Amplified, low molecular weight DNA was isolated using a second SPRI-bead size selection. Libraries were sequenced using a 50 bp paired-end run at the NYU Genome Technology Center. Raw sequencing reads were mapped to the hg19 version of the human genome using Bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) with the default settings. Duplicate reads were marked using the Picard Tools MarkDuplicates function (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>) and eliminated from downstream analyses. Enriched accessible peaks were identified using MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) with the default settings. Differentially accessible regions were identified using edgeR v3.18.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) and a generalized linear model. Read counts for all peaks were annotated for each sample from the bam file using the Genomic Ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>) R/Bioconductor package and normalized to reads per million (rpm) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scharer et al., 2016</xref>). Peaks with a greater than 2-fold change and FDRÂ &lt;Â 0.05 between comparisons were termed significant. Genomic and motif annotations were computed for ATAC-seq peaks using the HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) annotatePeaks.pl script. The findMotifsGenome.pl function of HOMER v4.8.2 (42) was used to identify motifs enriched in DAR and the âde novoâ output was used for downstream analysis. To generate motif footprints, the motifs occurring in peaks were annotated with the HOMER v4.8.2 annotatePeaks.pl function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) using the options â-size givenâ. The read depth at the motif and surrounding sequence was computed using the GenomicRanges v1.22.4 (66) package and custom scripts in R/Bioconductor.

Your article has been reviewed by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mauro Gaya (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you might see from the reviews comments there has been some disagreement about the novelty of the work. Nevertheless, after discussion with the reviewers, we have decided to consider a revised version of the manuscript in which a considerable effort needs to be focused in incorporations their comments and most importantly streamline the main message of the manuscript. We have decided to copy all reviewers comments to assist you with this. In your revised manuscript it will be important to discuss the novelty of the work in in the context of S. Wang et al., 2018.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Zumaquero et al., analyse the role of IFNÎ³ singling in human B cells. They found that this cytokine is necessary for the differentiation of naive B cells (BN: IgD+CD27-) into an intermediate developmental stage expressing T-bet (BDN:IgD-CD27-) that has the phenotype of an antibody-secreting cell precursor (pre-ASCs, IRF4+CD38-). They further show that IFNÎ³ increases the differentiation of naive B cells to ASCs by promoting IL21 receptor expression and in this way, their responsiveness to IL-21. They provide compelling mechanistic clues to this phenomenon: IFNÎ³-induced T-bet expression in B cells would be epigenetically modifying IL21R gene and in this way, elevating the levels of IL-21R. Interestingly, authors found that these intermediate T-bet expressing pre-ASCs are phenotypically similar to auto-reactive B cells found in a subset of SLE patients (T-bet+IgD-CD27-) displaying elevated IFNÎ³ levels in their blood.

The investigators set out to define whether its transcription factor, T-bet drives autoantibody formation in human SLE. They first confirm that T-bet promotes the generation of autoimmunity in a mouse model of TLR7-driven SLE and then move on to evaluate its significance in the human scenario. Capitalizing on their previous observation that T-bet is upregulated in CD11c<sup>hi</sup> B cells in SLE patients, now further refined to the CD27/IgD negative (B<sub>DN</sub>) compartment negative for CXCR5, the investigators find that this phenotype is correlated with elevated IFNÎ³ and IFNÎ³-driven inflammatory cytokines, substrates that also promote the generation of CD11c<sup>hi</sup> B cells in mice. The investigators then induced a SLE-BDN-like phenotype through Th1 mediated IFNÎ³ activation of health B cell donor population <italic>in vitro</italic>. This population showed similar transcriptional properties as that from SLE patients, and, relative to stimulation by Th2 cells, provided a progenitor population for rapid ASC development. This differentiation pathway was distilled <italic>in vitro</italic> as a two-step process involving initial priming by BCR crosslinking and IFNÎ³ signaling followed by temporally delayed proliferative cues provided by to IL-21 and TLR ligand. Notably IFNÎ³ and BCR signals induced formation of a T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> pre-ASC population from naÃ¯ve B cells in which (and in contrast to that seen with conventional IL-2 priming) chromatin accessibility of the IL21R locus was altered, leading to upregulation of IL-21R expression. Finally, the investigators isolate this population from SLE patents and demonstrated that it was capably of IL21-dependent differentiation into ASC. Importantly they also note that T-bet<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells were also capable of differentiating in an IL21-independent manner, indicating that in humans the B<sub>DN</sub> population remains phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>This study was extremely well planned and executed. Through exhaustive functional studies on isolated human B cell subsets, the authors distill the signaling input and molecular basis needed for test-tube recapitulation of a pathway underscoring SLE in humans. This paper identifies and elucidates the central role T-bet plays in potential predisposition for this disorder in people and was cross-validated across multiple levels, starting with the mouse model, through pathway recapitulation with naÃ¯ve human B cells in vitro, back through to the SLE phenotype in patents.

Can the authors explain this?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a lengthy and complex collection of experiments aimed at resolving the development, function and disease contribution of Tbet+ B cells in the autoimmune disease, SLE. Given this broad remit, it is not surprising that the experimental systems are varied and complex, ranging from mice, to human ex vivo cultures and to in vivo assessments in patients. It does make the report, however, quite difficult to follow and to determine whether each part actually contributes to the ultimate goal, and if in fact that goal is actually achieved. Equally there is an issue of novelty in that much of the information reported here is already available, requiring a significant degree of coherence in my opinion, to justify acceptance in its current form.</p><p>I think that rather than being such a coherent, linear progression from an hypothesis to a series of experiments to a conclusion, the work instead is a curious mixture of vignettes on a relatively unique in vitro B cell differentiation model, that is finally shoehorned onto the disease. I find that the final inferences â and not wanting to be rude, but I don't think there are many irrefutable conclusions â are very modest in terms of disease insight, even allowing for what's already published.</p><p>For a start, Figure 1A-C should be removed â the results, while being supportive of existing data, have no bearing on the remainder of the study and it is not referenced after the description. The remainder of Figure 1 makes an established connection, that the frequency of Tbet-expressing, CD11c<sup>hi</sup> B cells is increased in SLE patients and corresponds with the presence of IFNÎ³. Many of these data are published in Wang et al., 2017.</p><p>Figure 2 describes what may be the signature culture system of this laboratory â a system that promotes antibody secreting cell formation preferentially in conditions that contain IFNÎ³, compared to those that contain IL4. This is in the presence of IL21 in both and CD40L, factors which many investigators have reported as potent inducers of ASC formation for human B cells in vitro on their own. This is a disconnect for me, in that it suggests that the in vitro system is distinct or unique and I therefore wonder about the applicability of the results outside the culture system. However, it does show induction of Tbet in B cells exposed to IFNÎ³, again confirming existing reports. And it shows that the non-ASC developed in the presence of IFNÎ³ look like a B cell fraction in SLE patients, a disease overwhelmingly associated with IFNÎ³ signalling. I assume this from healthy donor B cells although it is not stated.</p><p>Figure 3 further characterises the in vitro differentiation, again with B cells from what I assume is a healthy donor (unstated). It shows preferential ASC differentiation in the IFNÎ³ conditions, still in the presence of IL21 and IL2, which again others (eg Tangye) have shown to be potent inducers of ASC formation in conditions lacking IFNÎ³, making this hard to reconcile. The data are somewhat difficult to interpret as most panels show what I think is the percent of cells within the division peak that are of the phenotype indicated on the y-axis. Thus, Figure 3F shows 60% of cells in division 7 of Be1 conditions to be ASC, etc., but the percentages of the total population in each division can't be determined. Curiously in this culture, Be1 conditions produce 20% ASC (sum of values in Figure 3C) while Be2 produces 1.4%, despite both being in IL21! This is also in comparison to the 12% ASC in Be2 cultures in Figure 2I. Is this a donor difference? It is also surprising to see Figure 3 no error bars on the measurements, yet the experiment appears to have been done multiple times.</p><p>Figure 4 is apparently to show the similarity of the B cells in culture with IFNÎ³ lacking CD27 and IgD â the B<sub>DN</sub> cells â as having a propensity to differentiate into ASC. This is shown by comparing the gene signature of the Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells to various populations. My problem with this is that there may be several reasons why they correlate, such as proliferation versus no proliferation (e.g. Bn cells used as a comparator). Equally, I find the amount of IRF4 in the fractions difficult to interpret. If there are significant non-proliferating (division 0) B cells in the culture, they will not express much of any IRF4. Proliferating B cells will express more IRF4, as they have to in order to proliferate, and ASC will express the most. I don't find this intermediate amount of IRF4 compelling evidence that these are ASC precursors. Equally the culture is unconvincing. CD38 is not a unique marker of ASC (as shown here by the very low frequency of actual ASC in the culture â 5/100 cells for IgG â despite CD38+ being 41%) and we are not shown the ELISPOT results immediately after sorting to show the purity of the population.</p><p>Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9 I found particularly confusing relative to the narrative of the work. They could be excised without any loss to the 'story' as they represent a detailed examination of this culture system without much attempt to show the relevance of either the factors, the amounts or the order of addition and/or removal to the processes driving B cell differentiation in normal let alone SLE conditions. I simply don't get these figures at all, in addition to be very complex. One curious comment was that the Tbet-hi B<sub>DN</sub> Be1 cells are responding to endogenous TLR ligands. That is pretty curious, and I wonder what evidence there is and what endogenous ligands they think are in action? I also find it very puzzling that the culture returns the result that IFNÎ³ is a potent B cell mitogen or facilitator of B cell proliferation (Figure 8). This is, as far as I am aware, a unique finding.</p><p>Last within this group I take issue with the statement that the experiments in Figure 9 test in any way the hypothesis that &quot;IFNÎ³-induced Tbet might alter the epigenetic profile of the B cells&quot;. The results do not support the subsequent conclusion that by &quot;promoting upregulation of Tbet, which modifies chromatin accessibility of the IL21R locus in the IFNÎ³ stimulated B cells&quot;. No. An association is shown but there is definitely no causation.</p><p>Figure 10 appears to be based on 1 patient and to show that disease activity (as measured by antibody titres) correlates with the appearance of Tbet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells. Again, I am reasonably confident this has been reported, maybe with slightly different criteria, but same message. This figure is intended to tie the study together to show that the Tbet B<sub>DN</sub> cells in SLE patients have the differentiation potential that has been described for B<sub>DN</sub> cells derived in the in vitro cultures. They do, to an extent, but is this sufficient proof to say that the processes used in vitro to produce these cells in vitro are the processes that occurred in vivo to make the phenotypically similar cells? I think not. In part this is due to the what I think is the very poor efficiency of the culture system in which 10^5 B<sub>DN</sub> B cells were put in for stimulation but only 400 IgG ASC came out? (Figure 10K).</p><p>Overall this is a long, complicated and ultimately hard to follow report that I don't think supports the claimed conclusions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;IFNÎ³ induces epigenetic programming of human T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B cells and promotesTLR7/8 and IL-21 induced differentiation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

They found that this cytokine is necessary for the differentiation of naive B cells (BN: IgD+CD27-) into an intermediate developmental stage expressing T-bet (BDN:IgD-CD27-) that has the phenotype of an antibody-secreting cell precursor (pre-ASCs, IRF4+CD38-). They further show that IFNÎ³ increases the differentiation of naive B cells to ASCs by promoting IL21 receptor expression and in this way, their responsiveness to IL-21. They provide compelling mechanistic clues to this phenomenon: IFNÎ³-induced T-bet expression in B cells would be epigenetically modifying IL21R gene and in this way, elevating the levels of IL-21R. Interestingly, authors found that these intermediate T-bet expressing pre-ASCs are phenotypically similar to auto-reactive B cells found in a subset of SLE patients (T-bet+IgD-CD27-) displaying elevated IFNÎ³ levels in their blood. To provide physiological relevance to this phenomenon, authors generated mouse chimeras to show that T-bet expressing B cells are required for disease progression in a mouse model of SLE.

We find circulating influenza-specific (hemagglutinin (HA) binding) switched memory (B<sub>SW</sub>, CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>neg</sup>) and double negative (B<sub>DN</sub> IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>neg</sup>) B cells following influenza vaccination. Many of these vaccine HA-specific B cells express high levels of T-bet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A-B</xref>) and the frequency of these cells increases between days 7-21 post-vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Thus, these cells are not only induced in the setting of pathogenic disease (i.e. SLE) but are also detected during normal immune responses. Interestingly the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> HA-specific B cells, like the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 population found in SLE patients or our in vitro induced T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells, also express CD11c and FcRL5 and have downregulated CXCR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1D</xref>).

Is there anything that might explain this?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, systemic levels of IFNÎ³, CXCL10 and TNFÎ± are heterogenous within our SLE cohort (Figure 1K-L). However, when all the SLE samples are combined for the analysis, we still observe significant differences in systemic cytokine levels between the SLE patients and healthy donors (HD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A-C</xref>). Moreover, the positive correlation between inflammatory cytokine levels and the frequencies of circulating T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B cells is still evident when all SLE patient samples are combined for the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2D-F</xref>). Interestingly, we find that the Caucasian SLE patients in our cohort (shown in green circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>) uniformly express low levels of these inflammatory cytokines and have fewer circulating T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B cells. By contrast, the individuals with the highest frequencies of T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B cells and the highest levels of systemic inflammatory cytokines are African Americans (shown in red circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). This is consistent with data from two recent publications demonstrating that the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> subset (DN2 cells) is more prominent in a subset of African American SLE patients (Jenks et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). While this may be due to genetic and/or environmental differences between these two patient populations, we do know that the frequency of circulating DN2 cells correlates with disease severity (as measured by SLEDAI score, (Jenks et al., 2018)) and that disease severity is increased in a subset of African American women. Therefore, we suspect that those individuals who present with the highest levels of IFNÎ³-driven cytokines and T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B cells are those with more active, less well-controlled severe disease (who are often AA in our cohort of patients). This point is now discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41641.031</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Positive correlation between high systemic levels Of inflammatory cytokines and frequency Of circu- lating T-bethi B cells in SLE patients.</title><p>(<bold>a-c</bold>) Plasma concen- tration of IFN7 (<bold>a</bold>) CXCLIO (<bold>b</bold>) and TNFa (<bold>c</bold>) in 5 healthy donors (blue symbols) and 25 SLE patients (red and green symbols).

Can the authors recapitulate the Be1 phenotype using cytokine manipulation alone? If so, what is the minimal cocktail that can deliver the phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>We show that co-culture of naÃ¯ve B cells with Th1 cells + IL-21 and IL-2 is sufficient to generate ASCs and a population of pre-ASCs (IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>neg</sup> Be1<sub>DN</sub> cells) that are phenotypically, functionally and molecularly similar to the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells that are expanded in a subset of SLE patients (i.e. T-bet<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>int</sup>, CD11c<sup>+</sup>FcRL5<sup>+</sup>). In revised Figure 5D-E, we show that stimulation of naÃ¯ve B cells (from HD and SLE patients) with anti-Ig + TLR 7/8 ligand in the presence of IFNÎ³, IL-2, IL-21 and BAFF is sufficient to induce the formation of effector DN2-like B cells that are CD27<sup>neg</sup>IgD<sup>neg</sup>, T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup>, CD11c<sup>+</sup>FcRL5<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>neg</sup> and have begun downregulating CXCR5. In Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7 of the manuscript, we defined the minimal signaling elements required for the formation of the DN2-like pre-ASCs and subsequent ASCs. In this analysis, we defined the pre-ASC population as IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>neg</sup>T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup>. For brevity, we didnât show all of the data but we did look at how each stimulus influences expression of these markers and others (i.e. CD11c, CXCR5, CD21 and FcRL5) that are used to identify T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells. As we presented in the paper, only IFNÎ³ signaling induced the Tbet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> phenotype (see Figure 6 and Figure 7). However, IFNÎ³ signals are not obligate for CD11c and FcRL5 upregulation or downregulation of CD21 and CXCR5. Instead, and consistent with prior publications (Ettinger et al., 2005; Kuchen et al., 2007), we found that down-regulation of IgD can be induced by other cytokines including IL-21 and IL-2 and IFNÎ³. Moreover, like others have reported (Masilamani et al., 2003; Naradikian et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018), BCR stimulation promoted downregulation of CXCR5 and CD21, while IL-21 facilitated upregulation of CD11c and FcRL5. TLR7/8 and IL-2 signals, while important for cell proliferation/recovery, were dispensable for acquisition of the Tbet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 phenotype. Therefore, our data suggest that a minimal stimulation cocktail consisting of BCR ligand + TLR7/8 + IFNÎ³ + IL-2 + IL-21 can induce recoverable numbers of pre-ASCs that are very similar phenotypically to the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells found in SLE patients. This stimulation cocktail was used for the experiments shown in Figure 8, Figure 9 and Figure 10 of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5I.

Therefore, these two panels are not examining the same stimulation conditions. We found that anti-Ig stimulation between days 3-6 of the cultures (+/+ and -/+ conditions) impaired ASC formation in our in vitro cultures. By contrast, B cells that were either transiently activated with anti-Ig (+/-) or not stimulated with anti-Ig (-/-) did differentiate into ASCs. In the experiment shown in revised Figure 5G (+/+ conditions) we detected no ASCs in the cultures on day 6.

Can the authors explain this?</p></disp-quote><p>The original Figure 9B-C (now revised Figure 9E-F) examined IL21R expression on Day 3 (revised Figure 9E) and Day 6 (revised Figure 9F) while the original Figure 9D (now revised Figure 9G) examined IL-21R expression on day 6 of the cultures. As the reviewer noted, the expression of IL21R increases between days 3 and 6 on the bulk (total) B lineage cells in the cultures (revised Figure 9E vs revised Figure 9F). The reviewer is also correct that IL21R expression does drop on a subset of the B lineage cells in the cultures on day 6 (most easily seen in revised Figure 9G but also evident in revised Figure 9F). The B cells expressing the lowest levels of IL21R on day 6 are the B cells that have undergone the most rounds of division (as measure by CTV dilution, see revised Figure 9G). These extensively divided B cells that express lower levels of IL21R are the CD27<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> ASCs that are found in the day 6 cultures. This is evident when the day 6 cells are subdivided into ASCs and non-ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Therefore, our data show that IFNÎ³ induces upregulation of IL21R in the Be.IFNÎ³ and Be.g2 cells and suggest that as these cells differentiate into ASCs, IL21R expression levels begin to decline.</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41641.032</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>IL21R expression levels decline as B cells differentiate into ASCs.</title><p>BN cells were activated for 3 days with anti-lg, R848, IFNY and IL-2, then washed and cultured for an additional 3 days with IL-21 and R848 (Be.Y2 cells).

Given this broad remit, it is not surprising that the experimental systems are varied and complex, ranging from mice, to human ex vivo cultures and to in vivo assessments in patients. It does make the report, however, quite difficult to follow and to determine whether each part actually contributes to the ultimate goal, and if in fact that goal is actually achieved. Equally there is an issue of novelty in that much of the information reported here is already available, requiring a significant degree of coherence in my opinion, to justify acceptance in its current form.</p><p>I think that rather than being such a coherent, linear progression from an hypothesis to a series of experiments to a conclusion, the work instead is a curious mixture of vignettes on a relatively unique in vitro B cell differentiation model, that is finally shoehorned onto the disease. I find that the final inferences â and not wanting to be rude, but I don't think there are many irrefutable conclusions â are very modest in terms of disease insight, even allowing for what's already published.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the manuscript is densely packed with data from multiple types of in vitro and in vivo model systems and that it could potentially be condensed. However, we believe that our data do as reviewer 2 summarized âdistill the signaling input and molecular basis needed for test-tube recapitulation of a pathway underscoring SLE in humans. This paper identifies and elucidates the central role T-bet plays in potential predisposition for this disorder in people and was cross-validated across multiple levels, starting with the mouse model, through pathway recapitulation with naÃ¯ve human B cells in vitro, back through to the SLE phenotype in patients.â Moreover, we think that our in vitro model system provides a platform for testing the potential origins of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> pre-ASC B cell subset (DN2 cells) â a subset that is of great interest in a variety of disease settings. In addition, we think that our in vitro model system may also be very useful for directly testing which pathways are amenable to targeting the development of this subset of pathogenic B cells in humans. Finally, we think that the data presented here are novel in that the data describe the stimulation conditions that are needed (albeit in vitro) to induce the formation of human T-bet<sup>hi</sup> pre-ASCs and demonstrate that these pre-ASCs can differentiate into ASCs when appropriately stimulated. Most importantly, our original data plus new data provided in revised Figure 9 and Figure 10, are the first to show that IFNÎ³ signals specifically synergize with TLR7/8 and IL-2 to drive the epigenetic remodeling of the BCR activated B cells and increase chromatin accessibility within the IL21R and PRDM1 loci as well increasing accessibility around BLIMP1 and IRF4 binding sites within the genome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For a start, Figure 1A-C should be removed â the results, while being supportive of existing data, have no bearing on the remainder of the study and it is not referenced after the description.</p></disp-quote><p>The existing data examining T-bet expressing B cells in SLE mouse models includes three publications that arrive at diametrically opposing conclusions. Two papers conclude that T-bet expressing B cells play no role in autoantibody-mediated disease (Du et al., 2019; Jackson et al., 2016) while one study indicates that Tbet expressing B cells are necessary for the development of autoantibodies in their model of SLE (Rubtsova et al., 2017). Using a completely distinct model of SLE (Yaa.Fcgr2b<sup>-/-</sup>) that is driven by gene duplication and over-expression of the TLR7 gene, we demonstrate a clear role for T-bet expressing B cells driving the formation of autoantibodies, kidney damage and mortality. We believe that these data do have bearing on the rest of the manuscript as our data show that IFNÎ³, which is obligate for expression of T-bet in human B cells activated with TLR ligands, antigen and IL-21, synergizes with TLR7/8 and IL21 to promote expansion and differentiation of human B cells. In the revised manuscript we summarize the mouse data in one sentence, move the data to Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 and refer back to the mouse data in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The remainder of Figure 1 makes an established connection, that the frequency of Tbet-expressing, CD11c<sup>hi</sup> B cells is increased in SLE patients and corresponds with the presence of IFNÎ³. Many of these data are published in Wang et al., 2017.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that there are similarities between the data in the original Figure 1 and the data published by Wang et al., 2018et al.. However, the experiments published by Wang and Jenks used surface markers (like CD11c, FcRL5, CD21 or CXCR5) to subdivide the B cells in SLE patients while we subdivide the B cells using the transcription factor T-bet. While this may seem like a largely semantic point, our paper is focused on how IFNÎ³ drives ASC development and T-bet, unlike any of the other markers analyzed in the other papers, is induced in an IFNÎ³-dependent manner in human B cells and serves as a biomarker for B cells that have undergone IFNÎ³-dependent programming. More importantly, Figure 1 also includes novel data that is not found in the Wang paper (or published elsewhere) showing a direct and significant correlation between the levels of systemic inflammatory IFNÎ³ and IFNÎ³-induced cytokines and the frequency of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells (revised Figure 1K-L). We think that the data in Figure 1 provide context and justification for rest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 describes what may be the signature culture system of this laboratory â a system that promotes antibody secreting cell formation preferentially in conditions that contain IFNÎ³, compared to those that contain IL4. This is in the presence of IL21 in both and CD40L, factors which many investigators have reported as potent inducers of ASC formation for human B cells in vitro on their own. This is a disconnect for me, in that it suggests that the in vitro system is distinct or unique and I therefore wonder about the applicability of the results outside the culture system.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the reviewer is correct that in vitro systems to measure human B cell differentiation have been developed and that antigen and signals provided by T cells, including IL-21 and CD40L, can promote ASC formation, most of those experiments were performed with either total CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells (which includes many memory B cells) or purified memory B cells. Remarkably few studies have examined culture conditions that promote naÃ¯ve B cells to differentiate into ASCs and in general, few ASCs are detected in these cultures (on the order of 5%, see for e.g. (Berglund et al., 2013; Deenick et al., 2013; Ettinger et al., 2005)). Our novel finding in this paper is that IFNÎ³ greatly augments the differentiation of naÃ¯ve human B cells. In as few as 4-5 days (cultures with Th1 cells + IL-21) or 5-6 days (defined activation cocktail that includes only IFNÎ³, IL21, Anti-Ig and R848), we can recover large numbers of ASCs that are simply not found at these timepoints if IFNÎ³ is not included in the cultures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, it does show induction of Tbet in B cells exposed to IFNÎ³, again confirming existing reports.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it is well known that IFNÎ³ can induce expression of T-bet in mouse and human B cells. However, it is also reported that IL-21 and TLR ligands are potent inducers of T-bet in B cells (Naradikian et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018). We show in this manuscript that neither IL-21 nor the TLR ligand R848 is sufficient to induce the formation of the T-bet expressing pre-ASC subset described here and that Tbet upregulation and the development of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> population (DN2-like cells) requires IFNÎ³.

Indeed, Tangyeâs paper (Berglund et al., 2013) shows that the frequency of ASCs in cultures containing naÃ¯ve B cells activated with CD40L, IL21, and IL2 is 4.6%. Similarly, in 5 independent experiments (rev. Figure 3F-I and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D-F) we enumerated an average of 3.9% ASCs (range 0.2-10%) in the Be2 cultures. What is novel in our paper is that we enumerated an average of 24.1% ASCs (range 6.7-57%) in the Be1 cultures. More importantly, in 15 paired Be1 and Be2 co-cultures, we observed more ASCs in the Be1 cultures relative to the Be2 cultures (revised Figure 3B). Therefore, our contribution to the field is that we show that IFNÎ³-producing T cells greatly augment ASC development from naÃ¯ve human B cells. We make this point more clearly in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data are somewhat difficult to interpret as most panels show what I think is the percent of cells within the division peak that are of the phenotype indicated on the y-axis.

This is despite the fact that the proliferative response of the B cells in the two cultures is basically identical (original Figure 2F). In the revised manuscript, we provide data from 5 experiments using independent paired Be1 and Be2 co-cultures (revised Figure 3E-J, revised Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A-I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Each of the 5 experiments show that the frequency of ASCs (whether defined by CD19<sup>lo</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>CD27<sup>hi</sup>, CD19<sup>lo</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>hi</sup>, or CD19<sup>lo</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>) is increased in the day 5-6 Be1 cultures compared to the day 5-6 Be2 cultures. The data show that cell division within each paired co-culture is very similar, suggesting that the increased ASC formation in the Be1 cultures is not due to increased proliferation. Finally, when we examine the cells that divided 6+ times in both co-cultures, we always find that a higher proportion of those cells are ASCs in the Be1 cultures compared to Be2 cultures. Collectively, these results indicate that ASC formation is augmented in the Be1 co-cultures.</p><fig id="respfig4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41641.033</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>ASC formation is augmented and accelerated in Bel co-cultures.</title><p>(<bold>a-o</bold>) Proliferation and ASC formation were measured in 5 independent (Examples 1-5) day 5-6 paired Bel and 3e2 Go-cultures that contained purified CTV-IabeIed BN cells and allogenic Thl or Th2 cells plus IL-2 and IL-21 , proliferation analysis (<bold>a, d, g, j, m</bold>) Of B lineage cells in the day 5-6 co-cultures showing the frequency Of CD19â¢n0 cells in each cell division.

Moreover, the increase in ASCs in the Be1 cocultures is not due to changes in the proliferative potential of the B cells as the proliferative rate of the cells in the paired co-cultures is identical. Again, our data does not demonstrate that ASCs formation is absolutely reliant on IFNÎ³ but we show that ASC formation is significantly more robust when IFNÎ³ is included. We now make this point more clearly in the results and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is also in comparison to the 12% ASC in Be2 cultures in Figure 2i.

However, in each paired co-culture the proliferative rates of the Be1 and Be2 cells are directly comparable. Despite this, we always find more ASCs in the Be1 cultures compared to the Be2 cultures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also surprising to see Figure 3 no error bars on the measurements, yet the experiment appears to have been done multiple times.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not include error bars on the CTV measurements because there is donor to donor variation in the allo-reactive cultures that do affect the rate of proliferation within the co-cultures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A</xref> (Example 1) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4D</xref> (Example 2)). This donor to donor variation in our co-cultures makes it impossible to combine data sets. To demonstrate to the reviewer that the data presented in the manuscript are representative of multiple experiments we provide 5 independent paired co-culture experiments (see revised Figure 3 and new Figure 3âfigure supplement 1). In each of the 5 examples, the proliferative responses of the B cells in the Be1 and Be2 co-cultures are very similar. However, the frequency of ASCs is always higher in the Be1 co-cultures, regardless whether we define the ASCs as CD38<sup>hi</sup>CD19<sup>lo</sup> or as CD19<sup>lo</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>hi</sup> or CD19<sup>lo</sup>CD27<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Thus, we can confidently conclude that ASC formation is always augmented when B cells are activated in the presence of Th1 cells and that this increase is not due to an inability of the Be2 cells to divide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 is apparently to show the similarity of the B cells in culture with IFNÎ³ lacking CD27 and IgD â the B<sub>DN</sub> cells â as having a propensity to differentiate into ASC. This is shown by comparing the gene signature of the Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells to various populations. My problem with this is that there may be several reasons why they correlate, such as proliferation versus no proliferation (eg Bn cells used as a comparator).</p></disp-quote><p>In each GSEA we begin with collated lists of genes that are reported by others to be significantly upregulated in ASCs when the ASCs are compared to naÃ¯ve B cells (revised Figure 4G), or to switched memory B cells (revised Figure 4I) or total B cells (revised Figure 4H). We then use GSEA to determine whether expression of these âASC upregulated genesâ are more highly expressed in either the Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells or Be2 B<sub>DN</sub> cells. In all 3 analyses, we find that the ASC signature genes are significantly enriched in the Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells compared to the Be2 B<sub>DN</sub> cells. We do not think that the enriched ASC gene signature in the Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells is due to changes in the proliferative potential of Be1 and Be2 cells as these cells divide equivalently (see for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Instead, we believe that the GSEA data suggests that more genes that are associated with the ASC program are upregulated in the Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells compared to the Be2 B<sub>DN</sub> cells. This is entirely consistent with our data showing that ASC formation is augmented in the Be1 co-cultures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Equally, I find the amount of IRF4 in the fractions difficult to interpret. If there are significant non-proliferating (division 0) B cells in the culture, they will not express much of any IRF4. Proliferating B cells will express more IRF4, as they have to in order to proliferate, and ASC will express the most. I don't find this intermediate amount of IRF4 compelling evidence that these are ASC precursors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that IRF4 expression levels can reflect B cell activation, proliferation and differentiation. NaÃ¯ve B cells that havenât proliferated express very little IRF4, while B cells that have proliferated multiple times and differentiated into ASCs do express the highest levels of IRF4. To confirm this point, we added a new experiment (revised Figure 4M) where we examined cell division within the T-bet and IRF4 expressing cells present in the Be1 co-cultures. IRF4<sup>neg</sup>T-bet<sup>neg</sup> cells (popA in Figure 4M) are undivided. These cells (which are IgD<sup>+</sup>) include the remaining naÃ¯ve B cells. We can also identify a population of cells that express high levels of IRF4 and low levels of T-bet (popD in Figure 4M). These cells (which are CD38<sup>hi</sup>CD27<sup>hi</sup> ASCs) have fully diluted the CTV indicating that the cells divided 6+ times. Finally, we defined 2 populations of cells that upregulate T-bet and express low to intermediate levels of IRF4 T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>lo/int</sup> (popB in Figure 4M) and T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int/hi</sup> (popC in Figure 4M). These cells have divided multiple times, with the T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>lo/int</sup> (popB) cells having proliferated less times on average than the Tbet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int/hi</sup> (popC). Thus, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the cells in the culture that have differentiated into ASCs must pass through an intermediate stage where they first upregulate T-bet and then gradually upregulate IRF4. Consistent with this conclusion, GSEA revealed that genes that are directly induced by IRF4 in ASCs (relative to total B cells) are enriched in the T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells (revised Figure 4J). Therefore, we conclude from these data that the T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> population of B<sub>DN</sub> cells found in the Be1 co-cultures are an intermediate population that are not ASCs but exhibit transcriptional programming consistent with a pre-ASC population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Equally the culture is unconvincing. CD38 is not a unique marker of ASC (as shown here by the very low frequency of actual ASC in the culture â 5/100 cells for IgG â despite CD38+ being 41%) and we are not shown the ELISPOT results immediately after sorting to show the purity of the population.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this concern with new data in revised Figure 4N-O. Briefly, we sorted the IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>neg</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells from donor paired Be1 and Be2 co-cultures, labeled the cells with CTV and then put them in culture for 18 hours. Approximately 47% of the IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>neg</sup> sorted Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells and 65% of the sorted IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>neg</sup> Be2 B<sub>DN</sub> cells divided at least 1x within 18 hours (Figure 4A). No CD27<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> ASCs were detected in the undivided B<sub>DN</sub> subset, regardless of whether these cells were sorted from the Be1 or Be2 co-cultures (Figure 4A). Interestingly, approximately half (47.2%) of the actively proliferating Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells differentiated into CD27<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> ASCs within 24 hours (Figure 4A). By contrast, only 12.7% of the actively proliferating sorted Be2 B<sub>DN</sub> cells differentiated into ASCs during that same timeframe. These data therefore indicate that approximately 1 in every 5 sorted Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells differentiated into ASCs in 18 hours while only 1 in every 12 sorted Be2 B<sub>DN</sub> cells differentiated into ASCs in the same timeperiod. In three independent experiments (Figure 4B), we observed an average 3.5 fold increase in ASC precursors in the sorted Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells compared to Be2 B<sub>DN</sub> cells. Thus, sorted B<sub>DN</sub> cells from both Be1 and Be2 cultures are activated and dividing and a proportion of these cells can differentiate into ASCs within 1 cell division in less than 1 day. However, B<sub>DN</sub> cells from the Be1 cultures generate ~3-4x more ASCs that the B<sub>DN</sub> cells from the Be2 cultures in the same timeframe. Collectively, these data support the conclusion that the B<sub>DN</sub> cells isolated from both Be1 and Be2 co-cultures are not ASCs but that this population includes pre-ASCs that can differentiate <italic>rapidly</italic> into ASCs after dividing one additional time. In addition, the data support the conclusion that the Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> pre-ASC population supports significantly augmented and/or accelerated ASC formation relative to the Be2 B<sub>DN</sub> pre-ASC population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9 I found particularly confusing relative to the narrative of the work. They could be excised without any loss to the 'story' as they represent a detailed examination of this culture system without much attempt to show the relevance of either the factors, the amounts or the order of addition and/or removal to the processes driving B cell differentiation in normal let alone SLE conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of these figures is to identify the minimal signals that give rise to the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells that we identified as pre-ASCs in our Be1/Th1 co-cultures. We used our RNA-seq data to identify the signaling pathways that are activated in the pre-ASCs and then replaced the T cells in the cultures with defined stimuli to see if we could recapitulate the development of the pre-ASC population. The data are complicated but we define a set of minimal signals (transient BCR ligation, IFNÎ³, TLR7/8, IL-2 and IL-21) that induce the development of the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2-like population in vitro. We show that B cells activated with antigen (BCR ligation) and TLR7/8 ligands in the presence of IFNÎ³ form a T-bet<sup>hi</sup> pre-ASC population that is phenotypically and molecularly similar to the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells that are found in a subset of SLE patients and to the Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells that we generated by co-culturing naÃ¯ve B cells with Th1 cells + IL21 + IL-2. In new data (revised Figure 8 and Figure 9), we show that IFNÎ³ augments ASC development by synergizing with TLR and IL-2 signals by poising the cells to become responsive to IL-21. We also provide new data (revised Figure 10) to show that IFNÎ³, particularly when combined with IL-2, globally impacts chromatin accessibility in the day 3 T-bet<sup>hi</sup>IRF4<sup>int</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> population that has not yet been exposed to IL-21. In addition, we observed significant increased chromatin accessibility surrounding BLIMP1 and IRF4 binding motifs in the B cells activate in the presence of IFNÎ³ + IL-2, suggesting ongoing chromatin remodeling around regulatory regions that are targeted by two transcription factors that are required for ASC development. Finally, in the revised manuscript, we identify IFNÎ³-dependent epigenetic changes in two genes (IL21R and PRDM1 (Blimp1)) that are known to be required for ASC differentiation. These changes in chromatin accessibility occur independently of IL-21 signaling in the IFNÎ³ + IL-2 stimulated cells and are accompanied by increased IL-21R expression, enhanced IL21R-dependent signaling and B cell differentiation. Interestingly, these IFNÎ³-dependent differentially accessible chromatin regions (DARs) are also present in the IL21R and PRDM1 loci in SLE DN2 cells, suggesting that these DARs may be regulated by IFNÎ³ in these SLE patient B cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I simply don't get these figures at all, in addition to be very complex. One curious comment was that the Tbet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> Be1 cells are responding to endogenous TLR ligands. That is pretty curious, and I wonder what evidence there is and what endogenous ligands they think are in action?</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, the IPA analysis shown in the original Figure 5A predict that the TLR7 and TLR9 signaling pathways are activated in Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells relative to Be2 B<sub>DN</sub> cells. This means that known downstream targets of the TLR7/8/9 signaling pathways are, in general, more highly expressed in Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells. The interesting question, as noted by the reviewer, is why the TLR pathway(s) are activated in the Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells when we did not add exogenous TLR ligands to the co-cultures. The most likely answer is that, like other have reported (Sindhava et al., 2017), endogenous TLR ligands are released by dying cells in the cultures. However, while this may explain where the TLR ligands are coming from, it does not explain why TLR signaling pathways are activated in the B cells from the Be1 cultures compared to the Be2 cultures, particularly since the frequency of dying cells is not different in the Be1 and Be2 co-cultures (data not shown). Therefore, we hypothesized that Be1 B<sub>DN</sub> cells must be more responsive to the endogenous TLR7/8/9 ligands that are present in both cultures. In support of this conclusion, we provide new data in the paper (revised Figure 9A-C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>) showing that B cells activated (with TLR7/8 ligand + anti-Ig + IL-21 + IL-2) in the presence of IFNÎ³ respond to a 100-fold lower dose of TLR7/8 ligands than B cells stimulated with the same activation cocktail minus IFNÎ³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A-B</xref>). In fact, the IFNÎ³-stimulated B cells stimulated with low dose TLR ligand proliferated vigorously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A</xref>) and efficiently differentiated into ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4B</xref>) when activated with low dose R848, while B cells in the cultures that did not include IFNÎ³ remained undivided and did not differentiate into ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A-B</xref>). Furthermore, cross-titration experiments with IFNÎ³ and R848 demonstrated clear synergy between these two signaling pathways and revealed that B cells activated in the presence of IFNÎ³ can respond to normally non-stimulatory concentrations of R848 (0.01 Âµg) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4C</xref>). We believe that these data explain why B cells activated under Be1like conditions (IFNÎ³ stimulated) exhibit a TLR activation signature as these cells are exquisitely sensitive to the low levels of endogenous TLR ligands that are likely to be present in our in vitro cultures. More importantly, the data suggest that B cells that are activated in the presence of IFNÎ³ are âprimedâ to respond to even very low levels of TLR ligands. We believe that this finding explains why the IFNÎ³ experienced T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells from SLE patients exhibit increased responsiveness to TLR ligands (Jenks et al., 2018) and why T-bet expressing B cells contribute to disease pathogenesis in the Lupus-prone animals with a TLR7 gene duplication (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). We make these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also find it very puzzling that the culture returns the result that IFNÎ³ is a potent B cell mitogen or facilitator of B cell proliferation (Figure 8). This is, as far as I am aware, a unique finding.</p></disp-quote><p>There is no data that we are aware of in the literature to support the conclusion that IFNÎ³ is a potent B cell mitogen. Instead, our data support the conclusion that IFNÎ³ facilitates B cell proliferation by enhancing the B cell response to TLR7/8 ligands, which are known to induce proliferation. Indeed, IFNÎ³-mediated enhancement of B cell proliferation is largely lost when TLR ligands are not included in the cultures (see rev. Figure 9A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A</xref> â compare proliferation profile of cells stimulated Â± IFNÎ³ in the presence of no R848 vs 0.1 Âµg/ml R848). This point is made more clearly in the revised discussion of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Last within this group I take issue with the statement that the experiments in Figure 9 test in any way the hypothesis that &quot;IFNÎ³-induced Tbet might alter the epigenetic profile of the B cells&quot;. The results do not support the subsequent conclusion that by &quot;promoting upregulation of Tbet, which modifies chromatin accessibility of the IL21R locus in the IFNÎ³ stimulated B cells&quot;. No. An association is shown but there is definitely no causation.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, association does not equal causation and we modified the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 10 appears to be based on 1 patient and to show that disease activity (as measured by antibody titres) correlates with the appearance of Tbet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells. Again, I am reasonably confident this has been reported, maybe with slightly different criteria, but same message.</p></disp-quote><p>The original Figure 10A (now revised Figure 1J) examined the correlation between the frequency of circulating T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> cells (DN2 cells) and the titers of anti-Smith Ab. The number of donors in this analysis is 18 (not 1). Similar data was recently published by Jenks et al. (Jenks et al., 2018) from a separate cohort of SLE patients.</p><p>The other panels in the original Figure 10, which include functional and phenotypic analyses, were performed with B cells from n = 2-3 SLE patients. These data are now found in revised Figure 1H-I (n=3 independent patient samples), revised Figure 5E and G (n=3 independent patient samples) and revised Figure 5P-Q (n=2 independent patient samples).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This figure is intended to tie the study together to show that the Tbet B<sub>DN</sub> cells in SLE patients have the differentiation potential that has been described for B<sub>DN</sub> cells derived in the in vitro cultures. They do, to an extent, but is this sufficient proof to say that the processes used in vitro to produce these cells in vitro are the processes that occurred in vivo to make the phenotypically similar cells? I think not.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that we cannot conclusively prove that the stimuli defined in our culture system fully recapitulate the complex microenvironment and signals that the SLE B cells are exposed to in vivo, we do think that we have identified at least one important and underappreciated signal (IFNÎ³) which clearly augments ASC formation by increasing the responsiveness of B cells to TLR ligand and IL-2 and preparing the cells to respond to IL-21. Moreover, we show that the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>DN</sub> pre-ASC population that we can induce in vitro with either Th1 cells + IL-21 + IL-2 or with defined stimuli (IFNÎ³, TLR7/8 ligand, BCR ligand, IL-2 and IL-21) exhibit molecular, epigenetic, phenotypic and functional properties of preASCs as well as the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 population that is expanded in a subset of SLE patients, particularly those patients who present with an elevated systemic IFNÎ³-driven cytokine signature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In part this is due to the what I think is the very poor efficiency of the culture system in which 10^5 B<sub>DN</sub> B cells were put in for stimulation but only 400 IgG ASC came out? (Figure 10K).</p></disp-quote><p>We removed these data from the revised manuscript. It is true that we only detected ~400 ASCs in the original Figure 10K from an input of sorted 100,000 T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells. However, we do not think that this is due to the poor efficiency of the culture system but rather to the fact that we sorted the pre-ASC DN2 cells and let the cultures go for 6 days. What we know is that DN2-like cells are poised to rapidly differentiate into shortlived ASCs once exposed to IL-21 and do not require multiple rounds of cell division. By contrast, memory B cells can proliferate and then differentiate. So, by day 6, we believe that the response of the DN2 cells is well past the peak and most of the short-lived ASCs have already died. By contrast, the memory B cell cultures can continue to divide and to generate ASCs for many days. This is why in the revised manuscript we now specifically look at a much earlier timepoint (2.5 days of stimulation, see revised Figure 10N). When we examine this timepoint, we can see that the frequency of ASCs in the cultures containing Tbet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells is only 2-3 fold lower than the cultures started with memory B cells and orders of magnitude higher than that seen in cultures started with the T-bet<sup>lo</sup> naÃ¯ve B cells. Thus, we argue that in a 2.5 day window T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cells differentiate nearly as efficiently as the memory B cells and much better than naÃ¯ve B cells. Moreover, while the frequency of ASCs in both the memory B cell cultures and the T-bet<sup>hi</sup> DN2 cultures appears low when compared to publications examining in vitro differentiation of memory B cells, it is important to remember that we looked much earlier than has been done in the prior publications (that are typically enumerated between day 5-7 or even out to day 10). If we extend our cultures started with memory B cells, which continue to divide, out to 4 days, well over half the cells in the cultures are ASCs. Thus, we believe that our culture system can efficiently generate ASCs from naÃ¯ve B cells, from memory B cells and from DN2 cells. However, ASCs derived from the DN2 cells, which differentiate without only limited additional cell division, need to be measured early while ASCs that are derived from naÃ¯ve or memory B cell precursors are best measured late, after the cells have been activated to proliferate and then differentiate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall this is a long, complicated and ultimately hard to follow report that I don't think supports the claimed conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for your resubmission and the efforts to address the reviewers comments. Reviewers were satisfied on how you have addressed their comments, but at the same time they are concerned about the presentation of the manuscript. As you will see from their comments, there is a sense of a large amount of data but a lack of clarity in the overall message. At this point, we do not require from you new data to be added to the manuscript, but we would like to ask you to make an effort to streamline the text to make it clear and easy to follow, with main novel data in the main figures and the supporting material in supplementary. We are attaching reviewers comments of reviewer 3 so you can address the issues.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Authors addressed all my concerns. They generated a new figure showing that t-bet+ B cells appear following flu vaccination and they are phenotypically similar to the DN2 B cells found in SLE patients and B<sub>DN</sub> cells generated in their ex vivo culture system. They should consider adding this figure as supplementary for the paper and shortening the main text. I support its publication in eLife.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have made a strong and commendable effort to address the concerns I articulated in the first review. This version of the manuscript is a marked improvement, and for the reasons articulated in the first review feel this paper can now be published.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I note with some regret that virtually nothing I suggested has been acted on other than the very obvious corrections and improved scientific practice. I still find the paper overly long, overly complex, somewhat repetitive of existing information â including from papers published by this group â and also somewhat self-serving. By this last term I mean that having made (again) the observation that there are expanded Tbet+, activated B cells in SLE patients, it is now claimed in the discussion that the expansion of these cells in SLE is predicted by their discovery (Discussion section).</p><p>The manuscript remains very long (10 figures with 135 panels; 2 supplementary figures and 6 supplementary files; 85 references; 5 pages of discussion etc.), very complex and somewhat impenetrable. I note also that the other referees do not share any/many of my concerns, so I accept that these futile requests for clarity and brevity are probably more about me than anything else.</p></disp-quote><p>There was a sense of a large amount of data but a lack of clarity in the overall message. We were therefore asked to make an effort to streamline the text to make it clear and easy to follow, with main novel data in the main figures and the supporting material as supplementary materials.</p><p>To that end, we have made the following changes in revision 3.</p><p>1) Reduced the number of main figures from 10 to 8. We moved some data (particularly representative flow cytometry plots and gating strategies) to supplement files. We also removed some of the less critical panels/data all together.</p><p>2) The Results section is now reduced by 22%.</p><p>3) The Discussion section is decreased by 32%.</p><p>4) The references have been reduced from 85 references to 67.</p><p>5) The figure legends have been reduced by 26%.</p><p>6) We moved supporting data to supplemental and now have 13 Supplementary files to support the main 8 figures. Many of these Supplementary files are single panels. We have 5 Supplementary Tables (Excel files with RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, GSEA gene lists, P values for HOMER motif analyses, and Statistic tables).</p><p>In total, we have reduced and consolidated the main sections of the paper by 20%. I believe that the manuscript is now easier to digest and flows more logically.</p></body></sub-article></article>
