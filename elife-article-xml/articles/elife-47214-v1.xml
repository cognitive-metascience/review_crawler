In mice, there are two successive waves of XCI: imprinted and random. Imprinted XCI starts early in development by specifically inactivating the paternal X chromosome (Xp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kay et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Okamoto et al., 2004</xref>). While the Xp remains silenced in extra-embryonic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Takagi and Sasaki, 1975</xref>), it is reactivated in the embryo during implantation, followed by random XCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mak et al., 2004</xref>). After this decision has been made, the inactive X (Xi) chromosome is epigenetically maintained throughout cell division as a compact chromatin structure known as the âBarr bodyâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr and Bertram, 1949</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies using chromosome conformation capture (3C) based methods have identified that the Xi folds into two megadomains and forms a network of long-range interactions termed superloops that are directed by the non-coding loci <italic>Firre</italic> and <italic>Dxz4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horakova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Dxz4</italic> in cell lines leads to the loss of both megadomain and superloop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giorgetti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonora et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Froberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darrow et al., 2016</xref>), while deletion of <italic>Firre</italic> alone disrupts the superloop but has no impact on megadomain formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Froberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barutcu et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>Firre</italic> locus is transcribed into the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) <italic>Firre</italic> that escapes XCI and plays a role in nuclear organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hacisuleyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andergassen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berletch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies in human and mouse cell line models of random XCI, found that deletion of these elements have minimal impact on X chromosome biology beyond the loss of these structures, though the phenotypic consequences of their deletion throughout mammalian development have not been addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giorgetti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonora et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Froberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darrow et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barutcu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we answer this question by generating mice lacking <italic>Firre</italic> and <italic>Dxz4</italic> and performing an extensive transcriptomic analysis in embryonic, extraembryonic and adult organs. We determined that these elements are dispensable for mouse development and XCI biology. However, the absence of these loci results in organ-specific expression changes on autosomes, suggesting that these regions are involved in autosomal gene regulation rather than XCI biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the in vivo role of <italic>Firre</italic> and <italic>Dxz4</italic> loci both individually and in combination, we generated three knockout (KO) mouse strains: two carrying a single locus deletion (SKO) of either <italic>Firre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lewandowski et al., 2019</xref>) or <italic>Dxz4</italic> and one carrying a double locus deletion (DKO) of <italic>Firre</italic> in conjunction with <italic>Dxz4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, Materials and methods).

To test whether the absence of the <italic>Firre</italic> and <italic>Dxz4</italic> loci has an impact on random or imprinted (Xp chromosome inactive) XCI in vivo, we collected embryonic day 12.5 female F1 brains (random/skewed XCI), placentas and visceral yolk sac (imprinted XCI) from reciprocal crosses between our KO strains and <italic>Mus musculus castaneus</italic> (CAST), followed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and allele-specific analysis using the Allelome.PRO pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andergassen et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We collected the same organs from males to test the role of these loci on the X chromosome outside of XCI biology. Unsupervised clustering of the sequenced samples confirmed the identity of the tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We then investigated the <italic>Firre</italic> expression level in <italic>Firre</italic> SKO and DKO female brains, and detected approximately half of the wildtype levels as expected for random XCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Next, we inspected the <italic>Firre</italic> expression level in the placenta and visceral yolk sac (extra-embryonic organs that undergo imprinted XCI) to distinguish the phenotypic consequences of deletions if they are on the Xa (maternal inheritance of the deletion) versus the Xi (paternal inheritance of the deletion) chromosome. We did not detect <italic>Firre</italic> expression if the deletion was inherited maternally, while we detected <italic>Firre</italic> wildtype expression levels in the paternal deletion, demonstrating that <italic>Firre</italic> is exclusively expressed from the Xa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, in contrast to previous reports that identified <italic>Firre</italic> as a gene that escapes XCI in cell lines that model random XCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hacisuleyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andergassen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berletch et al., 2015</xref>), we found that <italic>Firre</italic> does not escape imprinted XCI. Remarkably, in the <italic>Dxz4</italic> SKO we detected a <italic>Firre</italic> wildtype pattern, suggesting that disruption of the superloop between the two loci or the absence of megadomains has no impact on <italic>Firre</italic> gene expression in either random or imprinted X inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We hypothesized that dysregulated gene sets that are: (1) shared across the three strains are superloop specific (2) shared between <italic>Dxz4</italic> SKO and DKO are megadomain-dependent and (3) shared between <italic>Firre</italic> SKO and the DKO are <italic>Firre</italic> locus specific. To identify gene sets for these categories, we selected the genes dysregulated in at least one of the three KO strains where the direction of the expression change in either one of the single KO agrees with that of the DKO (|log2FC|Â â¥Â 1). We first used this approach for the liver, an organ with a low number of differentially expressed genes in the DKO, and identified 15 megadomain, four superloop, and 4 <italic>Firre</italic> locus dependent genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> sheet G).

In addition, fold changes in <italic>Firre</italic> SKO and DKO are strongly correlated (spearman rhoÂ =Â 0.87, p-value&lt;2.2*10<sup>â16</sup>), indicating that the <italic>Firre</italic> locus is the main driver for downregulation of these gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). To test whether this molecular phenotype can be uncoupled form X inactivation, we performed the same analysis in DKO male spleens. We found a similar pattern of downregulation as observed in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Here we addressed the in vivo role of these elements by generating mice carrying a single or double deletion of these loci. In agreement with previous in vitro studies, we find that the loss of these loci in vivo does not affect random XCI. The lack of dysregulated X-linked genes in adult organs suggests that these mega-structures may also not be important for long-term maintenance of the Xi chromosome. Moreover, by studying the placenta and the visceral yolk sac we were able to show for the first time that loss of these loci also does not affect imprinted XCI.</p><p>Remarkably, deletion of these loci results in reproducible organ-specific expression changes on autosomes suggesting that structural changes of the Barr body may lead to autosomal gene dysregulation. Indeed, crosstalk between autosomes and the X chromosome has been proposed as a mechanism for X inactivation counting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rastan, 1983</xref>). Whether these changes are directly regulated by the Barr body structure remains to be investigated. The largest transcriptional effect on autosomes is <italic>Firre</italic> locus-dependent and X inactivation-independent, suggesting a role for the <italic>Firre</italic> RNA or DNA locus in autosomal gene regulation. The major function of these dysregulated genes appears to be in ontologies associated with chromosome structure and segregation, which is in line with the known role for <italic>Firre</italic> lncRNA in nuclear organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hacisuleyman et al., 2014</xref>). This relationship points to an RNA dependent role, which may be either direct or indirect, on autosomal gene regulation.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;in vivo Firre and Dxz4 deletion elucidates roles for autosomal gene regulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jeannie T Lee as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Eisen as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study generates single or double deletions of Firre and Dxz4 in mice, and show that despite the repeats being conserved in mammals, these mutants are viable, fertile and show no defect in random or imprinted XCI. Instead, the lack of Firre and Dxz4 results in dysregulated genes on autosomes in an organ-specific manner. Although the authors present mostly negative data, the manuscript would be of interest to the field and is significant because (1) it analyzes the phenotype in vivo in a mouse model, contrasting with previous papers that performed experiments only in cell culture. (2) The current manuscript also sheds light on a previous claim by Giorgetti et al., (2016) that Dxz4 is required for genes to escape from XCI. (3) It is revealed that the loci also do not play a role in imprinted XCI. All three reviewers believe that the scope of the work is in principle in line with <italic>eLife</italic>. However, for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, we would require several major revisions.</p><p>1) Better controls to rule out strain background or off-target artifacts, when looking at changes in autosomal gene expression. (See reviewer 3 notes).</p><p>2) More backcrosses and RNA-seq of placenta, as it is the only tissue with non-random XCI, and therefore the only tissue where the authors can distinguish between effects stemming from Firre/Dxz4's roles on the inactive vs. the active X. (See reviewer 2).</p><p>3) Direct versus indirect effects of Dxz4/Firre on autosomal expression. If the authors would like to claim a direct effect, CHART analyses would be required. Otherwise, the statements should be toned down. (See reviewer 1 notes).</p><p>4) The 2 main figures should be broken up. (See reviewer 1 notes).</p><p>5) Revision of statistical analyses. (See reviewer 2 notes).</p><p>6) Finally, to the extent possible, please try to address the additional concerns of reviewers 2 and 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The paper from Andergassen et al., is a succinct report made up of mostly negative findings and confirms the negative results of several past publications. Although the knockouts rule out a role in XCI, the report is significant in that (1) it analyzes the phenotype in vivo in a mouse model, contrasting with previous papers that performed experiments only in cell culture; In the majority of past reports, it was shown that the conserved X chromosome &quot;mega-structures&quot; controlled by the Firre and Dxz4 alleles are not required for XCI in cell lines. (2) The current manuscript also sheds light on a previous claim by Giorgetti et al., (2016) that Dxz4 is required for genes to escape from XCI. No effect on gene escape is seen by Andergassen et al., in vivo. (3) The loci also do not play a role in imprinted XCI.</p><p>The authors generate mice carrying a single or double deletion of Firre and Dxz4, and show that despite the repeats being conserved in mammals, these mutants are viable, fertile and show no defect in random or imprinted XCI. One positive finding is that the lack of Firre and Dxz4 results in dysregulated genes on autosomes in an organ-specific manner. By comparing the dysregulated genes between the single and double deletion, they categorize superloop, megadomain, and Firre locus-dependent gene sets and see that Firre deletion has the greatest effect on autosomal expression signatures. The manuscript is within the scope of papers published in <italic>eLife</italic> and would be of interest to the field. Overall, the analysese are done well and the conclusions are mostly supported by the data. However, I recommend several revisions:</p><p>1) While I accept that there are changes in autosomal gene expression, I am less convinced that the effects are direct. I am also not convinced that X-chromosomal superstructures directly affect autosomal gene expression. If the authors would like to claim a direct role, they must perform additional analyses, including â for example â CHART analysis to correlate changes at specific loci with binding of the RNA, or 3C or Hi-C to determine if the loop domains interact with autosomal gene targets.

And another figure should likewise be devoted to a deeper analysis of imprinted XCI, since this is another major point of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Andergassen et al., describes the generation of mouse single and double knockouts of two X-linked macrosatellites, Firre and Dxz4. The authors analyze sex ratio, litter size and expression phenotypes of these three knockouts relative to wild-type, i.e. F1 hybrids of musculus x castaneous crosses. Whether and how these macrosatellites may participate in X chromosome inactivation or escape from XCI is an important question, due to previously described roles of Firre (not referenced PMID: 26048247 and PMID:25887447) and Dxz4 (not referenced PMID:26248554) in gene expression and inactive X chromosome conformation, respectively. However, as presented, in vivo defects were non-comprehensively analyzed, and gene expression experiments improperly controlled and somewhat over-interpreted:</p><p>1) The authors main conclusion, that there is no sex ratio distortion in the double ko, is partially undermined by a miscalculated p-value (should be 0.2712 under a p=0.5 cumulative binomial) and only six reported litters. This table should also include the outcomes of the wildtype control and single homozygous ko matings.</p><p>2) Differences in the genetic background of wild-type (not specified), single knockouts (after only two backcrosses: ~12.5% BALB/C genome for Firre, and ~6.25% DBA for Dxz4), and the double ko (variable ~1.6% BALB/C and ~6.25% DBA), are not taken into account in the gene expression analysis. This would be a non-issue with more backcrosses to C57BL/6J, at least five (see Silver, mouse genetics book).</p><p>3) Low and inconsistent numbers of replicates in the RNA-seq that reduce statistical power. This is especially problematic for attributing differential expression to loss of megadomains and superloop, because this analysis depended on comparing across multiple differential gene lists, which shrink with low statistical power (see only two Dxz4 ko replicates). This could be addressed by additional replicates from the single ko's, to get at least four across the board for liver, spleen and placenta.</p><p>4) Homozygous animals also lack Firre RNA (and possibly Dxz4-associated transcripts) expressed from the active X. The analysis here assumes that there are no confounding interactions between differential genes attributed to one group or another. A deeper analysis of the placental data in heterozygous F1 hybrid animals, where such interactions can be excluded, would be preferable and likely yield more insight towards identifying megadomain- or superloop-specific gene expression, if any.</p><p>In conclusion, while the authors present a worthwhile question and set of experiments, more careful analysis and interpretation is necessary to address functions of Firre and Dxz4 in XCI and development. At minimum, the placental RNA-seq should be repeated and fully analyzed after more than 5 backcrosses, with at least 4 replicates for each of the 4 genotypes presented. Additional novelty could come from three interesting observations reported here: (1) enrichment for differential genes implicated in faithful chromosome segregation in mice lacking Firre expression, (2) Xist upregulation by 30% in Dxz4 single and double ko's (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B), and (3) shift in allelic ratio in the spleen of Dxz4 ko's (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B). Are there specific genes driving this or is the deletion skewing XCI?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In their study, Andergassen et al., describe mouse mutants for the noncoding RNA-gene Firre and the Dxz4 Megadomain boundary element, which are important for X-chromosome 3D-structure. It has been an important question in the X-inactivation field, what the functional significance of these elements is and what their impact is on X-chromosome inactivation. Recent studies using cell lines have already demonstrated that deletion of these elements does not affect X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in vitro. However, the current study is the first one to assess their importance in vivo and during imprinted XCI in the placenta. The data regarding a lack of an XCI phenotype in Firre and Dxz4-deletion mice is therefore important for the X-inactivation field.</p><p>The second main message of the paper is that nevertheless changes in autosomal gene expression are observed. Only few changes appear to be dependent on Dxz4-deletion, however more are observed in the Firre KO, which is expected from its role as a non-coding RNA, which could also have function away from the X-chromosome. However, as mentioned in my specific comments below, off-target or strain background effects can at the moment not be completely ruled out. Therefore, the authors should address these points, to ensure that the autosomal changes in gene expression are indeed caused by the Firre and Dxz4 mutation and are not artifacts.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should perform Southern blotting and/or other assays to confirm that no autosomal off-target mutations were introduced when targeting the Firre and Dxz4 loci. PCR-screening alone as done at the moment (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1) is not sufficient to rule that out especially considering the low number of back-crossings and the variability between replicates when looking at changes in autosomal gene expression (Figure 2D). This would be important especially as a main message of the paper is that there are Firre/Dxz4-dependent changes in autosomal gene expression.</p><p>2) Figure 2: The different knockout alleles have been generated in mixed strain backgrounds (129, BALB/C, DBA) and only relatively few backcrosses seem to have been performed to pure B6 background (&gt;2). Where did the wildtype mice come from, to which autosomal gene expression levels were compared in the adult expression bodymap? Were they of equivalent mixed strain background, or were wildtype controls of pure strain background used? It is important that controls of matched strain background were used throughout the study, in order to avoid differences in autosomal gene expression due to strain-background effects.</p><p>3) Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B and Figure 4âfigure supplement 4C: Xist RNA seems to be upregulated dependent on Megadomain deletion (Figure 4âfigure supplement 4C) and the allelic-ratio seems to skew random X-inactivation in the brain more towards the M Musculus (Dxz4-deleted) allele in Dxz4 and Firre/Dxz4 KO mice. The authors should check, if Xist skewing and allelic ratios of X-linked genes are significantly changed during random XCI in the Dxz4 and Firre/Dxz4 KOs.</p><p>4) Figure 2D: The megadomain-specific upregulation of urinary cluster genes in liver seems to be very variable between replicates. It would be good to add a third replicate for delta Dxz4 as at the moment one replicate shows strong upregulation, while the second one doesn't. Also, in the Firre/Dxz4 double-mutants half of the replicates show an effect while others don't. How do the authors explain this discrepancy between replicates?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled <italic>&quot;</italic>in vivo <italic>Firre</italic> and <italic>Dxz4</italic> deletion elucidates roles for autosomal gene regulation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Please see comments below for more details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The revised manuscript by Andergassen et al., adds new placental RNA-seq data that was requested by reviewers so that the authors could exploit imprinted XCI to untangle the effects of Firre and Dxz4 deletions residing on the active vs. the inactive X. This is impossible to do in tissues with random XCI as analyzed in the &quot;bodymap&quot;. The authors should state clearly that the conclusions of their bodymap data are possibly impacted by random XCI and unaccounted genetic variation (raised in the prior round of review). There appear to be very few consistently diff. expressed genes for any of the deletions in the placenta or other tissues (except the spleen). Moreover, the authors conclude that XCI and escape in the placenta are not affected, but apply a minimal log2FC cutoff of 1, the maximal differential that could be expected if XCI or escape are impacted (going from 1 to 2 active copies or vice versa). Allelic analyses which address this question directly is only presented in aggregated figures, supplementary tables, or overly compressed log-scales, obscuring gene-specific changes. These issues need to be addressed, not by new experiments, but a more in-depth and transparent gene expression analysis:</p><p>1) Please include a supplementary table listing all RNA-seq samples (indicating replicate groups) with read depths and% reads aligned. Please include PCA plots of all samples in this analysis, next to or in place of supplemental heatmaps. Supplementary tables on placental RNA-seq showed some genes with high log2FC that failed the significance cutoff â is this a replicate/variance issue? Was batch-correction applied to minimize the impact of different strain backgrounds? There is insufficient information in the methods to replicate this analysis.</p><p>2) Seeing more escaping genes on the CAST inactive X is an interesting observation, but not presented in meaningful depth. Allele-specific analysis of genes subject to and escaping XCI in the placental RNA-seq should be plotted on log2FC scale from -3 to +3 with Firre as an outlier (Figure 3A, rather than from -12 to +12). And in Figure 3B and C, there should be a Venn diagram listing the CAST/BL6 -common and specific escaping genes in placental RNA-seq.</p><p>3) Both DKO and Dxz4 show increased Xist expression and DKO animals have a very significant change towards more BL6-biased random XCI (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2, please add a p-value for that difference in median X-linked expression). Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B should be moved to main Figure 3, as Xist upregulation in the absence of Dxz4 appears to be consistent across the animal. Non-coding genes regulating Xist in cis and skewing XCI were not listed in the supplement â were any of them changed? Please include these genes the supplementary tables (use Gencode reference rather than RefSeq if necessary). In view of Xist and XCI skewing, it is essential that Dxz4 SKO and DKO sex ratios are reported in Figure 1B.</p><p>4) Please re-analyze genome-wide differential expression without log2FC cutoff in the placental RNA-seq data to distinguish Firre locus from superloop and megadomain differentially expressed genes (if any). Include this info in Figure 4, and discuss in the context of the other random XCI bodymap &amp; GSEA analysis. If Firre is only relevant in the spleen, please state so clearly.</p><p>5) There is incongruence between the genes listed as commonly differentially expressed in Figure 4 and the gene lists in the supplementary file (only 8 genes match the table &amp; the Venn diagram in 4E). And only 45 genes are diff. expressed in the spleens of both Firre and DKO mice. Please indicate clearly which GSEA-enriched gene sets originated from which comparisons (update Venn in Figure 4E), and include info listing these enriched diff. genes in the updated supplementary tables. There is insufficient information here to replicate this analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In their revised version the authors have added some new data (visceral yolk sac data, DNA-methylation data, more replicates) and addressed many of my concerns in changing the wording and splitting the figures, making the manuscript more readable. They have not completely addressed the concerns related to the mixed strain background, which is a main weakness of the paper. Nevertheless, the authors have explained the situation in more detail, providing indirect (but no new experimental) arguments that the phenotypes observed are indeed due to the gene modifications and not due to strain background effects. Some additional doubts remain about the genotyping strategies used (PCR only â cannot rule out off-target mutations elsewhere in the genome).</p><p>Nevertheless, the paper has generally improved from the initial version and adds an interesting piece of information to the X-inactivation field regarding functional non-requirement of Firre and X-megadomains for X-inactivation in vivo, but having rather potential functions in direct or indirect autosomal gene regulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47214.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The study generates single or double deletions of Firre and Dxz4 in mice, and show that despite the repeats being conserved in mammals, these mutants are viable, fertile and show no defect in random or imprinted XCI. Instead, the lack of Firre and Dxz4 results in dysregulated genes on autosomes in an organ-specific manner. Although the authors present mostly negative data, the manuscript would be of interest to the field and is significant because (1) it analyzes the phenotype in vivo in a mouse model, contrasting with previous papers that performed experiments only in cell culture. (2) The current manuscript also sheds light on a previous claim by Giorgetti et al. (2016) that Dxz4 is required for genes to escape from XCI. (3) It is revealed that the loci also do not play a role in imprinted XCI. All three reviewers believe that the scope of the work is in principle in line with eLife. However, for publication in eLife, we would require several major revisions.</p><p>1) Better controls to rule out strain background or off-target artifacts, when looking at changes in autosomal gene expression. (See reviewer 3 notes).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer comments that the relatively low number of backcrossing (fewer than 5) of the founder mice with the C57BL/6J strain could result in strain background differences between wild type and KO strains. To control for potential strain background or off-target effects artifacts, we performed all necessary control experiments in our initial submission which we will highlight and discuss in more detail below.</p><p>a) All the wildtype controls samples that we used for RNA-seq originate from backcrossing of the <italic>Firre, Dxz4</italic> and double deletion founder mice with the C57BL/6J strain in order to ensure a matching genetic background to the KO strains and, thus, to allow for proper comparison between wildtype and KO strains. To clarify this point, we added the following sentence to the âMaterials and methodsâ section (Mouse strains): âIn order to control for strain background, all wildtype control mice were obtained from backcrossing of founder mice with C57BL/6J to match the KO strain background.â</p><p>b) To minimize potential strain background or off-target effects, for the <italic>Firre-Dxz4</italic> double KO bodymap we used four biological replicates per group, collected from different litters.</p><p>c) The dysregulation of autosomal genes that was observed in the DKO mice, was confirmed in <underline>independently</underline> generated SKO mice, strongly arguing for a specific effect of the deletions, rather than strain background or off-target effects. For example, the largest spleen-specific transcriptional effect on autosomes detected in the DKO bodymap was also detected in independently-generated <italic>Firre</italic> SKO but not in the <italic>Dxz4</italic> SKO. Thus, the observed autosomal genes dysregulation can be confidently attributed to the specific deletion of the <italic>Firre</italic> locus rather than to potential background strain differences or off-target effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More backcrosses and RNA-seq of placenta, as it is the only tissue with non-random XCI, and therefore the only tissue where the authors can distinguish between effects stemming from Firre/Dxz4's roles on the inactive vs. the active X. (See Reviewer 2)</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the above examples that strongly suggest background is not influencing our conclusions, it is important to note that the suggested backcrosses would take approximately a year. At the very least this would require redoing the entire sample collection and sequencing again.</p><p>In the placenta we had not observe dysregulation of X-linked genes or gene escape in the presence of the deletions on either Xa or Xi. We have now included one additional placenta biological replicate of the DKO (deletion on Xa and Xi) and confirmed that the deletion of these loci does not have an effect on the X chromosome (new Figure 3). To further investigate whether the deletions have any impact on DNA methylation levels of the inactive X chromosome, we have now also performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) on placentas lacking both <italic>Firre</italic> and <italic>Dxz4</italic> on Xa or Xi. We found similar methylation levels as in wildtype, providing further evidence that deletion of these loci does not affect X chromosome biology (new Figure 3âfigure supplement 1).</p><p>The reviewer also commented that the placenta was the only tissue in our dataset undergoing non-random XCI and we agree that it is worth examining another tissue with non-random XCI. Thus, to further explore the role of non-random XCI in <italic>Firre</italic> and <italic>Dxz4</italic> mutants, we collected the visceral yolk sac, an extra-embryonic tissue that, similarly to the placenta, undergoes imprinted XCI. We performed RNA-seq analysis of the visceral yolk sac and as observed in the placenta, we did not detect dysregulation of X-linked genes or gene escape in the presence of the deletions either on Xa or Xi (new Figure 3) a further evidence that the lack of the <italic>Firre</italic> lncRNA or the mega-structures does not affect imprinted X chromosome inactivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Direct versus indirect effects of Dxz4/Firre on autosomal expression. If the authors would like to claim a direct effect, CHART analyses would be required. Otherwise, the statements should be toned down. (See reviewer 1 notes).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the effect could be either direct or indirect. Indeed, we had acknowledged that further studies are needed to establish whether the effect of the megastructures on autosomal genes regulation is direct or indirect. With regard to the autosomal targets of <italic>Firre</italic> RNA that we reported previously (<italic>Slc25a12, Ypel4, Eef1a1, Atf4 and Ppp1r10</italic> in male mouse embryonic stem cells, PMID: 24463464), we did find that <italic>Ypel4</italic> is downregulated in the spleen of both DKO and <italic>Firre</italic> SKO mice.

While this finding would suggest a direct role of <italic>Firre</italic> RNA in at least some of the expression changes, we agree that our experimental approach does not permit to discriminate between direct and indirect effects. To clarify this point, we have revised the text in the Discussion section as follow: âThe major function of these dysregulated genes appears to be in ontologies associated with chromosome structure and segregation, which is in line with the known role for <italic>Firre</italic> lncRNA in nuclear organization. This relationship points to an RNA dependent role, which may be either direct or indirect, on autosomal gene regulation.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The 2 main figures should be broken up.

Although the knockouts rule out a role in XCI, the report is significant in that (1) it analyzes the phenotype in vivo in a mouse model, contrasting with previous papers that performed experiments only in cell culture; In the majority of past reports, it was shown that the conserved X chromosome &quot;mega-structures&quot; controlled by the Firre and Dxz4 alleles are not required for XCI in cell lines.

One positive finding is that the lack of Firre and Dxz4 results in dysregulated genes on autosomes in an organ-specific manner. By comparing the dysregulated genes between the single and double deletion, they categorize superloop, megadomain, and Firre locus-dependent gene sets and see that Firre deletion has the greatest effect on autosomal expression signatures.

In addition, we would like to clarify that the <italic>Firre</italic> SKO mouse was generated by inserting LoxP sites flanking the <italic>Firre</italic> gene body into JM8A ESCs (PMID: 19525957) which are of Bl6 background and not 129xBl6 as we indicated in the original submission. The ESCs were then injected into blastocysts to obtain chimeras that were then backcrossed to Bl6 to obtain the founder mouse. The founder mouse was then crossed with CMV-CRE mice B6.C-Tg(CMV-cre)1Cgn/J, JAX Stock no: 006054. While the CRE JAX strain was generated from BALB/c-I ESCs, stock 006054 was backcrossed to the Bl6 background for 10 generations. Thus, the background strain is Bl6 and not BALB/c as we indicated in the original submission. We apologize for the confusion. The resulting <italic>Firre</italic> SKO mouse was subsequently backcrossed three times with Bl6, more details in Lewandowski et al. bioXriv 2019. Based on this consideration the background of the <italic>Firre</italic> SKO is almost 100% Bl6 (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A). The <italic>Dxz4</italic> single deletion strainwas generated by co-injecting Cas9 mRNA together with two guide RNAâs that span the <italic>Dxz4</italic> locus into pronuclear stage 3 (PN3) zygotes isolated after mating super ovulated B6D2F1 (50% Bl6 50% DBA) female mice with Bl6 males resulting in a founder mouse with 75% Bl6 background. The Founder mouse was then backcrossed two times with Bl6, and can thus be considered as 93.75% Bl6 background (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a). The <italic>Firre-Dxz4</italic> double deletion strain, was generated by piezo-assisted Intracytoplasmic sperm injection of <italic>Firre</italic> SKO sperm (Bl6 background) into B6D2F1 (50% Bl6 50%DBA) oocytes (at PN3, Cas9 mRNA was co-injected with the two <italic>Dxz4</italic> locus spanning gRNAs.) The resulting DKO founder mouse was then backcrossed two times with Bl6, and can thus be considered as 93.75% Bl6 (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A). All the wildtype controls samples that we used for RNA-seq originate from backcrossing of the <italic>Firre, Dxz4</italic> and DKO founder mice with the Bl6 strain in order to ensure a matching genetic background to the KO strains and, thus, to allow for proper comparison between wildtype and KO strains.</p><p>We have now provided a more detailed description of the generation of all strains, as well as how the corresponding WT mice were obtained, in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Low and inconsistent numbers of replicates in the RNA-seq that reduce statistical power. This is especially problematic for attributing differential expression to loss of megadomains and superloop, because this analysis depended on comparing across multiple differential gene lists, which shrink with low statistical power (see only two Dxz4 ko replicates).

To address this point, we have performed an additional analysis to test whether the DKO deletion on either Xa or Xi might result in autosomal gene regulation in the placenta, a tissue where we can disentangle the functional role of <italic>Firre</italic> RNA on Xa from that of megadomain and superloop structures that only exist on the Xi. We detected only a few autosomal genes dysregulated in the DKO deletion on either Xa or Xi that were not changed in the SKO, suggesting that the mega-structures and the lncRNA <italic>Firre</italic> have no impact on autosomal gene regulation in the placenta (Supplementary file 1 sheet A-B). We have now highlighted this finding in the Results section of the revised manuscript, as follow: (âNotably, by using the same criteria we detected only a few autosomal genes dysregulated in the DKO that were not changed in the SKO, suggesting that the mega-structures and the lncRNA <italic>Firre</italic> have no impact on autosomal gene regulation in the placenta.

At minimum, the placental RNA-seq should be repeated and fully analyzed after more than 5 backcrosses, with at least 4 replicates for each of the 4 genotypes presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a fourth biological replicate of the placenta DKO as indicated in point 2 of âEssential revisionâ.

Are there specific genes driving this or is the deletion skewing XCI?</p></disp-quote><p>a) It would be very interesting to follow up the <italic>Firre</italic> dependent enrichment of differential genes involved in chromosome structure and segregation, however we believe that this would be outside the scope of this study and will instead be followed up by a separate study.</p><p>b) <italic>Xist</italic> upregulation by 30% in <italic>Dxz4</italic> single and DKO is an interesting observation because it suggests that the <italic>Dxz4</italic> locus or the resulting megastructure is regulating <italic>Xist</italic> expression. Given that we donât detect dysregulated genes on the X chromosome in the absence of <italic>Dxz4</italic>, our interpretation of this finding is that <italic>Xist</italic> upregulation occurs only from the inactive X chromosome, suggesting a role for maintaining X chromosome silencing. It would be very interesting to follow <italic>Xist</italic> expression in <italic>Dxz4</italic> deletions to test whether <italic>Xist</italic> upregulation correlates with aging, however, that is outside the scope of this current study.</p><p>c) In Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B we show the allelic ratio of the E12.5 F1 brains (not the spleen) and found the expected XCI skewing ratios, a well-documented effect in female cells from crosses between Bl6 and CAST that results in the predominant inactivation of the Bl6 X chromosome. As pointed out by reviewer 2 and 3, the XCI skewing was even stronger in the <italic>Dxz4</italic> and DKO brains. To test whether the additional skewing is significant we performed a t-test on the <italic>Xist</italic> allelic ratios between WT (n=17) and each of the KO strains (n=6) and observed significant skewing (t-test, adjusted p-value = 0.0108) in the presence of the DKO deletion (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A right), suggesting that the Bl6 chromosome is further biased towards silencing in mice lacking both <italic>Firre</italic> and <italic>Dxz4</italic>. We have now highlighted this finding in the Results section of the revised manuscript, as follow: (âHowever, our DKO animals show significant skewing of the <italic>Xist</italic> allelic ratios (t-test, adjusted p-value = 0.0108) (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A right panel), suggesting that the Bl6 chromosome is further biased towards silencing in mice lacking both <italic>Firre</italic> and <italic>Dxz4</italic>.â)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The authors should perform Southern blotting and/or other assays to confirm that no autosomal off-target mutations were introduced when targeting the Firre and Dxz4 loci. PCR-screening alone as done at the moment (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1) is not sufficient to rule that out especially considering the low number of back-crossings and the variability between replicates when looking at changes in autosomal gene expression (Figure 2D). This would be important especially as a main message of the paper is that there are Firre/Dxz4-dependent changes in autosomal gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to point 1 of âEssential revisionâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2: The different knockout alleles have been generated in mixed strain backgrounds (129, BALB/C, DBA) and only relatively few backcrosses seem to have been performed to pure B6 background (&gt;2). Where did the wildtype mice come from, to which autosomal gene expression levels were compared in the adult expression bodymap? Were they of equivalent mixed strain background, or were wildtype controls of pure strain background used? It is important that controls of matched strain background were used throughout the study, in order to avoid differences in autosomal gene expression due to strain-background effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the reviewer comment and have addressed this in âEssential revisionâ point 1-2 and in the response to reviewer 2 point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B and Figure 4âfigure supplement 4C: Xist RNA seems to be upregulated dependent on Megadomain deletion (Figure 4âfigure supplement 4C) and the allelic-ratio seems to skew random X-inactivation in the brain more towards the M Musculus (Dxz4-deleted) allele in Dxz4 and Firre/Dxz4 KO mice. The authors should check, if Xist skewing and allelic ratios of X-linked genes are significantly changed during random XCI in the Dxz4 and Firre/Dxz4 KOs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this observation; we have addressed this in reviewer 2 point 4c.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2D: The megadomain-specific upregulation of urinary cluster genes in liver seems to be very variable between replicates. It would be good to add a third replicate for delta Dxz4 as at the moment one replicate shows strong upregulation, while the second one doesn't. Also, in the Firre/Dxz4 double-mutants half of the replicates show an effect while others don't. How do the authors explain this discrepancy between replicates?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by reviewer 2, the expression of major urinary protein genes was shown to be highly variable across individuals (PMID: 26973837) which explains the discrepancy across replicates.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 is satisfied with the revisions (no comments attached). Reviewer 3 also feels that the paper is much improved but remains concerned about strain background.

For this reason, we kept <italic>Dxz4</italic> SKO line to a minimum and mainly used the strain to generate crosses with CAST for the allele-specific placenta analysis. The sex-ratio of the <italic>Firre</italic> SKO progeny is also normal (Lewandowski et al., in press) and, since the <italic>Firre</italic> locus is the main driver of the observed expression changes, we feel that assessing sex-ratio in the <italic>Dxz4</italic> SKO is outside the scope of this study.</p><p>The main biological question of this study was to investigate the in vivo role of the two Xlinked loci <italic>Firre</italic> and <italic>Dxz4,</italic> that provide the platform of the largest conserved chromatin structures in female mammals.
