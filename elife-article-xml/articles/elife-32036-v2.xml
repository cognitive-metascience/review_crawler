A screen of itch-inducing compounds (pruritogens) in zebrafish larvae yielded a single pruritogen, the TLR7 agonist imiquimod, that elicited a somatosensory neuron response. Imiquimod induced itch-like behaviors in zebrafish distinct from those induced by the noxious TRPA1 agonist, allyl isothiocyanate. In the zebrafish, imiquimod-evoked somatosensory neuronal responses and behaviors were entirely dependent upon TRPA1, while in the mouse TRPA1 was required for the direct activation of somatosensory neurons and partially responsible for behaviors elicited by this pruritogen. Imiquimod was found to be a direct but weak TRPA1 agonist that activated a subset of TRPA1 expressing neurons. Imiquimod-responsive TRPA1 expressing neurons were significantly more sensitive to noxious stimuli than other TRPA1 expressing neurons. Together, these results suggest a model for selective itch via activation of a specialized subpopulation of somatosensory neurons with a heightened sensitivity to noxious stimuli.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32036.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Itch is a common and uncomfortable sensation that creates a strong desire to scratch. This mechanism may have evolved so animals can remove harmful parasites or substances from themselves. Feelings like touch, pain, and itch arise when stimuli such as mechanical pressure, temperature, or chemicals activate groups of specialized neurons in the skin. This response takes place when certain proteins – or receptors – at the surface of the neurons are stimulated. For instance, TRP ion channels such as TRPA1 play an important role in both the itch and pain responses. In mammals, directly activating these channels elicits pain. Itch is felt when itch responsive receptors are activated on a distinct set of neurons, which in turn activate TRP receptors. Although these processes have been well-studied in mammals, little is known about the existence of itch sensation in other animals.</p><p>To explore this, Esancy, Condon, Feng et al. exposed zebrafish to chemicals that induce itch in mammals, and found that imiquimod, a medicine used to treat certain skin conditions, can elicit itch in fish. When this chemical was injected into the lips of a fish, the animal rubbed them against the walls of its tank, akin to scratching an itch. Further experiments showed that imiquimod directly activated the pain-sensing ion channel TRPA1. In fact, this receptor was essential to the ‘scratching’ behavior: fish genetically engineered to lack TRPA1 did not react to the drug.</p><p>Fluorescent proteins were then used to track when the neurons that carry TRPA1 were activated.This revealed that, in the skin of zebrafish, there are at least two functionally distinct populations neurons that express TRPA1. One population, whose activation is associated with the animal ‘scratching’, responds even when TRPA1 receives a low level of stimulation. The other population is less sensitive: it responds only to high-intensity stimuli and is associated with a pain response such as freezing and slower movements. Further experiments in the mouse suggest that this mechanism is present in mammals as well. This coding strategy explains how pain and itch can be experienced when the same receptors are being activated.</p><p>Studying how animals like fish experience itch gives an insight into how detecting these sensations could have evolved. In turn, understanding this mechanism at the molecular and cellular levels may help find new ways to design better treatments for itch and pain disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>itch</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>TRPA1</kwd><kwd>somatosensory</kwd><kwd>imiquimod</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DE23730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dhaka</surname><given-names>Ajay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mary Gates</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Undergraduate Research Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Condon</surname><given-names>Logan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Levinson Emerging Scholars Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Undergraduate Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Condon</surname><given-names>Logan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A pain-relaying ion channel on a hypersensitive population of sensory neurons can instead elicit sensations of itch in both fish and mice when directly activated, providing a novel model of itch transduction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Itch is an unpleasant sensation that elicits a scratch behavior in terrestrial vertebrates. In mammals, chemically-induced itch is thought to be mediated by pruritic receptors on somatosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bautista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoon, 2015</xref>). These receptors are typically G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that, upon activation, prompt the opening of downstream transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, facilitating activation of the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ross, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang, 2015</xref>). This coupling of pruritic receptors to TRPA1 or TRPV1 is especially intriguing in that these TRP channels also serve as nociceptors, mediating responses to algogenic (painful) stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laing and Dhaka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ikoma et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) have proven to be a valuable tool in the study of nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gau et al., 2013</xref>).

When 5dpf larval zebrafish were exposed to individual pruritogens, only IMQ elevated baseline locomotion (p&lt;0.001), producing a dose dependent increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). When coupled with our findings in CaMPARI transgenics, these results indicate that IMQ likely acts through somatosensory neurons to evoke behavioral responses. While 5-HT did produce a reduction in locomotion, it did not activate somatosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). Given the limited sensitivity of the locomotor assay we were unable to differentiate nocifensive behavior elicited by AITC from potentially pruritic behavior elicited by IMQ. To address this issue, we employed an adult zebrafish behavioral assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Correia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maximino, 2011</xref>). Injection of IMQ into the lip elicited a lip-rubbing behavior that may constitute a form of itch-scratch response in zebrafish, a behavior that was absent in sham-injected control fish (p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1—3</xref>) and distinct from previously described zebrafish nocifensive, escape, or exploratory behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colwill and Creton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levin et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with studies of nocifensive behaviors, injection of AITC produced freezing behavior (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) as well as a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in velocity not observed in control or IMQ injected fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Such distinct behavioral responses imply that zebrafish are capable of experiencing, and responding differentially to, discrete stimuli analogous to itch and pain in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Trpa1b</italic>, but not <italic>tlr7</italic>, is required for both neuronal and behavioral responses to imiquimod</title><p>The mechanism by which IMQ elicits itch in mammals is unclear. IMQ, a treatment for various skin disorders, acts through TLR7 to stimulate an immune response, with intense itching and painful burning commonly reported as side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lebwohl et al., 2004</xref>). In mice, however, IMQ is reported to be itch selective, and only elicits scratching, but not nociceptive, behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, there is dispute surrounding TLR7’s role in IMQ-induced itch. One study found that <italic>Tlr7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed deficits in IMQ evoked itch and proposed that <italic>Tlr7</italic> expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons was mediating IMQ transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). TLR7 has also been reported to couple with TRPA1 in DRG neurons to evoke nociception in response to other TLR7 agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2014</xref>). However, conflicting studies found that <italic>Tlr7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited no deficits in IMQ-evoked itch, and RNAseq analysis of DRG neurons found no evidence for <italic>Tlr7 </italic>expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore investigated whether TLR7 and/or TRPA1 were involved in transducing the neural and behavioral responses to IMQ in zebrafish.</p><p><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization studies in zebrafish larvae revealed that <italic>tlr7</italic> mRNA expression is restricted to known hematopoietic regions in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bresciani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2011</xref>), and was notably absent in both TG and Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>).

However, due to a lack of a Tlr7 positive control, we were unable to confirm that Tlr7 was functional in our heterologous expression system. With this caveat in mind, the lack of zebrafish Tlr7 response to these TLR7 agonists lends further credence to the conclusion that Tlr7 is not involved in somatosensory neuronal activation or behavior in this species.</p><p>If TRPA1 does not couple with TLR7, but is instead directly activated by both IMQ and AITC, how could IMQ be itch-selective in the mouse? To address this question we assessed the EC<sub>50</sub> and peak responses to IMQ and AITC in HEK cells transfected with <italic>Trpa1</italic> from different species. The EC<sub>50</sub> of IMQ for zebrafish, mouse and human TRPA1 was consistently higher than the AITC EC<sub>50</sub>, demonstrating that IMQ is a weaker agonist than AITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Notably, while the IMQ EC<sub>50</sub> of zebrafish Trpa1 and human TRPA1 were only 2–3 fold greater than that of the EC<sub>50</sub> of AITC, mouse TRPA1 demonstrated a ~40 fold difference between the EC<sub>50</sub> of AITC and IMQ. Furthermore, only mouse TRPA1 elicited significantly lower maximum responses to IMQ than AITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). In similar electrophysiology experiments, HEK cells transfected with zebrafish <italic>trpa1b</italic> exhibited identical current density responses upon stimulation with the maximum dose of either AITC or IMQ, but cells transfected with mouse <italic>Trpa1</italic> exhibited significantly higher current density responses following stimulation with AITC, relative to IMQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Such physiological differences in TRPA1 function between species could provide a potential mechanism for the itch selectivity of IMQ in mice, implying that IMQ is not a strong enough mouse TRPA1 agonist to elicit nociception in this species. Conversely, the ability of both zebrafish and human TRPA1 to respond equally to AITC and IMQ at maximal doses potentially explains how IMQ can elicit both itch and pain sensations in humans, and suggests that the same may be observable in fish.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Imiquimod responsive neurons are a primed subpopulation of TRPA1-expressing neurons</title><p>In the preceding <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging experiments, we observed that only a small proportion of zebrafish Trpa1+ neurons, identified by their responsiveness to AITC, were also responsive to the IMQ stimulus.

Based on our finding that IMQ is a weaker TRPA1 agonist than AITC, one potential explanation is that such an itch-selective Trpa1+ population is more sensitive to TRPA1 agonists, and can be activated by weaker (pruritic) stimuli. In IMQ+/AITC+ neurons, we determined that the average maximum fluorescence intensity response to the IMQ stimulus was significantly lower than that of the AITC stimulus (p&lt;0.001), implying that at the concentrations used, IMQ is indeed a weaker TRPA1 stimulus than AITC in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Additionally, it is possible the single neuron that responded only to the second pulse of IMQ may also be a dual-responder. While the GCaMP fluorescence change only crossed our response threshold during the second pulse, it is possible that the sloping baseline may have obscured a minimal response to the first pulse, especially considering the low amplitude of the second response. However, for purposes of completion we decided to include this trace in our final counts. Given the finding that only ~30% of AITC responsive neurons responded to one pulse of IMQ (100 μM), if one assumes that this is the probability that any given AITC responsive neuron would respond to IMQ (100 μM), and that responses to IMQ are stochastic in nature, one would expect only a small fraction of neurons to be double responders (~9%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Furthermore, increasing the IMQ concentration to 200 µM in adult behavioral experiments evoked nocifensive behaviors such as elevated freezing and significantly reduced velocity, and the itch-like lip rubbing behavior seen at 100 µM was notably absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maximino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sneddon, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

These data indicate that the subpopulation of Trpa1+ neurons that drive itch behavior in the zebrafish are distinct in their sensitivity to TRPA1 agonists, but can be activated by either AITC or IMQ at the appropriate concentration to produce equivalent behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>TRPA1 mediates itch behavior and neuronal responses in in the mouse</title><p>We found that IMQ elicited responses in 9.6% (83/864) of cultured AITC+ DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) from WT animals.

We next explored whether IMQ-evoked scratching behavior was also dependent on TRPA1. High-dose IMQ (125 μg) paw injections did not evoke nocifensive behaviors in WT mice (n = 0/10 IMQ-injected), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2011</xref>).

In the mouse, increasing the concentration of AITC activated more DRG neurons in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Furthermore, within the population of neurons that responded to lower concentrations of AITC, the IMQ+ subpopulation was enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J</xref>). We also found that IMQ+ neurons in the mouse had a smaller peak responses to IMQ than AITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Additionally, AITC peak responses within the IMQ+ population were significantly greater than in the AITC+ only population (p&lt;0.01), demonstrating that the heightened sensitivity of IMQ+ neurons to TRPA1 agonists is conserved in the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Subsequent experiments revealed that IMQ+ DRG neurons exhibited a significantly higher maximum response to the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin (CAPS) than CAPS+ only neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>), implying that the IMQ+ neurons may be intrinsically more sensitive to noxious stimuli, not exclusively TRPA1 agonists. Finally, in accordance with our zebrafish data, we observed that AITC stimulus intensity dictates whether mice exhibit pruritic or nocifensive behaviors. In order to discriminate between nocifensive and pruritic behaviors, we employed a ‘cheek model of itch’ assay in which compounds injected into the cheek may elicit scratching (a pruritic response) or wiping (a nocifensive response) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shimada and LaMotte, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2010</xref>). We observed that AITC (50 mM) produces significant scratching behavior with no appreciable wiping behavior (p&lt;0.001 and N.S. respectively), while a higher dose of AITC (100 mM) results in a significant attenuation of the observed scratching behavior, as well as a significant wiping behavior (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.001 respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The sense of itch in mammals has been thoroughly explored, but there is a dearth of knowledge on the presence of itch, and the neural mechanisms which transduce it, in lower vertebrates such as fish. Here, we use a popular model organism, the zebrafish, to demonstrate that fish are potentially capable of experiencing a form of rudimentary itch in response to the pruritogen IMQ, and suggest that this sensation is conveyed by the direct activation of TRPA1 on a specialized subset of somatosensory neurons highly sensitive to TRPA1 agonists.</p><p>Through a combination of experimental procedures, we show that the pruritogen IMQ can elicit behavior and neuronal responses in zebrafish. In larvae, IMQ elicits an increase in locomotion and activation of somatosensory TG neurons, suggesting that the observed locomotor effects likely originate in the periphery, and are not due to the direct action of IMQ upon more central structures. Furthermore, in adult zebrafish, peripherally applied IMQ produces a scratching-analogous lip-rubbing behavioral response that is distinct from the nocifensive behaviors evoked by the algogen AITC as well as previously described escape behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Correia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maximino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colwill and Creton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levin et al., 2007</xref>). The fact that IMQ-evoked behavioral responses manifest as lip-rubbing, as opposed to nocifensive or escape behaviors, further suggests that these fish are indeed experiencing an itch-like sensation. For animals whose anatomy prohibits scratching behavior with claws, the use of another body part or an external object is perhaps the only recourse to address a pruritic stimulus. Such scratching behaviors have previously been documented in animals from a variety of taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chevalier-Skolnikoff and Liska, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deecke, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Green and Mattson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delius, 1988</xref>).</p><p>There is currently a lack of consensus in the literature as to how IMQ induces itch in mammals, although all studies show that TRPV1-expressing neurons are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). A major point of contention surrounds the involvement of the immune receptor TLR7, the therapeutic target of IMQ. Our work provides additional evidence that TLR7 is not involved in the direct activation of somatosensory neurons by IMQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Instead, the TRPA1 ion channel appears to play a key role in transducing IMQ-evoked neuronal effects and the behaviors that result from such neuronal activity. Unlike <italic>trpa1b</italic>, <italic>tlr7</italic> is not expressed in zebrafish somatosensory tissue, as demonstrated by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. Moreover, zebrafish that lacked functional TLR7 behaved equivalently to wildtype animals in response to IMQ application. By contrast, behavioral and neuronal responses to IMQ in both fish and mice were largely dependent upon TRPA1. Utilizing both electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we showed that IMQ was able to directly activate TRPA1, and that co-transfection of <italic>Tlr7</italic> did not potentiate IMQ-evoked responses. However, greater concentrations of IMQ were required to elicit the same levels of calcium flux that were evoked by lower concentrations of AITC, implying that IMQ is a weaker agonist than AITC in all species we examined. With zebrafish and human TRPA1, IMQ eventually reached the same maximal calcium response levels as AITC, while IMQ responses with mouse TRPA1 plateaued at lower maximal levels than AITC. This suggests that in the mouse, IMQ is incapable of evoking the same intensity of neuronal responses as AITC can, even at high concentrations. Our findings may provide a molecular explanation for previously-documented observations that in the mouse, IMQ appears to be itch-selective, while in humans, IMQ has been reported to elicit sensations of both itch and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lebwohl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Findings from these <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments may also underlie our own observations in both mice and adult zebrafish behavioral experiments. In the context of TRPA1 activation, stronger stimuli elicited nocifensive behaviors, whereas weaker stimuli evoked pruritic behaviors. Furthermore, the effects of stimulus intensity upon neuronal activation and behavior were largely but not entirely independent of stimulus identity. In adult zebrafish low concentrations of IMQ evoked pruritic behaviors while higher concentrations of IMQ were capable of eliciting nocifensive freezing behaviors. In line with previous reports, we were unable to elicit murine nocifensive behaviors with high concentrations of IMQ, which we hypothesize was due to the inability of IMQ to maximally activate mouse TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, AITC evoked behaviors were not species dependent as predicted by the dose response curves of zebrafish Trpa1 and mouse TRPA1 to this agonist. Low concentrations of AITC produced scratching behaviors, while higher concentrations of AITC evoked nocifensive behaviors in both species. While the direct activation of a TRP channel to evoke itch by a pruritogen or algogen is somewhat surprising, as it deviates from canonical pathways requiring both pruritic GPCRs and TRP ion channels, such a mechanism supports observations of itch in both human and mouse studies following application of typically noxious TRP channel agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Højland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sikand et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, our observation that behaviors transitioned from a pruritic to a nocifensive phenotype as stimulus intensity increased was mirrored by our observations in calcium imaging studies. Experiments with two different calcium indicators of neuronal activity, GCaMP and CaMPARI, revealed a correlation between TRPA1 agonist stimulus intensity and neuronal recruitment. Specifically, stronger stimuli (high concentrations of TRPA1 agonists) activated more neurons than weaker stimuli (lower concentrations of TRPA1 agonists).</p><p>Based on these findings we hypothesized that a population coding strategy was being employed. In our model, low intensity stimuli would selectively activate a subset of TRPA1-expressing neurons that encode pruriception, whereas higher intensity stimuli would activate another population of TRPA1-expressing neurons that encode nociception. This hypothesis would be in line with recent findings that pruriception is encoded by different populations of somatosensory neurons than those that encode nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goswami et al., 2014</xref>). Calcium imaging of zebrafish and mouse somatosensory neurons revealed the existence of at least two functionally distinct neuronal subpopulations. In both species, we observed a population of neurons that responded to both low and high intensity TRPA1 agonists and another that only responded to high intensity TRPA1 agonists. Our observation that sequential pulses of IMQ (100 μM) activate the low intensity TRPA1 agonist responsive population in zebrafish demonstrates that this population is likely genetically defined, and not determined stochastically. Furthermore, in the mouse, we observed that the vast majority of IMQ (100 μM) responsive neurons also responded to the TRPA1-dependent pruritogens chloroquine and deoxycholic acid, supporting the conclusion that these neurons constitute a pruritic subpopulation. Unfortunately, equivalent experiments could not be performed in the zebrafish, as we were unable to identify other pruritogens for this species.</p><p>In alignment with these results, in both species, neurons that responded to low intensity TRPA1 agonists also exhibited a greater response to high intensity AITC stimulation than neurons that only responded to high intensity AITC stimulation. This implies that putative itch-encoding neurons comprise a more sensitive subset of somatosensory neurons than nociceptive neurons. Additionally, in both species, IMQ (100 μM) responsive neurons were enriched within populations of neurons that responded to low concentrations of AITC; in other words, we observed a high degree of overlap in the populations of neurons that responded to low intensity TRPA1 agonists irrespective of stimulus identity. Together, this provides further evidence of the greater sensitivity of a population of itch-encoding neurons to TRPA1 agonists.</p><p>Itch is a complex physiological phenomenon, and several models have been proposed to explain its transduction in the periphery and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bautista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ross, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schmelz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McMahon and Koltzenburg, 1992</xref>). Here, we describe a mechanism through which acute IMQ-evoked itch is mediated by the peripheral somatosensory neurons of two species. Weak stimuli such as lower concentrations of the TRPA1 agonists IMQ and AITC activate only a subset of highly sensitive pruriceptive TRPA1-expressing neurons, while the remaining nociceptive TRPA1-expressing neurons are only recruited by higher intensity TRPA1 stimuli. Our proposed model clearly is not the sole mechanism by which itch is coded as a distinct sensation from pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bautista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ross, 2011</xref>). However, in the context of pruritogens and algogens that are direct TPRA1 agonists, our findings overwhelmingly support a population-coding model for the discrimination of itch and pain.</p><p>Our data implicates a mechanism for the direct activation of TRPA1 by IMQ to elicit sensations of itch in both zebrafish and mice. Our findings that IMQ-induced itch was attenuated, but not abolished, in <italic>Trpa1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice supports additional mechanisms for IMQ-evoked itch in this species. One may speculate that the activation of an immune response by IMQ in other cell types could result in a cascade of downstream signaling that could ultimately lead to a release of endogenous pruritic stimuli (e.g. histamine and serotonin from mast cells). In the zebrafish, TLR7 is unlikely to contribute even indirectly to IMQ-induced itch sensation, as we observed no behavioral phenotype in <italic>tlr7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals. However, this does not rule out the possibility that pathogen exposure could stimulate the immune system via TLR activation or other pathways, leading to an indirect activation of pruritic somatosensory neurons and triggering both itch sensations and scratching behaviors. Several studies have implicated that Tlrs in several species of fish play a role in immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meijer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanwal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou and Sun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanekhy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kileng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). However, no study has explicitly queried potential connections between such immune responses and downstream neuronal activation or behavior in any fish species. While our results demonstrate that TLR7 is not involved in transducing IMQ-evoked itch in the zebrafish, investigating the role of immune responses in mediating somatosensations (both in zebrafish and other species) would be an interesting route for future exploration.</p><p>It is plausible that an unknown receptor is activated by IMQ and couples with TRPA1 <italic>in vivo</italic> to evoke a somatosensory neuron response. Our TRPA1 mutant experiments would be unable to detect the existence of such a receptor, which would presumably not function to elicit neuronal activity in the absence of TRPA1. However, our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments suggest that the existence of such an unknown receptor is unlikely, as it would also have to be endogenously expressed in HEK cells. Furthermore, the dose-dependent overlap we observed in the number of neurons that were responsive to IMQ and AITC, as well as similarities in the dose dependent itch and nociceptive behaviors elicited by these compounds in both zebrafish and mice, implies that these compounds are acting via the direct activation of TRPA1.</p><p>We observed that out of several mammalian pruritogens, only IMQ elicited behavioral and neuronal responses in zebrafish. While we tested pruritogens that targeted mammalian pruritic receptors with a known zebrafish ortholog, it is possible that other stimuli we did not test may also evoke sensations of itch in these animals. It is likewise possible that histamine, serotonin, TGR5, and PAR-2 receptors do not function in the itch pathway as pruritic receptors on primary sensory neurons in zebrafish, as they do in mammals. For example, zebrafish have an extensive histaminergic system with multiple histamine receptors, but histamine receptor expression appears to be restricted to the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peitsaro et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, while zebrafish do possess mast cells (which in mammals release histamine and serotonin that act upon peripheral sensory neurons to elicit itch), studies indicate that these mast cells do not contain histamine or serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prykhozhij and Berman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mulero et al., 2007</xref>). It is therefore plausible that in the zebrafish, histamine and serotonin do not play a functional role in pruritic sensation or immune responses, but are restricted to more central processes such as mediating sleep-wakefulness cycles, mood, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sackerman et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The direct activation of a TRP channel to elicit itch or pain through the recruitment of distinct populations of somatosensory neurons via stimulus sensitivity is mechanistically simple. That such a mechanism is present in both zebrafish and mouse may imply that this particular form of itch transduction appeared before the emergence of terrestrial vertebrates, and may have been conserved throughout evolutionary history to persist in mammals. One could therefore postulate that this rudimentary form of itch potentially evolved from existing pain-transducing molecular and neural machinery as a means to differentiate high- and low-intensity noxious stimuli for which an alternative behavioral response was more appropriate. While data from only two species is not sufficient to declare that our proposed mechanism is evolutionarily conserved, we hope that our findings provide a springboard for future research into pruritus across multiple taxa, which would help elucidate the evolutionary development of this important sense.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our work demonstrates that IMQ can directly activate TRPA1 to elicit pruritic behavioral responses in both the zebrafish and mouse. Furthermore, we have shown that the immune receptor TLR7 does not mediate somatosensory neuronal responses to IMQ. Our results imply that in both species a subset of highly sensitive TRPA1-expressing itch-encoding neurons can respond to weaker TRPA1 agonists to encode sensations of itch and elicit discrete itch behaviors. More intense stimuli, such as those that evoke nocifensive behaviors, appear to recruit this highly-sensitive subset as well as less-sensitive TRPA1-expressing neurons. Our finding that IMQ responsive neurons in the mouse are part of a TRPA1-expressing subpopulation that is activated by other TRPA1 dependent pruritogens provides further evidence that these more sensitive neurons indeed signal itch. Parallel observations between the zebrafish and mouse suggest that this relatively simple mechanism for conveying, and distinguishing between, pruritic and algogenic stimuli originated early in vertebrate evolution and appears to be preserved in mammals. In sum, our results support the existence of a population-coding based strategy through which differential activation of TRPA1-expressing somatosensory neurons with high or low sensitivities to TRPA1 agonists can relay the discrete sensations of itch and pain respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry</title><p>Adult Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio)</italic> were raised with constant filtration, temperature control (28.5 ± 2°C), illumination (14 hr:10 hr light-dark cycle, lights on at 9:00 AM), and feeding.

All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and the International Association for the Study of Pain, and were approved by the Animal Studies Committee at Washington University School of Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell lines</title><p>HEK 293T cell stocks were initially purchased from ATCC, which authenticated their identity via STR profiling.

Larvae were anesthetized with tricaine, and placed in individual PCR tubes with a small quantity of E2 media. An equivalent amount of a 2X base solution made from a 50x stock (1.25 M NaOH, 10 mM EDTA pH 12) was then added to each tube, and all tubes were incubated at 95°C for 30 min. Following this, 1x neutralization solution (again made from from a 50x solution, 2M Tris-HCl pH 5) was added, and the resulting DNA solutions were stored at −20°C. Adult genomic DNA was extracted using similar methods, but with a few minor modifications. Individual fish were anesthetized with tricaine, and a small portion of the tail fin was removed with a scalpel and placed into an individual PCR tube. 1X base solution was then applied to the piece of tissue, which was incubated for 30 min at 95°C until an equivalent amount of 1X neutralization solution was added.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Nonsense mutant generation</title><p>Nonsense mutants for both <italic>trpa1b</italic> and <italic>tlr7</italic> were generated essentially as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shah et al., 2016</xref>). To synthesize the template DNA required for the in vitro transcription we employed a two oligo PCR method, one oligo contained the RNA loop structure required for recognition by the Cas9 enzyme and had the sequence 5'[gatccgcaccgactcggtgccactttttcaagttgataacggactagccttattttaacttgctatttctagctctaaaac]3'. The second, gene specific, oligo had the sequence 5'[aattaatacgactcactata(N20)gttttagagctagaaatagc]3’, where (N20) refers to the 20 nucleotide oligo that binds the genome. In the case of the <italic>trpa1b</italic> nonsense mutants the N20 oligo was 5’[GGCGTATAAATACATGCCAC]3’. In the case of the <italic>tlr7</italic> nonsense mutant the N20 oligo was 5’[GGGGATGTAGGACAAGTTGT]3’. A mixture of 400 μL of Cas9-encoding mRNA and 200 ng/μL of the proper sgRNA was injected into zebrafish embryos of the AB background at the one cell stage.</p><p>Fish were then screened for mutations using the following primers, <italic>tlr7</italic> 5’ GGATGCGTTTATGCTGCTTGACAA, <italic>tlr7</italic> 3’ AATGTTGTTGTTGTACAGGTAGAGCTC, <italic>trpa1b</italic> 5’-CTCATACATTCATAAACCTGCCTGATAT, and <italic>trpa1b</italic> 3’ – TGGAGGGGCGTCAGACCCTTT, and Sanger Sequencing.</p><p>We identified two nonsense mutants for <italic>trpa1b</italic>, one that possessed a 4 bp insertion and one that possessed a 7 bp deletion. We then outcrossed these founders (F0) to WT fish of the same genetic background (AB line) and screened for germline transmission in the F1 generation. Members of the F1 generation were additionally backcrossed to WT fish to establish an F2 generation. Heterozygous F2 zebrafish were then crossed to each other to produce an F3 generation that was used for experiments; additionally F2 zebrafish were crossed to transgenics expressing calcium indicator proteins (CaMPARI, GCaMP) under neuronal promoters in order to perform functional imaging studies. In some instances, F3 zebrafish were backcrossed a fourth time to establish younger generations of fish. Animals that were homozygous for either the 4 bp insertion or 7 bp deletion possessed identical phenotypes (i.e., lack of behavioral response to AITC). Likewise, zebrafish with a 4 bp/7 bp phenotype possessed an identical phenotype as 4 bp/4 bp and 7 bp/7 bp homozygotes.</p><p>We identified one nonsense mutant for <italic>tlr7</italic> that possessed a 1 bp deletion. As with the generation of the <italic>trpa1b</italic> mutant line, this founder was outcrossed to a WT fish and the offspring were screened for germline transmission. Subsequent generations were backcrossed in the manner described above.</p><p>In the <italic>trpa1b</italic> experiments, WT siblings of <italic>trpa1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish were used as the controls. In the <italic>tlr7</italic> experiments, a pure <italic>tlr7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> line was established and compared to age-matched WT fish, since we were unable to genotype the 1 bp mutation via conventional methods (gel electrophoresis, HRMA) and could only identify the mutation via sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Larval zebrafish behavior</title><p>At 5dpf, larval zebrafish (AB background) were placed into individual wells on a 96-well mesh bottom plate (Millipore, Burlington, MA) resting in a bath of E2 medium. The 96-well plate was then transferred to a hot plate that was maintained at a constant temperature of 28.5°C. Then the 96-well plate was moved from the E2 medium bath to the experimental bath for four minutes, during which the behavioral response of the larval zebrafish was recorded with a HD camcorder (Canon, Japan). Experiments were performed blindly and each larva’s total locomotive behavioral response was tracked using Ethovision (Noldus, Netherlands). Statistical analysis was done using an analysis of variance (Graphpad Prism 6) or Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. All experimental compounds were purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise noted and were made up in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and E2 medium.</p><p>In experiments involving nonsense mutants and their WT siblings, all larvae were genotyped following video capture of the behavioral response. Briefly, each larva was removed from its well and placed into a PCR tube in 25 μL of E2 media. gDNA was extracted using the base extraction technique described above. For experiments involving <italic>trpa1b</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fish, all larvae were genotyped by HRMA (CFX Connect, BioRad, Hercules, CA) using the primers 5’-CTCATACATTCATAAACCTGCCTGATAT and 3’-TGGAGGGGCGTCAGACCCTTT. As mentioned previously, due to difficulties in genotyping the 1 bp deletion in <italic>tlr7</italic> nonsense mutants, animals were identified by genomic sequencing, and a pure <italic>tlr7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> was created for use in behavioral experiments and were compared to AB fish.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Examining neuronal activation with CaMPARI transgenic zebrafish</title><p><italic>elavl3</italic>:CaMPARI zebrafish in the Casper background were simultaneously exposed to chemical stimuli and a 405 nm light in order to permanently photoconvert active neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fosque et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, 3dpf larval zebrafish were paralysed by injecting α-bungarotoxin protein (Sigma) into the chest cavity using microinjection needles pulled on a Flaming-Brown Micropipette Puller (model P-87, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) and a Picrosprizter II microinjection apparatus (General Valve Corporation, Fairfield, NJ). Paralysed fish were then placed in small glass-bottomed dishes (Wilco Wells, Netherlands) filled with an individual chemical from the pruritic screen and allowed to incubate for 2 min. Following this incubation period, glass-bottomed dishes were placed on the stage of an inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Japan, model Ix81S1F-3) and the larvae were exposed to a 405 nm light for 40 s using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Post-exposure fish were removed from the chemical and placed in a petri dish filled with embryo media and tricaine to prevent any future activation of sensory neurons. Immediately prior to imaging, larvae were mounted on coverslips in 1.5% agarose +tricaine in EM. TG and surrounding neural tissue were imaged using a 20x lens on an LSM 880 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Zen Black software was used to scan through the entire TG, acquiring a 1024 × 1024 pixel image slice at every ~5 µm that could then be stacked in the Z plane until the entire ganglion was imaged. Images were examined for photoconverted (red-labeled) neurons, and totals were established for each TG in each condition. When used, ANOVA statistical tests were done against control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Adult zebrafish behavior</title><p>Adult zebrafish were placed in traps (Thoren Caging Systems) and were transported to the experimental area, which was maintained at 28.5 ± 2°C, where they were left to acclimate for one hour. After completing acclimation fish were transported one at a time to the injection area. Each fish was anaesthetized by exposure to 12.0 ± 0.3°C system water. They were then immobilized and injected in the upper lip using a 33 gauge Hamilton needle and 20 μL Hamilton syringe. Fish were injected with 10 μL of experimental or control solution, all of which were made up in 1% DMSO, 1x PBS, and distilled water. After injection, fish were placed into a trap and transferred to the recording area. The behavioral response was recorded for five minutes using an HD camcorder (Cannon). The velocity of the fish was then analyzed using Ethovision (Noldus) and all facial interactions were manually scored to prevent any bias in the data. All analysis was blinded. All statistical analysis were done with an analysis of variance (Graphpad Prism 6) or Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test.</p><p>In the case of nonsense mutant experiments, after the behavioral responses were captured, each fish was euthanized by tricaine overdose and fin clipped, and the fin section was placed in a PCR tube. Then, gDNA was extracted from the excised tissue using the previously described base extraction technique. <italic>Trpa1b </italic>genotype was determined using the same HRMA strategy as employed in the larval behavioral experiments. Since a homozygous <italic>tlr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> line was employed for adult behavioral experiments, genotyping post-experiment was unnecessary.

Larvae were hybridized with DIG-labeled riboprobes for <italic>trpa1b</italic> or <italic>tlr7</italic> overnight at 65°C. They then underwent a series of stringent washes, followed by incubation in α-DIG conjugated Fab fragments (Roche, Switzerland, 1:10,000) and staining in NBT/BCIP solution. Larvae were washed with PBTw and stored in glycerol until imaging, whereupon they were mounted in 100% glycerol and photographed using an upright Axioplan2 microscope (Zeiss).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Calcium imaging with <italic>elavl3</italic>:GCaMP transgenic zebrafish</title><p>3dpf zebrafish larvae from either <italic>elavl3</italic>:GCaMP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>) or <italic>elavl3</italic>:H2BGCaMP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) transgenic line were paralysed as described above. After paralysis, larvae were mounted in 2% agarose in EM on coverslips, which were then placed into a perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments). Once solidified, the agarose immediately surrounding the head was cut away with a scalpel to ensure maximal exposure to chemical stimuli. The perfusion chamber was placed onto the stage of an Olympus Fluoview FV-1000 multiphoton microscope equipped with an infrared laser controlled by Mai Tai software (Spectra-Physics, Thermo Electron Corporation, Walthom, MA). Larvae were imaged under the following parameters: laser wavelength of 880 nm, resolution of 4.0 µs/pixel, frame rate of 1–3 s per frame, frame size of 512 × 512 pixels. Laser intensity, HV, and zoom were optimized for individual larva. For experiments comparing multiple stimuli, each stimulus was separated by an equivalent period of E2 media washout.

All experiments were performed in compliance with institutional animal care and use committee standards and experiments were performed essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kimball et al., 2015</xref>). Dissociation and culturing of mouse DRG neurons were performed as described with the following modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Story et al., 2003</xref>). Dissected DRGs were dissociated by incubation for 1 hr at 37°C in a solution of culture medium [Ham’s F12/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% horse serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)] containing 0.125% collagenase (Worthington Biochemicals, Lakewood, NJ), followed by a 30 min incubation in 10 ml of culture media plus 1.25 units of papain. Calcium imaging was performed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Story et al., 2003</xref>). Growth media was supplemented with 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor. For experiments involving heterologous expression, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were transiently transfected with one or two of the following plasmid constructs: zebrafish <italic>trpa1b</italic>, zebrafish <italic>tlr7</italic>, mouse <italic>Trpa1</italic>, mouse <italic>Tlr7</italic>, human <italic>TRPA1</italic>, and/or human <italic>TLR7</italic>. All constructs except for the one encoding zebrafish <italic>tlr7</italic> were also co-transfected with pIRES-eGFP plasmid in order to estimate transfection efficiency. (For zebrafish <italic>tlr7</italic>, this step was unnecessary because the construct was already in the pIRES-eGFP vector.) The buffer solution for all experiments was 10 mM HEPES in 1X Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).</p><p>The threshold for activation was defined as 30% above baseline for both DRG and heterologous expression experiments. Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used for all statistical calculations. All averaged traces represent mean ± s.e.m.

Briefly, HEK 293T cells were seeded at ~80% confluency in individual wells of a 24-well plate (N ≈ 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well) and transiently transfected with the same zebrafish, mouse, or human <italic>Tlr7</italic> constructs as employed in calcium imaging following a standard lipofectamine protocol. All cells were also co-transfected with a nF-kB Firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (p1242 3x-KB-L, Addgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mitchell and Sugden, 1995</xref>]), a Renilla luciferase control plasmid (p207-CMV-Renilla, gift from Tom Reh), and pIRES-eGFP (if necessary) for estimating transfection efficiency. As a negative control, another set of HEK 293T cells were transfected only with pIRES-eGFP. Twenty-four hours following transfection, the culture media was removed from all cells and replaced with normal serum-free media or with serum-free media containing 200 μM loxoribine. Following a 24 hr treatment period, culture media was removed, plated cells were rinsed briefly with DPBS, then lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega) and gentle agitation on a multi-purpose rotator (Barnstead, Hampton, NH). Lysates were analyzed on a Viktor3 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA), which generated luminescence values in CPS (counts per second) for both Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity. Assays were also performed on 1X PLB samples to estimate background luminescence. Background luminescence was subtracted from each measurement, and the Firefly/Renilla CPS ratio was calculated for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Immunohistochemistry on HEK 293T cells</title><p> To verify that TLR7 was being expressed by HEK 293T cells used in our experiments, we transfected cells on coverslips with either mouse or human <italic>Tlr7</italic> constructs and pIRES-eGFP; some cells were only transfected with pIRES-eGFP to serve as a negative control. 48 hr following transfection, cell culture media was removed, and coverslips were washed briefly with 1X DPBS and fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Coverslips were again rinsed briefly in DBPS and then blocked in 10% goat serum in 1X PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies against TLR7 (rabbit anti-TLR7, Boster, Pleasanton, CA, 1:250) and GFP (chick anti-GFP, 1:1000, Invitrogen) were made in PBST with 10% goat serum and applied to the coverslips, which were incubated overnight at 4°C. Coverslips were then rinsed 3X in PBST to remove primary antibodies, treated with secondary antibodies (AlexaFluor goat anti-chicken 488 and AlexaFluor goat anti-rabbit 568, both at 1:1000, Life Technologies and Invitrogen, respectively) for approximately 2 hr at room temperature, washed in PBST, and mounted on slides with DAPI-containing Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Diana Bautista (Reviewer #1). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Editor has drafted this decision. The reviewers were interested in the topic, but had a number of concerns, some more serious than others, and some of which will require additional experiments.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and thoughtful study examining itch in zebrafish. The authors first performed a screen to identify pruritogens that activate the zebrafish trigeminal ganglia and show that imiquimod triggers calcium influx in these neurons. They also show that imiquimod injection into the lip triggers a novel behavioral response, namely lip rubbing. TRPA1, but not TLR7, mediated the cellular and behavioral responses to imiquimod, and zebrafish, mouse and human TRPA1 channels were directly activated by imiquimod. However, Trpa1 is expressed in a large number of nociceptive neurons and produces pain as well as itch responses. The authors propose that imiquimod and AITC differentially activate subsets of Trpa1-expressing neurons such that at low concentrations it produces itch occurs with low concentrations and nociception at high concentrations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear how many pruritogens were tested in the CaMPARI screen.

How long does the behavior persist? Figure 1K shows representative responses to 10uM AITC and 10uM imiquimod.

Liu et al. state that loxoribine does induce a dose-dependent, TLR7-dependent itch in mice. But their actual data show that scratching is very transient and only statistically significant for a first few minutes following injection. Were loxorobine-evoked behavioral and calcium imaging experiments performed such that a rapid response would be detected? If so, please report the response, or lack of response, during the first few minutes following injection.</p><p>4) It is interesting that mouse and human TLR7 is activated by both imiquimod and loxoribine but that fish TLR7 is only sensitive to imiquimod. Are there other differences in the zebrafish response to TLR7 agonists, such as the natural ligand ssRNA? This is worthy of discussion given that the mechanisms are unknown by which parasite infection of fish triggers natural behaviors to remove the parasite (e.g., visiting cleaning stations, rubbing against coral). TLRs are proposed to be one mechanism by which fish respond to parasite infection, but few studies have addressed this topic in detail. A short discussion of previous work on infection, natural fish behaviors and TLRs would expand the scope of the study.</p><p>5) A general mechanism for discrimination of itch from pain is proposed. Although the evidence is mostly consistent for the proposed (see, my major reservations below), it was not convincing that this is the principle mechanism by which most itch agents are discriminated from nociceptive stimuli. Experiments showing that other pruritogens are discriminated via the same proposed mechanism would be needed. At the least, discussion of alternative mechanisms is necessary.</p><p>6) Assuming zebrafish have mast cells, the authors should discuss why histamine and serotonin do not elicit itch-behavior in fish. Also, data from two species does not seem to be enough to claim that the mechanism is evolutionary conserved. This claim should be toned down.</p><p>7) The behavioral experiments performed in fish, with different doses of AITC need to be performed in mice, i.e. the proposed mechanism would predict that low doses of AITC should elicit scratching in mice, while higher doses would provoke nociferous responses. This is not a difficult experiment and is a test of the authors' proposed mechanism.</p><p>8) The data that the zebrafish Trpa1 is the imiquimod receptor in vivo and in vitro is strong, however the behavioral results for mouse Trpa1 is weak. First, at the doses of IMQ used in mice, only small numbers of scratch-responses are elicited. Second, Trpa1-null mice, compared to wild-type mice, only showed a 50% reduction in responses (not the same as the almost complete loss seen in fish). What is the result at higher doses of IMQ in mice? The presented results suggest that there are additional IMQ receptors in mice that contribute to scratching responses.</p><p>9) The authors suggest that selective subsets of Trpa1-neurons are activated, but provide little direct evidence for this proposal. The authors should investigate if other known mouse itch-inducing agents activate the same neurons as IMQ. This experiment could be performed relatively quickly.</p><p>10) More information about the CRISPR mutants and additional validation would be appreciated. How many times were the mutants backcrossed? Were multiple alleles identified, and did they have the same phenotype? Can the mutant phenotype be rescued by expressing wild type TrpA1b?

They also show that in heterologous cells, expression of TrpA1b, but not TLR7, confers a response to IMQ, albeit more weakly than AITC. These results lead the authors to propose that TrpA1b is the direct sensor of IMQ, rather than a channel downstream of a GPCR. The fact that TrpA1b can be directly activated is compelling, but the results do not exclude the possibility that there is another receptor in vivo.

This finding could be strengthened further by addressing the same question with calcium imaging in zebrafish larvae- i.e. are the same trigeminal neurons that respond to IMQ also those responsive to low TrpA1 concentrations?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32036.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear how many pruritogens were tested in the CaMPARI screen.

The sentence in the text was intended to cite Kim et al., 2011 (not Liu et al., 2010), and has since been corrected. Kim et al. (Kim et al., 2011) performed similar experiments as Liu et al., but did not find any increase in scratching behavior when mice were injected with loxoribine, in line with what we observed in the zebrafish. However, the reviewer addresses an important issue regarding the time course of behavioral experiments. According to Liu et al., loxoribine only evokes a statistically significant increase in mouse scratching behavior within the first five minutes following injection. In all of our behavioral experiments with adult zebrafish, fish were filmed immediately after injection for 5 minutes. Therefore, we would assume that our behavioral assay was temporally sensitive enough to capture even transient, rapid responses to loxoribine. That we did not observe any immediate responses to loxoribine indicates that it likely has no effect on zebrafish. Larval zebrafish behavior was conducted on similar timescale, as recording began immediately after the mesh-bottomed plate containing zebrafish larvae was lowered into the chemical to be tested. We would therefore expect that our larval behavioral screen has the capacity to capture brief, transient responses to loxoribine. While we did not performin vivo GCaMP calcium imaging on larval zebrafish with loxoribine, our CaMPARI experiments would be able to capture immediate neuronal responses. In these experiments, photoconversion was performed while the larvae were still in the stimulus bath; as such, there was no temporal “gap” between stimulus exposure and photoconversion of active neurons. Given a lack of response to loxoribine under all of these experimental conditions, especially when coupled with our data from the dual luciferase assay indicating that loxoribine did not activate zebrafish TLR7, we concluded that loxoribine has no behavioral or neuronal effects on the zebrafish.</p><p>While we intended for our reference to the Kim et al. paper (Kim et al., 2011) to highlight the similarities of our results in the zebrafish with previous findings in the mouse, and not to necessarily compare our results in mice to these previous findings, it is of note that our calcium imaging experiments with dissociated mouse DRGs would also be sufficient to capture a transient loxoribine response. All of our DRG calcium imaging experiments were performed in real time – i.e., neurons were imaged while chemicals were being perfused across them – and thus we would expect that any immediate responses could be captured. We did not perform any loxoribine behavioral experiments in mice, and so cannot comment on the response/lack thereof following injection.</p><p>It should also be noted that the experiments performed by Kim et al. were binned in 5 minute increments, like the experiments performed by Liu et al. Therefore, we would expect that their assay had identical temporal sensitivity, and would have been able to capture the transient loxoribine responses Liu et al. observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is interesting that mouse and human TLR7 is activated by both imiquimod and loxoribine but that fish TLR7 is only sensitive to imiquimod.

A short discussion of previous work on infection, natural fish behaviors and TLRs would expand the scope of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion that we more thoroughly probe this topic, and as requested, we have expanded upon our discussion of what is known about TLRs and immune responses to infection in teleost fish. Examining the indirect role of TLR7 at promoting endogenous itch in fish would be a very interesting basis for future studies, but was outside the scope of ours. While we found several studies that examined that implicated TLRs in innate immune responses in several fish species (for example, TLRs are upregulated following infection, and TLR activation is associated with proliferation of peripheral blood leukocytes, inhibition of viral replication, and the induction of interferon genes), we were unable to find studies that focused specifically on the link between natural fish behaviors and immune stimulation. We hope that our modifications (Discussion, ninth paragraph) adequately address the reviewer’s concerns. Additionally, this suggestion has brought to light that we could have been more clear in explaining the results of the dual luciferase assay, as we found that zebrafish TLR7 did not respond to either imiquimod or loxoribine, while both human and mouse TLR7 did. We have since rephrased our text to emphasize that zebrafish TLR7 does not respond to these TLR7 agonists. However, we recognize that due to a lack of a positive control, we cannot verify that zebrafish TLR7 was indeed functional or expressed properly in our assay, and have elaborated upon this caveat in the third paragraph of the subsection “Imiquimod directly activates TRPA1”.</p><p>“In the zebrafish, however, TLR7 is unlikely to contribute even indirectly to IMQ-induced itch sensation, as we observed no behavioral phenotype in TLR7-/- animals, and found no evidence that TLR7 is even responsive to typical mammalian TLR7 agonists, like loxoribine and IMQ. […] While our results suggest that TLR7 is not involved in transducing IMQ-evoked itch in the zebrafish, investigating the role of immune responses in mediating somatosensations (both in zebrafish and other species) would be an interesting route for future exploration.”</p><p>“However, due to a lack of a TLR7 positive control, we were unable to confirm that TLR7 was functional in our heterologous expression system. With this caveat in mind, the lack of zTLR7 response to these TLR7 agonists lends further credence to the conclusion that TLR7 is not involved in somatosensory neuronal activation or behavior in this species.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A general mechanism for discrimination of itch from pain is proposed. Although the evidence is mostly consistent for the proposed (see, my major reservations below), it was not convincing that this is the principle mechanism by which most itch agents are discriminated from nociceptive stimuli. Experiments showing that other pruritogens are discriminated via the same proposed mechanism would be needed. At the least, discussion of alternative mechanisms is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. To recap, the mechanism we posit for the discrimination of itch from pain is a population coding model in which low intensity TRPA1 agonists activate a selective subset of highly sensitive TRPA1-expressing neurons and high intensity TRPA1 agonists activates both this selective subset as well as another population of less-sensitive neurons. This bears some similarity to “labeled line” coding mechanisms proposed by others, in which a subset of neurons that express pruritic GPCRs and itch-specific neuropeptides convey itch (Bautista, Wilson and Hoon, 2014; Hoon, 2015; Ross, 2011; Goswami et al., 2014; Ma, 2010). In the context of somatosensations provoked by direct TRPA1 channel agonists, we feel that our evidence largely supports such a model, as opposed to other mechanisms (i.e., an intensity coding strategy). As we did not investigate other compounds known to elicit both itch and pain depending upon factors such as stimulus concentration and method of application (Hoon, 2015), however, we cannot claim that this is the universal mechanism through which itch and pain are distinguished. We did not mean to imply that our proposed mechanism was the only method for itch and pain discrimination, and we hope that our modifications to the text have clarified this point. We have amended our Discussion section to emphasize the point that our mechanism may not be applicable to every scenario, and have made efforts throughout the paper to specify that our mechanism refers to TRPA1-expressing neurons being activated by TRPA1 agonists.</p><p>“We however do not mean to imply that other pruritogens selectively evoke itch or pain by activating pruriceptors and/or nociceptors in a dose-dependent manner. Our proposed model clearly is not the sole mechanism by which itch is coded as a distinct sensation from pain (Bautista, Wilson and Hoon, 2014; Hoon, 2015; Ross, 2011; Goswami et al., 2014; Ma, 2010).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Assuming zebrafish have mast cells, the authors should discuss why histamine and serotonin do not elicit itch-behavior in fish.

This claim should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thought-provoking question, and have followed through upon the reviewer’s suggestion to discuss this topic more thoroughly. We have expanded our previous few sentences in the Discussion to include a more detailed explanation of zebrafish mast cell physiology (e.g., describing that zebrafish mast cells do not appear to contain histamine or serotonin) and the implications that this may have on itch behavior. Additionally, we have also emphasized the possibility that while zebrafish possess serotonin and histamine receptors, these receptors may not be expressed on somatosensory neurons, precluding their involvement in pruritic sensation (Discussion, eleventh paragraph). The reviewer also points out that data from two species is insufficient to declare that a mechanism is “evolutionarily conserved”. We agree, and have toned down our claims accordingly (Discussion, last paragraph).</p><p>Mast Cells: “We observed that out of the several mammalian pruritogens, only IMQ elicited behavioral and neuronal responses in zebrafish. […] It is therefore plausible that in the zebrafish, histamine and serotonin do not play a functional role in pruritic sensation or immune responses, but are restricted to more central processes such as mediating sleep-wakefulness cycles, mood, and anxiety (Pei et al., 2016; Sackerman, 2010).”</p><p>Conclusion: “The direct activation of a TRP channel to elicit itch or pain through the recruitment of distinct populations of somatosensory neurons via stimulus sensitivity is mechanistically simple. […] While data from only two species is not sufficient to declare that our proposed mechanism is evolutionarily conserved, we hope that our findings provide a springboard for future research into pruritus across multiple taxa, which would help elucidate the evolutionary development of this important sense.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The behavioral experiments performed in fish, with different doses of AITC need to be performed in mice, i.e. the proposed mechanism would predict that low doses of AITC should elicit scratching in mice, while higher doses would provoke nociferous responses.

We have since performed these experiments, and our findings demonstrate that low dose AITC (50 mM) produces significant scratching behavior with no appreciable wiping behavior (p &lt; 0.001 and N.S. respectively), while a stronger AITC stimulus (100 mM) results in a significant attenuation of the observed scratching behavior, as well as a significant wiping behavior (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001 respectively). These results have been included in Figure 5..It is not clear why we observed scratch-specific behaviors at AITC concentrations higher than those reported by others to predominantly elicit nocifensive wiping behaviors (Robertson et al., 2013; Akiyama, Carstens and Carstens, 2010).</p><p>“Finally, in accordance with our zebrafish data, we observed that AITC stimulus intensity dictates whether mice exhibit pruritic or nocifensive behaviors. […] We observed that AITC (50 mM) produces significant scratching behavior with no appreciable wiping behavior (p &lt; 0.001 and N.S. respectively), while a higher dose of AITC (100 mM) results in a significant attenuation of the observed scratching behavior, as well as a significant wiping behavior (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001 respectively) (Figure 5I).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The data that the zebrafish Trpa1 is the imiquimod receptor in vivo and in vitro is strong, however the behavioral results for mouse Trpa1 is weak.

What is the result at higher doses of IMQ in mice? The presented results suggest that there are additional IMQ receptors in mice that contribute to scratching responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the possibility of additional IMQ receptors, and a non-TRPA1 dependent mechanism for mediating IMQ-induced itch, is present in the mouse. To explore this possibility further, we performed experiments in which a higher dose of IMQ (50 μg) was applied to both WT and TRPA1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. At this concentration we observed increased scratching behavior in wild type animals that did not differ from TRPA1 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. These data have been included in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Higher concentrations of IMQ likely produce this result via an indirect mechanism, potentially through a TLR7 mediated pathway, a possibility that is addressed in our reply to Essential revision #12. We find it unlikely that an alternate pruritic GPCR exists given the overlap we observed between neurons activated by IMQ and low concentrations of AITC, which is also discussed further in our reply to Essential revision #12. Additionally, we would like to clarify that we observed an ~8-fold increase in scratch behavior with IMQ (10 μg) compared to controls, and would argue that this is not a small response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors suggest that selective subsets of Trpa1-neurons are activated, but provide little direct evidence for this proposal.

We have expanded our explanation of these experiments in the Discussion section, and have likewise clarified how equivalent experiments are impossible in the zebrafish due to a lack of responses to other pruritogens. Our findings that subsequent pulses of IMQ activate the same neurons in a non-stochastic manner (Figure 4—figure supplement 2, see also our response to Essential revision #11), further support our claim that this is a defined subpopulation of TRPA1 neurons.</p><p>“Furthermore, in the mouse, we observed that the vast majority of IMQ (100 μM) responsive neurons also responded to the TRPA1-dependent pruritogens chloroquine and deoxycholic acid, supporting the conclusion that these neurons constitute a pruritic subpopulation.

How many times were the mutants backcrossed? Were multiple alleles identified, and did they have the same phenotype? Can the mutant phenotype be rescued by expressing wild type TrpA1b? In most experiments wt was used as the control; why weren't heterozygous siblings used?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern about the generation and validation of our CRISPR mutants, and have provided more information in the Materials and methods section of our paper. It should be noted that in all behavioral experiments, fish were genotyped after completion of the experiment. While we did not find any evidence of gene dosage effects – i.e., we found no significant difference in AITC response between WT and heterozygous siblings – we restricted our comparisons to wildtype siblings because that seemed to be the most stringent approach. These results are comparable to those obtained by Prober et al. (Prober et al., 2008), who used the TILLING approach to generate mutants. In their study, they observed normal AITC responses in both TRPA1b homozygous wildtype fish as well as their heterozygous siblings. When generating these mutants, we did not perform experiments exploring whether the mutant phenotype can be rescued by expressing wildtype TRPA1b due to technical constraints. We do not have a way to effectively re-institute TRPA1 expression specifically in TRPA1 neurons. While injecting TRPA1 mRNA into a zebrafish embryo would initially seem like a viable procedure, we could not ensure specificity of expression. Additionally, given that mRNA injections are performed early in development (i.e., at the 1-cell stage), the mRNA expression would not last until 5dpf, the age at which we performed all of our behavioral screens due to mRNA degradation and protein turnover.</p><p>“We identified two nonsense mutants for TRPA1, one that possessed a 4bp insertion and one that possessed a 7bp deletion.

We have performed the suggested experiments to image responses to IMQ at different times and determine whether the same neurons are activated each time. We found that nearly all of IMQ responsive neurons respond to multiple pulses of IMQ, arguing that this is a defined population of neurons and that IMQ responses are not determined stochastically. We have modified both the Results and Discussion sections of the paper to include this new information, and have added an additional figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Results: “To verify that IMQ activates a selective subset of TRPA1+ neurons as opposed to activating TRPA1+ neurons stochastically, we performed calcium imaging experiments in which 3dpf <italic>elavl3</italic>:H2BGCaMP6 were exposed to successive pulses of 100 μM IMQ.

They also show that in heterologous cells, expression of TrpA1b, but not TLR7, confers a response to IMQ, albeit more weakly than AITC. These results lead the authors to propose that TrpA1b is the direct sensor of IMQ, rather than a channel downstream of a GPCR. The fact that TrpA1b can be directly activated is compelling, but the results do not exclude the possibility that there is another receptor in vivo. This issue should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful suggestion of discussing this issue more thoroughly, and have provided an additional paragraph in the Discussion section exploring the possibility of IMQ-evoked itch mediated by an unknown co-receptor. While the existence of an alternate IMQ-binding co-receptor is possible, we feel that this is improbable. First, results from our in vitro experiments necessitate that such a receptor would be endogenously expressed in HEK cells in order to couple with TRPA1 and evoke calcium flux, as we did not observe any response to IMQ in cells that were not transfected with TRPA1. This seems unlikely. Secondly, results from experiments in which we modified the stimulus intensity similarly make this possibility unlikely. The overlap we observed in the number of neurons that were responsive to IMQ and low-dose AITC similarly implies that the same receptor on these neurons was activated under these two conditions. If a neuron has two distinct ways of being activated by IMQ (either directly through TRPA1 or through the coupling of TRPA1 to a mystery co-receptor), we would not expect the neuronal recruitment to scale with stimulus intensity the way we observed.</p><p>Additionally, we have also elaborated upon the possibility of “indirect itch” that could occur when pruriceptors are activated indirectly as a result of an immune response generated via activation of TLR7 and/or other immune receptors. We think that these mechanisms most certainly exist, and are likely responsible for our observations that IMQ-induced scratching behavior is not entirely abolished in TRPA1<sup>-/-</sup> animals, and that IMQ-induced scratching behavior is identical between TRPA1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and their wildtype siblings at higher concentrations of IMQ (also discussed in our response to Essential revision #8; the indirect role of TLRs in fish responses are also discussed in our response to Essential revision #4). At such high concentrations, mechanisms involving the direct activation of TRPA1 to evoke itch may be saturated, and additional increases in responses may result from the indirect stimulation via immune modulation. We hope that this addition adequately addresses the reviewer’s concerns.</p><p>“Our data implicates a mechanism for the direct activation of TRPA1 by IMQ to elicit sensations of itch in both zebrafish and mice. […] Furthermore, the dose-dependent overlap we observed in the number of neurons that were responsive to IMQ and AITC, as well as similarities in the dose dependent itch and nociceptive behaviors elicited by these compounds in both zebrafish and mice, implies that these compounds are acting via the direct activation of TRPA1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The fact that low concentrations of AITC activate a similar fraction of TrpA1b-expressing neurons in zebrafish larvae as IMQ is a nice finding supporting the authors' hypothesis that IMQ-expressing neurons are primed for TrpA1 activation.

This finding could be strengthened further by addressing the same question with calcium imaging in zebrafish larvae- i.e. are the same trigeminal neurons that respond to IMQ also those responsive to low TrpA1 concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>We realize that we may not have been explicit as necessary in our original text, but we did perform imaging experiments in which we sequentially applied IMQ, a low concentration of AITC (10 μM), and a high concentration of AITC (50 μM) to 3dpf <italic>elavl3</italic>:GCaMP5 zebrafish larvae. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C. We show that the population of IMQ+ neurons is entirely contained within the population of neurons responding to low AITC concentrations, which is itself within a broader population of neurons that are activated by high concentrations of AITC. From this data, it can be extrapolated that IMQ responding neurons are enriched within the population of neurons that respond to low AITC levels.

Together, this provides further evidence of the greater sensitivity of a population of itch-encoding neurons to TRPA1 agonists.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
