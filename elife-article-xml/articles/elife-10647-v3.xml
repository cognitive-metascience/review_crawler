The processes that modulate SOX2 activity to promote pluripotency are not well understood. Here, we show SOX2 is <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modified in its transactivation domain during reprogramming and in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Upon induction of differentiation SOX2 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation at serine 248 is decreased. Replacing wild type with an <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 (S248A) increases reprogramming efficiency. ESCs with <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 exhibit alterations in gene expression. This change correlates with altered protein-protein interactions and genomic occupancy of the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 compared to wild type. In addition, SOX2 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation impairs the SOX2-PARP1 interaction, which has been shown to regulate ESC self-renewal. These findings show that SOX2 activity is modulated by <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc, and provide a novel regulatory mechanism for this crucial pluripotency transcription factor.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10647.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10647.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10647.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Embryos develop from stem cells, which have the ability to mature into any type of cell in the body. The activity of proteins called transcription factors determines whether a stem cell will become a specialized cell type or remain in an immature “pluripotent” state that has the potential to become any cell type. These transcription factors bind to the cell’s DNA to regulate the activity of target genes.</p><p>SOX2 is a transcription factor that helps to maintain embryonic stem cells in a pluripotent state. In 2011, a group of researchers showed that a specific sugar molecule was added to SOX2 in mouse embryonic stem cells, in a process called <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation. Now, Myers, Peddada et al. – including the researchers who performed the 2011 study – have studied the effects of this SOX2 modification in more detail.</p><p>Transcription factors have two major activities – they bind to DNA and recruit other proteins that can turn target genes on or off. Myers, Peddada et al. found that, in pluripotent stem cells, a complex pattern of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation is present on SOX2 in a region that is responsible for recruiting other proteins. In addition, SOX2 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation decreases when stem cells are directed to become a new cell type.</p><p>Further experiments investigated gene activity in stem cells that contained a mutant form of SOX2 that cannot be <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modified. In these cells, genes that help to maintain the cell in a pluripotent state were more active than in normal cells. The mutant form of SOX2 was altered in its ability to bind DNA and to associate with proteins that control gene activity.</p><p>Myers, Peddada et al.’s findings raise several questions. Does <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation control the activity of SOX2 in other cell types, such as neurons and cancer cells, in which this modification can be detected on SOX2? Why does a modification on the portion of the SOX2 that is thought to interact with other proteins affect SOX2 DNA binding activity? Finally, understanding how <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation is employed to regulate SOX2 activity in response to developmental cues remains a major challenge.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10647.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10647.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>SOX2</kwd><kwd>O-GlcNAc</kwd><kwd>pluripotency</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>electron transfer dissociation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIGMS P41GM103481</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burlingame</surname><given-names>Alma L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burlingame</surname><given-names>Alma L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIRM RB4-05990</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peddada</surname><given-names>Sailaja</given-names></name><name><surname>Chatterjee</surname><given-names>Nilanjana</given-names></name><name><surname>Panning</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005984</institution-id><institution>Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

Replacement of wild type SOX2 (SOX2<sup>WT</sup>) with an <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc-deficient mutant SOX2 (SOX2<sup>S248A</sup>) results in increased reprogramming efficiency. mESCs with SOX2<sup>S248A</sup> as their sole source of SOX2 have increased expression of genes associated with pluripotency and exhibit a decreased requirement for OCT4. SOX2<sup>S248A</sup> exhibits altered genomic occupancy and differential association with transcriptional regulatory complexes. <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation directly inhibits the SOX2 and PARP1 interaction, which plays a regulatory role in mESC pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lai et al., 2012</xref>).

Using an unbiased strategy for enrichment of native <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylated nuclear peptides, we previously identified SOX2 S248 as an OGT substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Myers et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we find that S248 is <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylated during somatic cell reprogramming and that mutation of this residue to alanine increases reprogramming efficiency. We also find mESCs expressing SOX2<sup>S248A</sup> exhibit changes in transcription consistent with increased expression of pluripotency promoting genes at the expense of differentiation promoting genes. Together, these analyses from both mESCs and during somatic cell reprogramming reveal the S248A mutation promotes SOX2 activity, which suggests SOX2 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation is inhibitory during maintenance and establishment of pluripotency.</p><p>Our data indicate that S248 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation is regulated by developmental signaling molecules, since removing LIF and adding RA to trigger differentiation resulted in a substantial decrease in this PTM. This decrease in S248 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation appears contradictory to the finding that the S248A mutation, which eliminates <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation, promotes mESC self-renewal. However, the effects of this, or any, PTM are likely to be context specific, and determined by the transcription factors and signaling molecules present in each cell type. GlcNAc-S248 may inhibit SOX2 activity in mESCs, where the decrease in this PTM may alter SOX2 activity upon differentiation, such that SOX2 functions appropriately for the changing cellular context. As this work shows, use of methods that allow analysis of SOX2 PTM-specific PPIs and genomic occupancy may be crucial to understand how combinations of PTMs are used to regulate SOX2 activity in response to developmental cues.</p><p>In addition to changes in gene expression, the S248A mutation altered SOX2 genomic distribution. As well as occupying the same sites as SOX2<sup>WT</sup>, SOX2<sup>S248A</sup> was found at an additional 1000 sites. The majority of these sites contained a predicted SOX2 binding motif, indicating the mutation allows SOX2<sup>S248A</sup> to occupy sites that SOX2<sup>WT</sup> is unable to access in mESCs. This result suggests <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation can regulate the affinity of SOX2 for its target sites. Since the mutation lies in the TAD, but affects the activity of the high mobility group DNA binding region, the mutation or loss of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation could affect secondary protein structure and/or PPIs. Single molecule imaging of SOX2 with a deleted TAD showed altered DNA occupancy and higher site-specific residence time, supporting the idea that TAD mutations affect SOX2 DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Upon OCT4 knockdown, fS248A-Tg mESCs did not exhibit as dramatic a change in colony morphology as fSOX2-Tg mESCs. In addition, the new sites of genomic occupancy seen in fS248A-Tg mESCs did not have nearby predicted OCT4 motifs. Together these results suggest the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 may exhibit an altered reliance on OCT4 for binding and regulation of gene expression. Further studies aimed at querying the effects of the S248A mutation on genome-wide OCT4 distribution should provide insight into whether this SOX2 PTM alters OCT4 association with target sequences, and may address if <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc impacts OCT4/SOX2 heterodimerization.</p><p>Our proteomic analyses indicated there are substantial differences in SOX2-centered PPIs in fS248A-Tg mESCs. Many of the proteins that exhibited differential interaction between wild type and mutant SOX2 are components of complexes implicated in chromatin regulation. These altered associations may underlie the transcriptional and genomic occupancy changes seen in the mutant mESCs. In addition, components of the PARP-XRCC and the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) complexes were enriched with SOX2<sup>S248A</sup>, suggesting the possibility that these complexes may function in transcriptional regulation in addition to DNA repair. Consistent with this hypothesis, DNA damage complexes promote mESC self-renewal and iPSC generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fong et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our PARP1 results are consistent with previous reports describing its interaction with SOX2 in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lai et al., 2012</xref>). In both these studies, differentiation of mESCs promotes the PARP1-SOX2 interaction. We found PARP1 interaction with SOX2 is disrupted by <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc and decreased GlcNAc-S248 in differentiating ESCs, consistent with a model in which the developmentally regulated decrease in S248 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation promotes PARP1 interaction. During differentiation, the SOX2-PARP1 interaction inhibits SOX2 binding to enhancers of genes that are necessary for self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lai et al., 2012</xref>). We find that SOX2<sup>S248A</sup> exhibits increased association with PARP1 without decreased occupancy of pluripotency genes under self-renewal conditions. This result indicates the SOX2-PARP1 interaction alone does not inhibit SOX2 binding to pluripotency gene targets and suggests additional developmentally regulated alterations in SOX2 PTMs or interaction partners contribute to control of SOX2 occupancy.</p><p>The increase in SOX2 S253 phosphorylation in fS248A-Tg mESCs suggests there is potential for crosstalk between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation in the TAD peptide in mESCs.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by three reviewers, and the evaluation was overseen by a Reviewing editor and Janet Rossant as Senior editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript is a very interesting study regarding the role of SOX2-S248 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation in the context of ESC differentiation and reprograming. The authors use several functional and genome/proteome-wide assays to investigate the role of <italic>O-</italic>GlcNac in pluripotency and reprogramming by focusing on the transcription factor SOX2.</p><p>Myers et al. follow up on their previous observation that the pluripotency factor SOX2 is <italic>O-</italic>GlcNac-modified at Ser-248 in mouse ESCs. Here, they show that <italic>O-</italic>GlcNac-modified SOX2 decreases with differentiation and increases during reprogramming into iPSCs. Ectopic expression of a mutant form of SOX2 that cannot be <italic>O-</italic>GlcNac-modified (S248A) in ESCs supports self-renewal, gives rise to less differentiated colonies and suppresses differentiation. Similarly, ectopic expression of S248A in combination with Oct4, Klf4and c-Myc gives rise to more iPSC colonies than OCT4, SOX2 (WT), Klf4 and c-Myc expression. The authors finally show that ESCs expressing SOX2 S248A form associate with ca. 1,000 loci that are different from WT SOX2 in ESCs and lack nearby OCT4 binding sites. Moreover, proteomic analysis suggests that the S248A form of SOX2 associates less efficiently with PARP1 and other proteins, thus providing a partial explanation for the differentiation defect of mutant ESCs. This study makes a number of interesting observations on a modification that has received a lot of attention in the stem cell field over the last few years. This is an interesting area and this approach is an important one. The manuscript should be acceptable for publication once the authors eliminate the weaknesses outlined below. Various concerns can be addressed by editing text and labels, and by clarifying experimental details in particular with respect to statistics/quantification/replicates. In addition, there is a need for a few additional experiments to confirm the validity of some of the main findings and conclusions, which are perceived by all reviewers as relatively straightforward for the authors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Extracted ion chromatograms are sub-optimal to show quantitative values for peptide abundance since ionization can vary from run to run (i.e. comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> to 1C). More developed quantitative methods would be much more informative (SILAC, isobaric tagging, etc.). The authors could normalize the area under a peak for a given SOX2 isoform to the area under all SOX2 isoforms to establish relative quantitation; however, the authors would also need to prove that there is no difference in ionization efficiency between WT SOX2 and S248A SOX2. The authors could also use an orthogonal technique such as Western blot if a modification specific antibody is available.</p><p>2) The retention times for the <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc modified fSOX2-Tg vs. fS248A-Tg is different: is that to be expected for a single amino acid change? Moreover, the authors mention that the asTAD peptide could be modified at T258 with <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc but do not examine the potential role further. Is this the reason for the residual peak corresponding to an <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc modified peptide in all of the traces? (i.e., with the S248A cells, one would expect no blue trace otherwise). Importantly, the authors need to address at some level why T258 was not further explored – they did not make this explicit.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>: the authors make conclusions based on this figure, but they do not show statistics. If there is statistical significance associated with the blue and red bars that should be clearly depicted. Moreover, how many times were the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> performed? It is important to convince the reader and the reviewers that these results are reproducible and give some statistics in the paper.</p><p>4) In the reprogramming experiments, the authors need to show that the SOX2 WT and S248A vectors are expressed at comparable levels. If they are not, this would be a much more trivial explanation for the observed phenotype.</p><p>5) The authors need to better describe and characterize the SOX2-deficient ESC lines (originally made by Masui et al.) harboring SOX2 overexpression constructs, and need to provide more details on how the cell line fSOX2-Tg and F248A-Tg have been created. According to the material method, 2TS22C cells have been stably transfected with CAG-3xF-Sox2 WT or S248A. One reviewer was wondering why the endogenous SOX2 present in the parental line visible on the top WB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> is not expressed in fSOX2-Tg and f248A-Tg? Therefore, the parent cell line setup needs to be explained. The authors should also analyze expression of a few pluripotency markers such as OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG by IF. AP staining is not a quantitative method and should be avoided (regardless, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>: AP staining difficult to see).</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, fSOX2 WT and fSOX2-248A exhibit similar cell localization but localization of endogenous SOX2 in parental cell line should be shown as well to appreciate the physiological localization of the overexpress isoforms of fSOX.</p><p>7) The authors claim that many genes associated with pluripotency are increased in SOX2 S248A mutants as judged by microarrays. It would be helpful to provide GSEA to show that there is an actual enrichment.</p><p>8) Differences in SOX2 occupancy between SOX2 WT and S248 expressing ESCs are rather minimal (ca. 1,000 sites), which could reflect ChIP-to-ChIP variability. It is unclear whether these analyses were done in replicates. The authors need to convincingly show that these differences are real, for example by confirming differentially bound targets by ChIP-PCR using independent cell preparations. Alternatively, the authors could generate ChIP-seq data from biological replicates.</p><p>9) The authors suggest that the SOX2 S248 mutation directs SOX2 to sites that are not co-occupied by OCT4 based on the lack of a canonical OCT4 consensus sequence +/- 20 bp. This would be more convincing if the authors performed ChIP for OCT4 in the SOX2 S248 cells and showed that it does not co-occupy the sites.</p><p>10) Differences in protein-protein binding between SOX2 WT and S248A cells also need to be validated in a more quantitative manner. It is difficult to ascertain how robust the differences presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> really are. Has the MS and validation experiment been performed on the same sample or in biological replicates? In the second paragraph of the subsection “SOX2<sup>S248A</sup> has altered protein-protein interactions”, the authors mention a 4-fold increase in binding partners but give no indication of how this quantitative value was calculated. Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> is a nice experiment to show that GlcNAcylation of SOX2 impairs its interaction with PARP1. However, loadings of SOX2 are not equal throughout the lane and the controls are missing. The authors should show the rate of SOX2 GlcNAcylation that is achieved in here. Also, it is obvious that OGT will interact with SOX2 but this interaction itself may impact the interaction of SOX2 with PARP1. A good control in here would be to incubated SOX2, PARP1 and OGT in presence or not of UDP-GLCNAc.</p><p>11) There are a number of typos that are apparent in the figures as well as throughout the text (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B:</xref> <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc – the &quot;O&quot; is a box; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, there is no top number on the y-axis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> text: μM is μm rather than the &quot;micro&quot;, F1a the double <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc peptide is mislabeled. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, pictures are shifted… It also appears that tables are missing?</p><p>12) Corresponding mass-spectra of the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> are missing and should be provided.</p><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>/C, 2B/C, 3C/D: the x-axis is labeled with RT, but there is no indication of the values associated with the retention time. This does not give the reader a good indication of how narrow a window the authors are examining. Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> appear to be stretched. Why is there a y ion annotated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>? Is this from a secondary reaction and if so, why are they annotated? Other contaminating peaks that are much larger remain un-annotated.</p><p>14) <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc modification of OCT4 has also been shown to be required for maintaining pluripotency. [Cell Stem Cell 17 May 2012 (doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2012.03.001)] While the authors reference this paper, they do not do so in the context of their OCT4 discussion and this is an important addition for the reader to best understand the state of the field.</p><p>15) The paper is solid but needs to be rewritten in parts to reflect what was actually tested and verified. Certainly SOX2 plays a key role in the maintenance of pluripotency and <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc influences its function. A suggestion for the title may be: <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc influences the protein-protein interactions mediated by the pluripotency factor SOX2. It is important that the authors do not leave the impression that this is a unique or sole means by which <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc influences this important biological process. Moreover, it is important to be concise – for instance what does 'more pluripotent' stand for? Thus, the manuscript and the figures should be edited carefully throughout.</p><p>16) As the authors say, the phenotype of the S248A overexpression mutant is counterintuitive given the requirement for OGT in ESCs. I do not think that different contexts can explain this discrepancy, as the authors suggest, since both studies examine ESC self-renewal. It is more likely that the OGT KO phenotype is due to other <italic>O-</italic>GlcNac-modified proteins that have opposing effects to SOX2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10647.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Extracted ion chromatograms are sub-optimal to show quantitative values for peptide abundance since ionization can vary from run to run (i.e. comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> to 1C).

The authors could also use an orthogonal technique such as Western blot if a modification specific antibody is available.</italic> </p><p>With modern high mass accuracy and high resolution mass spectrometers, coupled with high performance chromatography label free quantitation (LFQ) has become a powerful method of quantitation. This is especially true for less complex mixtures, such as co-immunoprecipitations or single proteins. We chose LFQ for this study because a majority of our analyses are not comparing isobaric peptides, the wild-type vs. the S248A peptides, for example. However, your point about the ionization efficiencies is very important. We have now included our LC-MS analysis of wild-type and S248A TAD synthetic peptides, as well the GlcNAc-S248 TAD synthetic peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These analyses show that the ionization efficiency between all the synthetic peptides are roughly equal.</p><p> <italic>2) The retention times for the O-GlcNAc modified fSOX2-Tg vs. fS248A-Tg is different: is that to be expected for a single amino acid change? Moreover, the authors mention that the asTAD peptide could be modified at T258 with O-GlcNAc but do not examine the potential role further.

Removal of the hydroxyl group by changing the serine to alanine creates a less hydrophilic peptide. Our synthetic peptide analyses recapitulate the change in retention times between wild-type and mutant peptides.</p><p>The role of the other <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc sites, while potentially interesting, was not the focus of this study. We did not examine the function of the T258 and S259 sites because they had already been studied by Jang et al. (Cell Stem Cell, 2012, Figure S4G). Jang et al. used an <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc site prediction algorithm that identified T258 and S259 as potential sites. They performed reprogramming analysis with the double T258 and S259 mutant and showed a decrease in efficiency, while mutation of S248+T258+S259 exhibited normal efficiency. The loss of function phenotype of the T258+S259 mutant could be a result of impacting <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAcylation or perturbing protein structure. Since we had a gain of function phenotype with S248 alone and the Jang et al. triple mutant data also suggested a gain of function, we instead chose to focus on this modification site.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>: the authors make conclusions based on this figure, but they do not show statistics.

Nat Cell Bio, 2007). For our studies we introduced CAG-3xF-SOX2<sup>WT</sup> or S248A under tet-repressed conditions, selecting for lines with levels of FLAG-tagged SOX2/S248A comparable to the amount of SOX2 in the original parental line (before repression). All experiments are carried out with the tet-SOX2 transgene repressed, which is why untagged SOX2 is no detectable in the blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. In the revised manuscript we provide a more detailed description of the generation of our transgenic ESC lines and include a new supplemental figure explaining the method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we now include Western blotting/IF for OCT4 and NANOG, showing that these are not substantially different between 3xF-SOX2<sup>WT</sup> and 3xF-S248A mESCs.</p><p>We provide the NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4 immunostaining experiments requested by the reviewer, showing that the wild-type and mutant are not notably different for expression of these pluripotency transcription factors.

It is unclear whether these analyses were done in replicates. The authors need to convincingly show that these differences are real, for example by confirming differentially bound targets by ChIP-PCR using independent cell preparations. Alternatively, the authors could generate ChIP-seq data from biological replicates.</italic> </p><p>We apologize that we were not clear enough in our original submission. In the Methods section we indicate that we performed two biological replicates (each with technical duplicates, for a total of 4 replicates) of the ChIP-seq. We now also state that replicates were performed in the figure legend accompanying the text. The files are deposited in GEO and available to the reviewers. Thus the 1000 new sites occupied in mutant relative to wild type (representing a 25% increase in the number of sites) are not likely to be due to ChIP-to ChIP variability.</p><p> <italic>9) The authors suggest that the SOX2 S248 mutation directs SOX2 to sites that are not co-occupied by OCT4 based on the lack of a canonical OCT4 consensus sequence +/- 20 bp. This would be more convincing if the authors performed ChIP for OCT4 in the SOX2 S248 cells and showed that it does not co-occupy the sites.</italic> </p><p>OCT4 ChIP followed by qPCR at S248A-specific peaks would certainly be informative about whether there is OCT4 binding in the vicinity of these new SOX2 binding sites. ChIP-qPCR doesn't provide the type of resolution necessary to indicate where the binding motif lies within the amplicon (in contrast to ChIP-seq, in which read counts indicate SOX2 and OCT4 peaks abut each other in the OCT4-SOX2 motif found in many active promoters in ESCs). Indeed, if we query for OCT4 motifs +/- 100 bp, a substantial fraction of S248A specific sites contain a predicted OCT4 binding site. Therefore, to address whether OCT4 is bound nearby SOX2 at the S248A-specific sites, ChIP-seq will be necessary. Performing such a ChIP-seq experiment is outside the scope of this manuscript, but is certainly something we will pursue in the future. For the resubmission we have changed the presentation of the analysis of ChIP-seq data. Instead of restricting our query to +/-20 bp of the SOX2 peaks, we used de novo motif identification to determine in an unbiased way what motifs predominant in the SOX2 peaks shared by wild type and S248A and in the S248A-specific peaks. Using this method, the canonical SOX2 motif is identified in the S248A-specific peaks and the canonical OCT4:SOX2 motif is identified in the peaks shared between wild type and mutant. This presentation more clearly highlights that mutant SOX2 site specificity is different from that of wild type SOX2.</p><p><italic>10) Differences in protein-protein binding between SOX2 WT and S248A cells also need to be validated in a more quantitative manner. It is difficult to ascertain how robust the differences presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> really are. Has the MS and validation experiment been performed on the same sample or in biological replicates?

A good control in here would be to incubated SOX2, PARP1 and OGT in presence or not of UDP-GLCNAc.</italic> </p><p>Forgive our lack of clarity for the affinity purification experiments. Our discovery experiments for the SOX2-protein interactions were performed using well-established, quantitative mass spectrometric methods (Kelihauer et al. MCP, 2015, Sharma et al. Cell Rep, 2014, Schilling et al. MCP, 2012) and is described in the Methods section. Briefly, we used the ratio of a particular protein’s intensity to its respective SOX2 intensity, excluding any TAD peptide signal. We then took the ratio of (ProteinX/SOX2-WT)/(ProteinX/SOX2-S248A). The ratios for all proteins were used to determine the variance of the data, and ultimately which proteins were more enriched by WT or mutant SOX2. The discovery work was carried out on biological replicates and IP-Western analyses used additional, separate biological replicates. We have altered the text in a hope to make these points more clear.</p><p>Thank you for the kind words regarding the recombinant work. Because concerns were raised about the possibility of a SOX2:OGT interaction impacting the SOX2:PARP1 interaction, we have substantially redesigned the experiment to remove OGT after the <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAcylation reaction. Briefly, we employed Bio-tagged SOX2 and His-tagged OGT for the <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAcylation reaction, carrying out the reaction +/- the sugar donor UDP-GlcNAc. After the reaction, SOX2 was bound to streptavidin beads and isolated away from the OGT (and UDP in the +UDP reaction). The bead bound SOX2 (+/- <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAcylation, confirmed by Western blot and mass spec) was incubated with GST-tagged PARP1, to assay for interaction. In the new figure, we provide appropriate input controls as well as blots showing that OGT is not present in the SOX2-PARP1 pull down.</p><p> <italic>11) There are a number of typos that are apparent in the figures as well as throughout the text (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: O-GlcNAc – the &quot;O&quot; is a box; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, there is no top number on the y-axis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> text: μM is μm rather than the &quot;micro&quot;, F1a the double O-GlcNAc peptide is mislabeled. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, pictures are shifted… It also appears that tables are missing?</italic> </p><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out these oversights.

Supplemental activation adds a low level of vibrational energy to dissociate ETD product ions that remain associated due to intramolecular interactions (Swaney et al., Anal Chem, 2007, Good et al., MCP, 2007). While the supplemental activation is low enough to not be the major pathway of unimolecular dissociation, some minor collisional activation dissociation can occur.</p><p> <italic>14) O-GlcNAc modification of OCT4 has also been shown to be required for maintaining pluripotency. [Cell Stem Cell 17 May 2012 (doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2012.03.001)] While the authors reference this paper, they do not do so in the context of their OCT4 discussion and this is an important addition for the reader to best understand the state of the field.</italic> </p><p>We did not mention the Jang et al. paper in the context of our OCT4 discussion because we have not been able to reproduce their data.

Certainly SOX2 plays a key role in the maintenance of pluripotency and O-GlcNAc influences its function. A suggestion for the title may be: O-GlcNAc influences the protein-protein interactions mediated by the pluripotency factor SOX2. It is important that the authors do not leave the impression that this is a unique or sole means by which O-GlcNAc influences this important biological process. Moreover, it is important to be concise – for instance what does 'more pluripotent' stand for? Thus, the manuscript and the figures should be edited carefully throughout.</italic> </p><p>These points are well taken. We have gone over the manuscript and made attempts to be more accurate and concise – ‘more pluripotent’ is removed. We struggled with how best to word the title so as not to unintentionally convey the idea that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc regulates pluripotency entirely through SOX2. We have altered the title to “SOX2 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation alters protein-protein interactions and genomic occupancy to modulate gene expression in pluripotent cells”. This title describes the main results without implying that SOX2 is the only relevant OGT target in pluripotent cells. We feel that is necessary to include “SOX2 <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAcylation….” in the title – otherwise it could lead to the incorrect impression that the <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAc modification is not necessarily on the SOX2 itself.</p><p> <italic>16) As the authors say, the phenotype of the S248A overexpression mutant is counterintuitive given the requirement for OGT in ESCs. I do not think that different contexts can explain this discrepancy, as the authors suggest, since both studies examine ESC self-renewal. It is more likely that the OGT KO phenotype is due to other O-GlcNac-modified proteins that have opposing effects to SOX2.</italic></p><p>This point is absolutely correct.
