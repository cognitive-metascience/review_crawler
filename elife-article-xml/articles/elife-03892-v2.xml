The anatomical connectivity between rod bipolar and A17 amacrine cells in the mammalian retina, specifically that neighboring A17s often receive input from many of the same rod bipolar cells, provides a rare technical opportunity to measure cross-synaptic synchrony under physiological conditions. This approach reveals that synchronization of rod bipolar cell synapses is near perfect in the dark and decreases with increasing light level. Strong synaptic synchronization in the dark minimizes intrinsic synaptic noise and allows rod bipolar cells to faithfully transmit upstream signal and noise to downstream neurons. Desynchronization in steady light lowers the sensitivity of the rod bipolar output to upstream voltage fluctuations. This work reveals how cross-synaptic synchrony shapes retinal responses to physiological light inputs and, more generally, signaling in complex neural networks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03892.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03892.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03892.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human eye is capable of detecting a single photon of starlight. This level of sensitivity is made possible by the high sensitivity of photoreceptors called rods. There are around 120 million rods in the retina, and they support vision in levels of light that are too low to activate the photoreceptors called cones that allow us to see in color. This is why we cannot see colors in the dark.</p><p>Signals are relayed through the retina via a circuit made up of multiple types of neurons. The activation of rods leads to activation of cells known as ‘rod bipolar cells’ which, in turn, activate amacrine cells and ganglion cells, with the latter sending signals via the optic nerve to the brain. All of these neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses. Activation of a rod bipolar cell, for example, triggers the release of molecules called neurotransmitters: these molecules bind to and activate receptors on the amacrine cells, enabling the signal to be transmitted.</p><p>For the brain to detect that a single photon has struck a rod, the eye must transmit information along this chain of neurons in a way that is highly reliable while adding very little noise to the signal. Grimes et al. have now revealed a key step in how this is achieved.</p><p>Electrical recordings from the mouse retina revealed that, in the dark, small fluctuations in the activity of rod bipolar cells lead to the near-deterministic release of neurotransmitters. This reduces the impact of random fluctuations in neurotransmitter release produced at individual synapses and ensures that the signals from rod bipolar cells (and thus from rods) are transmitted faithfully through the circuit with minimal added noise. As light levels increase, this tight synchrony of transmitter release breaks down, reducing the sensitivity to individual photons.</p><p>Given that many other brain regions share the features that enable retinal cells to coordinate the release of neurotransmitters, this mechanism might be used throughout the brain to increase the signal-to-noise ratio for the transmission of information through neural circuits.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03892.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03892.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>signal processing</kwd><kwd>synchronization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY11850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rieke</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rieke</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Rachel O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cells within the retina synchronize transmitter release across their output synapses in the dark, reducing the impact of noise generated at these synapses and allowing light-dependent signals to be transmitted with minimal added synaptic noise.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Everyday activities depend on the reliability of neural computation. Yet the mechanistic building blocks of the underlying circuits can exhibit highly stochastic behavior. Understanding neural computation requires bringing these two perspectives together, in particular, it requires identifying, under physiological conditions, the sources of noise in neural signals and how such noise is controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deneve et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>). Sensory systems, for example, must encode and transmit physiological stimuli accurately and quickly based on inherently stochastic processes such as transduction and synaptic transmission.</p><p>Neural circuits share a number of common architectural features. Cross-synaptic synchrony (CSS)—synchronization of transmitter release at different output synapses of a single neuron—is an important factor in how these common architectural features will impact the coding and transmission of physiological signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas and Sejnowski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rosenbaum et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2014</xref>). For example, the strength of network correlations generated by divergent synaptic output from a single presynaptic neuron depends directly on CSS. Similarly, if CSS is high, multiple parallel synapses between a pre- and postsynaptic neuron can enhance transmission of upstream noise and mitigate the impact of intrinsic synaptic noise. Circuits using graded signals or action potentials share these issues because the small number of vesicles associated with transmission of physiological signals cause synaptic release to vary even for nominally fixed presynaptic signals such as action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Castillo and Katz, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Stevens, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Two issues have hindered progress in understanding the importance of cross-synaptic synchrony for neural signaling. First, quantitative anatomical information about convergent and divergent wiring patterns is essential for understanding the influence of CSS, but such information is lacking for most brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denk et al., 2012</xref>). Second, the experimental conditions for studying neurotransmitter release biophysically often preclude studying physiological signaling in the same circuit. Retinal signaling at low light levels provides an opportunity to tackle these issues directly because of the wealth of available anatomical information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kolb, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolb and Famiglietti, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsukamoto and Omi, 2013</xref>) and the ability to study synaptic mechanisms in the context of physiological light stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sampath and Rieke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunn and Rieke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oesch and Diamond, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In starlight, signals from rod photoreceptors traverse the retina through the specialized rod bipolar circuit (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloomfield and Dacheux, 2001</xref>). Behavioral and physiological studies indicate that the sensitivity of this circuit approaches limits set by noise in the rod photoreceptors themselves, indicating that little noise is generated at downstream synapses (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Field et al., 2005</xref>). Rod bipolar cells (RBCs) provide a key component of this circuit; they receive dendritic input exclusively from rods, and provide output to several types of amacrine cells via anatomically distinct and stereotypic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelson and Kolb, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsukamoto and Omi, 2013</xref>). Here, we exploit the distinct anatomical features of these connections to quantitatively characterize the role of cross-synaptic synchrony in retinal signaling at low light levels. We find that RBC output synapses can exhibit near-perfect synchronization for small physiological changes in presynaptic voltage such as those encountered near visual threshold. This reveals a surprisingly low level of stochastic behavior at individual synapses under dark-adapted conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our aims were (1) to determine the degree of synchronization of RBC output synapses, (2) to identify the factors that control synchronization, and (3) to measure the impact of synchronization on the transmission of signal and noise through the rod bipolar circuit.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Same synaptic input, very different signal</title><p>AII and A17 amacrine cells provide the two main postsynaptic targets of RBCs. As described below, the connectivity between RBCs and these postsynaptic neurons provides an opportunity (1) to measure cross-synaptic synchrony (CSS) using paired A17 recordings, and (2) to examine its role in neural transmission by recording feedforward signaling in the AII amacrine cell and other downstream circuit elements.</p><p>Each rod bipolar cell releases glutamate from ∼50 ribbon synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sterling and Lampson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsukamoto and Omi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32a">Mehta et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These specialized synapses often exist as dyads, in which each presynaptic ribbon is shared by two postsynaptic targets, most commonly one AII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, purple) and one A17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, green) amacrine cell. AII and A17 amacrine cells differ in morphology, wiring configuration and functional contributions to retinal processing. AII amacrine cells convey rod-mediated signals to ganglion cells via gap junctions made with the axon terminals of On cone bipolar cells and via glycinergic synapses made with both the axon terminals of Off cone bipolar cells and the dendrites of Off ganglion cells. They have a compact dendritic field (∼40 μm) and receive direct synaptic input from ∼10 RBCs. A17 amacrine cells provide GABAergic feedback inhibition to RBC axon terminals. They have a wide dendritic field (∼300 μm) and collect input from more than 100 RBCs, which provide their only known source of excitation. Central to our work here, each RBC can make tens of synaptic contacts onto a single AII amacrine cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsukamoto and Omi, 2013</xref>), but typically only one synaptic contact onto a single A17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ellias and Stevens, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson and Kolb, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimes et al., 2010</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03892.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Same presynaptic neuron, very different postsynaptic noise properties.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three-dimensional EM reconstruction of a rod bipolar cell axon terminal (pink), presynaptic ribbons are represented with black markers (46 in total).

Variability in the AII inputs was insensitive to pharmacological block of the receptors mediating feedforward (to the AII) and feedback (to the RBC axon terminal) inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the large spontaneous fluctuations in the AII inputs arise from excitatory RBC inputs and do not require synaptic inhibition.</p><p>How can synaptic inputs from RBCs to AII and A17 amacrine cells differ so markedly? Multiple factors, such as differences in the cells' electrical properties, could contribute; we hypothesized that a key factor was differences in the connectivity of AII and A17 amacrine cells with RBCs and synchronization of output synapses within individual RBC axon terminals. Since A17 amacrine cells receive input, on average, from one ribbon-type synapse per RBC, their synaptic input should not be affected by synchronization across ribbons. AII amacrine cells, however, receive inputs from multiple synapses per RBC and hence their inputs should be shaped by RBC CSS. In support of this synchronization hypothesis, closer examination of the noisy AII input currents in <italic>Gjd2</italic> knockout mice revealed that the largest spontaneous current fluctuations were many times larger in amplitude and total charge than the average miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC; see ‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The differences in RBC connectivity with AII and A17 amacrines and in excitatory inputs to the two postsynaptic amacrine cells (in darkness) suggest that CSS substantially shapes RBC synaptic output. The RBC's CSS cannot be measured under dark-adapted conditions using imaging approaches because even two-photon (i.e., infrared) imaging produces too much rod activation to maintain the retina in a dark-adapted state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Euler et al., 2009</xref>). Instead, as described below, we took advantage of the sparse, stereotyped connectivity between RBCs and A17s to characterize the CSS of RBCs under physiological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Synchrony of RBC output</title><p>Each A17 amacrine cell is contacted by a large fraction of the RBCs within its dendritic field (∼50% in rabbit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>); therefore, pairs of A17s with highly overlapping dendrites receive synaptic contact from many of the same RBCs (i.e., RBCs that are common to both A17s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Because single ribbons typically provide input to an AII–A17 dyad and a single RBC typically contacts an A17 only once (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), highly overlapping A17s receive input from different ribbon-type synapses made by many of the same (i.e., common) RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Substantial dark correlations were present in pairs with the highest resistance (&gt;15 GΩ), suggesting at most a small contribution from electrical coupling. We did not attempt to eliminate electrical coupling using genetic manipulations because the connexins forming gap junctions between A17s have not been identified. However, pharmacological experiments described below (see section ‘Redundant connections and CSS scale dark noise transmission’) provide additional evidence for little contribution of gap junctions to correlations in A17 signals.

(2) This synchronization decreases with steady light.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Redundant connections and CSS scale dark noise transmission</title><p>What produces a high degree of CSS in the RBC's output in the absence of visual stimuli? First, synaptic failures and other sources of variability at individual synapses must be minimized; a full complement of releasable vesicles and multi-vesicular release likely contribute to minimizing intrinsic synaptic variability at individual RBC synapses (see ‘Discussion’). Second, different RBC synapses must experience common fluctuations in release probability so that they become coactive. Fluctuations in the dendritic synaptic input to RBCs from rod photoreceptors and consequent fluctuations in RBC voltage could cause release probability to covary. The pharmacological experiments described below support this proposal.</p><p>Rod photoreceptors provide input to RBC dendrites at sign-inverting glutamatergic synapses containing mGluR6 postsynaptic receptors. To reveal the role of upstream rod noise in controlling RBC output, we used agonists and antagonists of these receptors while recording from AII and A17 amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). After collecting dark records from an AII or A17 amacrine cell, RBC dendritic input was suppressed by the mGluR6 agonist APB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Slaughter and Miller, 1981</xref>). APB increases mGluR6 activity and produces a clear reduction in the mean RBC synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sampath and Rieke, 2004</xref>).

A mixture of receptor agonist and antagonist should suppress RBC voltage fluctuations while permitting control of the mean RBC voltage and release rate via changes in the agonist/antagonist ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ala-Laurila et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, antagonist concentrations could be identified that produced postsynaptic holding currents, and hence RBC synaptic release rates, near those in darkness (dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Similar agonist/antagonist mixtures maintained the mean RBC voltage while suppressing both light responses and dark noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This manipulation, however, did not restore noise in the inputs to AII and A17 amacrine cells to its dark level; the suppression of noise was particularly clear in the AII inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus similar release rates (dark vs appropriate agonist/antagonist mixture) can produce very different levels of synaptic noise. The larger change in variance of the AII inputs compared to the A17 inputs is consistent with the differences in connectivity and a role of CSS in causing small changes in RBC voltage to produce large changes in AII input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The sensitivity of synaptic noise to suppressing fluctuations in RBC dendritic input suggests that RBC voltage fluctuations synchronize synaptic release in the dark. If this is the case, then the strength of correlated synaptic input to neighboring A17s (i.e., CSS) should be sensitive to suppressing RBC voltage fluctuations. Thus, we repeated the pharmacological manipulations of RBC dendritic inputs while recording from A17 pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In control conditions, the peak cross-correlation for these pairs was 0.43 ± 0.05 (CSS<sub>dark</sub> = 0.71 ± 0.08, n = 4 pairs). Suppressing RBC synaptic release with APB eliminated correlations (4 ± 2% of that in darkness). Restoring the mean release rate with the mGluR6 antagonist modestly increased correlation strength (compared to APB), but it remained significantly less than that in the dark (peak correlation 0.11 ± 0.03, corresponding to an estimated CSS of 0.18 ± 0.05, p = 0.0034, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>).</p><p>The agonist/antagonist experiments also provide additional evidence against a primary role for gap junctions between A17s in correlating responses of nearby cells. The cross-correlation measures the fraction of the total noise in one cell that is correlated with noise in another cell. Non-rectified electrical connections between two A17s should cause a fraction of the electrical signal of one A17 to be shared with the other. Correlations in the A17 signals produced by gap junctions should hence be insensitive to decreasing the total noise in the A17 signals by suppressing fluctuations in RBC input as the same fraction of noise should remain correlated. The sensitivity of correlation strength to decreasing RBC voltage fluctuations pharmacologically indicates that gap junctions play at most a modest role in producing correlations, confirming the importance of synchrony across RBC synapses.</p><p>These results indicate that CSS strength depends on whether noise in the RBC output is produced by upstream sources or is intrinsic to the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Specifically, high CSS in the dark is generated by fluctuations in RBC dendritic input and the resulting fluctuations in RBC voltage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Light-dependent changes in CSS and noise transmission</title><p>Gain is high within the rod bipolar pathway in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunn et al., 2006</xref>), helping ensure that signal and noise inherited from the rod photoreceptors rather than noise introduced later in retinal processing dominates activity in downstream cells (e.g., AII amacrine cells). Redundant connections between RBCs and AII amacrine cells and high CSS at these connections provide key elements of such amplification. With increasing light level, the rod bipolar pathway ceases to be the sole route for signals to traverse the retina, as rod and cone signals are conveyed to ganglion cells through the cone bipolar circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xin and Bloomfield, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deans et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trexler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manookin et al., 2008</xref>).

We found that synchrony across different RBC output synapses was very strong in the dark, such that ∼80% of the vesicle release events occurring at different ribbons within the same RBC axon terminal were synchronous. The high level of cross-synaptic synchrony caused noise in the synaptic inputs to AII amacrine cells to be dominated by noise generated in the rod photoreceptors rather than noise generated at the RBC output synapse itself. As light level increased, conditions under which other retinal circuits become active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manookin et al., 2008</xref>), vesicle release at the RBC→AII synapse transitioned from high CSS to low CSS, thus limiting transmission of upstream signals and noise. We discuss these conclusions and their implications for retinal and neural processing in more detail below.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Implications for photon detection</title><p>The ability of the dark-adapted visual system to detect a small number of absorbed photons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hecht et al., 1942</xref>) places considerable constraints on the underlying mechanisms. For example, behavioral sensitivity requires that rod photoreceptors detect single photons, and we now have a good understanding of how that is achieved mechanistically (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rieke and Baylor, 1998</xref>). Behavioral sensitivity also requires that retinal synapses maintain low noise so as not to obscure the single photon responses of the rods. Similar requirements on the fidelity of synaptic transmission arise in other neural circuits that sense subtle changes in input.</p><p>Synaptic noise first threatens the fidelity of visual signaling at the synapse between rods and RBCs. This is an unusual sign-inverting synapse in which ongoing release of glutamate from the rod photoreceptors acts via metabotropic glutamate receptors to close ion channels in the RBC dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Slaughter and Miller, 1981</xref>). Mean release rate at these synapses is highest in the dark, with light exposure leading to a decrease in release rate. In complete darkness, saturation of the postsynaptic metabotropic cascade suppresses the transmission of rod noise; this synaptic saturation enhances the sensitivity of retinal signals more than 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Rossum and Smith, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Field and Rieke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berntson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sampath and Rieke, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The potential pitfalls associated with synaptic noise recur as signals traverse the retina, mainly via conventional chemical synapses. Our work here details how the operation of synapses between RBCs and AII amacrine cells maximizes sensitivity to upstream activity while minimizing added noise in darkness. Specifically, highly synchronized vesicle release across parallel RBC output synapses amplifies RBC voltage fluctuations produced by rod signals and noise while minimizing added synaptic noise. Quite surprisingly, achieving the estimated dark CSS of 0.8 requires that the dark fluctuations in RBC voltage produce near-deterministic changes in vesicle release at individual synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Multiple release sites at each ribbon synapse (each RBC ribbon has ∼10 active zones; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), high vesicle availability and postsynaptic receptor saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tong and Jahr, 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) will facilitate low synaptic variability. The low rate of ongoing release in darkness compared to that in the presence of steady light ensures that the readily releasable vesicle pool in the RBC terminal remains full (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singer and Diamond, 2006</xref>), an important component of strong synaptic synchronization. These results highlight that the RBC output synapses operate far from a regime in which vesicle release follows Poisson statistics, and this is important for their ability to reliably transmit the small signals forming the basis of night vision.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03892.008</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Multiple active zones (AZ) per synapse and low synaptic variability enhance CSS in darkness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CSS measurements constrain synaptic variability at individual synaptic connections.

If the RBC is too strongly hyperpolarized, the synapse will be ineffective in transmitting single photon responses generated in the rods.

Cross-synaptic synchrony impacts each of these issues.</p><p>Retinal ganglion cells, like output neurons in many neural circuits, exhibit strong noise correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnett and Spraker, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mastronarde, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murphy and Rieke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cafaro and Rieke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Volgyi et al., 2013</xref>), and these correlations can be dominated by divergent noise from common upstream circuit elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brivanlou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trong and Rieke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ala-Laurila et al., 2011</xref>). Cross-synaptic synchrony is a key determinant of whether anatomical divergence will produce correlated signals in downstream neurons. When cross-synaptic synchrony is high, postsynaptic targets of a given neuron will receive highly correlated input. Changes in CSS, such as with mean light level as observed here, will then control the strength of noise correlations produced by divergence, without morphological changes in the circuit connections.</p><p>Changes in CSS could also play an important role in the integration of signals from distinct parallel circuits. For example, as light levels increase from darkness, the need for high gain imposed by detecting sparse photons is reduced and visual perception depends less critically on signals traversing the rod bipolar pathway. Over a substantial range of light levels, visual signals elicit simultaneous activity in rod and cone photoreceptors and their associated circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Naarendorp et al., 2010</xref>). These parallel signals are combined through several shared circuit elements (e.g., AII amacrine cells) before they are transmitted to targets in the central nervous system. Efficient transmission of noisy rod signals through the rod bipolar pathway could jeopardize cone signals under these conditions. As luminance increases the RBC depolarizes, eventually evoking synaptic depression by way of vesicle depletion and Ca<sub>v</sub> inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singer and Diamond, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jarsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oesch and Diamond, 2011</xref>), mechanisms that likely underlie the decrease in cross-synaptic synchrony we observe here. The observed decrease in synchrony within the rod bipolar pathway serves to decrease transmission of rod noise to shared downstream circuit elements. Other highly interconnected brain regions might use similar mechanisms for dynamically regulating signal transmission in parallel circuits prior to signal integration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Experiments were conducted on whole mount and slice (200 μm thick) preparations taken from dark-adapted <italic>Gjd2</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deans et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2002</xref>) or wild-type C57/BL6 mice.

Retinas were incubated with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor conjugate, Invitrogen and anti-mouse DyLight conjugate, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 12 hr in PBS. Retinas were then mounted in Vectashield (Vector labs, Burlington, CA).</p><p>Images were acquired with an Olympus FV1000 microscope using a 1.35 NA 60× oil objective, at a voxel size of 0.102 × 0.102 × 0.3 μm or 0.204 × 0.204 × 0.3 μm. Raw image stacks were processed with MetaMorph (Universal Imaging) and Amira (Mercury Computer Systems). To identify sites of apposition between PKC positive RBCs and A17 amacrine cell varicosities, pixel overlap was assessed upon rotation of the image volumes in 3D using Amira. Synaptic contact was defined when the fluorescent signals overlapped by &gt;1 pixel at all angles of the 3D rotation. To determine the percentage of RBCs in the field of view that contacted the A17 cell, individual RBCs were digitally isolated and reconstructed using the ‘label-field’ function of Amira. To generate connectivity maps of the A17s, RBCs axonal locations were assessed in concentric rings spaced 20 μm apart, centered on the soma of the injected A17. A17 dendrites traverse ∼40 μm of the inner plexiform before reaching sublaminas 4 and 5 (where they make the majority of their synaptic contacts with RBCs); therefore, the most central concentric ring corresponds to dendritic distances between 40 and 60 μm, the second ring corresponds to dendritic distances between 60 and 80 μm and so on.</p><p>The A17→RBC connectivity patterns derived from whole mount preparations were used to derive the slope factor that relates the RB's CSS to correlations measured in highly overlapping A17s (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). To account for the effects of slicing in our calculations, we divided the number of contacted RBCs within a given ring by two (except for the first ring). Using these values and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>, we estimate the slope (purple line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) to be 0.64 ± 0.03 for highly overlapping A17s recorded in the slice preparation (0.67 ± 0.03 for whole mount).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electron microscropy</title><p>A previously published data set was analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>) (retina k0563).

Reviewer #3 remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This work of Grimes at al contrasts synaptic noise in AII vs A17 amacrine cells of the mouse, exploring in particular the correlations in synaptic release among multiple release sites from retinal bipolar cells onto amacrine cells. The main experimental design takes advantage of an anatomical observation that each A17 amacrine cell receives only one synaptic input from a particular RBC. This allowed the authors to measure the correlation between two neighboring A17s, and use it as an estimate of the correlation that results from two different synapses located in the same RBC. They then went on and calculated the CSS and evaluated correlation in the next cell order (RGCs). The conclusions are quite striking. In very low light levels different synaptic sites on the same retinal bipolar cell show highly correlated releases, almost deterministic/synchronous. Presumably this arises from voltage fluctuations in the terminals that are shared amongst release sites and have strong effects on release probability. As a result, noise at individual synaptic sites is diminished in favor of a concerted noise generated in the bipolar cell as a result of its responses to rod input. An interesting downstream result of this is that releases of glutamate and of glycine onto ganglion cells also show a shared pattern of noise. As light levels increase, such correlations, i.e., sensitivity to bipolar cells voltage fluctuation, decreases.</p><p>The reviewers were consistent in their praise of the strong experimental design and the elegant experiments; their only concerns were with the presentation. The authors can satisfy these concerns by some careful rewriting and more discussion. Reviewer #1 would like the authors to make it clearer that what they really want to show is CSS at the RBC to AII synapses and that the RBC to A17 synapses are used as a tool to estimate CSS at the AII synapses. Reviewer #2 praises the paper for putting their aims for the study up front but would like the authors to make Aim 3 conform more to what was actually achieved. Reviewer #2 would also like to see electrical compactness of the RBC addressed in the context of CSS. Please also address the minor comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 minor comments</italic>:</p><p>1) Please identify the experimental system (mouse) in the title to meet <italic>eLife</italic> requirements. For example, the title might be “Cross-synaptic synchrony and transmission of signal and noise across the murine retina.”</p><p>2) The Abstract was very confusing to me with its focus on A17 cells and stating that “...A17s often receive input from different synapses made by the same rod bipolar cell...” Do you mean AIIs? Can you explain in the Abstract that AIIs are the focus and A17 the tools without going over the word limits?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 minor comments</italic>:</p><p>From the Results section:</p><p>1) I assume you meant that one-rod bipolar cell releases glutamate at 50 ribbon synapses?</p><p>2) I find the sentence in parenthesis confusing because of “i.e.,”; maybe it will be clearer to say that “Both cell types receive … as can be inferred from…”.</p><p>3) An important factor that may differentiate the noise levels in AII and A17, which has been ignored in this paper, is the cells’ size. AII is relatively small and may have a higher input resistance.</p><p>4) For future reference, 2P imaging can work very nicely in a slice when using region of interest that do not include photoreceptors.</p><p>5) Please define CCpeak (since Methods comes after Results).</p><p>6) Why is it surprising to have this correlation: I think it is expected given that compactness of the RBC.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03892.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers were consistent in their praise of the strong experimental design and the elegant experiments; their only concerns were with the presentation.

We now emphasize the distinction in how we use AII and A17 amacrine cells in both the Abstract and the beginning of the Results section. We specify in the Abstract that ‘The anatomical connectivity between rod bipolar and A17 amacrine cells in the mammalian retina…provides a rare technical opportunity to measure cross-synaptic synchrony.’ A few sentences later we emphasize the role of CSS in transmission of signal and noise to downstream cells. We also revised the second paragraph of Results to more explicitly state the differences in how we use the two amacrine cells: ‘AII and A17 amacrine cells provide the two main postsynaptic targets of RBCs. As described below, the connectivity between RBCs and these postsynaptic neurons provide an opportunity to 1) measure cross-synaptic synchrony (CSS) – using paired A17 recordings and 2) examine its role in neural transmission – by recording feedforward signaling in the AII amacrine cell and other downstream circuit elements.’</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 praises the paper for putting their aims for the study up front but would like the authors to make Aim 3 conform more to what was actually achieved</italic>.</p><p>We have revised that sentence to more clearly state that our aim was to determine the role of CSS in transmission of both signal and noise through the rod bipolar circuit. The previous version emphasized signal alone, and indeed much of our work focuses on how CSS controls noise intrinsic to the rod bipolar output synapse and hence permits noise from the rods themselves to be the primary source of noise in responses of downstream neurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 would also like to see electrical compactness of the RBC addressed in the context of CSS. Please also address the minor comments</italic>.</p><p>We now state that ‘Thus strong synaptic synchronization requires large, coordinated increases in the probability of release (a notion supported by the electrically-compact nature of the RBC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Protti and Llano, 1998</xref>) and low intrinsic variability at individual synaptic connections (see Discussion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).’</p><p>Reviewer #1 minor comments:</p><p><italic>1) Please identify the experimental system (mouse) in the title to meet</italic> eLife <italic>requirements. For example, the title might be “Cross-synaptic synchrony and transmission of signal and noise across the murine retina</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p>The title has now been changed to ‘Cross-synaptic synchrony and transmission of signal and noise across the mouse retina’.</p><p><italic>2) The Abstract was very confusing to me with its focus on A17 cells and stating that “...A17s often receive input from different synapses made by the same rod bipolar cell...” Do you mean AIIs? Can you explain in the Abstract that AIIs are the focus and A17 the tools without going over the word limits</italic>?</p><p>Thanks for pointing out this confusing description and the need to emphasize A17s use as a tool. See the response to the first general comment above, which details changes in both the Abstract and Results to clarify the differences in how we use A17 recordings and AII recordings.</p><p>Reviewer #2 minor comments:</p><p><italic>From the Results section</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) I assume you meant that one-rod bipolar cell releases glutamate at 50 ribbon synapses</italic>?</p><p>The sentence now states that ‘Each rod bipolar cell releases glutamate from ∼50 ribbon synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sterling and Lampson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>; Singer et al., 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsukamoto and Omi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).’</p><p><italic>2) I find the sentence in parenthesis confusing because of “i.e.,”; maybe it will be clearer to say that “Both cell types receive … as can be inferred from…”</italic>.</p><p>The sentence now states that ‘Both cell types received substantial excitatory input in complete darkness as evinced byµMthe suppression of holding current and noise by 10 NBQX, an AMPA receptor antagonist (data not shown); however, spontaneous current fluctuations…’</p><p><italic>3) An important factor that may differentiate the noise levels in AII and A17, which has been ignored in this paper, is the cells’ size. AII is relatively small and may have a higher input resistance</italic>.</p><p>We now mention the possibility of differences in electrical properties: (‘Multiple factors, e.g., differences in the cells’ electrical properties…’). Rather than explore this possibilities, however, we favor a quick transition into the A17 paired recordings which provide direct insights into synaptic synchronization, which is the main focus of the paper.</p><p><italic>4) For future reference, 2P imaging can work very nicely in a slice when using region of interest that do not include photoreceptors</italic>.</p><p>We’ve slightly modified that sentence to say ‘The RBC’s CSS cannot be measured under dark-adapted conditions using imaging approaches because even two-photon (i.e. infrared) imaging produces too much rod activation to maintain the retina in a dark-adapted state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Euler et al., 2009</xref>).’ Indeed, while we also find that 2P imaging works well in a slice, even in that case there is sufficient light activation of rods to preclude measurements of fully dark-adapted retinal responses.</p><p><italic>5) Please define CCpeak (since Methods comes after Results)</italic>.</p><p>We changed this to read ‘Paired recordings from neighboring A17 amacrine cells (distance between somas &lt; 80 ∝m) revealed strong correlations in excitatory synaptic input in the dark (The peak of the cross-correlation function in darkness, i.e. the Dark CC<sub>peak</sub>, was 0.51±0.02, n = 8 pairs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c-e</xref>).’</p><p><italic>6) Why is it surprising to have this correlation: I think it is expected given that compactness of the RBC</italic>.</p><p>We found the strength of correlations surprising given the lack of visual stimuli (in the dark-adapted prep) and the lack of spiking behavior in RBCs. We’ve now modified the paragraph to explicitly mention these issues and to explicitly mention the electrically compact nature of the RBCs. Specifically, we now say: ‘The strength of correlations in spontaneous inputs to neighboring A17 amacrine cells in darkness indicated a surprising level of synaptic synchronization considering the lack of visual stimuli in these conditions and the fact that the presynaptic RBCs are non-spiking neurons. Thus even if the two recorded A17s receive input from an identical set of RBCs, correlation strengths near 0.5 require that two synapses made by the same RBC must be coactive at least half the time. Thus strong synaptic synchronization requires large, coordinated increases in the probability of release (a notion supported by the electrically-compact nature of the RBC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Protti and Llano, 1998</xref>) and low intrinsic variability at individual synaptic connections (see Discussion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).’</p><p>We also delve into this issue more completely in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, illustrating the large changes in the probability of release that are required to explain the measured CSS strength.</p></body></sub-article></article>
