endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates the unfolded protein response (UPR)—a signaling network that ultimately determines cell fate. Initially, UPR signaling aims at cytoprotection and restoration of ER homeostasis; that failing, it drives apoptotic cell death. ER stress initiates apoptosis through intracellular activation of death receptor 5 (DR5) independent of its canonical extracellular ligand Apo2L/TRAIL; however, the mechanism underlying DR5 activation is unknown. In cultured human cells, we find that misfolded proteins can directly engage with DR5 in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, where DR5 assembles pro-apoptotic caspase 8-activating complexes. Moreover, peptides used as a proxy for exposed misfolded protein chains selectively bind to the purified DR5 ectodomain and induce its oligomerization. These findings indicate that misfolded proteins can act as ligands to activate DR5 intracellularly and promote apoptosis. We propose that cells can use DR5 as a late protein-folding checkpoint before committing to a terminal apoptotic fate.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are chains of building blocks called amino acids, folded into a flexible 3D shape that is critical for its biological activity. This shape depends on many factors, but one is the chemistry of the amino acids. Because the internal and external environments of cells are mostly water-filled, correctly folded proteins often display so-called hydrophilic (or ‘water-loving’) amino acids on their surface, while tucking hydrophobic (or ‘water-hating’) amino acids on the inside.</p><p>A compartment within the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum folds the proteins that are destined for the outside of the cell. It can handle a steady stream of protein chains, but a sudden increase in demand for production, or issues with the underlying machinery, can stress the endoplasmic reticulum and hinder protein folding. This is problematic because incorrectly folded proteins cannot work as they should and can be toxic to the cell that made them or even to other cells. Many cells handle this kind of stress by activating a failsafe alarm system called the unfolded protein response. It detects the presence of incorrectly shaped proteins and sends signals that try to protect the cell and restore protein folding to normal. If that fails within a certain period of time, it switches to signals that tell the cell to safely self-destruct. That switch, from protection to self-destruction, involves a protein called death receptor 5, or DR5 for short. DR5 typically triggers the cell’s self-destruct program by forming molecular clusters at the cell’s surface, in response to a signal it receives from the exterior. During a failed unfolded protein response, DR5 seems instead to act in response to signals from inside the cell, but it was not clear how this works.</p><p>To find out, Lam et al. stressed the endoplasmic reticulum in human cells by forcing it to fold a lot of proteins. This revealed that DR5 sticks to misfolded proteins when they leave the endoplasmic reticulum. In response, DR5 molecules form clusters that trigger the cell's self-destruct program. DR5 directly recognized hydrophobic amino acids on the misfolded protein’s surface that would normally be hidden inside. When Lam et al. edited these hydrophobic regions to become hydrophilic, the DR5 molecules could no longer detect them as well. This stopped the cells from dying so easily when they were under stress. It seems that DR5 decides the fate of the cell by detecting proteins that were incorrectly folded in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>Problems with protein folding occur in many human diseases, including metabolic conditions, cancer and degenerative brain disorders. Future work could reveal whether controlling the activation of DR5 could help to influence if and when cells die. The next step is to understand how DR5 interacts with incorrectly folded proteins at the atomic level. This could aid the design of drugs that specifically target such receptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lam</surname><given-names>Mable</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Death receptor 5 can directly sense misfolded proteins downstream of the endoplasmic reticulum to provide a quality control mechanism that executes apoptosis and prevents further production of misfolded proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper folding of transmembrane and secreted proteins is critical to cell function and intercellular communication. Quality control of protein folding begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and responds to increased protein-folding demand during physiological or pathophysiological stresses. Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER, known as ER stress, activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) – a network of intracellular signaling pathways that initially mount cytoprotective response to restore ER homeostasis but can ultimately switch to a pro-apoptotic program under irresolvable stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>). Two key UPR sensors, IRE1 and PERK coordinate the decision between cell survival and death through the delayed upregulation of the apoptosis-initiating protein death receptor 5 (DR5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>During ER stress, IRE1 and PERK oligomerize upon directly binding to misfolded proteins, leading to their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karagöz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). PERK activation causes the selective translation of ATF4 and CHOP, which, in addition to upregulating genes that enhance the folding capacity of the ER, promotes the transcription of pro-apoptotic DR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamaguchi and Wang, 2004</xref>). The pro-apoptotic signal is initially counteracted by regulated IRE1-dependent mRNA decay (RIDD) that degrades DR5 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). Upon prolonged ER stress, PERK exerts negative feedback on IRE1 activity attenuating RIDD, thus de-repressing DR5 synthesis to drive cell commitment to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>DR5 is a pro-apoptotic member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily that signals from the plasma membrane into the cell in response to extracellular cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sheridan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walczak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashkenazi, 1998</xref>). It is constitutively expressed in various tissue types and forms auto-inhibited dimers in its resting state, analogous to other members of the TNFR family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spierings et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vanamee and Faustman, 2018</xref>). In its canonical mode of activation, binding of the homotrimeric extracellular ligand TRAIL (also known as Apo2L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wiley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pitti et al., 1996</xref>) assembles DR5 into higher-order oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hymowitz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mongkolsapaya et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Valley et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, DR5 forms intracellular scaffolds in which its cytosolic death domains recruit the adaptor protein FADD and pro-caspase 8 into the ‘death-inducing signaling complex’ (DISC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kischkel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sprick et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dickens et al., 2012</xref>). Upon DISC-mediated dimerization, pro-caspase 8 molecules undergo regulated auto-proteolysis to form active initiator caspase 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muzio et al., 1998</xref>). Activated caspase 8 frequently induces the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by truncating Bid, a pro-apoptotic Bcl2 protein, to cause Bax-mediated permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wei et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">LeBlanc et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>While DR5 and caspase 8 are both required for apoptosis during ER stress, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lam et al., 2018</xref>), along with other independent groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cazanave et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iurlaro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dufour et al., 2017</xref>), found unexpectedly that TRAIL is dispensable for this DR5 activation. Indeed, upon ER stress, most newly synthesized DR5 molecules never make it to the plasma membrane but remain intracellular and thus inaccessible to extracellular ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iurlaro et al., 2017</xref>). Given that at physiological levels DR5 is auto-inhibited until activated by a ligand, it remained a mystery how DR5 is activated in response to ER stress, prompting us to interrogate its intracellular mechanism of activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Misfolded proteins induce DR5-dependent apoptosis and can assemble DR5-caspase 8 signaling complexes</title><p>To examine the mechanism of cell death driven by an unmitigated protein folding burden, we induced the exogenous expression of a GFP-tagged form of the glycoprotein myelin protein zero (MPZ) in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). MPZ initially folds in the ER and then travels to the plasma membrane to mediate membrane adhesion in myelin-forming Schwann cells, where it is normally expressed. Mutations of MPZ that impair folding and cause its intracellular retention activate the UPR, leading to apoptosis in a manner dependent on CHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pennuto et al., 2008</xref>). We found that in epithelial cells, titration of even non-mutant, GFP-tagged MPZ to high expression levels resulted in its intracellular accumulation, indicating a compromised MPZ folding state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Folding-compromised MPZ induced a dose-dependent upregulation of the UPR transcriptional target genes CHOP, BiP, and DR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Upregulated DR5 was retained intracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and occurred concomitantly with cleavage of caspase 8and its downstream target caspase 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). By contrast, low levels of MPZ-GFP expression that exhibited proper plasma membrane localization did not induce caspase 8 or 3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). To determine when caspase 8 became active relative to cytoprotective UPR signaling, we assessed IRE1 activity during high MPZ-GFP expression through analysis of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing. As expected, IRE1-mediated <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing initiated a few hours post-transfection with MPZ-GFP and later attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The upregulation of DR5, caspase activity, and PARP cleavage (another indicator of apoptotic progression) occurred after the attenuation of IRE1 activity, consistent with the hallmarks of terminal pro-apoptotic UPR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Misfolded proteins induce DR5-dependent apoptosis and assemble DR5-caspase 8 signaling complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images of epithelial cells HCT116 fixed 24 hr post-transfection with 0.25–1.0 μg of a plasmid containing myelin protein zero (MPZ) tagged with a C-terminal monomeric EGFP or 1.0 μg of the empty vector showing MPZ-GFP fluorescence (green) and immunofluorescence with an antibody against DR5 (red) (scale bar = 5 μm).

To determine if upregulation of DR5 was sufficient to induce apoptosis, we increased DR5 levels in the absence of ER stress through ectopic expression of CHOP. Comparable levels of CHOP-induced DR5 protein in the absence of ER stress drove drastically lower levels of PARP cleavage and trypan blue staining (demarking apoptotic cells) compared to the presence of misfolded-protein stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and C–D</xref>).

This indicates that misfolded proteins differ in their propensity to directly engage the DR5-assembled DISC, and that other misfolded substrates—caused by the ectopically overexpressed ER-trafficked protein—may mediate direct DR5 activation.

We have examined the mechanism of apoptosis induction by the sustained expression of three different candidate ER-trafficked proteins associated with CHOP-dependent disease pathologies: MPZ, RHO, and INS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pennuto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oyadomari et al., 2002</xref>). In epithelial cells, overexpression of each protein induces apoptosis in a DR5-dependent manner. Consistent with previous reports of ectopic CHOP expression in the absence of ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCullough et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Southwood et al., 2016</xref>), CHOP-driven upregulation of DR5 alone did not account for the apoptosis observed during the overexpression of an ER-trafficked protein. For MPZ and RHO, the intracellular, misfolded pools of each protein physically associated with the DR5-caspase 8 complex. For proinsulin, which weakly associated with DR5 but triggered apoptosis to a similar extent, we believe it is likely that overexpression of this singular protein perturbed the folding of endogenous trafficking substrates and thereby provided other, perhaps more favored, misfolding substrates to directly engage DR5. This latter scenario is likely to occur under pharmacologically induced ER stress as well. The interaction between misfolded protein and DR5 bridges the long-standing mechanistic gap of why CHOP expression (and subsequent upregulation of its downstream factors) is necessary but not sufficient to drive cell death. Through characterizing the interaction between the DR5 ECD and peptide sequences of ER-trafficked proteins, we demonstrate that DR5 promiscuously binds to exposed hydrophobic stretches of misfolded proteins with an affinity in the range of 100 μM and in a highly cooperative manner.</p><p>To grasp how such a high concentration of misfolded protein could occur in the ERGIC, it is important to consider that the compartment is composed of vesicles and tubules measuring 60–100 nm in diameter and &lt;500 nm in length. In a back-of-the-envelope calculation, we estimate that reaching 100 μM in a vesicle with a diameter of 100 nm would require only 32 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sesso et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2003</xref>). The measured affinities are therefore well within physiological range. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy of living COS7 cells has indicated up to 100 molecules of a GFP-tagged viral glycoprotein in a 100 nm vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>), providing experimental evidence that surpassing concentrations of 100 μM is indeed physiologically relevant. In fact, the ‘low’ affinity between DR5 and misfolded proteins is likely a necessary feature that prevents aberrant DR5 oligomerization and activation in the crowded lumenal environment of membrane-bound compartments, as we previously established for other unfolded protein sensors, such as IRE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karagöz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Given that misfolded receptors can be exported from the ER when quality control mechanisms are overwhelmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Satpute-Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sirkis et al., 2017</xref>), detection of misfolded proteins by DR5 downstream of the ER likely serves to prevent the cell from displaying or secreting dysfunctional proteins that would be detrimental in a multicellular context. While IRE1 and PERK act as initial UPR sensors in the ER, DR5 acts as a late sensor of misfolded protein at the ERGIC during unmitigated ER stress. Thus, intracellular DR5 triggers apoptosis to enforce a terminal quality control checkpoint for secretory and transmembrane proteins. We postulate that other members of the TNFR family, for exmple DR4, which has been reported to play a role in cell death during Golgi stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Raam et al., 2017</xref>), may respond similarly to intracellular stimuli.</p><p>Although extensive research has focused on the therapeutic activation of death receptors including DR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashkenazi, 2015</xref>), limited strategies exist to inhibit such receptors despite their demonstrated role in apoptosis-mediated disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vunnam et al., 2017</xref>). Namely, DR5-mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes has been linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, while CHOP-dependent apoptosis in Schwann cells—wherein a role for DR5 has yet to be investigated—may contribute to diabetic peripheral neuropathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cazanave et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sato et al., 2015</xref>). Our finding that the assembly and disassembly of DR5 ECD oligomers can be controlled by a peptide raises the possibility that intracellular DR5 activation could be inhibited through small molecule ligand-induced dissociation of DR5 clusters to prevent apoptosis and thus preserve cell viability in the face of unresolved ER stress. From the work herein, this notion now emerges as a promising strategy to interfere therapeutically with deleterious death receptor function.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

client proteins can elicit apoptosis through direct engagement of DR5. The work suggests a provocative model to account for how UPR signaling is necessary but not sufficient to elicit cell death, and how cells might tune their survival decisions to the strength and persistence of the stressor. It will be interesting in future work to see how DR5 distinguishes substrates, and to identify what other stress signaling pathways impinge on this pathway to regulate its output. I expect that this work will be of great interest to those interested in stress responses and cell fate decisions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Misfolded proteins bind and activate death receptor 5 to induce apoptosis during unresolved endoplasmic reticulum stress&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Cristina Muñoz-Pinedo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors continue their studies on ER stress-induced cell death mediated by DR5. They demonstrate that overexpressed ER client proteins (primarily MPZ, but also rhodopsin) interact with DR5 and its partners (FADD, Casp8) in an ERGIC-like compartment. DR5 is capable of binding promiscuously and fairly weakly to peptides in MPZ and RHO, and expressing a wild-type MPZ peptide elicits death in a DR5-dependent manner while a mutant peptide that does not interact with DR5 does not (or at least not to as great an extent). Demonstration that the interaction can be broken such that approximately equal expression of the wild-type versus mutant peptide results in different outcomes is an important finding and helps raise confidence in the specificity of the interaction. The authors' model is appealing because it proposes that there is a mechanism by which the death pathway relies on some direct sensing of persistent misfolded proteins, rather than on the execution of a signaling cascade by UPR activation. There was agreement among the reviewers that the work is interesting and provocative. However, the reviewers also agreed that the paper requires a few straightforward experiments and some textual revisions to better support the conclusions and increase the rigor.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Ecto peptide studies. While the ecto peptide studies in Figure 4 add mechanistic strength to the paper, it is important to validate that the assumptions underlying the results are valid. Thus, (1) it is necessary to test whether the wild-type and mutant ecto peptides also accumulate in an ERGIC-like compartment with DR5. The data on wild-type full-length MPZ show that MPZ accumulation in this compartment is upstream of DR5 accumulation there. Therefore, if the mutant peptides do not accumulate in the ERGIC, it would suggest that their failure to elicit death is due to some other mechanism. Likewise if not even the wild-type peptide accumulates in the ERGIC, that would suggest an indirect DR5-dependent death mechanism. And (2) it is necessary to confirm that the cell death is in fact apoptotic (ideally by AnnexinV/PI and by showing that caspases are necessary, or both).</p><p>2) Increased Rigor. There were instances in which the reviewers were not fully confident in the robustness of the quantitative data in the manuscript. This hesitancy arose from instances of quantitative data where statistical comparisons were not made, and questions as to whether replicates were technical rather than biological in nature. To remedy this, all quantitative data should include appropriate statistical analysis including corrections for multiple comparison where appropriate and specification of the biological &quot;n&quot; number from which the data are derived (obviously if there are any data in which technical replicates rather than biological were used, biological replicates would need to be performed). Co-IP efficiencies should also be quantified for Figures 1 and 4. Particularly for Figure 1, the inputs in Figure 1—figure supplement 3B show equal DR5 in the three samples, but this is inconsistent with other experiments in the paper showing increased DR5 expression when MPZ is overexpressed. Thus, it is difficult to interpret increased pulldown of DR5 et al. in Figure 1F in light of this discrepancy, and these data are key to the paper. More information is needed on the timing of the pulldown and why DR5 total expression is not higher, and there should be a quantification of the percent recovered from all conditions from biological replicates. Source data should also be provided for quantitative experiments.</p><p>3) Consistency of data. This concern can be addressed textually. Not every assay is carried through every experiment in the paper (for instance, MPZ, FADD, caspase 8, and DR5 are not always IP'd together), and there are some results that seem on their face inconsistent with the model. For example, insulin elicits death in a DR5-dependent manner to as great or greater a degree as MPZ and RHO but does not appear to interact with DR5 or caspase 8 to a great extent (Figure 1—figure supplement 4D, E; Figure 1—figure supplement 5A, B). This alone suggests there are likely to be other factors and pathways involved. The system is likely to be complicated with many moving parts, and so the discrepancies here-and-there do not necessarily nullify the model, but these discrepancies should be explicitly acknowledged rather than minimized.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52291.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Ecto peptide studies.

All three plasma membrane-targeted constructs showed intracellular puncta that partially overlapped with ERGIC and DR5 signal (Figure 4F, Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D). Quantification of the mean Pearson’s correlation with ERGIC or with DR5 for each MPZ-ecto peptide showed no significant difference.</p><p>Additionally, DR5 exhibits a positive correlation with ERGIC for all three conditions, despite the difference in co-IP enrichment and measured cell death. This indicates that retention of DR5 at the ERGIC occurs independently of its interaction with these trafficking substrates and may instead occur due to a general backlog of trafficking through the secretory pathway during ER stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And (2) it is necessary to confirm that the cell death is in fact apoptotic (ideally by AnnexinV/PI and by showing that caspases are necessary, or both)</p></disp-quote><p>To confirm that cell death occurs through apoptosis, we have now measured Annexin V and Sytox Blue staining for cells transfected with the MPZ-ecto peptides. Figure 4—figure supplement 3B-G shows the distribution of early (Annexin V+, SytoxBlue-) versus late (Annexin V+, Sytox Blue+) apoptotic cells for one biological replicate, and Figure 4H summarizes the percentage of cells positive for Annexin V averaged over three biological replicates. As expected, the MPZ-ecto peptide exhibits a substantially higher population of Annexin V+ cells. Furthermore, the addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD reduced Annexin V staining (Figure 4H, Figure 4—figure supplement 3D), demonstrating the requirement of caspase activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Increased Rigor.

We had originally shown the caspase activity (with technical replicates) for the full titration of ecto peptide expression shown in Figure 4B, but we decided to repeat this assay for the normalized expression levels of the peptides. The original technical replicates of the full titration have been provided in Figure 4—source data 1.</p><p>Figure 4E now includes two additional biological replicates of qPCR for MPZ-ecto peptide and its mutant variants, and statistical significance was determined using multiple t-tests with correction for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Sidak method.</p><p>We did not perform additional biological replicates for data that had been repeated elsewhere in the manuscript. Specifically, Figure 1—figure supplement 1E shows a 2-fold change of caspase activity after 24 hours of MPZ-GFP transfection, which agrees with Figure 1—figure supplement 3C showing an average 2-fold increase from three biological replicates. In Figure 4B, the quantification of the percent PARP cleaved from titrating ecto peptide expression also agrees with the quantification shown in Figure 4G for the selected expression levels of ecto peptide and its mutants.</p><p>We also did not repeat experiments for data that do not make new arguments.

We think that the saturation of the DR5 signal in the blot of Figure 1—figure supplement 3B may be obscuring the relative levels. To address this discrepancy, we repeated the IPs for MPZ-GFP to normalize the DR5 input levels to GAPDH (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). When normalized to GAPDH, the DR5 levels of MPZ-transfected cells were 2-fold higher. The GAPDH levels of the MPZ inputs were consistently lower than those of the GFP inputs because we obtained a lower yield of MPZ-transfected cells due to cell death.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Biological Replicates for MPZ-GFP Pulldown of DR5.</title><p>(Left) Additional replicates of the MPZ-GFP IP from Figure 1G with signal for GFP and MPZ shown in green, GAPDH shown in red, and DR5 shown in grey; (Right) Quantification of DR5 signal in IP lanes normalized to GAPDH (n = 2 biological replicates, error bars are SD).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52291-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Nevertheless, even with less total DR5 in the input of MPZ samples, the MPZ IPs still showed higher amounts of DR5 than the GFP IPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] and there should be a quantification of the percent recovered from all conditions from biological replicates.

From three biological replicates, we estimate that MPZ-GFP retains 10% of DR5 from the input after three 10-min washes, while RHO-GFP retains 5%. The source data for this quantification is included in Figure 1—source data 9. This yield of DR5 is consistent with the weak affinity measured between DR5 and the MPZ-ecto peptide in solution. Since DR5 licenses caspase 8 to propagate downstream caspase signaling, only a fraction of DR5 would need to be activated to achieve apoptosis.</p><p>Likewise for Figure 4G, we estimate that 7-8% of total DR5 remains bound to the MPZ-ecto peptide from two biological replicates of IPs (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A). Both trials consistently show that DR5 is 3-4 fold more enriched on MPZ-ecto peptide than on the mutant peptides (See Figure 4—source data 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Consistency of data.
