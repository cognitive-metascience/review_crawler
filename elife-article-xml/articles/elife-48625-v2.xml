Among these transcripts, <italic>Noncoding RNA activated by DNA damage</italic> (<italic>NORAD</italic>) is particularly noteworthy, due to its unusually abundant expression in mammalian cells and tissues and strong evolutionary conservation across mammalian species. Initial studies of <italic>NORAD</italic> revealed that this lncRNA is required to maintain genomic stability in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), and provided strong evidence that this function is mediated through the ability of <italic>NORAD</italic> to bind to and negatively regulate PUMILIO RNA binding proteins (PUM1 and PUM2) in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Tichon et al., 2016</xref>). PUM proteins bind with high specificity to the eight nucleotide (nt) PUMILIO response element (PRE) (UGUANAUA or UGUANAUN) on target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), triggering their deadenylation, decapping, and eventual degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Miller and Olivas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Quenault et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, <italic>NORAD</italic> contains 18 conserved PREs and has the capacity to bind a large fraction of PUM1/2 within the cell, although it is not yet known whether <italic>NORAD</italic> limits PUM activity through a simple sequestration model or whether additional mechanisms contribute to PUM inhibition. Regardless, loss of <italic>NORAD</italic> results in PUM hyperactivity and increased repression of PUM targets that include important regulators of mitosis, DNA repair, and DNA replication, resulting in a dramatic genomic instability phenotype in <italic>NORAD</italic>-deficient cells and mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Kopp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, PUM1/2 overexpression is sufficient to phenocopy loss of <italic>NORAD</italic> in both human cells and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Kopp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), while PUM1/2 loss-of-function suppresses the genomic instability phenotype in <italic>NORAD</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Lee et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recently, an alternative mechanism for the regulation of genomic stability by <italic>NORAD</italic> was proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Munschauer et al., 2018</xref>). Proteomic analysis of the <italic>NORAD</italic> interactome revealed an interaction with RBMX, an RNA binding protein that contributes to the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamson et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequent experiments suggested that the <italic>NORAD</italic>:RBMX interaction facilitates the assembly of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex in the nucleus that includes Topoisomerase I (TOP1) and other proteins that are critical for genome maintenance. Importantly, PUM and RBMX interact with different sites on <italic>NORAD</italic> and function in distinct subcellular compartments. Thus, while it remains to be determined whether the <italic>NORAD</italic>:RBMX interaction is necessary for regulation of genomic stability, both PUM and RBMX may play important, non-mutually exclusive roles in the genome maintenance functions of <italic>NORAD</italic>.</p><p>Here, we further examined the mechanism by which <italic>NORAD</italic> functions to maintain genome stability in human cells and directly tested the requirement for PUM and RBMX interactions in this activity. RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using a panel of probes spanning the entire length of <italic>NORAD</italic>, as well as cellular fractionation studies, definitively demonstrated that this lncRNA localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm and does not detectably redistribute to the nucleus upon induction of DNA damage. Genetic rescue experiments in <italic>NORAD</italic> knockdown cells established that PUM binding is essential for maintenance of genomic stability whereas interaction with RBMX is completely dispensable for this function. Further experiments demonstrated that RBMX is not required for induction of <italic>NORAD</italic> following DNA damage nor its cytoplasmic localization. Together, these studies establish the importance of the <italic>NORAD</italic>:PUM axis in regulating genomic stability in mammalian cells and provide a foundation for further dissection of the mechanism and physiologic role of this pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>NORAD</italic> localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm with or without DNA damage</title><p>Initial studies of <italic>NORAD</italic> reported a predominantly cytoplasmic localization of this lncRNA in human cell lines, based on RNA FISH using pools of fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide probes and subcellular fractionation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Tichon et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, however, a distinct localization pattern was reported based upon RNA FISH performed using a commercially-available kit with a proprietary set of oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to an unknown segment of <italic>NORAD</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Munschauer et al., 2018</xref>). In these more recent experiments, <italic>NORAD</italic> was reported to localize equally between the nucleus and cytoplasm and appeared to redistribute almost entirely to the nuclear compartment upon treatment of cells with the DNA damaging agents camptothecin and doxorubicin. Importantly, a single cell line (human colon cancer cell line HCT116) was used in both the previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) and more recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Munschauer et al., 2018</xref>), arguing against a cell-type specific difference in <italic>NORAD</italic> trafficking as the cause of these discordant results.</p><p>We considered the possibility that the disparate observed localization patterns could be due to unrecognized processing of the <italic>NORAD</italic> transcript, such that different segments of the RNA that are recognized by the different FISH probes accumulate in distinct subcellular compartments. To investigate this possibility, and to reliably establish the localization of the entire <italic>NORAD</italic> transcript, we generated a panel of 11 in vitro transcribed RNA FISH probes spanning the complete <italic>NORAD</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Mito et al., 2016</xref>). One probe, that recognized a segment of <italic>NORAD</italic> containing an Alu repeat element (probe 7), gave rise to a nonspecific nuclear signal that was present in both <italic>NORAD</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>NORAD<sup>â/â</sup></italic> HCT116 cells. The remaining 10 probes produced a highly consistent, predominantly cytoplasmic, punctate localization pattern in wild-type cells that was absent in <italic>NORAD<sup>â/â</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâB</xref>). These results were confirmed using subcellular fractionation followed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) using primers located at the 3â² or 5â² ends of <italic>NORAD</italic>, which revealed that 80â90% of the transcript is localized to the cytoplasmic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48625.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>NORAD</italic> localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNA FISH in HCT116 cells using a panel of 11 probes tiling the entire <italic>NORAD</italic> transcript reveals a predominantly cytoplasmic signal that is absent in <italic>NORAD<sup>â/â</sup></italic> cells with all probes except probe 7, which produces a nonspecific signal likely due to the presence of an Alu repeat element. <italic>NORAD</italic> FISH signal in red, DAPI counterstain in blue.

Interestingly, we observed a modest increase in nuclear <italic>NORAD</italic> levels that peaked after 12 hr of camptothecin or doxorubicin treatment.

In light of these findings, it was surprising that PUM1/2 were not reported among the most enriched <italic>NORAD</italic>-bound proteins in the recent RNA antisense purification with quantitative mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) experiments performed in HCT116 cells that identified the <italic>NORAD</italic>:RBMX interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Munschauer et al., 2018</xref>). Since these RAP-MS experiments utilized pulse labeling with 4-thiouridine to crosslink <italic>NORAD</italic> to protein interactors, a bias towards detection of proteins that bind to newly synthesized <italic>NORAD</italic> would be expected, potentially explaining the enrichment of nuclear interactors observed. Nevertheless, we reanalyzed the published RAP-MS dataset to determine whether PUM1 or PUM2 were enriched in <italic>NORAD</italic> pull-downs compared to control <italic>RMRP</italic> pull-downs. Peptides were identified and scored using a combined algorithm that employed three search engines (Sequest HT, Mascot, and MS Amanda).

ImageJ was used for further image analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Subcellular fractionation</title><p>Cells were seeded in triplicate and 1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells were collected for subcellular fractionation, which was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Kopp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, cell pellets were lysed in RLN1 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% NP-40, RNAse inhibitor) on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 500g Ã 2 min. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction was separated from the pelleted nuclear fraction. RNA was then isolated from both fractions using the Qiagen RNeasy kit and equal cell equivalents of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA were used in subsequent qRT-PCR reactions. All samples were tested for <italic>NORAD</italic> as well as <italic>NEAT1</italic> (nuclear control) and <italic>GAPDH</italic> (cytoplasmic control). The sum of the nuclear and cytoplasmic expression level of each transcript was set to 100%, and the percentage of each transcript localized to each compartment was determined. <italic>NEAT1</italic> and <italic>GAPDH</italic>, respectively, showed the expected nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in each experiment, confirming successful fractionation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Reanalysis of <italic>NORAD</italic> RAP-MS data</title><p>The raw mass spectra files from iTRAQ-labeled <italic>NORAD</italic> and <italic>RMRP</italic> RAP-MS experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Munschauer et al., 2018</xref>) were downloaded from MassIVE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://massive.ucsd.edu">https://massive.ucsd.edu</ext-link>) using the identifier: MSV000082561. Peptide identification and quantification was performed using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher) with three search engines combined (Sequest HT, Mascot, and MS Amanda). MS/MS spectra were searched against the human Uniprot database. Search parameters included: trypsin enzyme specificity with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages tolerated, False Discovery Rate (FDR) set to 0.01 at both peptide and protein level,Â Â±10 ppm for precursor mass tolerance with a shorter window for fragment mass tolerance for the first search, and carbamidomethylation of cysteine modification and iTRAQ labels on N-termini and lysine residues as fixed modifications and oxidation of methionine and N-termini acetylation as variable modifications. All peptide and protein identifications had scores surpassing the combined search engine significance threshold for identification. Protein abundance was calculated as the intensity given from precursor quantification and was then normalized to the total peptide amount. To correct for total abundance differences between samples, protein and peptide abundance values in each sample were corrected by a constant factor such that the end total abundance was equivalent across all samples. Fold change was calculated as the log<sub>2</sub> difference of average scaled protein abundance in <italic>NORAD</italic> samples and <italic>RMRP</italic> sample.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;PUMILIO, but not RBMX, binding is required for regulation of genomic stability by noncoding RNA <italic>NORAD</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Igor Ulitsky (Reviewer #1); Philip Grote (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In the manuscript, Mendell and colleagues describe an advance in their study of <italic>NORAD</italic>, a mouse loss-of-function model of which was previously published in <italic>eLife</italic>. In the new manuscript, the authors focus on human cells, where they can reliably test the effects of loss-of-function of <italic>NORAD</italic> an genome stability by measuring fraction of HCT116 cells that become aneuploid, following loss of <italic>NORAD</italic> combined with expression of different rescue constructs. In this setting, the authors test different sequence variants and measure the fraction or aneuploid cells. This system allows the authors to compare the relative contribution of two groups of regions within <italic>NORAD</italic> â the ~20 PUMILIO binding sites, and the region that binds RBMX. RBMX was recently shown to bind <italic>NORAD</italic> by Munschauer et al., which showed that this binding is important for proper replication fork progression, and it was suggested in that paper that this binding is important overall for the roles of <italic>NORAD</italic> in genome stability. The new results convincingly show that PUMILIO binding is important for the aneuploid cell% phenotype (evaluated by measuring two chromosomes with DNA FISH). The authors also convincingly show that <italic>NORAD</italic> is mostly cytoplasmic in unstressed and in DNA-damaged cells, and that in contrast to the previous analysis by Muschauer et al., and consistently with all previous RIP and CLIP data, <italic>NORAD</italic> binds PUM1 and PUM2 PUMILIO proteins.</p><p>The topic of <italic>NORAD</italic> function and modes of action is of high interest, and the relative importance of the binding to PUMILIO in the cytoplasm and to RBMX in the nucleus for genome stability, as well as localization of <italic>NORAD</italic>, are a matter of controversy following the conflicting papers. The experiments are generally performed to a high standard and analyzed appropriately. The comments below mainly refer to the way the results are presented in context of prior work from the authors and from Munschauer et al., and are intended to provide a better distinction within the manuscript between the new results and discussion about the results of others.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The readout of genome integrity described by Munschauer et al. (% chromosome segregation defects) is not identical to the one described in this submission (and by Lee et al.: &quot;% aneuploid cells&quot;) and so formally cannot invalidate Munschauer et al.'s conclusions. Please comment on the possibility that, even with all the new results, <italic>NORAD</italic> has a dual function: as a modulator of PUMILIO factors and as an &quot;assembler&quot; of the NARC1 complex. For a more definitive result, the same phenotypic assays as described in the Munschauer paper would be required. Ideally this should be done, but if the same assay and same readout are not possible then statements (in the Title and Abstract and elsewhere) regarding RBMX binding not being important for genome stability would need to be toned down.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>â¢ The Abstract mentions that much of the prior work published in <italic>eLife</italic> was in mouse, but should also clarify that the new results are mostly in human cells.</p><p>â¢ Abstract.

(quantification of the frequency of chromosome segregation defects), which further demonstrates that RBMX binding is not essential for maintenance of genomic stability by <italic>NORAD</italic>. These new data have been added to Figure 5 of the revised manuscript. Similar to what we reported previously (Lee et al., 2016), and later confirmed by Munschauer et al., <italic>NORAD</italic> knockdown resulted in an increase in the percentage of anaphase cells that display defective chromosome segregation. Expression of full-length <italic>NORAD</italic>, or <italic>NORAD</italic> lacking the RBMX binding site, rescued this phenotype whereas mutation of the PUMILIO binding sites fully abrogated <italic>NORAD</italic> function in this assay.</p><p>It is worth noting that we initially chose the DNA FISH assay for the present study because it is a more sensitive readout of genome instability. DNA FISH reports the cumulative effect of chromosome segregation defects over many cell divisions whereas the analysis of mitoses provides a more limited snapshot of the defects present at a single time-point. Nevertheless, we appreciate the reviewersâ suggestion to perform both assays, which have yielded essentially identical results, thereby providing an even more definitive demonstration that PUMILIO binding is essential, whereas RBMX binding is dispensable, for genome maintenance by <italic>NORAD</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers have also requested that we comment on the possibility that â<italic>NORAD</italic> has a dual function: as a modulator of PUMILIO factors and as an &quot;assembler&quot; of the NARC1 complexâ. First, our data establish that assembly of the NARC1 complex is neither necessary nor sufficient for the genome maintenance function of <italic>NORAD</italic>. Since deletion of the RBMX binding site does not impair <italic>NORAD</italic> function, assembly of NARC1 is not necessary for genome stability. Moreover, the PUMILIO binding site mutant, which retains the ability to interact with RBMX, behaves as a null in genome stability assays, thus demonstrating that assembly of NARC1 is not sufficient for genome maintenance. In light of these observations, the proposed ability of <italic>NORAD</italic> to assemble the NARC1 complex is not relevant to <italic>NORAD</italic>âs genome maintenance function and therefore we chose not to investigate it deeply in this study. Nevertheless, we have performed a limited number of experiments to examine whether <italic>NORAD</italic> is indeed necessary for the assembly of NARC1, as determined by assessing the interaction of RBMX with TOP1 (the readout of NARC1 assembly described in Munschauer et al.). As shown below, in co-immunoprecipitation assays in <italic>NORAD</italic> wild-type and knockout cells performed using epitope-tagged RBMX (using the conditions described in Munschauer et al.), we detect no difference in RBMX:TOP1 interaction in the absence of <italic>NORAD</italic>. We would prefer not to add these data to our manuscript, however, because this experiment is tangential to our main conclusion, which is that NARC1, whether or not it forms, has no role in the genome maintenance function of <italic>NORAD</italic>. Clearly, substantial additional work would be necessary to establish the conditions, if any, under which <italic>NORAD</italic> stimulates assembly of this complex and its functional relevance.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Co-immunoprecipitation of RBMX and TOP1 in <italic>NORAD</italic>wild-type and knockout cells.</title><p>FLAG-tagged RBMX was stably expressed in HCT116 cells and immunoprecipitated using identical conditions as that described in Munschauer et al., 2018.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48625-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments:</p><p>â¢ The Abstract mentions that much of the prior work published in eLife was in mouse, but should also clarify that the new results are mostly in human cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the Abstract to indicate that the present study utilized human cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Abstract.

However, we agree that it is not clear what fraction of PUM1/2 is actually bound to <italic>NORAD</italic> at any given time, so we have rephrased the sentence to acknowledge that ââ¦it is not yet known whether <italic>NORAD</italic> limits PUM activity through a simple sequestration model or whether additional mechanisms contribute to PUM inhibition.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ &quot;definitively demonstrated that this lncRNA localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm and does not traffic to the nucleus upon induction of DNA damage&quot;.

We believe that this is the most effective means to communicate the results and conclusions of this study. In light of our use of this format, reasonable speculation to provide plausible explanations for disparate results is appropriately located immediately following the presentation of each main experiment. We have edited the text as follows to make it clear that the specific sentence to which the reviewer refers is speculation:</p><p>âWe speculate that the disparate localization pattern observed using a commercially-available RNA FISH probe set (Munschauer et al., 2018) most likely represented a non-specific signal.â</p><p>We do not believe that differences in HCT116 clones provides a likely explanation for the disparate localization patterns observed. The HCT116 cells used in our current and previous localization studies were purchased from ATCC and do not represent a laboratory-specific clone. We and others have reported an identical, cytoplasmic localization pattern in U2OS cells and MEFs (Tichon et al., 2016; Kopp et al., 2019). Moreover, fractionation studies in a large panel of cell lines, including the experiments reported here, have similarly demonstrated cytoplasmic localization of <italic>NORAD</italic> with or without DNA damage (Lee et al., 2016; Tichon et al., 2016; Kopp et al., 2019).</p><p>Similarly, we do not believe that differential accessibility of different probe sets to <italic>NORAD</italic> RNPs in the nucleus or cytoplasm provides a plausible explanation for the disparate localization patterns observed. We and others have previously reported predominantly cytoplasmic localization of <italic>NORAD</italic> using RNA FISH with tiled oligonucleotide probe sets (Lee et al.,2016; Tichon et al.,2016), which is the same type of probe used by Munschauer et al. Our new data generated using in vitro transcribed probes spanning the entire length of <italic>NORAD</italic> further support cytoplasmic localization. Equally importantly, the extensive subcellular fractionation studies reported here and elsewhere (Lee et al., 2016; Tichon et al., 2016; Kopp et al., 2019) further demonstrate cytoplasmic localization of <italic>NORAD</italic> with or without DNA damage, providing a completely independent experimental approach to support this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Results section: &quot;Since these RAP-MS experiments utilized pulse labeling with 4-thiouridine to crosslink NORAD to protein interactors, a bias towards detection of proteins that bind to newly synthesized NORAD would be expected, likely explaining the enrichment of nuclear interactors observed.&quot; This is also speculation and should be moved to the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, this manuscript is formatted with a combined Results and Discussion section.

Why does applying the strategy with three search engines make this difference?</p></disp-quote><p>Because the Munschauer et al. study analyzed the RAP-MS experiment using proprietary software that we do not have access to (Spectrum Mill v6.01 pre-release from Agilent Technologies), we are unable to reproduce their analysis and therefore we cannot state definitively why PUM proteins were not more highly ranked in their reported results. However, several aspects of their analysis are notable and may have contributed to their findings. First, we detect two isoforms for both PUM1 and PUM2. We do not know which isoform they refer to as PUM2 (ranked 185 in their analysis) and they do not comment on the PUM1 ranking (which is significantly higher than PUM2 in our analysis). Second, their ranking is based on fold increase in <italic>NORAD</italic> signal compared to signal observed in RMRP pull-down. We do not think RMRP pull-down is the ideal control since different proteins will exhibit different levels of binding to RMRP which may or may not represent background. Instead, we believe that <italic>NORAD</italic> knockout would have been a better control. Regardless, they chose to set a log<sub>2</sub> fold-increase of 1.6 (<italic>NORAD</italic>/RMRP pull-down), with p &lt; 0.05, as their arbitrary significance threshold. Notably, we observe PUM1 immediately below the enrichment cut-off of log<sub>2</sub> 1.6, with a more significant p-value than RBMX (see Figure 3âfigure supplement 1). Nevertheless, we would prefer not to comment further on their analysis since the data are clear that i) PUM1 and PUM2 are detectable interactors by RAP-MS and ii) these interactions have been confirmed in multiple independent CLIP datasets from human and mouse cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ There are no biological replicates in Figure 2D; why has Figure 2C biological replicates and not Figure 2D?

Because this is a complex figure with many data points, we feel that inclusion of this line aids the reader in distinguishing samples with elevated aneuploidy from those without.
