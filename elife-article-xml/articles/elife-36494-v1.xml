however, the specific contributions of different CART neuronal populations to this process are not known. Here, we show that depolarization of mouse arcuate nucleus (Arc) CART neurons via DREADD technology decreases energy expenditure and physical activity, while it exerts the opposite effects in CART neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LHA). Importantly, when stimulating these neuronal populations in the absence of CART, the effects were attenuated. In contrast, while activation of CART neurons in the LHA stimulated feeding in the presence of CART, endogenous CART inhibited food intake in response to Arc CART neuron activation. Taken together, these results demonstrate anorexigenic but anabolic effects of CART upon Arc neuron activation, and orexigenic but catabolic effects upon LHA-neuron activation, highlighting the complex and nuclei-specific functions of CART in controlling feeding and energy homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CART</kwd><kwd>transgenic mouse models</kwd><kwd>enegry homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CART exerts differential metabolic effects in response to activation of neurons of the Arc, where CART suppresses energy expenditure, while it enforces the reward characteristics of the LHA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neuropeptide cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is encoded by <italic>Cart prepropeptide (Cartpt)</italic> and involved in the regulation of a diverse range of physiological functions including food intake and energy homeostasis, thermoregulation, reward as well as stress processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lau and Herzog, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Subhedar et al., 2014</xref>). While the lack of knowledge on the potential CART receptor(s) hampers insights into the detailed mechanistic processes underlying CART actions, the phenotypes of <italic>Cartpt</italic>-knockout (KO) mice and the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of CART peptides suggest anorexigenic and catabolic actions of CART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lau and Herzog, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kristensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lau et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the administration of CART into specific hypothalamic nuclei demonstrated orexigenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2001</xref>), indicating location-dependent functions of CART.</p><p>In the hypothalamus, both the arcuate nucleus (Arc) and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) show high expression of CART and play a central role in a variety of homeostatic functions, including the regulation of energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lau and Herzog, 2014</xref>). The Arc represents the primary site of the coordination of peripheral signals to integrate nutritional status of the body with other central pathways controlling energy homeostasis, including the ones in the LHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barsh and Schwartz, 2002</xref>). Classically, two populations of neurons located in the Arc are regarded as the main regulators of energy homeostasis, the orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons and the anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, which to some extent coexpress CART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elias et al., 1998a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>). The LHA, in turn, receives projections from the Arc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elias et al., 1999</xref>) and is generally regarded as a critical regulator of feeding, motivated behavior and arousal, given that electrical stimulation of the LHA promotes feeding and reinforcement processes, whereas lesions of the LHA decrease ingestive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stuber and Wise, 2016</xref>). In addition, in situ hybridization studies show high coexpression of <italic>Cartpt</italic> with the orexigenic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH, encoded by <italic>Pmch</italic>) and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67, encoded by <italic>Gad1</italic>) in the LHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vrang, 2006</xref>), supporting the anabolic actions of LHA CART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, recent findings from our laboratory show that CART neuron-specific reintroduction of CART in the Arc or LHA in otherwise CART-deficient mice exerts differential effects on energy expenditure, while food intake was not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2018</xref>), highlighting the importance and differential responses to regional actions of CART.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of CART neuron activation to the regulation of energy expenditure focusing on the Arc and LHA, respectively.

In line with the downregulated energy expenditure, the decrease in locomotion mainly spanned the period of 2–6 hr (07:00 – 11:00 pm) post-CNO injection. Investigation of fuel source preference indexed by the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) showed no noticeable difference between saline and CNO treatments throughout the light and dark photoperiods, in either genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the dependence on endogenous CART for the decrease in energy expenditure, we measured body temperature parameters in response to CNO treatment in these mice by high-sensitivity infrared imaging. Importantly, while no change of temperature was observed in Arc→hM3Dq <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/cre</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), a significant decrease in the skin temperature above the area of the brown adipose tissue (BAT) and lumbar back region was detected in the Arc→hM3Dq <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> mice after CNO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is consistent with the observed decrease in energy expenditure in the presence of CART in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In order to assess the contribution of BAT to overall body temperature, we calculated the difference between BAT and lumbar temperatures. CNO-induced Arc→hM3Dq CART neuron activation did not lead to a change in the differences between BAT and lumbar temperatures compared to saline controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>right panels), indicating that both BAT and lumbar temperature decreased to the same extent upon Arc→hM3Dq CART neuronal activation. These results suggest that the observed decrease in skin temperature is not due to a specific change in BAT thermogenic activity. Furthermore, the observation that the decrease in temperature is paralleled by a decrease in physical activity suggests that decreased activity-related thermogenesis may at least in part contribute to the observed temperature changes.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36494.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>CNO-mediated activation of hM3Dq-containing Arc CART neurons leads to a decrease in body skin temperature in <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>Temperatures of the interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the lumbar back region, as well as the temperature differences between the inter-scapular and lumbar areas 2 hr following saline or CNO injection, measured by high-sensitivity infrared imaging in Arc→hM3Dq <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/cre</sup></italic> (<bold>A</bold>) and Arc→hM3Dq <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> mice (<bold>B</bold>).

Activation of Arc CART neurons leads to significant decreases in energy expenditure, locomotion and body temperature, and these effects are solely due to the contribution of CART since they are absent in Arc→hM3Dq <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/cre</sup></italic> mice that are devoid of endogenous CART. Furthermore, while food intake is not affected by activation of intact Arc CART neurons, activation of these neurons in the absence of CART leads to an increase in feeding, suggesting an inhibitory role of CART in these neurons by opposing the orexigenic action of other co-expressing neurotransmitter(s). In contrast, activation of LHA CART neurons results in a marked increase in energy expenditure, locomotion, body temperature and feeding. Although these effects induced by LHA CART neuronal activation can be achieved regardless of the presence or absence of CART, the presence of CART allows these responses to occur under lower level of activation (i.e. unilateral activation) and at a greater magnitude than in the absence of CART, indicating that CART is the predominant neurotransmitter responsible for these effects.</p><p>CART is classically considered to be an anorectic and catabolic neuropeptide, given that i.c.v. administration of CART decreases food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kristensen et al., 1998</xref>) and <italic>Cartpt</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice display increased body weight gain and adipose mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lau et al., 2016</xref>). However, the i.c.v delivery of CART triggers an uncoordinated and widespread simultaneous activation of CART signaling not reflecting the normal release sequence caused by physiological processes such as hunger or satiety. Similarly, global CART gene KO does not necessarily reveal the specific contributions of different populations of CART neurons in the hypothalamus and can also be plagued by developmental induced compensation.</p><p>Furthermore, typical neuromodulators of energy balance exert opposing effects on food intake and energy expenditure in order to enable homeostasis (e.g. increasing food intake, while concurrently reducing energy expenditure in response to energy deficiency) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bray, 2000</xref>). Interestingly, CART in the present work does not exert these classical opposing effects on food intake and energy expenditure. Therefore, we conclude that the actions of CART in the context of this study cannot be classified as purely anabolic or catabolic. However, considering body weight alteration as the major consequence of food intake and energy expenditure, we propose that actions of CART in response to LHA CART neuron activation are largely obesigenic, while actions of CART in response to Arc CART neuron activation are mainly leptogenic. These differential effects of CART in the Arc and LHA are also mirrored by coexpression of CART with anorexigenic and orexigenic neuropeptides in the Arc and LHA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lau and Herzog, 2014</xref>) as well as opposing expressional regulation of CART in these hypothalamic nuclei in response to orexigenic and anorexigenic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sergeyev et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, high fat diet-induced obese mice have reduced <italic>Cartpt</italic> expression in the Arc, but increased <italic>Cartpt</italic> expression in the LHA compared to mice that are resistant to high fat-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, inflammation-associated anorexia is associated with increased <italic>Cartpt</italic> expression in the Arc, whereas <italic>Cartpt</italic> expression in the LHA is decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sergeyev et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the regulation of energy balance, changes in ambient temperature typically affect food intake and energy expenditure in the same direction, thus lower ambient temperatures increase energy expenditure through adaptive thermogenesis as well as food intake in order to maintain energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lowell and Spiegelman, 2000</xref>). The Arc has been demonstrated to be an important regulator of energy balance in response to changes in ambient temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Suwanapaporn et al., 2017</xref>) and in line with this notion we have previously reported an increase in Arc <italic>Cartpt</italic> expression at thermo-neutral conditions as compared to room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lau et al., 2016</xref>). The observed increase in Arc <italic>Cartpt</italic> expression was associated with decreased energy expenditure, physical activity as well as food intake at thermo-neutral conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lau et al., 2016</xref>). The results of the current study confirm this previous association, and provide novel functional evidence for an important role for Arc CART that might be of importance for regulating energy balance in response to varying ambient temperatures.</p><p>The results presented here are also in accordance with our previous study, where we observed reduced body weight gain following reintroduction of CART into the Arc of otherwise CART-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2018</xref>). While the weight loss due to reintroduction of CART in the Arc of CART-deficient mice was associated with an increase in energy expenditure with unchanged feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2018</xref>), the CART-dependent Arc→hM3Dq CART neuron activation in <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> mice attenuated the weight gain and increased food intake otherwise seen in <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/cre</sup></italic> mice, indicating differential modes of action of Arc CART in response to neuronal activation versus chronic overproduction. Interestingly, similar to the results from the Arc CART groups, differential effects on energy expenditure were induced in response to LHA→hM3Dq CART neuron activation as compared to CART reintroduction in the LHA, which led to decreased energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2018</xref>), again indicating the context-dependent actions of CART. As the reintroduction of CART was associated with changes in mRNA expression of hypothalamic peptides that likely contributed to the overall effects on energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2018</xref>), it can be concluded that the present study reveals the actions of CART in response to acute neuronal activation without confounding expression changes in other neuropeptides, which would otherwise occur in response to chronic changes in CART expression. In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that the effects of spontaneous neurotransmitter release can remarkably differ from an evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rau and Hentges, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Another interesting observation of this study is that Arc→hM3Dq CART neuron activation induces an increase in food intake in the absence of endogenous CART. Considering that CART is partly co-expressed with the anorexigenic POMC in the Arc, this is surprising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vrang, 2006</xref>). While pharmacogenetic activation of POMC-expressing neurons has been reported to decrease food intake, a chronic stimulation of Arc POMC neurons was required to induce this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhan et al., 2013</xref>). However, recent single-cell gene expression analysis revealed a larger heterogeneity of neuronal cell types in both the Arc and the LHA than previously appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mickelsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lam et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, the orexigenic AgRP neurons in the Arc also express, low, but detectable levels of CART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lam et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that Arc→hM3Dq CART neurons reside not solely with the anorexigenic POMC neurons, but also to some extent with the orexigenic NPY/AgRP neurons. Thus, actions from other local neuropeptides elicited upon Arc→hM3Dq CART neuron stimulation may explain in part the elevated food intake observed in <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/cre</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>Our results reveal an orexigenic effect of CART in the LHA, given that LHA CART neuronal activation induced greater orexigenic responses in the presence of CART. This finding is consistent with our previous report demonstrating orexigenic effects of LHA CART-reintroduction in <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/cre</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2018</xref>), and also in line with a reported association between elevated CART expression in the LHA and increased feeding and body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, while the LHA is a region known to induce food intake and behavioral activation as shown by electrical stimulation of the LHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stuber and Wise, 2016</xref>), our results of orexigenic responses induced by LHA CART neuronal activation regardless of the presence of CART suggest a pivotal role of this neuronal population in mediating the metabolic and behavioral effects of the LHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stuber and Wise, 2016</xref>). Although the CART-expressing neuronal population of the LHA has been classically reported to be GABA-ergic and mainly co-expressed with MCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elias et al., 2001</xref>), novel techniques indicate a larger heterogeneity of LHA neurons, highlighting that the precise neurochemical profiles of CART neurons and their potential diverse functions remain to be characterized in more detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonnavion et al., 2016</xref>). For instance, LHA CART neurons have been found to co-express to a small extent at mRNA but not at the protein level with orexin (<italic>Hcrt</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mickelsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kosse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mavanji et al., 2015</xref>), another neuropeptide of the LHA that promotes food intake, physical activity and energy expenditure. Interestingly, results from our immunohistochemistry and TRAP-qPCR experiments confirm these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mickelsen et al., 2017</xref>) showing co-localisation of orexin at the mRNA level but not at the protein level. While identifying co-localisation of a variety of other neurotransmitters, we did not see any enrichment of <italic>Gal</italic> and only a weak enrichment of <italic>Slc32a1</italic>, which is in line with a recent single-cell gene expression analysis finding genes needed for GABA synthesis (<italic>Gad1, Gad2</italic>), but not for vesicular GABA release (<italic>Slc32a1</italic>) in both MCH and orexin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mickelsen et al., 2017</xref>). The great variety of different enriched genes in the current study indicates that CART neurons in the LHA are highly heterogeneous and many different subpopulations of CART neurons may exist contributing to the spectrum of different functions seen for these CART neurons in the LHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonnavion et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, LHA CART has recently been demonstrated to facilitate goal-directed behavior and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Somalwar et al., 2017</xref>), consistent with the activity-promoting effects of CART following LHA→hM3Dq CART neuron activation observed in our study. We therefore propose, that in contrast to the function of CART in the Arc, but in line with the differential effects of CART in different neuronal population, CART enforces the reward characteristics of the LHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sternson and Eiselt, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our study demonstrates the differential metabolic effects of endogenous CART in response to pharmacogenetic activation of neurons of the Arc or LHA. The findings from this study reinforce CART’s multifaceted context-dependent and region-specific functions in the modulation of feeding, thermoregulation and energy balance. Interestingly, apparent dissociation between the effects of CART on food intake and energy expenditure was unraveled in response to neuronal activation. Specifically, the presence of CART blunted the otherwise increase in food intake and body weight gain in response to Arc→hM3Dq CART neuron activation, while at the same time decreasing locomotion and energy expenditure. Opposite effects were observed in response to LHA→hM3Dq CART neuron activation, where the presence of CART promoted food intake and ingestive behavior, while increasing locomotion and energy expenditure. From a behavioral perspective, it could also be inferred that endogenous CART promotes a state of behavioral inhibition in response to Arc→hM3Dq CART neuron activation, while promoting behavioral activation in response to LHA→hM3Dq CART neuron activation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (mouse)</td><td valign="bottom">B6;129S4-Gt(ROSA)26 <break/>Sortm9(EGFP/Rpl10a) <break/>Amc/J Mus musculus</td><td>JAX</td><td>IMSR <break/>Cat# JAX:024750, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:024750">IMSR_JAX:024750</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (mouse)</td><td valign="bottom">C57BL/6J-Tg(Zp3-cre) <break/>82Knw/KnwJ Mus <break/>musculus</td><td>JAX</td><td>IMSR <break/>Cat# JAX:003650, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:003650">IMSR_JAX:003650</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="bottom">anti-c-Fos <break/>polyclonal</td><td>Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnologies</td><td valign="bottom">Santa Cruz Biotechnology <break/>Cat# sc-52-G <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2629503">AB_2629503</ext-link></td><td>(1:1500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td>anti-GAD67 <break/>monoclonal</td><td>Millipore</td><td valign="bottom">Millipore <break/>Cat# MAB5406 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2278725">AB_2278725</ext-link></td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td>anti-MCH <break/>polyclonal</td><td>Phoenix <break/>Pharmaceuticals</td><td valign="bottom">Phoenix Pharmaceuticals <break/>Cat# H-070–47 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10013632">AB_10013632</ext-link></td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td valign="bottom">anti-orexin <break/>polyclonal</td><td valign="bottom">Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnologies</td><td valign="bottom">Santa Cruz Biotechnology <break/>Cat# sc-8070 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_653610">AB_653610</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td>anti-GFP</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific <break/>Cat# A-11122 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_221569">AB_221569</ext-link></td><td>(10ug/TRAP experiment)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa 488 <break/>secondary <break/>anti-rabbit</td><td>Molecular <break/>Probes</td><td valign="bottom">Molecular Probes <break/>Cat# A-11094 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_221544">AB_221544</ext-link></td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa 488 <break/>secondary <break/>anti-goat</td><td>Molecular <break/>Probes</td><td>Molecular Probes <break/>Cat# A-11073 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_142018">AB_142018</ext-link></td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa 488 <break/>secondary <break/>anti-mouse</td><td>Molecular <break/>Probes <break/></td><td valign="bottom">Molecular Probes <break/>Cat# A-21202 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_141607">AB_141607</ext-link></td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Fluoroshield <break/>with DAPI</td><td valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich <break/>Cat# F6057</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>SYBR Green I Nucleic Acid <break/>Gel Stain -

The time point of injection was, however, preponed to 12:00 pm, in order to unveil potential LHA→hM3Dq-induced increases of ingestive behavior, which could be otherwise overlaid by the physiologic increase of food intake at dark onset.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Indirect calorimetry of energy expenditure and assessment of physical activity</title><p>To determine the metabolic effects of activating specific hypothalamic CART neuron populations, all <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> mice with Arc→hM3Dq or LHA→hM3Dq (n ≥ 6 for each of 4 groups) were evaluated for metabolic parameters and physical activity at 17–18 wks of age. For energy metabolism, metabolic rate of the unilateral injected cohorts was measured by indirect calorimetry using an 8-chamber open-circuit calorimeter (Oxymax series; Columbus Instruments) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2018</xref>). At 5:00 pm before dark onset, mice were i.p. injected with either saline or CNO (0.3 mg/kg of BW). Monitoring and data recording was then performed for 24 hr in the metabolic chambers, where the individually housed mice were provided ad libitum access to water and chow food in pellet form. At the end of the 24 hr recording session at 5:00 pm the next day, the same experiment was immediately repeated in a crossover design, such that mice receiving saline treatment before were i.p. injected with CNO, and vice versa. Mice were immediately placed back into the metabolic chambers after injection, and data were recorded for the next 24 hr until 5:00 pm the following day. For both 24 hr intervals, body weight was noted and food given in excess was weighed before and after the recording period for measuring daily food intake after subtraction of spillage.</p><p>For the bilateral injected cohort indirect calorimetry was performed within the Promethion metabolic cages (Promethion<sup>TM</sup>, Sable Systems International, NV USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaiyala et al., 2012</xref>).

Temperature measurement was performed daily for three consecutive days in 19–20-week-old mice. On the first day, all mice were injected with saline, as a habituation to the injection procedure. On day 2 and three mice were alternately i.p. injected with saline or CNO (0.3 mg/kg of BW). Temperature was measured 2 hr after injection for the unilateral injected hM3Dq cohorts.

Reagents used here were the same as those reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loh et al., 2017</xref>), unless stated otherwise. Freshly excised whole brain tissue was placed into chilled dissection buffer supplemented with fresh 100 ug/mL of cycloheximide (CHX; Sigma). Subsequently the LHA was micro-dissected and immediately processed further for the TRAP experiment. The dissected brain tissues were homogenized with a hand pestle mixer (Argos Technologies) in 500 μL of tissue lysis buffer supplemented with fresh protease inhibitor (Roche), CHX and RNAsin (Promega), and then incubated at 4°C for 5 min. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 x g at 4°C to remove pellet nuclei and cell debris, and then 50 μL of the 10% NP-40 (10 %vol/vol; Biochemica) and DHPC (300 mM; Avanti Polar Lipids) were added to the supernatant and mixed gently by inverting the mixture for 10 times. After incubation on ice for 5 min, the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 x g. 20% of the lysate was kept as input. For the preparation of the antibody-beads, 50 μL protein G Dynal magnetic beads (Invitrogen) were washed three times with 0.15 M KCl buffer at room temperature (RT), and then 5 uL of anti-GFP antibody (2 μg/ μL; Invitrogen) was added into the beads and incubated with beads suspended in 275 uL of KCl buffer for 1 hr at RT with mild end-to-end rotation. Next, the antibody-bound beads were collected by using the magnetic rack and washed three times with 0.15 M KCl buffer before use. The beads were then mixed with the cell-lysate supernatant, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C with mild end-to-end rotation overnight. Beads were subsequently collected on a magnetic rack, washed three times with 0.35 M KCl buffer supplemented with fresh CHX at 4°C, and immediately placed in 350 μL of RNA lysis buffer (RLT; Qiagen) supplemented with 10% of 2-mercaptoethanol at RT and incubated for 5 min. Next, the RLT-containing RNA was purified with the RNeasy microKit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s protocol. DNase digestion step was included in the purification. RNA quantification and purity were confirmed by NanoDrop Spectrophotometers. 40 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.

They report opposite effects following depolarization of Arc CART versus LHA CART, with Arc CART neurons decreasing, while LHA CART increasing, energy expenditure and physical activity, effects that are attenuated in the absence of CART. They also show different effects on food intake following activation of those CART populations. They conclude that activation of Arc CART neurons produces anorexigenic but catabolic effects, while activation of LHA CART produces orexigenic but catabolic effects. Overall, the manuscript reads well and presents novel results clarifying CART neurons' role in energy metabolism. However, the reviewer enthusiasm is limited by the fact that the study is still descriptive in nature and is at some extent confusing to follow.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Figure 1 is not conveying the point they are trying to make. The authors could add additional rostro-caudal pictures allowing a better reflection of the infection pattern. Moreover, the pictures show a very lateral injection pattern, especially for the Arc.

These figures include rostro-caudal pictures reflecting the infection pattern of the Arc and LHA injection sites (Figure 1A,B) as well as improved c-Fos micrographs showing CNO-induced c-Fos expression in hM3Dq-mCherry-positive CART neurons. The expression pattern are in agreement with our previous in situ analysis (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.npep.2016.03.006) and also reflects our cautious approach to aim our injections on the fringe of the Arc to let the viral vector to diffuse into it rather than causing major tissue damage through the needle track. Moreover, the significant alterations seen in the different physiological readouts in the injected versus the controls are testimony for the accuracy of our viral delivery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Injecting mice with empty vectors is not the only control needed.

These negative controls are now described in more detail in the Results section and the lack of responses in WT mice receiving DREADD viruses and CNO are presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 9—figure supplement 1 and Figure 10—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Activation of Arc CART neurons (in Cartpt<sup>cre/+</sup> mice – I assume this means that they had some CART?) reduced energy expenditure, skin temperature over intrascapular BAT depots, and physical activity.

Indeed, one has to be cautious when interpreting measurements of surface (skin) temperature covering the inter-scapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a measure of BAT thermogenesis. In fact, temperature differences between the inter-scapular and lumbar areas from the same animal (TBAT-TBack) are a better measure of the thermogenic contribution of inter-scapular brown adipose tissue. For that reason, we now also present this TBAT-TBack temperature difference in response to Arc CART neuron activation (Figure 3). As there is no significant difference between the changes in surface temperature of the BAT and lumbar regions, we conclude that the observed decrease in surface (skin) temperature is not due to a specific change in BAT thermogenic activity. Furthermore, the observation that the decrease in temperature is paralleled by a decrease in physical activity suggests that decreased activity related thermogenesis may at least in part contribute to the observed temperature changes. This aspect is now also addressed in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The mouse models description is very confusing: what germline CART KO was used?

In short, all mice are on a C57Bl/6 background. To generate the CART Cre knock-in line, we crossed our mice with a floxed CART gene that downstream also contained an inducible Cre-recombinase cassette with a germline oozyte (ZP3-Cre) line resulting in the removal of the CART coding sequence and its simultaneous replacement with the downstream inducible Cre-recombinase gene, which now is under the control of the endogenous CART promoter. The germline CART KO mice were generated by crossing these heterozygous CART Cre knock-in mice to homozygousity. To activate the CART promoter controlled Cre-recombinase gene the active hydroxyl tamoxifen was injected icv.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Apparently, the energy balance measurements were only acutely performed, which limits the speculation on the effects of CART neurons in the regulation of energy balance.

While the potential chronic treatment with CNO is a possible addition we believe this would not add significant additional information to the already extensive evaluation of these models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Neuroanatomical experiments to further describe the identity of CART neurons (particularly in the LHA) would have added useful information to determine whether the LHA CART neurons are part of circuitries genuinely involved in energy homeostasis regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>To further characterise the nature of the LHA CART neurons we employed IHC colocalisation experiments as well as ribosomal affinity purification technology (TRAP). For this, GFP-L10a fusion protein encoding Rosa26CAG-EGFP (TRAP) mice were crossed onto our <italic>Cartpt<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>mice to generate the <italic>CART<sup>cre/+</sup>;TRAP<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice (CART-TRAP), where the ribosomal L10a-GFP fusion protein is only produced in CART neurons (Figure 12A).</p><p>qPCR performed on mRNA isolated by immunoprecipitation with an anti-GFP antibody against the GFP-tagged ribosomal unit from LHA preparations of these mice confirmed a significant enrichment of <italic>Cartpt</italic> transcript in the immunoprecipitated (IP) RNA relative to the corresponding unprocessed RNA (Input) sample (Figure 12B). Using a candidate approach, we tested for the enrichment of known markers that are involved in energy homeostasis control including MCH and galanin, GABAergic markers and neurotensin.</p><p>Interestingly, there was overlap with all of these other neuropeptides except galanin, suggesting that CART neurons in the LH are highly heterogeneous and co-localise with various neuropeptides within the LHA. This great heterogeneity in CART neurons could be one of the reasons for the great spectrum of functional output from these LHA CART neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Activation of CART neurons in the LHA of Cartpt<sup>cre/+</sup> mice increased energy expenditure and physical activity, but did not alter dermal temperature over the scapulae. It also increased food intake.
