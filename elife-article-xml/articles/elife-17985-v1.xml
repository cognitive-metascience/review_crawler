regulation across eukaryotic species. We now describe an unexpected role of Pask in promoting the differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells and adipogenic progenitor cells. This function of Pask is dependent upon its ability to phosphorylate Wdr5, a member of several protein complexes including those that catalyze histone H3 Lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) during transcriptional activation. Our findings suggest that, during myoblast differentiation, Pask stimulates the conversion of repressive H3K4me1 to activating H3K4me3 marks on the promoter of the differentiation gene myogenin (<italic>Myog</italic>) via Wdr5 phosphorylation. This enhances accessibility of the MyoD transcription factor and enables transcriptional activation of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter to initiate muscle differentiation. Thus, as an upstream kinase of Wdr5, Pask integrates signaling cues with the transcriptional network to regulate the differentiation of progenitor cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17985.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17985.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>PASK</kwd><kwd>WDR5</kwd><kwd>muscle differentiation</kwd><kwd>MyoD</kwd><kwd>myogenin</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01DK071962-08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rutter</surname><given-names>Jared</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post Doctoral Training Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kikani</surname><given-names>Chintan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PASK phosphorylates Wdr5 to trigger epigenetic changes at lineage specifying promoters resulting in transcriptional derepression and differentiation of stem or progenitor cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pask (<underline>PAS</underline> domain containing protein <underline>K</underline>inase) is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase that has been implicated in signaling to coordinate nutrient sensing with metabolic control across eukaryotic phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hao and Rutter, 2008</xref>). The principal modality by which mammalian Pask appears to exert metabolic control is the regulation of gene expression. For example, Pask was shown to regulate the synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides in the liver via activation of Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein-1 (SREBP-1) transcriptional activity in response to feeding and insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Probably related to this function, pharmacologic inhibition or genetic ablation of Pask resulted in decreased liver fat content and improved insulin sensitivity in rodent models of diabetes and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). In pancreatic Î²-cells, Pask responds to extracellular glucose and stimulates the transcription of the gene encoding insulin via regulation of the PDX-1 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Semache et al., 2013</xref>). In spite of these observations, it has remained unclear how Pask coordinates these seemingly diverse transcriptional responses in different cell types.</p><p>Pask is expressed at a low level in most adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katschinski et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, we noticed anÂ elevated <italic>Pask</italic> mRNA abundance in stem or progenitor cell types in several transcriptome datasets. Using genetic and pharmacologic means of modulating Pask activity, we have uncovered a novel function of Pask in regulating the differentiation of stem and progenitor cells into neuronal, adipocytes or myocytes lineages. The mechanism underlying this role depends upon direct phosphorylation of Wdr5, which is a component of several chromatin modifying complexes, including mixed lineage leukemia (Mll) histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wysocka et al., 2005</xref>). Wdr5 is a histone H3 binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wysocka et al., 2005</xref>) that is postulated to present the H3âN-terminal tail to the Mll or Set1 enzymes for methylation at lysine 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruthenburg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schuetz et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Lysine 4 of Histone H3 is sequentially methylated to the mono- (H3K4me1), di- (H3K4me2) and tri-methyl (H3K4me3) forms by methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shilatifard, 2012</xref>). H3K4me1 is typically found at enhancers, which are binding sites for regulatory DNA-binding transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>). However, a recent study demonstrated that H3K4me1 functions as a transcriptional repressive mark at the promoters of lineage specifying genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, H3K4me3 marks are usually associated with transcriptionally active promoters, or with poised promoters when found together with repressive H3K27me3 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>). These histone modifications collaborate with pioneering transcription factors to elicit programs of gene expression that drive differentiation of stem and progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>). Using myogenic progenitor cells as a model of inducible differentiation, we show that phosphorylation of a single Wdr5 serine by Pask is necessary and sufficient for the conversion of repressive H3K4me1 marks to activating H3K4me3 marks at the lineage-specifying myogenin (<italic>Myog</italic>) promoter. This concomitantly enhances MyoD recruitment and chromatin remodeling of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter and stimulates transcription of <italic>Myog</italic> to initiate terminal differentiation. Taken together, our results establish Wdr5 phosphorylation by Pask as an important node in the signaling and transcriptional network that initiates and executes differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pask is required for terminal differentiation in multiple cell lineages in vitroÂ and muscle regeneration in vivo</title><p>As part of our ongoing study of the regulation and function of Pask, we examined <italic>Pask</italic> mRNA abundance in several publicly available gene expression datasets. We observed elevated <italic>Pask</italic> mRNA across diverse stem and progenitor cell types compared to differentiated cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). For example, <italic>Pask</italic> was more abundant in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and progenitor cell types such as C2C12 myoblasts, C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells, Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells and immune progenitor cells compared to mouse embryonic fibroblasts, other somatic cell types and adult tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>) (BioGPS:Pask, GeneAtlas MOE430). Furthermore, we noticed an increase in <italic>Pask</italic> expression during reprogramming of hepatocytes, fibroblasts and melanocytes to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The increased <italic>Pask</italic> expression in iPSCs was comparable to the abundance observed in undifferentiated ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohi et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, terminal differentiation of human ESCs into cardiac muscle resulted in a progressive decline in theÂ <italic>Pask</italic> expression before ultimately reaching the low abundance found in the adult heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2008</xref>) suggesting a positive correlation between <italic>Pask</italic> expression and stemness.</p><p>In examining potential drivers of <italic>Pask</italic> expression in transcription factor ChIP-Seq databases from mouse ESCs, we noticed that the <italic>Pask</italic> promoter was occupied by the Oct4 and Nanog pluripotency transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marson et al., 2008</xref>). The Oct4 and Nanog binding region of the <italic>Pask</italic> promoter is evolutionarily conserved and is decorated in ESCs with transcriptionally favorable histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and H3 Lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) modifications and RNA Polymerase II recruitment, suggestive of transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karlic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moorefield, 2013</xref>). Silencing of Oct4 or Nanog in ES cells resulted in modest, but statistically significant, suppression of <italic>Pask</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loh et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, gene expression and promoter analysis suggest robust stem and progenitor cell-specific expression of <italic>Pask</italic>, possibly driven by the Oct4 and Nanog transcription factors, in embryonic stem cells.</p><p>To determine if this high <italic>Pask</italic> expression in stem cells, including in iPSCs, is indicative of Pask being functionally important for either iPSC generation or differentiation, we first assessed the effect of Pask inhibition on iPSC reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Extensive studies using in vitro, cell and animal models have established the Pask selectivity and lack of toxicity of the BioE-1197 Pask inhibitor, making it a reliable and acute means of suppressing Pask activity in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). In the presence or absence of BioE-1197, we induced reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing IRES-driven Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) from the endogenous <italic>Pou5f1 (Oct4</italic>) locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lengner et al., 2007</xref>), which enables robust GFP expression upon successful reprogramming. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3AâB</xref>, Pask inhibition had no effect on theÂ GFP<sup>+</sup> colony formation, indicating that Pask is dispensable for iPSC reprogramming.</p><p>We next examined the necessity of Pask for differentiation of pluripotent ES cells into neurons using retinoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2009</xref>) in the presence or absence of BioE-1197. Differentiation in control cells caused Oct4 expression to be lost and increased expression of the neuron-specific Glycine Receptor Alpha 1 (Glra1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). In contrast, each of these signs of terminal differentiation was lost or blunted by treatment with BioE-1197 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2H</xref>), suggesting a necessity of Pask for neuronal differentiation of ES cells.</p><p>Progenitor cells such as C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells and C2C12 myoblasts also robustly express <italic>Pask</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). C3H10T1/2 cells differentiate into adipocytes in response to appropriate signaling cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pinney and Emerson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reznikoff et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). To determine if Pask is required for theÂ differentiation of these progenitor cells similar to neuronal differentiation of ES cells, we treated C3H10T1/2 cells with adipogenic stimuli in the presence or absence of BioE-1197. Vehicle-treated control cells efficiently differentiated into mature adipocytes, as evidenced by theÂ accumulation of lipid droplets in more than 80% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, Pask inhibition greatly impaired adipocyte differentiation, as only about 10% of cells contained observable lipid droplets. We also observed impaired expression of the <italic>Adipoq</italic> and <italic>Fabp4</italic> adipocyte markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) in BioE-1197 treated samples compared with DMSO control. BioE-1197 had no effect on cell doubling time in proliferative C3H10T1/2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>We also evaluated the necessity of Pask for differentiation of mouse C2C12 muscle progenitor cells, which differentiate into multi-nucleated muscle fibers in response to horse serum or insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, control) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yaffe and Saxel, 1977</xref>). Pooled siRNA knockdown or inhibition of Pask strongly impaired the formation of multi-nucleated myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). Similarly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated <italic>Pask</italic> mutation also resulted in suppression of insulin-induced differentiation as indicated by the absence of multi-nucleated myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A</xref>, quantified in 4B) and prevented the induction of myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4C</xref>). In addition, BioE-1197 treatment also blunted the induction of myosin heavy chain in human primary myoblasts in response to both horse serum and insulin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4D</xref>). Similar to mouse myoblasts, induction of human <italic>MYLPF</italic> (myosin light chain) and <italic>ACTA1</italic> (skeletal muscle actin) mRNAs was also blunted or abrogated by Pask inhibition during differentiation of human myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17985.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pask is required for skeletal muscle regeneration after acute muscle injury.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts was assessed after Pask was either knocked down using pooled siRNA or inhibited using 25Â ÂµM BioE-1197.Â Control cells were transfected with pooled non-targeting siRNA.

Importantly, this effect appears to be cell autonomous as only that fraction of cells in the population that express WT Pask (WT<sup>+</sup>) show rescue of the fusion defect, whereas cells not expressing hPask within the same culture (WT<sup>-</sup>) remained mono-nucleated and fusion defective. Additionally, <italic>Mylpf</italic> (myosin light chain) and <italic>Acta1</italic> mRNAs, which are both markers of myoblast differentiation, failed to be induced in <italic>Pask</italic> knockdown cells. Expression of both genes was rescued by expression of WT but not KD human PASK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the proliferation and differentiation of primary myoblasts isolated from hindlimb muscles of WT and <italic>Pask<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice in the presence or absence of BioE-1197. Under proliferative culture conditions, neither genetic deletion nor inhibition of Pask had any effect on theÂ proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). In response to differentiation cues, myoblasts derived from WT mice efficiently formed multi-nucleated myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In contrast, genetic elimination of Pask (i.e. myoblasts derived from germline <italic>Pask<sup>-/-Â </sup></italic>mice) caused a ~60% decrease in differentiation efficiency. Interestingly, the effect of Pask inhibition in WT cells was much more pronounced, almost completely eliminating myotube formation. BioE-1197 had no effect, however, on <italic>Pask</italic><sup>-/-</sup> myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This result demonstrates that the effects of the BioE-1197 Pask inhibitor are completely dependent on the presence of Pask, a clear indication that these effects are mediated by Pask inhibition. Moreover, these results demonstrate that myoblasts derived from germline <italic>Pask<sup>-/-Â </sup></italic>mice exhibit a Pask-independent compensation that appears, at least in vitro, to partially rescue myotube formation.</p><p>The myoblast differentiation process is activated in vivo to repair and replenish the myotome after muscle injury. During muscle regeneration, satellite cells become activated, proliferate and eventually fuse in response to differentiating signals to restore mature myotubes. We observed that as early as 3 days post injury, PASK mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) expression was robustly upregulated. This is consistent with high Pask expression in stem cells compared with differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), since muscle stem cells begin to proliferate upon muscle injury before eventually fusing to replenish the injured myotome. To test the functional relevance of increased <italic>Pask</italic> expression during muscle regeneration, we compared the kinetics of muscle regeneration in WT and <italic>Pask</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, whereas Myh3, a marker of regenerative myogenesis, was robustly induced as early as Day 5 in WT animals, <italic>Pask</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals showed very little induction of Myh3 expression. Similarly, WT animals show robust induction of Myh3 immunohistochemical staining, but this was blunted in <italic>Pask</italic><sup>-/-</sup> muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).

The effects of loss of Pask activity were most obvious in the appearance of MyoG<sup>+</sup> cells during differentiation. In control cells, the fraction of MyoG<sup>+</sup> cells dramatically increased from Day 0 (~7%) to Day 1 (~60%) and Day 2 (~80%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, quantified in 2G, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>). MyoG<sup>+</sup> cell numbers were substantially reduced by either Pask inhibition or knockdown. We also noticed a striking correlation of Pask and MyoG expression. At Day 1, we observed a strong co-expression between Pask and MyoG, wherein ~50% of Pask<sup>+</sup> cells were MyoG<sup>+</sup> whereas only ~15% of Pask<sup>-</sup> cells were MyoG<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). As expected, inhibition of Pask function with BioE-1197 eliminated this correlation, with both populations losing MyoG staining. Importantly, in the <italic>Pask</italic> knockdown samples, MyoG expression was present almost exclusively in those cells in the population that escaped <italic>Pask</italic> silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>Both the increase in Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells and the decrease in MyoG<sup>+</sup> cells observed upon <italic>Pask</italic> knockdown were completely rescued by expression of WT hPask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Surprisingly, transient over-expression of human Pask, even in the absence of extrinsic differentiation cues, was sufficient to induce formation of multi-nucleated myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>) and to induce the entire differentiation transcriptional program in growth medium (GM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). This included suppression of <italic>Pax7</italic> as well as induction of <italic>Myod, Myog</italic> and <italic>Mylpf</italic>. Addition of differentiation medium (DM) further enhanced myoblast differentiation in hPask-expressing cells, as evidenced by the elevated expression of <italic>Myog</italic> and <italic>Mylpf</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Together, these data establish Pask as necessary for the timely execution of the terminal differentiation program in myoblasts and as sufficient to initiate that program even in the absence of extrinsic differentiation signals.</p><p>The robust cell autonomous correlation between Pask and MyoG expression is probably a reflection of the necessity of Pask for MyoG expression, but it also prompted us to explore the possibility that MyoG might also regulate Pask expression during differentiation. Interestingly, previous ChIP-Seq data had suggested that MyoG, and to a lesser extent MyoD, occupies the <italic>Pask</italic> promoter during C2C12 differentiation coincident with H3K4me3 modification and RNA-PolII recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yue et al., 2014</xref>). We independently validated that MyoG was indeed recruited to the proximal <italic>Pask</italic> promoter upon initiation of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3B</xref>) and that MyoG expression stimulates expression from a <italic>Pask</italic> promoter-driven reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). These data suggest the possibility that <italic>Pask</italic> expression in differentiating myoblasts might be driven by MyoG to further support commitment to differentiate. Thus, taken together, our data show that Pask and MyoG engage in a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop to enforce the terminal differentiation program once it has been signaled to initiate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pask collaborates with MyoD to drive MyoG expression and myogenesis</title><p>The gene expression data presented above suggest the possibility that either failure to suppress Pax7 expression or failure to induce MyoG expression underlies the differentiation defect caused by the absence of active Pask. Because Pask protein expression correlated most strongly with that of MyoG and MyoG is known to repress Pax7 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olguin et al., 2007</xref>), we hypothesized that Pask collaborates with MyoD to induce MyoG expression. MyoD is a pioneering transcription factor that is sufficient to induce a myogenic cell fate even in non-muscle progenitor cells. C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells normally express the Peroxisome proliferator-receptor activated gamma 2 (PPARÎ³2) adipogenic transcription factor and efficiently differentiate into adipocytes in response to adipogenic differentiation cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, MyoD-induced expression of <italic>Myog</italic> and <italic>Mylpf</italic> was impaired by Pask inhibition while <italic>MyoD</italic> expression was unaffected.

In addition, as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy, the fraction of MyoG<sup>+</sup> cells at either Day 1 or Day 2 of differentiation was markedly decreased by Pask inhibition, while MyoDpositivity was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref>). In addition to the loss of MyoG expression, cells treated with BioE-1197 exhibited a profound failure in the formation of multi-nucleated myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Based on these results, we hypothesized that the differentiation failure of Pask-inhibited cells was not due to failed inactivation of Pax7, which is not expressed in C3H10T1/2 cells, but instead is due to an inability of MyoD to induce MyoG expression in the absence of Pask. Indeed, we found that ectopic expression of rat MyoG was sufficient to bypass the Pask requirement for <italic>Mylpf</italic> expression even though endogenous mouse <italic>Myog</italic> remained suppressed in BioE-1197 treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These data place Pask within the myogenic transcriptional cascade, with Pask being necessary to act in concert with MyoD to induce MyoG expression and myogenic differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pask phosphorylates Wdr5</title><p>Catalytically inactive Pask was unable to rescue the differentiation defect caused by silencing of endogenous Pask (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâE</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C</xref>) and a catalytic inhibitor mimicked genetic inactivation of Pask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2FâG</xref>). We concluded, therefore, that Pask-dependent phosphorylation of one or more specific substrates must be required for theÂ myogenic gene expression and differentiation. Since none of the known Pask substrates are likely to serve this role, we sought to identify new substrates that might mediate the effects of Pask on differentiation. We employed a strategy that combines experimental and bioinformatics approaches. Specifically, we identified all proteins that had been described to physically interact with Pask in high-throughput protein-protein interactome datasets (BIOGRID: Pask) and were identified in our own unpublished Pask interactome studies. We then filtered this dataset for proteins that contain the consensus phosphorylation motif for Pask ([HKR]-X-[KR]-X-X-[ST]) that we previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kikani et al., 2010</xref>). Wdr5 was the single candidate substrate protein that emerged, based on its interaction with Pask in our dataset and in a global affinity capture screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ewing et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We first sought to validate the physical interaction of Pask and Wdr5 and did so in C2C12 cells across a differentiation time-course. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, Wdr5 associated with Pask during the proliferative phase (-1 and 0 days). However, that interaction was significantly enhanced following the onset of differentiation (Day 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also found that co-expressed epitope-tagged forms of Pask and Wdr5 co-immunoprecipitated and that this did not require Pask catalytic activity as the K1028R Pask mutant (KD) precipitated Wdr5 equivalently to WT Pask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17985.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Pask directly interacts with and phosphorylates Wdr5 at Ser49.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Endogenous Pask was immunoprecipitated from C2C12 cells, either before (day -1, 0) or after induction of differentiation (Day 1).

To properly place the Pask-Wdr5 interaction within these complexes and to determine if Pask associates with any intact Wdr5-containing complexes, we expressed exclusive members of each of the major Wdr5- containing complexes. This included Menin (Mll1/2 complex), PTIP (Mll3/4 complex), GCN5 (Kat2A Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT) complex) and Set9 (Setd7a â H3K4me3 complex) as well as Rbbp5, which is a member of the core Wdr5 sub-complex that is common to all Mll and Set complexes. Among these, only Wdr5 was able to co-purify endogenous Pask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that Pask is not a stable member of intact Wdr5-containing complexes, but might associate selectively with free Wdr5. Supporting this notion, the interaction between Pask and Wdr5 appears to be direct as GST-tagged Wdr5, purified from bacteria, bound to Pask purified from insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, while overexpressed Pask was cytoplasmic (typically perinuclear) in the majority of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rutter et al., 2001</xref>), with only ~10% of cells exhibiting nuclear Pask in absence of Wdr5 co-expression, Wdr5 co-expression with Pask significantly enhanced the nuclear accumulation of Pask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To define the minimal region of Pask that is responsible for Wdr5 interaction, we generated a series of N- and C-terminal Pask truncation mutations and assessed their ability to co-purify Wdr5. We found that the N-terminal 914 residues of Pask were dispensable for Wdr5 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). The interaction was lost, however, upon deletion of residues 915â948, suggesting that Wdr5 likely interacts with Pask just upstream of the canonical protein kinase domain.</p><p>Wdr5 was phosphorylated efficiently by WT Pask, but not KD Pask, in in vitro kinase reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and this was abrogated by the BioE-1197 Pask inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). BioE-1197 also robustly blunted the in situ phosphorylation of Pask and Pask-bound Wdr5 using in-cell <sup>32</sup>P labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As Pask association with Wdr5 was enhanced at the onset of differentiation, we asked if Pask activity towards Wdr5 is stimulated at this time. Consistent with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kikani et al., 2010</xref>), Pask exhibits modest activity in the absence of stimulation in C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). At 12âhr post-addition of insulin containing differentiation media, however, Pask was activated as assessed by increased autophosphorylation and Wdr5 phosphorylation, thus suggesting that Pask kinase activity is stimulated during differentiation.</p><p>Wdr5 was selected based on it containing a sequence that matched the Pask consensus substrate motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kikani et al., 2010</xref>). That site, with Serine 49 as the putative phospho-acceptor residue, is strikingly similar to that of the best-characterized substrate of yeast Pask, Ugp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), which is also robustly phosphorylated by human Pask (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kikani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rutter et al., 2002</xref>). In particular, the -5His and -3Lys residues, which were shown to be the most important for determining Pask phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kikani et al., 2010</xref>), are present in this putative Wdr5 phosphorylation motif. As expected, we found that Ser49 is required for phosphorylation by Pask since mutation to either glutamate (Glu) or alanine (Ala) nearly abolished phosphorylation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Pask-associated WT Wdr5 was phosphorylated in cells as shown above, but the S49A mutant showed a marked reduction in <sup>32</sup>P incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Together, these results suggest that Pask interacts with Wdr5 and phosphorylates it at Ser49 both in vitro and in cells.</p><p>Finally, we asked whether theÂ phosphorylation status at Ser49 affects Wdr5 association with either Pask or members of its histone modifying complexes using unphosphorylatable S49A or phospho-mimetic S49E variants of Wdr5. Pask purified from insect cells bound to bacterial-expressed Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> more weakly than WT, whereas Wdr5<sup>S49A</sup> bound Pask more avidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E</xref>).

We found that the association with endogenous Pask is weakened with Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> and strengthened with Wdr5<sup>S49A</sup> compared with Wdr5<sup>WT</sup>. These data are consistent with the common observation that an unphosphorylated substrate (mimicked by the Ala mutant) engages with its kinase with higher affinity compared to its phosphorylated forms (mimicked by the Glu mutant). When examining components of the Mll1-4, SET1 and KAT2a complexes, we found that Wdr5<sup>WT</sup>, WDR<sup>S49A</sup> and Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> all bound to each member of these complexes equivalently, suggesting that Wdr5 phosphorylation by Pask does not alter recruitment of Wdr5 into its many chromatin-modifying complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> restores <italic>Myog</italic> expression and myogenesis in the absence of Pask activity</title><p>Having established Wdr5 as a Pask substrate and given the published role of Wdr5-containing complexes in myoblast differentiation via the regulation of myogenic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McKinnell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Segales et al., 2014</xref>), we wanted to determine whether Wdr5 phosphorylation is the mechanism through which Pask regulates <italic>Myog</italic> expression and myocyte differentiation. If so, one might expect that expression of a Wdr5 variant that constitutively mimicked the phosphorylated form would reverse the effects of Pask inactivation and rescue the differentiation defect.

Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup>, on the other hand, completely reversed the aberrant increase in Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells caused by <italic>Pask</italic> knockdown. Importantly, this decrease in Pax7 positivity was only present in those cells in the population that expressed Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> (S49E<sup>+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, indicated by arrows), and not in those cells in the population that were uninfected (S49E<sup>-</sup>). This demonstrates that these are cell autonomous effects that are directly and specifically related to theÂ expression of the phospho-mimetic Wdr5 mutant. Those cells expressing Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> also exhibited an almost complete rescue of MyoGexpression, while those expressing GFP and Wdr5<sup>S49A</sup> were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In this case, Wdr5<sup>WT</sup> also caused a significant increase in the fraction of MyoG<sup>+</sup> cells. As before, MyoG expression was unaffected in those cells in the Wdr5<sup>WT</sup> and Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup>-expressing populations that were uninfected. The defect in MHC expression and myotube formation caused by <italic>Pask</italic> knockdown was also robustly rescued in Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup>-expressing cells and weakly rescued in Wdr5<sup>WT</sup>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we noticed that ectopic expression of Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup>, like WT Pask, was sufficient to induce expression of MyoG even in the absence of differentiation stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

As we observed previously in microscopy experiments, expression of WT, but not KD, hPask completely rescued H3K4me3 occupancy of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, expression of Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> restored H3K4me3 occupancy, whereas Wdr5<sup>S49A</sup> and Wdr5<sup>WT</sup> had no or modest effects, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). One potential mechanism whereby Wdr5 phosphorylation might stimulate H3K4me3 occupancy of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter is through enhanced Wdr5 promoter recruitment. To test this hypothesis, we performed Flag-Wdr5 ChIP-qPCR analysis on these same samples to determine Flag-Wdr5 occupancy on the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter. Consistent with that hypothesis, Wdr5<sup>WT</sup> modestly occupied the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter and this was decreased for the S49A mutant and increased for the S49E mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Neither WT nor KD Pask occupied the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), consistent with our observation that Pask is not a stable member of any Wdr5-containing complexes. We also examined the Pask-dependence of endogenous Wdr5 occupancy of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter and found that the increased binding of Wdr5 to the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter in response to differentiation cues observed in control cells was blunted in Pask-siRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Wdr5 binding to the <italic>Myod</italic> promoter, on the other hand, was neither significantly induced upon differentiation, nor was it affected by <italic>Pask</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), consistent with the observation that Pask is not required for expression of MyoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2DâE</xref>).</p><p>These data suggest that Wdr5 phosphorylation affects H3K4 trimethylation activity at the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter. MyoD is recruited to the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter during differentiation and then in turn orchestrates the chromatin remodeling process to promote transcriptional activation of <italic>Myog</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palacios and Puri, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rampalli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saccone and Puri, 2010</xref>). We examined whether Pask plays a role in this process by assessing whether MyoD occupancy on the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter during differentiation was affected by <italic>Pask</italic> knockdown. Indeed, we found that <italic>Pask</italic> knockdown completely blocked the differentiation-stimulated increase in MyoD occupancy of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 6âsource data 1</xref>). This requirement for Pask is due to Wdr5 phosphorylation as expression of Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> increased MyoD occupancy of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter at Day 1 of differentiation, whereas Wdr5<sup>S49A</sup> blocked it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 6âsource data 1</xref>). Interestingly, Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> increased the MyoD occupancy of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter even in the absence of differentiation cues (Day 0) to a level similar to that found in control cells at Day 1 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 6âsource data 1</xref>). This result is consistent with our observation that Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> expression is sufficient to induce MyoG expression in the absence of differentiation cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Thus, it appears that Pask and/or phospho-Wdr5 are necessary and sufficient to stimulate the myogenic transcriptional cascade, and perhaps that MyoD occupancy and H3K4me3 modification synergize to maximize expression from the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter during differentiation.</p><p>The <italic>Myog</italic> promoter was recently shown to have high H3K4me1 occupancy in non-differentiating C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). These marks are converted to H3K4me3 marks in response to differentiation cues through an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). Pask is activated by these same differentiation cues and expression of either WT Pask or phospho-mimetic Wdr5 is sufficient to bypass the requirement of differentiation cues. Hence, we asked whether Pask-Wdr5 signaling regulates H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion on the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter in response to differentiation cues. In control cells, H3K4me1 marks were progressively depleted from the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter over the differentiation time-course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 7âsource data 1</xref>), most likely due to further methylation to H3K4me3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). <italic>Pask</italic> knockdown severely blunted that loss of H3K4me1, in concert with blunting the appearance of H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). This H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion was accompanied by a decrease in total histone H3 density at the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggestive of a transition from a transcriptionally inactive or closed (nucleosome rich) to a transcriptionally accessible or open (nucleosome depleted) state that might facilitate MyoD recruitment in control cells. This loss of H3 density during differentiation was abolished by <italic>Pask</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 7âsource data 1</xref>). Because H3K4me1 is commonly found at enhancers, we also asked whether Pask is required for H3K4me1 occupancy at the <italic>Myog</italic> enhancer. However, unlike the proximal <italic>Myog</italic> promoter, H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion at the <italic>Myog</italic> upstream enhancer is not impaired by <italic>Pask</italic> knockdown, nor is the appearance of H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, MyoD recruitment to the enhancer during differentiation is impaired similarly to the proximal promoter by <italic>Pask</italic> knockdown, possibly due to the interdependence of the enhancer and promoter for optimal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sanyal et al., 2012</xref>).

These effects of Wdr5<sup>S49A</sup> and Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> expression mirror those on MyoD occupancy of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Thus, Wdr5 phosphorylation status appears to dictate MyoD recruitment to the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter, perhaps via H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrate herein, using multiple genetic and pharmacologic manipulations, that Pask is required for the differentiation of ES cells, adipogenic stem cells and myoblasts. Focusing on myoblast differentiation as a powerful and facile model system, we show that Pask phosphorylation of Wdr5 promotes several molecular events that together enable the expression of <italic>Myog</italic>, which encodes the critical myogenic transcription factor Myogenin. Pask activity or expression of Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup>, which mimics the Pask phosphorylated form of Wdr5, is necessary and sufficient to drive H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion, MyoD recruitment and transcription at the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter. Based on the data presented herein, we propose a model for C2C12 cells wherein under proliferative conditions, MyoD is unable to bind stably to the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter due to a repressive chromatin configuration enforced by H3K4me1 marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). As a result, <italic>Myog</italic> is not expressed and differentiation is prevented. Differentiation cues, including insulin, stimulate Pask kinase activity, Pask-Wdr5 association and Pask phosphorylation of Wdr5 at Ser49. Phosphorylation of Wdr5, which is a component of histone methylation complexes, facilitates the conversion of H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 at the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter resulting in chromatin remodeling, stable MyoD recruitment, transcription initiation and establishment of the differentiation program. Once this program initiates, it is buttressed by MyoG, likely in collaboration with MyoD, stimulating <italic>Pask</italic> expression while suppressing <italic>Pax7</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olguin et al., 2007</xref>). This self-reinforcing transcriptional circuit, driven by interlocking positive and negative feedback loops, creates stable commitment to the myogenic cell fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>In spite of the role of <italic>Pask</italic> in the muscle regeneration response to injury in vivoÂ that we have described, <italic>Pask<sup>-/-Â </sup></italic>mice are developmentally normal. While surprising, this is similar to the phenotype of mice lacking the key myogenic transcription factors, Myod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rudnicki et al., 1992</xref>), Pax7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seale et al., 2000</xref>), Myf5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kassar-Duchossoy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaul et al., 2000</xref>) or Mrf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kassar-Duchossoy et al., 2004</xref>) (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MusarÃ² and 2014</xref>). Moreover, we found that myoblasts from <italic>Pask<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had acquired resistance to Pask inhibitor-mediated suppression of myocyte differentiation, indicating that constitutive knockout results in a pro-differentiation compensatory response that is Pask-independent. Similarly, <italic>Pask</italic>-siRNA or PASK-inhibited cells typically exhibited modest induction of <italic>Myog</italic>, its target genes and H3K4me3 abundance upon differentiation, suggesting the presence of <italic>Pask-</italic>independent mechanisms to drive myogenin induction. Itâs noteworthy that <italic>Pask</italic><sup>-/-</sup> myoblasts exhibit elevated expression of <italic>Myf5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which has been shown to be able to compensate for the loss of MyoD function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conerly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rudnicki et al., 1992</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Myf5 and other transcriptional regulators drive some of the Pask-independent activation of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter. Nonetheless, our data demonstrate that the Pask-Wdr5 signaling axis is necessary and sufficient for full activation of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter and subsequent myoblast fusion.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Transcriptional regulation of Pask in stem and progenitor cells</title><p>We have shown that <italic>Pask</italic> expression is high in stem and progenitor cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>). In ES cells, the <italic>Pask</italic> promoter is occupied by the pluripotency promoting transcription factors, Oct4 and Nanog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). This transcription factor occupancy coincided with theÂ <italic>Pask</italic> transcriptional activation as indicated by the occupancy of RNA PolII as well as the activating H3K4me3 and H3K27ac chromatin modifications. During muscle regeneration in vivo expression is dramatically induced as early as 3 days after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), coincident with expansion of the satellite cell population and stimulation of MyoG expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braun and Gautel, 2011</xref>). We showed that MyoG and MyoD bind the <italic>Pask</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3AâB</xref>), which is marked by broad domains of H3K4me3 occupancy similar to those found in other lineage-specifying genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benayoun et al., 2014</xref>). Terminal differentiation of ES cells and C2C12 myoblasts results in a decline in <italic>Pask</italic> expression, which ultimately reaches a low steady-state abundance when differentiation is complete. This pattern is consistent with the expression of other key regulators of terminal differentiation like MyoD and hints at the importance of Pask in theÂ lineage commitment process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Pask and Wdr5 phosphorylation promote terminal differentiation</title><p>Pharmacologic inhibition of Pask activity caused a loss of terminal differentiation in three differentiation paradigms: ES cells to a neuronal fate, C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells to adipocytes and C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes. Utilizing the myoblast differentiation system, we have identified and described Wdr5 as a Pask substrate that mediates these differentiation effects. Wdr5 has been previously implicated in controlling stem cell maintenance. For example, Oct4 associates with Wdr5 and recruits H3K4me3 complexes to its target promoters to induce transcriptional activation and maintenance of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ang et al., 2011</xref>). In C2C12 myoblasts, Wdr5 was shown to interact with Pax7 to enforce myogenic specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawabe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McKinnell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rudnicki et al., 2008</xref>). Our results provide a new regulatory role for Wdr5 in promoting differentiation via the expression of key target genes. More importantly, these results define a novel regulatory paradigm wherein the function of Wdr5 is modulated by Pask-dependent phosphorylation. While we deem it likely, it remains to be established whether Wdr5 phosphorylation is a conserved and required mechanism whereby Pask promotes the differentiation of other stem and progenitor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pask as a signaling intermediate in cell differentiation</title><p>Differentiation cues engage and activate the signaling pathways and transcriptional networks that combine to drive terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basson, 2012</xref>). While a pioneering transcription factor like MyoD can occupy its target promoters in a sequence-specific manner, the full activation of the MyoD transcriptional response depends upon signaling from differentiation cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berkes and Tapscott, 2005</xref>). These cues, including those used in vitro treatment with insulin, are thought to enhance MyoD binding to its target promoters and recruit histone modifying proteins to initiate the expression of differentiation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berkes and Tapscott, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blum and Dynlacht, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braun and Gautel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dilworth and Blais, 2011</xref>). Ectopic expression of Pask or phospho-mimetic Wdr5 was sufficient to induce all of these effects in the absence of differentiation cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2KâJ</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). These data raise the possibility that Pask might be a critical node in the signaling network connecting differentiation cues with myogenic gene expression. Consistent with that hypothesis, we found that Pask activity was stimulated by differentiation cues as was the Pask-Wdr5 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We therefore believe that differentiation cues act, at least in part, to drive the myogenic transcriptional program via Pask activation and phosphorylation of Wdr5. It remains unknown how Pask activity and the Pask-Wdr5 interaction are stimulated by differentiation cues, but we suggest that these phenomena are likely central components of this signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of Pask-pWdr5 in H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion</title><p>H3K4me1 was recently demonstrated to be a transcriptionally repressive mark at the promoters of myogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). In response to differentiation cues, H3K4me1 is further methylated to H3K4me3 on these promoters to initiate their expression. H3K4 monomethylation is catalyzed by the Wdr5-containing Mll3/Mll4 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2013</xref>), while the Wdr5-containing Mll1/Mll2 complexes catalyze H3K4 trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shilatifard, 2012</xref>). Thus, it has been predicted that differentiation cues promote a Mll3/Mll4 to Mll1/Mll2 switch on myogenic promoters via an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that Pask phosphorylation of Wdr5 might be required for this process. For example, Pask silencing prevented the H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion on the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter in response to differentiation cues and silencing of Mll3 rescued the defect in the induction of <italic>Myog</italic> expression caused by <italic>Pask</italic> silencing. Interestingly, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 was unaffected at the <italic>Myod</italic> promoter or at the <italic>Myod</italic> and <italic>Myog</italic> enhancers during differentiation in <italic>Pask</italic>-silenced condition. This suggests that Pask and Wdr5 phosphorylation are not required for the enzymatic activity of the Mll1/2 or Mll3/4 complexes, but only for their activity on specific promoters like <italic>Myog, Acta1</italic> and <italic>Mybph</italic>. These promoters are repressed during proliferation and required to be derepressed at the onset of differentiation. Our data suggest that Pask mediates chromatin remodeling including H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion, resulting in enhanced MyoD binding and transcriptional activation during differentiation via Wdr5 phosphorylation. Future studies will determine whether Pask-mediated Wdr5 phosphorylation promotes switching of the Mll3/4 and Mll1/2 complexes at the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter.</p><p>Taken together, we have identified Pask and Wdr5 phosphorylation as necessary for differentiation of myocytes in vitro. Because the myocyte differentiation epigenetic program is similar to those found in other differentiation paradigms, including those we show to be Pask dependent, we speculate Pask likely functions through similar mechanisms in other systems. Specifically, we suggest that Pask phosphorylates Wdr5 to promote H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion on the promoters of lineage-specifying genes to facilitate chromatin remodeling, gene expression and differentiation. As a known component of hormonal and nutrient signaling pathways, future studies of Pask functions in stem cells have the promise of opening exciting new avenues that combine metabolic signaling and stem cell fate determination with the control of terminal differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Please refer to resource table for resource ID of the reagents used in this study in supplementary information.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and differentiation paradigm</title><p>HEK 293T, C2C12 myoblasts and C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells were obtained from theÂ American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

This issue should at least be addressed in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting and very important question that we also probed in a limited way during our studies. In C2C12 myoblasts, Wdr5 silencing resulted in stunted cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). When myoblasts were induced to differentiate, control myoblasts efficiently differentiated, however, Wdr5 silenced myoblasts failed to form multi-nucleated myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>)and induce myogenin and MHC- two markers of differentiation we have used in this manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3</xref>). More important for this question, we did not see any myogenin or MHC expression at Day 0 (in proliferative condition) when Wdr5 was silent. Thus, at least in myoblasts in our hands, Wdr5 knockdown is not sufficient to cause exit from self-renewal and differentiation. Our data show that Wdr5 is required for both the proliferative phase and differentiation process in myoblasts. This is not surprising since Wdr5 is an essential intermediate in many transcriptional events during both proliferation and differentiation states. For example, in myoblasts, Wdr5 has been shown to associate with Pax7 and regulate myoblast proliferation. During differentiation, MyoD and other transcription factors are known to recruit MLL, KAT2A-B and Set complexes of which Wdr5 is a core member to the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter to promote differentiation. We have included the data here, but have not included it in the manuscript per se, because it seemed a bit tangential to the logic of the already complex story. At the discretion of the editor and reviewers, we could include it in the paper.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17985.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Wdr5 silencing affects proliferation rate in C2C12 myoblasts.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17985.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17985.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17985-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17985.027</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Wdr5 silencing suppresses myotube formation in C2C12 myoblasts.&lt;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>&gt;</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17985.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17985.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17985-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17985.028</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Wdr5 is required expression of myogenin (MyoG) and myosin (MHC) during differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17985.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17985.028</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17985-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) Are there any effects on proliferation rate due to loss of WDR5 phosphorlyation under proliferative culture conditions?</italic> </p><p>We do not see any effect on proliferation rate upon either PASK inhibition (Manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4F</xref>) or Wdr5 S49A expression in myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 4</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17985.029</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>C2C12 cells were infected with retrovirus expressing GFP (Control) or WT, S49A or S49EâWdr5 cDNAs. 24 hrs after infection, puromycin selection was performed for four days.</title><p>1000 cells from each samples were plated into 96 well plates and after two days, total cell number was counted for each cell types.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17985.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17985.029</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17985-resp-fig4-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) PASK knockdown had no effect on H3K4me3 signature at the MyoD promoter (or expression of MyoD) although it did influence H3K4me3 and MyoD occupancy at MyoG promoter to drive the expression of MyoG in response to differentiation cues.

While the interplay between MyoD and pWdr5 is an important and complex area, we have tried to address this question partially here. MyoD is extensively involved in remodeling of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter at the onset of differentiation by recruiting MLL complexes, HATs and SWI/SNF complexes. MyoD serves a pioneering function at the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter to activate its transcription in response to differentiation signaling (Cao et al., 2006). While MyoD occupies <italic>Myog</italic> promoter during the proliferative phase, signaling inputs are required to stimulate chromatin remodeling and activation of MyoG transcription (Cao et al., 2006). On the other hand, inhibition of MyoD aborts the differentiation process. Thus, we hypothesize that MyoD acts synergistically with signaling inputs such as those that activate the PASK-Wdr5 pathway to remodel <italic>Myog</italic> promoter. We tested this by examining levels of H3K4me3 on the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter in control or <italic>Myod1</italic>- silenced C2C12 before and after the onset of differentiation. This was done in cells expressing WT, S49A and S49E Wdr5 as a surrogate for activation or inactivation of PASK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 5</xref>). We observed that knockdown of <italic>Myod1</italic> partially prevented H3K4me3 induction on the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter in all samples, including Wdr5<sub>S49E</sub>. We also examined the effect of <italic>Myod1</italic> knockdown on differentiation in Wdr5 WT, S49A or S49E cells. Again, we noticed that in non-targeting siRNA (Control) samples, Wdr5<sub>S49E</sub> expressing cells made robust myofibers and Wdr5<sub>S49A</sub> expressing cells were defective in myotube formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 6</xref>). <italic>Myod1</italic> knockdown, however, significantly suppressed myotube formation in Wdr5<sub>S49E</sub> expressing cells. Hence, we think that Wdr5 phosphorylation is not sufficient to overcome the loss of MyoD function and that MyoD acts synergistically with phosphorylated WDR5 to induce epigenetic changes at the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17985.030</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>H3K4me3 ChIP was performed from C2C12 myoblasts after control or MyoD knockdown expressing WT, S49A or S49E WDR5 mutants at Day 0 and Day 1 of differentiation.</title><p>* P&lt;0.05 between Wdr5<sub>S49E</sub> vs. Wdr5<sub>WT</sub> at Day 0 in control samples.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17985.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17985.030</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17985-resp-fig5-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17985.031</object-id><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Representative images of C2C12 myoblasts at Day 1 of differentiation after control or MyoD knockdown in WT, S49A or S49E WDR5 mutants expressing cells.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17985.031">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17985.031</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17985-resp-fig6-v1"/></fig></p></body></sub-article></article>
