collection of misfolded multimers, ranging from soluble oligomers to insoluble amyloid fibrils. Inspired by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements of protein folding, an experimental strategy to study site-specific misfolding kinetics during aggregation, by effectively suppressing contributions from inter-molecular FRET, is described. Specifically, the kinetics of conformational changes across different secondary and tertiary structural segments of the mouse prion protein (moPrP) were monitored independently, after the monomeric units transformed into large oligomers O<sub>L</sub>, which subsequently disaggregated reversibly into small oligomers O<sub>S</sub> at pH 4. The sequence segments spanning helices α2 and α3 underwent a compaction during the formation of O<sub>L</sub> and elongation into β-sheets during the formation of O<sub>S</sub>. The β1-α1-β2 and α2-α3 subdomains were separated, and the helix α1 was unfolded to varying extents in both O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prion</kwd><kwd>α to β switch</kwd><kwd>intra-molecular FRET</kwd><kwd>small and large oligomers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JC Bose Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Udgaonkar</surname><given-names>Jayant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IYBA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sengupta</surname><given-names>Ishita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001405</institution-id><institution>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Udgaonkar</surname><given-names>Jayant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multi-site FRET measurements of moPrP oligomerization at low pH indicate that major conformational changes take place as monomers reversibly transform into large oligomers, which subsequently disassemble reversibly into small oligomers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The structural characterization of kinetic intermediates in protein aggregation is a challenging task. Most experimental probes, used to study misfolding and aggregation kinetics, track either the acquisition of β-structure, or global changes in size. Although intermediate forms populated transiently during fibril formation reactions can be detected, for example by single-molecule FRET measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cremades et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shammas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), their detailed structural characterization is difficult. Equilibrium and kinetic measurements using multi-site FRET, to probe conformational changes in different parts of a protein, while it folds, unfolds, forms functional oligomers or interacts with its binding partner, have been a rich source of site-specific information, usually invisible to global probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lakshmikanth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lillo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Using a similar approach to study misfolding can potentially reveal the step-wise conformational changes that lead to the global misfolding of a protein.</p><p>The mostly α-helical and monomeric prion protein (PrP) undergoes drastic secondary and tertiary structural re-arrangements upon aggregation into a variety of misfolded β-sheet-rich multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 1993</xref>), most of which are not infectious. A class of fatal neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are caused by infectious aggregates of misfolded PrP. Conversion to the pathogenic form possibly initiates in the endocytic pathway, when the protein encounters an acidic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borchelt et al., 1992</xref>). The pathogenic misfolded aggregates thus formed in vivo are highly heterogeneous, with the most infectious oligomers composed of 14–28 monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Silveira et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The extremely rugged aggregation landscape of PrP has made it challenging to determine the high-resolution structure(s) of its various misfolded β-rich aggregated forms. However, several structural models have been derived from experimental data, which differ not only in their secondary structure content, but also in the location and size of the β-sheet-rich core. While some models suggest that a major part of the native fold remains intact in the aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeMarco and Daggett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Govaerts et al., 2004</xref>), several experimental studies have shown that a major section of the β-rich core of the aggregates formed from the full length PrP is located in the sequence segment that corresponds to the α2-α3 subdomain of monomeric PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cobb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diaz-Espinoza and Soto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tycko et al., 2010</xref>). It has been a challenge to determine the mechanism of misfolding that occurs during the formation of any of the distinct β-rich aggregates of PrP.</p><p>In agreement with observations made in vivo, the oligomerization and misfolding of mouse PrP (moPrP) is favoured in vitro at low pH in the presence of 150 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2015b</xref>), due to the protonation of residues H186 and/or D201 in the α2-α3 subdomain of moPrP. Previous HX-MS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2015a</xref>) had shown that the protected core region of the β-rich oligomers formed by PrP at low pH in vitro resembles that of amyloid fibrils derived from diseased brain. Not surprisingly then, recombinant PrP from animal species with high susceptibility to prion disease has been shown to readily form β-rich oligomers at low pH in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khan et al., 2010</xref>). β-rich oligomers formed at low pH, readily disrupt lipid membranes; this property is a likely reason for their toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the β-rich oligomers formed at low pH appear to be a suitable structural model for studying a putatively important misfolding mechanism of PrP.</p><p>Interestingly, oligomer formation of moPrP at pH 4 could be completely abolished by substituting a discordant but highly conserved sequence stretch (TVTTTT) in the C-terminal end of α2, with a very high β-sheet propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dima and Thirumalai, 2002</xref>), by the α-helix favouring residue alanine (AAAAAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that the C-terminal end of α2 plays a critical role in the initiation of misfolding. In species with low susceptibility to prion disease, the loop between β2 and α2 is more rigid in the monomeric prion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gossert et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that its flexibility might play an important role in facilitating misfolding. It is also known that residues H186 and D201 together with R155, K193 and E195 form a network of electrostatic interactions between the α2-α3 and β1-α1-β2 subdomains in monomeric PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hadži et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hosszu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2015b</xref>). The disruption of these electrostatic interactions either by a lowering of pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2016a</xref>) and addition of salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sengupta et al., 2017</xref>), or by charge reversing or neutralizing pathogenic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2015a</xref>) facilitate misfolding and oligomer formation in vitro. It appears that separation of the α2-α3 and β1-α1-β2 subdomains must occur before conversion to the β-conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eghiaian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hafner-Bratkovic et al., 2011</xref>). Locking of the α2-α3 and β1-α1-β2 subdomains either by engineering in an artificial disulphide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eghiaian et al., 2007</xref>), or by binding to anti-prion drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamatari et al., 2013</xref>) prevent misfolding and aggregation. While such equilibrium studies have suggested possible sequences of structural changes during oligomer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2016a</xref>), there has been a dire need for kinetic studies that can directly delineate the structural mechanism of the misfolding which accompanies the oligomerization of the prion protein at low pH.</p><p>In the current study, the structural mechanism of the spontaneous formation of β-rich oligomers at pH 4, in the absence of any denaturant but in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, has been delineated. Earlier studies of the formation of these misfolded oligomers had indicated that oligomerization drives major intra-molecular conformational change. Real-time NMR measurements had shown that no major conformational change occurs in the monomer before it assembles into oligomer: the monomer structure is perturbed to only a very minor extent before assembly into oligomers, which is rate-limited by association steps in which dimers and trimers are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sengupta et al., 2017</xref>). Not surprisingly, single-molecule studies have found that misfolded monomeric PrP is not stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Measurements of changes in size and conformation by CD (circular dichroism), SEC (size-exclusion chromatography) and HX-MS (hydrogen-exchange coupled to mass spectrometry), had shown that oligomerization is faster than major conformational change in the case of two pathogenic mutant variants of moPrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sabareesan and Udgaonkar, 2016</xref>), under oligomerization conditions identical to those used in the current study. Notably, β-rich oligomers of moPrP, which form worm-like fibrils by an isodesmic mechanism at pH 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jain and Udgaonkar, 2008</xref>), are distinct from the off-pathway oligomers seen to form transiently during nucleation-dependent amyloid fibril formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sabareesan and Udgaonkar, 2017</xref>), from the octamers formed at low pH in the presence of 2 M urea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larda et al., 2013</xref>), from the oligomers formed spontaneously by a tandem dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilch et al., 2003</xref>), and from the neurotoxic oligomers obtained by thermal refolding of ovine prion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eghiaian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rezaei et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Most kinetic studies of protein misfolding have lacked sufficient structural resolution or have been complicated by the effects of multimerization. Deriving inspiration from site-directed spin labelling (SDSL) EPR and FRET measurements on protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Margittai and Langen, 2008</xref>) and very successful kinetic studies of protein folding, using multi-site FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lakshmikanth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lillo et al., 1997</xref>) a generally applicable method was developed to measure site-specific misfolding kinetics in non-nucleated aggregating systems, while eliminating the complicating effects of multimerization. This was achieved using FRET between a Trp residue and a thio-nitrobenzoate (TNB)-moiety attached to a free Cys residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lakshmikanth et al., 2001</xref>), in five different single Trp, single Cys-containing mutant variants of moPrP. Every pair of proteins, with and without the TNB adduct, was separately co-oligomerized with a large excess of a tryptophan-free (Trp-less) mutant variant of moPrP. Such an experimental strategy has been shown to result in the suppression of inter-molecular contributions to FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pinotsi et al., 2014</xref>); hence, the FRET measurements report only on structural changes occurring in each monomeric unit comprising the oligomer.</p><p>To complement the FRET studies, which were used to monitor conformational changes within each monomeric unit of the oligomer, techniques that monitored changes in the global properties of the oligomers were employed. CD was used to monitor global changes in secondary structure (mostly β-sheet formation), and steady-state tryptophan fluorescence intensity and anisotropy were used to measure changes in the local environments of differently placed Trp residues, and in overall oligomer size/population, respectively. Size-exclusion chromatography was used to monitor the kinetics of monomer loss during oligomer formation, and to characterize the heterogeneity in the oligomer formation. It should be noted that by themselves probes such as CD, cannot detect site-specific structural changes, because the signal is dominated by β-sheet formation, making it insensitive to any other conformational change. In contrast, the experimental strategy demonstrated here, allows the visualization of segment-specific misfolding of moPrP, during the course of oligomer formation at low pH. It is, however, not possible to distinguish whether all monomeric units undergo these conformational changes synchronously or in a random manner, using this approach.</p><p>Taken all together, the fluorescence and FRET data revealed that a local perturbation in the loop separating α2 and α3 took place prior to oligomer formation. Along the course of the oligomerization reaction, the fastest change appeared to be the compaction of the sequence segments spanning helices α2 and α3. The separation of the α2-α3 sub-domain from the β1-α1-β2 subdomain appeared to be slower. The slowest changes appeared to be the unfolding of α1, and the expansion of the sequence segments that encompassed α2 and α3 into extended β-strands. From the size-exclusion chromatography results, two oligomeric species of distinct sizes, O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub>, were seen to be populated to varying extents at all times of the oligomerization reaction, suggesting that monomer M, O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub> were interconverting. Kinetic modelling and global fitting of the conversion of M to O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub>, revealed that the contraction of the sequence segments spanning helices α2 and α3 took place concomitant to the formation of oligomer O<sub>L</sub> from monomers, and their expansion took place as O<sub>L</sub> disaggregated reversibly to form O<sub>S</sub>. α1 was unfolded and the α2-α3 sub-domain was separated from the β1-α1-β2 subdomain to varying extents in both O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FRET pairs to monitor site-specific misfolding in the monomeric unit of the oligomer</title><p>The Trp-TNB FRET pair has an estimated Forster radius (R<sub>0</sub>) of ~23 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), which allows the reliable measurement of change in distance in the range of ~11 to ~35 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lakshmikanth et al., 2001</xref>).

Therefore, while the fast dynamics of α1 allow the buried C153 side-chain to get labelled, the disulfide bond between residues C178 and C213 remains oxidized in that timescale. A Trp-less mutant variant, with all Trp residues mutated to Phe residues was also purified for co-oligomerization experiments, in which it could be shown that inter-molecular FRET was suppressed during oligomerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Fluorescence and FRET efficiency changes in monomeric and oligomeric moPrP</title><p>Prior to the kinetic experiments, fluorescence emission spectra were recorded for each pair of unlabelled and TNB-labelled proteins, in their monomeric and oligomeric forms. The fluorescence emission maximum was at 355 nm and 345 nm, for monomeric mutant variants with W144 and W197 as the donor fluorophore, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>). This observation, indicating a markedly different local environment around each Trp residue, is in agreement with the solution NMR structure of monomeric moPrP, where W144 is completely exposed to solvent, and W197 is partially buried (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Riek et al., 1996</xref>). In the corresponding TNB-labelled monomeric mutant variants, the Trp fluorescence was quenched, but to different extents. The extent of quenching by TNB was dependent on the separation of the Trp and the TNB moiety in the monomer, clearly indicative of FRET. In addition, the observed FRET efficiencies for different pairs of mutant variants were in good agreement with the expected FRET efficiencies calculated from the solution NMR structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The small differences in the expected and observed FRET efficiencies can be attributed to the size and orientation of the Trp and TNB-side chains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Moreover, the far-UV CD spectra of all unlabelled and TNB-labelled mutant variants matched well with that of WT moPrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the secondary structure is conserved in these proteins.</p><p>While all the unlabelled and TNB-labelled mutant variants were able to form β-rich oligomers, comparable to those formed by WT moPrP as judged by CD and DLS measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sengupta and Udgaonkar, 2017</xref>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), the local environment around donor fluorophores W144 and W197 changed in different ways upon oligomer formation. A blue shift to 345 nm and an increase in quantum yield was observed for the W144-containing mutant variants, suggesting that the local environment of W144 was more hydrophobic in the oligomers than in the monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). In contrast, a slightly decreased quantum yield without a change in the emission maximum was observed for the W197-containing mutant variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>) indicating that the W197 side-chain was partially buried in both monomer and oligomer, but that additional quenching mechanisms were operative in the oligomer. The W197 side-chain in the monomer is in close proximity to residues H186 and Y155, which like the disulfide bond, can quench Trp fluorescence, either by excited state proton and electron transfer, or by direct contact, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hennecke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>). Rearrangements in structure in each monomeric unit of the oligomer, or between monomeric units within the oligomer, can result in quenching, due to the proximity of these residues to W197. The enhanced FRET efficiency in the oligomers compared to the monomers, in all five mutant variants, suggested that both intra- and inter-molecular FRET could be contributing to the quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence in the oligomers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Co-oligomerization with Trp-less moPrP results in the suppression of inter-molecular FRET</title><p>To suppress the inter-molecular contribution to FRET in the oligomers, and to exclusively measure intra-molecular FRET changes during oligomer formation, single Trp-containing labelled and unlabelled protein (dopant) were co-oligomerized with increasing amounts of Trp-less moPrP (while keeping the total protein concentration fixed at 100 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Toyama and Weissman, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The FRET efficiencies were similar for the oligomers prepared at 1:34 (~3 mol%) and 1:50 (2 mol%) doping ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and significantly lower than that determined for oligomers prepared from the dopant protein alone (i.e. without Trp-less moPrP), or for oligomers prepared at a 1:13 (~8 mol%) doping ratio.

In order to verify that the fast misfolding kinetics of the dopant protein by itself had no influence on how fast it formed misfolded co-oligomers with Trp-less moPrP, the global misfolding kinetics of doped Trp-less moPrP was monitored by far-UV CD at four doping ratios (1:5, 1:10, 1:50 and 1:99) corresponding to 20, 10, 2 and 1 mol% of TNB-labelled W197-C223 moPrP (dopant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The amplitude and characteristic times of fluorescence change were both distinct for the corresponding labelled proteins. The data suggested that two of the distances monitored in these experiments, changed in a manner comparable to each other, but distinct from the other three distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Since changes in both distance R and Forster radius R<sub>0</sub> can affect the FRET efficiency, E, (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>) it was important to consider both, while interpreting changes in E. It is to be noted that an increase in the quantum yield as well as a blue shift of the spectrum of the donor W144 is expected to increase R<sub>0 </sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>), although not to a significant extent, due to its 1/6th power dependence on both the quantum yield and the overlap integral (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>). An increase in R<sub>0</sub> was expected to result in an increase in E, but for both FRET pairs W144-C153 and W144-C199, a decrease in E was observed. Consequently, the decrease in E reflected a true increase in distance. In contrast, for the TNB-labelled W197-C169 and W197-C223 mutant variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, Appendix 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the very small changes in quantum yield and overlap integral upon oligomerization result in only a 2.5–4% decrease in R<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3 equ4">Equations 3 and 4)</xref>. The modest change in R<sub>0</sub> could only account for 8–23% of the total change in FRET efficiency observed for these proteins, suggesting that the decrease in E must be a consequence of a true change in distance. Moreover, a change in κ<sup>2</sup> also could not account for the observed change in FRET efficiency (Appendix 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>For the W144-C153 FRET pair, designed to monitor conformational changes in α1, the intra-molecular FRET efficiency decreased by ~22% with a characteristic time of 7.1 ± 0.1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

This could be because either the distance remained unchanged, or became greater than the sensitivity range (~11 Å to ~35 Å) of the Trp-TNB FRET pair.</p><p>The intra-molecular FRET efficiency for both FRET pairs with W197 as the donor fluorophore, W197-C169 and W197-C223 changed in a manner distinct from that of the other FRET pairs. First, the amplitude of the burst phase change in Trp fluorescence was comparable for both the unlabelled and labelled proteins, indicating that no change in intra-molecular FRET efficiency occurred in the dead time of measurement. This further confirmed that the burst-phase change in fluorescence reflected only a localized perturbation to the environment of W197, before oligomerization commenced.</p><p>Second, the FRET efficiency changed in two observable kinetic phases: a fast phase during which intra-molecular FRET efficiency increased and a slow phase during which it decreased. The apparent fast compaction of the sequence segments spanning both α2 and α3, as seen in the increase in FRET efficiency, appeared to take place with characteristic times of 1.7 ± 0.2 and 1.4 ± 0.3 hr, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The apparent fast increase in FRET efficiency, was more than 30-fold faster than the estimated timescale for the independent oligomerization of 2 μM labelled dopant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sabareesan and Udgaonkar, 2016</xref>), and thus, the fast phase of FRET efficiency increase did not originate from (i) the oligomerization of 2 μM labelled dopant proteins independently of 98 μM Trp-less moPrP, or (ii) co-oligomerization of the two proteins on a faster timescale (see above). Furthermore, the fast compaction of the erstwhile helical sequence segments was also observed for a Trp-197-DNP-C2 FRET pair (with a R<sub>0</sub> of ~30 Å) and for a Trp-DANS FRET pair (Appendix 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The characteristic times for the slow phase of elongation/FRET decrease (16.7 ± 2.8 and 11.1 ± 2.5 hr) were comparable to the characteristic time of global misfolding, as monitored by far-UV CD (11.1 ± 3.7 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>With the exception of W144-C153-TNB, all other TNB-labelled proteins, at 100 μM concentration, by themselves misfolded with characteristic times of ~1.5 hr, when monitored by CD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Nevertheless, the oligomerization reactions in which these proteins were used (at 2 μM concentration) as dopants of 98 μM Trp-less moPrP took place with characteristic times ranging between ~2 and 10 hrs, when monitored by fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, even though the 100 μM DANS-labelled proteins by themselves misfolded with a characteristic time of ~0.5 hr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which was ~2.5 fold faster than the corresponding TNB-labelled proteins, the observed characteristic times of fluorescence and FRET-monitored changes, when the DANS-labelled proteins were used as dopant proteins, were in qualitative agreement with those of the corresponding TNB-labelled proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The lack of correlation between the timescales of misfolding of the labelled proteins by themselves, and timescales when the same proteins were used as dopant proteins, suggests that the fast changes in FRET efficiency are unlikely to be a consequence of altered co-oligomerization kinetics of 98 μM Trp-less moPrP when it co-oligomerizes with 2 μM dopant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Kinetic modelling of FRET and SEC data</title><p>Kinetic simulations and global fitting were carried out to test whether a parallel, sequential or triangular model best described the formation of O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub> from M, taking into account both the SEC and FRET data.

At pH 4 and 7, ΔG has been reported to be 4.6 and 6.04 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> respectively. Moreover, it has been shown that while misfolding/oligomerization is 100% complete within 24 hr at pH 4, it is only ~5% complete at pH 5.7 on the same timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2016a</xref>). Linear extrapolation to pH 7 suggests that misfolding/oligomerization should take years to complete at neutral pH. It should be noted that at pH 7, moPrP forms amyloid fibrils, and that oligomers are either completely absent or present in undetectable amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous real-time NMR measurements had not detected any major structural rearrangement in the monomer, prior to oligomerization at pH 4 in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. This was supported by CD, SEC and HX-MS measurements of changes in conformation and size/population during oligomerization, under similar conditions, which had also indicated that major conformational change accompanying misfolding occurs only after, or concomitant with oligomerization. Among the two tryptophan residues, W144 and W197 that were used as donor fluorophores in this study, W197-containing mutant variants exhibited a burst-phase change in fluorescence, when they were used as dopant proteins in co-oligomerization experiments. This is likely a consequence of a local change in monomeric moPrP before the start of oligomerization, namely the disruption of the K193-E195 salt-bridge in the α2-α3 loop, in accordance with previous NMR measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sengupta et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To probe the major conformational changes in the monomeric unit as it misfolds into β-sheet-rich oligomers in real time with segment-specific resolution, FRET measurements were employed. The presence of eight tryptophan residues in WT moPrP prevented its use in suppressing the intermolecular contributions to the FRET signal during oligomer formation. Trp-less moPrP was therefore used as the pseudo-WT moPrP analogue for the FRET measurements. The secondary structure and size (as estimated from CD and DLS measurements, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sengupta and Udgaonkar, 2017</xref>) of the Trp-less moPrP oligomers were found to be comparable to that of WT moPrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, Trp-less moPrP formed oligomers L and S (O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub>) to similar extents as did WT moPrP at pH 4 in 150 mM NaCl. However, Trp-less moPrP misfolded and oligomerized ~2.5 fold slower compared to that of WT moPrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). With this caveat in mind, the FRET measurements have allowed the delineation of the major structural changes that take place in the monomer, as it converts into soluble β-sheet-rich oligomers at pH 4.</p><p>A qualitative comparison of the characteristic times of all structural changes monitored by FRET suggests that a compaction of the segments spanning the α2 and α3 helices is the fastest change (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The separation of the β1-α1-β2 sub-domain from the α2-α3 subdomain and the conformational change in α1 appear to be slower. The slow decrease in FRET efficiency in α1 is likely to be due to the unfolding of this helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2015a</xref>). Remarkably, these results suggest that domain separation occurs spontaneously under acidic conditions which mimic the endocytic environment in the cell, in marked contrast to previous results where oligomerization was induced by thermal denaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eghiaian et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, this study shows that it is possible to directly show that the β1-α1-β2 sub-domain separates from the α2-α3 subdomain during the formation of the misfolded oligomers, by using an appropriately placed FRET donor-acceptor pair. In previous studies, the importance of subdomain separation had been inferred only indirectly from the observation that disulfide-crosslinking of the subdomains can abolish oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hafner-Bratkovic et al., 2011</xref>). The slowest change appears to be the elongation of sequence segments that had spanned α2 and α3; this is possibly due to their conversion into β-sheets and is also reported on by the global probe CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44698.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model depicting the site-specific misfolding moPrP at during the course of oligomer formation at pH 4.</title><p>The sequence segments spanning the α2 and α3 helices undergo a compaction as monomers convert reversibly to large oligomers, O<sub>L</sub>.

In contrast, HX-MS experiments could not detect any significant conformational change in this segment upon oligomer formation: α3 was found to be highly protected against HX in both the monomer and oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sabareesan and Udgaonkar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2015a</xref>). HX-MS measurements probe the extent of exchange of backbone amide protons/deuterons with solvent and are silent to structural changes, which do not result in a measurable change in protection against HX. Since α3 is part of the buried core of both the monomer and the oligomer, HX-MS fails to detect conformational changes which might be taking place in α3, concomitant to oligomer formation. FRET, on the other hand, can detect these structural changes readily. This explains the apparent discrepancy between the HX-MS and FRET monitored conformational changes in α3 during the course of oligomer formation. Importantly, these results are in contrast to EPR studies carried out at neutral pH, on disulfide-free mutant variants of the PrP in nanodiscs, which had suggested that α1 and α3 retain their helicity, and that only α2 undergoes conversion to the β-conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The observations from the SEC experiments that both large (O<sub>L</sub>) and small (O<sub>S</sub>) oligomers are formed sequentially from monomer M, and that both oligomers and monomer coexist at equilibrium at pH 4 in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, along with the previous demonstration that O<sub>L</sub> can disaggregate into O<sub>S</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jain and Udgaonkar, 2010</xref>) allowed kinetic modelling of the SEC data according to a M ↔ O<sub>L </sub>↔ O<sub>S</sub> mechanism. The kinetic modelling and global fitting of the SEC and FRET data together yielded forward and backward rate constants for each step. Specifically and importantly, the biphasic (increase followed by decrease) changes in FRET efficiency observed for the sequence segments 197–169 and 197–223 were found to be a consequence of higher FRET efficiency values in O<sub>L</sub> than in M and O<sub>S</sub>. In addition, the decrease in FRET efficiency observed for sequence segments 144–153 and 144–199 was found to be a consequence of lower FRET efficiency values in O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub> than in M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Hence, the kinetic modelling indicates that the structural changes accompanying oligomerization occur in two steps. The formation of O<sub>L</sub> from M is accompanied by compaction of the sequence segments spanning the α2 and α3 helices, which accounts for the higher FRET efficiency seen for sequence segments 197–169 and 197–223 in O<sub>L</sub>. The subsequent dissociation of O<sub>L</sub> to O<sub>S</sub> is accompanied by an expansion of the same sequence segments, which is likely to be due to the formation of extended β-sheet structure in O<sub>S</sub>. It is possibly the formation of β-sheet structure that makes O<sub>S</sub> more stable than O<sub>L</sub>. The estimated FRET efficiency values for the sequence segments 144–153 and 144–199 further predict that α1 has unfolded and the erstwhile β1-α1-β2 sub-domain has separated from the erstwhile α2-α3 sub-domain to different extents in O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub>. These observations are supported by previous HX-MS measurements of the oligomers at pH 2 which showed that the sequence stretch 190–197 spanning a segment of the α2 helix and the α2- α3 loop is weakly protected in O<sub>L</sub>, but moderately protected in O<sub>S</sub>, suggesting that the α2 helix is unstructured in O<sub>L</sub>, but may have converted to β-sheet in O<sub>S</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the α1 helix is weakly protected in O<sub>L</sub>, but moderately protected in O<sub>S</sub> in accordance with the FRET results.</p><p>For an α-helix to convert into a β-sheet, intra-helical hydrogen bonds must be disrupted, for new inter-strand hydrogen bonds to form. It has been suggested that helices must undergo partial or complete unfolding before they can re-arrange their hydrogen bond structure to form β-sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qin and Buehler, 2010</xref>). In the case of moPrP, hydrogen bonding at both the ends and/or middle of α2 and α3 can dissolve, but due to the presence of the native disulfide bond, residual structure will still be present. This increase in dynamics, without the complete loss of structure might allow the two ends of the helices to come closer, leading to the modest increase in FRET efficiency, distinct from the random coil structure of completely unfolded segments, which typically have lower FRET efficiencies than their folded counterparts. Subsequently, the formation of new hydrogen bonds between β-strands within and between monomers (leading to a decrease in FRET efficiency as β-strands are usually longer than α-helices) is complete within a timescale that is similar to that of global misfolding monitored by far-UV CD. The presence of highly dynamic and frustrated sequence segments like the TVTTTT stretch at the C terminal end of α2, possibly aids the early partial unfolding/compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Thirumalai, 2013</xref>). On the other hand, the disulphide bond stapling α2 and α3 might be a deterrent to complete unfolding, but could be crucial in positioning the two helices in an optimal position for inter-strand hydrogen bond formation. Alternatively, the compaction could be also be a result of non-native hydrogen bond formation which neither mimics the α-helix or β-sheet arrangement. Indeed, folding simulations of α-helix formation have detected misfolded β-hairpin like structures and compact structures with non-native hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertsch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the data presented here is the first real-time experimental demonstration of the sequence of segment-specific conformational changes that occur in each monomeric unit of moPrP as it forms oligomers. It will be important to establish whether the compaction-elongation mechanism of the α to β switch, delineated here for moPrP at pH 4, is shared by other proteins that undergo a similar conformational change during aggregation. Finally, the search for new molecules with the potential to completely abolish misfolding can benefit greatly from studies probing the effect of pathogenic mutations and anti-prion drugs on each of the multiple conformational changes delineated in this study, which lead to global misfolding.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>Trp-less-moPrP (pET22b vector)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td>Novagen-Sigma Aldrich</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>W144-C153-moPrP (pET 22b vector)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td>Novagen-Sigma Aldrich</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>W144-C199-moPrP (pET22b vector)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td>Novagen-Sigma Aldrich</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>W144-C223-moPrP (pET22b vector)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td>Novagen-Sigma Aldrich</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>W197-C169-moPrP (pET22b vector)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td>Novagen-Sigma Aldrich</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>W197-C223-moPrP (pET22b vector)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td>Novagen-Sigma Aldrich</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Trp-less-moPrP</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td>W144-C153-moPrP</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>W144-C199-moPrP</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>W144-C223-moPrP</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td>W197-C169-moPrP</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="bottom">W197-C223-moPrP</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2017.07.014</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>DynaFit</td><td valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1006/abio.1996.0238">https://doi.org/10.1006/abio.1996.0238</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>All reagents used for experiments were of the highest purity grade from Sigma, unless otherwise specified.

For a buried cysteine such as C153, the reduction reaction on the native protein was carried out for 36 hr.

All measurements were made on a Fluoromax 4 spectrofluorimeter. A quartz cuvette of path length 2 × 10 mm was used for all measurements. The temperature of the reaction was maintained at 37°C, with a circulating water bath. The cuvette was kept stoppered during the reaction to prevent solvent loss due to evaporation.</p><p>To eliminate the contribution of scatter to the fluorescence signal, a 325 nm long-pass filter was kept between the thermo-statted cuvette and the emission monochromator. An excitation wavelength of 295 nm, an emission wavelength of 340 nm, excitation slit width of 1 nm and emission slit width of 5 nm were used in all experiments. The kinetics mode of the Fluoresscence software was used for acquisition for most experiments. The number of cycles and time interval between cycles were set according to the number of kinetic data points and total acquisition time of the reaction. Every kinetic time point was an average of 10 points acquired over 10 s. The anti-photobleaching mode was activated in these experiments, such that the shutter remained closed between acquisitions, so that negligible loss of fluorescence intensity due to photobleaching occurs. Every experiment was repeated 4–5 times on an average. For some experiments, kinetic time points were acquired manually, at desired intervals. A control experiment was carried out using the same acquisition parameters, but in the presence of native buffer only (10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4).

This was incubated for 5 min in the thermostatted cuvette before recording the spectrum. The fluorescence intensity of the monomer was adjusted for concentration by multiplying the measured value at 340 nm by 0.9. These concentrations were chosen such that after addition of 50 µL of 10x aggregation buffer to 450 µL of the above protein mixture, the final concentrations of Trp-less moPrP and dopant would be 98 µM and 2 µM, respectively.</p><p>Similarly, before recording the first kinetic time point after initiation of misfolding, a dead time of 5 min was allowed for equilibration to 37°C.

Briefly, parallel and sequential reaction schemes were tested for the reversible formation of oligomers O<sub>s</sub> and O<sub>L</sub> from M. The ratios of forward and backward rate constants were fixed to account for the ratio of O<sub>s</sub>/O<sub>L</sub> ~ 3 and the amounts of M, O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>s</sub> that was approximately estimated from the SEC data. The FRET and SEC data were globally fit separately to first test which of the reaction schemes best describes both data sets with comparable rate constants. While the M ↔ O<sub>S </sub>↔ O<sub>L</sub> and the O<sub>S </sub>↔ M ↔ O<sub>L</sub> mechanisms were able to fit the FRET and SEC data separately to satisfaction, global fitting of both data sets together did not yield acceptable fits. All parameters were allowed to vary in the fitting procedure except for the FRET efficiency value of O<sub>S</sub> for the 197–169 sequence segment, which was constrained to a low value of 1e-20 while global fitting of FRET data to the M ↔ O<sub>L </sub>↔ O<sub>S</sub> mechanism. While fitting the normalized monomer loss kinetics from the SEC data, the signal for M was allowed to vary, while the signal for O<sub>S</sub> and O<sub>L</sub> were fixed to zero.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of our laboratory for critically reading the manuscript, and MK Mathew, S Gosavi, A Singh and S Krishna for helpful discussions.

mutant variants</title><p>Since it is not possible to measure the exact value of κ<sup>2</sup>, a range of κ<sup>2</sup> values for both W197-containing mutant variants, W197-C169 and W197-C223 in their oligomeric forms were determined from time-resolved anisotropy measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). TNB is non-fluorescent; therefore, the proteins were labelled with 1,5-IAEDANS (see Materials and methods section) and measurements were made as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jha and Udgaonkar (2009)</xref>.</p><p>The estimated κ<sup>2</sup> values range from 0.4 to 2 and 0.21 to 2.5 for the proteins W197-C169 and W197-C223 respectively in their oligomeric forms. These values correspond to R<sub>0</sub> values ranging from 23.8 to 31.1 and 21.3 to 32.2 Å respectively (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref> in main text). If the FRET efficiency changes were only due to a change in R<sub>0</sub> without any change in distance R, the expected FRET efficiency values should range from 0.04 to 0.25 and 0.05 to 0.36 for the W197-C169 and W197-C223 proteins in their oligomeric forms respectively. The lower observed FRET efficiencies of 0.01 and 0.035 respectively for these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) cannot be a consequence of a change in κ<sup>2</sup> and R<sub>0</sub> solely, and must reflect a true change in distance R.</p><p>Moreover, the fundamental anisotropy values of 0.24 and ~0.28 respectively estimated from the fit (r(0)) are significantly lower than the fundamental anisotropies of both donor tryptophan (r<sub>0</sub> = 0.4) and acceptor 1,5-IAEDANS (r<sub>0</sub> = 0.36) groups determined in frozen solution, suggesting a significant amplitude (40–50%) for the free motion of both donor and acceptor probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), even when attached to a large oligomeric species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lakshmikanth et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, (i) the fast sub-ns segmental motions of 40–50% amplitude of both donor and acceptor groups in the oligomeric forms of both proteins, (ii) the smaller size of the TNB label compared to the DANS label (iii) the inability of a change in κ<sup>2</sup> and R<sub>0</sub> to account for the observed FRET efficiency values in the oligomeric forms all justify the use of κ<sup>2</sup> = 2/3 for the oligomeric forms.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Effect of mutation and labelling on secondary structure, stability and global misfolding kinetics</title><p>The secondary structure, thermodynamic stability and global misfolding kinetics of all the unlabelled and TNB/DANS-labelled mutant variants were determined experimentally using far-UV CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). For the WT moPrP, the values reported here agree well with previously reported values at pH 4 of 4.1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>, 1.2 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> and 3.5 M for ΔG, m and C<sub>m</sub> respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cereghetti et al., 2003</xref>). Most mutations in moPrP, which have been shown to alter the thermodynamic stability or folding/unfolding kinetics, have typically been located in buried positions in the α2-α3 subdomain, and involve hydrophobic side-chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2009</xref>). Keeping this in mind, all mutations were made in solvent-exposed positions, except for the completely buried M153C mutation in α1 and the partially-buried F197W mutation in the loop between α2 and α3 helices. The unlabelled W197-C169 and W197-C223 mutant variants used here were not destabilized, supporting earlier observations that the F197W mutation does not perturb stability and/or unfolding/folding kinetics despite it being equivalent to residue F198 in human PrP, a site for the pathogenic mutation F198S associated with the inherited prion disease, the GSS syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jenkins et al., 2008</xref>). However, the W197-C169 mutant variant misfolded with slightly faster kinetics, compared to the WT moPrP, possibly due to its location in the loop between β2 and α2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gossert et al., 2005</xref>). Somewhat counter intuitively, the completely buried M153C mutation in α1 did not alter thermodynamic stability or global misfolding kinetics. The only mutant variant with a significant reduction in thermodynamic stability (but without a change in global misfolding kinetics) was W144-C199, (despite E199C being a solvent-exposed position) possibly due to an altered surface charge. A change in intrinsic properties of the amino acid sequence (for e.g. hydrophobicity, β-sheet propensity or charge) upon mutation could not account for the change in the global misfolding kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>In marked contrast to the unlabelled mutant variants, a striking correlation between the global misfolding kinetics and position of the TNB/DANS acceptor moiety was seen for the corresponding labelled mutant variants (with no correlation to thermodynamic stability) at 100% labelling density. When the solvent-exposed positions C169, C199 or C223, in the α2-α3 subdomain were covalently modified with TNB/DANS, global misfolding kinetics was accelerated. In contrast, when the buried position C153 on α1 was covalently modified with TNB, global misfolding kinetics remained unchanged. The enhanced kinetics is unlikely to be due to a change in local stability of the α2 and α3 helices upon labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), but instead appears to be a result of enhanced association kinetics at high labelling densities. This is possibly because the formation of misfolded oligomers of moPrP at pH 4 is rate-limited by association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sengupta et al., 2017</xref>), and involves inter-molecular interactions within the α2-α3 subdomain of monomeric PrP, which misfolds to form the β-rich core of the oligomers.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Correlation of global misfolding rates with change in intrinsic properties, local and global thermodynamic stability upon mutation/labelling</title><p>An increase in protein misfolding/aggregation rates have been shown to correlate well with an increase in hydrophobicity, β-sheet propensity, population of aggregation-prone intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiti et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dobson, 2003</xref>), a decrease in charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calamai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiti et al., 2002a</xref>) and/or local/global thermodynamic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiti and Dobson, 2006</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the present manuscript, Sengupta and Udgaonkar use FRET-based measurements to investigate conformational changes occurring in the α2-α3 and β-1-α1-β2 subdomains of the mouse prion protein (moPrP) after its incorporation into oligomers at low pH. Based on differential changes in FRET between Trp residues (W144 in α1 or W197 in the α2-α3 linker) and TNB attached to engineered Cys in 4 positions around those subdomains, the authors propose a model for moPrP misfolding in which the α2-α3 segment initially compacts, before separating from the β1-α1-β2 subdomain, followed by α1 unfolding and transition of the α2-α3 segment into extended non-native β sheets.</p><p>Revealing the mechanism by which PrP converts into a misfolded isoform is difficult and complex, yet very important, as PrP is the archetype for disease-related propagated misfolding. In contrast to previous studies that mostly analyzed the global aggregation process, the presented FRET-based experiments allow the investigation of sub-steps and conformational transitions in individual domains of PrP. Performing the measurements at low pH is physiologically relevant based on the hypothesis that misfolding in the endosome plays an important role in pathogenesis and/or propagation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In their revised full submission, the authors responded in detail to initial criticism regarding potential changes in Foerster radius upon oligomerization and the artificially fast misfolding behavior of TNB-labeled variant. While the concerns about changes in Foerster radius, quantum yield or kappa square of TNB have been addressed to full satisfaction, there remain major questions about the misfolding kinetics of the TNB- or DANS-labeled mutants. All reviewers agreed that these significant technical concerns need to be addressed prior to further consideration of this manuscript for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) There are major concerns regarding to what extent the mutations and labels are responsible for the observed FRET behavior, and whether misfolding of WT PrP indeed follows the same rules. Whatever leads to faster oligomerization of labeled mutant PrP in isolation may also influence its oligomerization with WT PrP and thus have an effect on the measured FRET kinetics. It is quite intriguing that the rate of initial FRET increase (0.6 or 0.7 h-1) agrees very well with the accelerated misfolding/oligomerization kinetics of the isolated labeled mutants (0.61 – 0.78 h-1). The presented controls (CD and anisotropy) are dominated by the oligomerization behavior of the excess unlabeled &quot;WT&quot; PrP and are thus inept to probe whether the labeled mutant PrP dopant oligomerizes with WT PrP at an accelerated rate, followed by slower assembly of additional WT PrP.</p><p>CD measurements at 10 or 20% dopant revealed a 50% higher global rate of misfolding when fit to a single exponential, which may in fact indicate faster initial association of TNB-labeled monomers even with WT PrP. Clear double exponential behavior may be hard to detect, given the limited resolution (Figure 2B) and the expected low amplitude of a fast phase when using excess WT PrP.</p><p>These concerns about mutant and/or label effects on the FRET measurements are reinforced by the presented model, proposing that the fast conformational change, i.e. helix compaction, occurs at a rate of 0.6-0.7 h-1 only <italic>after</italic> oligomerization, yet all non-FRET readouts monitoring this oligomerization (e.g. anisotropy) show rates of ~ 0.1 h-1. How is that possible? Maybe the helix compaction and segment separation actually happen <italic>before</italic> oligomerization, in a spontaneous misfolding event that precedes assembly? This question relates to the essential debate about whether natively folded PrP fluctuates into a non-native structure before joining an aggregate, or whether it joins the aggregate and then re-configures.</p><p>To draw more solid conclusions, the authors need to use a more direct technique (e.g. FCS, SEC, DLS, AFM and/or inter-molecular-FRET) for assessing the formation kinetics as well as size changes with time for the PrP variants, especially the Trp-less PrP. How do the amount and size of oligomers change with time? Measuring the diffusion constant (and hence size) by FCS as a function of time may allow the authors to assess whether the FRET-labelled molecules are changing conformation before or after becoming incorporated into the oligomer.</p><p>Alternatively, the authors could consider applying some size fractionation method at different time-points to see whether labelled PrP has joined an oligomer before or after (or during) the fast structural change. This approach would have the advantage that different fractions could be characterized regarding their FRET efficiency, providing extra information about how the structure changes along with the growth of the oligomer.</p><p>2) Another issue lies in the fact that mutating multiple Trp residues likely affects protein structure, stability, and dynamics (i.e. activation barriers), which raises questions about the robustness of the conclusions and their applicability. For instance, the Trp-less PrP shows the slowest kinetics, which may indicate that it has some deficiency in conformational conversion and oligomerization. As a minimum, the authors should use an additional method to verify whether the oligomer of Trp-less PrP has similar properties and formation efficiency as the WT oligomers. Whether the fluorescence/FRET measurement using TrP-less PrP in the dopant experiment really represent the kinetics and mechanism of the WT normal PrP is unclear. This issue is intrinsic to the approach and cannot be resolved for the current study, but should be discussed accordingly. An important aspect to consider for the W197 mutants, however, is that the equivalent residue in human PrP, F198, is the site of a pathogenic mutation. F198S is associated with GSS syndrome, an inherited prion disease. That the W197 mutants of moPrP show faster misfolding and oligomerization in the present study could therefore be related to the fact that misfolding is particularly sensitive to this residue, even though an F to W mutation is much more conservative than the F to S mutation responsible for GSS syndrome.</p><p>3) There were initial concerns among the reviewers about the number of novel findings and the apparent overall advance provided by this work. Several previous studies had already concluded that the α2-α3 and β1-α1-β2 segments have to separate and α1 has to unfold prior to the β-conversion, leaving the potential compaction of the α2-α3 helices as the only major new result. However, these concern could be somewhat alleviated during the reviewers' discussions and a more in depth review of the literature, which revealed that previous work, for instance by Eghiaian et al. and Hafner-Bratkovic et al. using thermal denaturation or disulfide crosslinking, were less conclusive and more questionable regarding their relevance for the 'natural' misfolding process of PrP. In contrast, the present paper shows that domain separation occurs spontaneously in acidic conditions, which are endogenously found in endosomes. The authors should therefore better emphasize these advances of their study and in more detail put them into perspective to previous conclusions. Moreover, the somewhat turgid and disjointed writing of the paper does not do full justice to the assays and results. The manuscript is also strongly dominated by the setup of the system and various controls, whereas critical experiments and their discussion are proportionally slim, which should be improved in a revised version.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44698.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In their revised full submission, the authors responded in detail to initial criticism regarding potential changes in Foerster radius upon oligomerization and the artificially fast misfolding behavior of TNB-labeled variant.

We think this is highly unlikely because the average oligomer size is about 50, and would therefore have only one dopant molecule. Nevertheless, it is important to demonstrate directly that 1 dopant molecule per 50-mer during co-aggregation is not responsible for the “intriguing” observation.</p><p>The similarity of rates alluded to, is only true when the dopant molecule is TNB–labelled. We have also carried out FRET experiments for monitoring the 197-169 and 197-223 segments, where instead, the dopant molecules are DANS-labelled. 100% DANS-labeled dopant molecules misfolded at a CD-monitored rate of ~2 h<sup>-1</sup>, which was about 2.5 fold faster than 100% TNB-labelled dopant molecules. Yet, the characteristic times (1/k) for the fast and slow phases of FRET change were comparable for (2% TNB-labelled dopant + 98% Trp-less protein) and (2% DANS-labelled dopant + 98% Trp-Less protein. If the fast change in FRET was indeed a consequence of the altered oligomerization kinetics of Trp-less protein co-aggregating with 2 mol% 197-223-TNB or 197-169-TNB, then it should have been ~2.5 fold faster for the corresponding DANS-labelled dopants. This is not the case. Hence, the fast FRET change is not an effect of the altered oligomerization kinetics of 98 μM Trp-less protein in the presence of 2 μM 197-169-TNB/DANS or 197-223-TNB/DANS, but is a consequence of the compaction of these sequence segments.</p><p>We discuss this in the sixth paragraph of the subsection “Site-specific conformational changes in moPrP monitored by intra-molecular FRET” where we state: “Moreover, even though the 100 μM DANS-labelled proteins by themselves misfolded with a characteristic time of ~0.5 h (Supplementary file 2), which was ~2.5 fold faster than the corresponding TNB-labelled proteins, the observed characteristic times of fluorescence and FRET-monitored changes, when the DANS-labelled proteins were used as dopant proteins, were in qualitative agreement with those of the corresponding TNB-labelled proteins (Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 3 and Supplementary file 2). The lack of correlation between the timescales of misfolding of the labelled proteins by themselves, and timescales when the same proteins were used as dopant proteins, suggests that the fast changes in FRET efficiency are unlikely to be a consequence of altered co-oligomerization kinetics of 98 μM Trp-less moPrP when it co-oligomerizes with 2 μM dopant.”</p><p>We also point out that in our previous analysis of the rise and fall FRET kinetics seen for the 197-169 and 197-223 segments, we had assumed that the conformational changes were happening irreversibly. Our new SEC experiments, described below, have shown that two different oligomer populations (O<sub>S</sub> and O<sub>L</sub>) form reversibly from monomer M. We have re-analyzed our kinetic FRET data taking into account the SEC data, and we show that the two steps of FRET change seen for the 197-169 and 197-223 segments, occur during the formation of O<sub>L</sub> from M and of O<sub>S</sub> from O<sub>L</sub>. The analysis is described in the second paragraph of the subsection “Kinetic modelling of FRET and SEC data”, and also described below in response to a later point of the reviewers.</p><p>We also agree that the CD measurements are dominated by the oligomerization behavior of excess Trp-less moPrP. However, steady state tryptophan fluorescence anisotropy has no contribution from Trp-less moPrP, as it reports only on oligomers containing Trp. SS Trp fluorescence anisotropy therefore does not report on the oligomerization of Trp-less moPrP alone; it either reports solely on the oligomerization of 2 μM labeled moPrP, or the co-oligomerization of Trp-less and labeled moPrP. In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Unlabelled and TNB-labelled mutant variants form misfolded co-oligomers with Trp-less moPrP with comparable kinetics”, we describe how our data clearly indicate that 2 μM labeled moPrP does not oligomerize independently when mixed with 98 μM Trp-less protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>CD measurements at 10 or 20% dopant revealed a 50% higher global rate of misfolding when fit to a single exponential, which may in fact indicate faster initial association of TNB-labeled monomers even with WT PrP.

We have discussed this in the first paragraph of the subsection “Unlabelled and TNB-labelled mutant variants form misfolded co-oligomers with Trp-less moPrP with comparable kinetics” where we have stated: “TNB-labelled W197-C223 moPrP was chosen as the dopant as it misfolds nearly 10-fold faster by itself at 100% labelling density, compared to Trp-less moPrP (Supplementary file 2). […] It should be noted that although the observed kinetics appear to be described well by a single exponential equation, it is not possible to rule out the presence of two exponential components, with one component too small in amplitude to be detected.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These concerns about mutant and/or label effects on the FRET measurements are reinforced by the presented model, proposing that the fast conformational change, i.e. helix compaction, occurs at a rate of 0.6-0.7 h-1 only AFTER oligomerization, yet all non-FRET readouts monitoring this oligomerization (e.g. anisotropy) show rates of ~ 0.1 h-1.

However, we find that this conformational change is only observable at a total protein concentration of 100 μM, in the presence of 98 μM Trp-less moPrP.</p><p>We discuss this in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Unlabelled and TNB-labelled mutant variants form misfolded co-oligomers with Trp-less moPrP with comparable kinetics” where we state: “The fluorescence spectra of the native monomers of the different unlabelled and labelled moPrP variants differed from those of the corresponding misfolded oligomers (Figure 1). […] These results also suggested that in the presence of 98 µM Trp-less moPrP, it was very unlikely that 2 µM dopant protein could misfold before oligomerization, and supported the results of the steady state Trp fluorescence anisotropy measurements which had indicated that the two proteins co-oligomerized.”</p><p>We describe, in our answer to the next point, how we have resolved the conundrum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To draw more solid conclusions, the authors need to use a more direct technique (e.g. FCS, SEC, DLS, AFM and/or inter-molecular-FRET) for assessing the formation kinetics as well as size changes with time for the PrP variants, especially the Trp-less PrP.

Also importantly, it was important for us to remember our own results on oligomerization monitored by size exclusion chromatography SEC, published over the past decade.</p><p>In our earlier studies of wt moPrP, as well as of different mutant moPrP variants, we had shown that the oligomerization reaction leads to the formation of two oligomer populations, the large O<sub>L</sub> population and the smaller O<sub>S</sub> population. It was shown that the transitions between monomer (M) and O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub> are reversible, and that during oligomerization the populations of the two oligomers change with respect to each other. Also importantly, O<sub>L</sub> could transform directly into O<sub>S</sub>.</p><p>We have now monitored oligomerization kinetics of 100 μM Trp-less moPrP using size-exclusion chromatography. In agreement with previous results with WT moPrP at pH 4, O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub> were found to be populated. The populations of these oligomers changed, but their sizes (indicated by their elution volumes) remained fixed as oligomerization progressed. At the end of 60 h, we found the populations of monomer and oligomer (O<sub>S</sub> and O<sub>L)</sub>to be ~14% and ~86% respectively (by integrating the area under each curve). Again in agreement with previous results, M, O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub> were seen to be interconverting. We tested sequential, parallel and triangular kinetic models by carrying out kinetic simulations and global fitting, and found that the sequential model M↔O<sub>L</sub>↔O<sub>s</sub> was able to account for both the size-exclusion and FRET data satisfactorily, with rate constants k<sub>1,</sub> k<sub>-1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub> and k<sub>-2</sub> of 0.09, 0.05, 0.09 and 0.03 h<sup>-1,</sup>respectively.</p><p>In view of these new results and our previous results, it is clear that our earlier analysis, where (i) we did not incorporate the formation of two oligomers and (ii) assumed the conversion between the monomer and oligomer to be irreversible, was obviously incorrect. The incorrect analysis also meant that the rate constants that we had obtained assuming irreversibility and only one oligomer population were erroneous.</p><p>To globally fit the FRET data, the FRET efficiency values for M, O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub> were allowed to vary locally for each sequence-segment. Unfortunately, the FRET efficiency values of O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub> could not be determined experimentally as the SEC column was not able to separate them adequately. We note that the global fitting routine predicted a high FRET efficiency value for O<sub>L</sub> and a low FRET efficiency value for O<sub>S</sub> for the 197-169 and 197-223 sequence segments.</p><p>The new data and analysis therefore resolve the question of when during oligomerization, do the fast FRET changes take place. They indicate that compaction of the erstwhile helical segment takes place along the course of formation of O<sub>L</sub> from M. The subsequent elongation of the erstwhile helical segments, takes place concomitant with the disassembly of O<sub>L</sub> to form O<sub>S</sub>.</p><p>We discuss this in the subsection “Oligomer formation monitored by size-exclusion chromatography” where we state: “To directly monitor the change in population and/or size of the oligomers, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was carried out. In agreement with previous results obtained with WT moPrP (Singh et al., 2014), Trp-less moPrP was found to form two populations of oligomers, the larger O<sub>L</sub> and the smaller O<sub>S</sub>, at pH 4 and 150 mM NaCl, As oligomerization progressed, the total amount of oligomers increased, but the sizes (as estimated from their elution volumes) remained fixed (Figure 3B). […] The poor resolution of the SEC column made it difficult to reliably estimate the relative amounts of O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub> at equilibrium, but it appeared that, O<sub>S</sub> was populated to about a three-fold higher extent than was O<sub>L</sub>.”</p><p>And we also state in the subsection “Kinetic modelling of FRET and SEC data”: “Kinetic simulations and global fitting were carried out to test whether a parallel, sequential or triangular model best described the formation of O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub> from M, taking into account both the SEC and FRET data. […] It is more appropriate to use the M↔O<sub>L</sub> ↔ O<sub>S</sub> mechanism, because it is a simpler kinetic model than the triangular model.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another issue lies in the fact that mutating multiple Trp residues likely affects protein structure, stability, and dynamics (i.e. activation barriers), which raises questions about the robustness of the conclusions and their applicability.

We had characterized the oligomers of Trp-less moPrP (and the labelled and unlabeled mutant variant proteins) using DLS measurements and found them to be comparable to those of WT moPrP in an earlier paper. We have now included the DLS results for Trp-less and moPrP oligomers in this paper for better comparison. Furthermore, we have acknowledged the intrinsic caveat in this study in which Trp-less moPrP has been used as a pseudo WT moPrP analogue.</p><p>We discuss this in the Discussion as follows: “The presence of eight tryptophan residues in WT moPrP prevented its use in suppressing the intermolecular contributions to the FRET signal during oligomer formation. […] With this caveat in mind, the FRET measurements have allowed the delineation of the major structural changes that take place in the monomer, as it converts into soluble β-sheet rich oligomers at pH 4.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An important aspect to consider for the W197 mutants, however, is that the equivalent residue in human PrP, F198, is the site of a pathogenic mutation. F198S is associated with GSS syndrome, an inherited prion disease. That the W197 mutants of moPrP show faster misfolding and oligomerization in the present study could therefore be related to the fact that misfolding is particularly sensitive to this residue, even though an F to W mutation is much more conservative than the F to S mutation responsible for GSS syndrome.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that for the mutant variants W197-C169 and W197-C223, only the former shows a ~2 fold increase in misfolding rates, whereas the latter remains unchanged, compared to WT moPrP (Supplementary file 2). Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the misfolding rate is faster in W197-C169 solely due to the F to W mutation. Instead, the faster misfolding rate for the W197-C169 mutant variant is possibly a result of the S169 to C169 mutation. This residue, located in the loop between β2 and α2 has been shown to be important in controlling the rigidity of the loop and affect the misfolding/aggregation propensity of the prion protein from different species.</p><p>We have discussed this as follows in the Supplementary Materials: “The unlabelled W197-C169 and W197-C223 mutant variants used here were not destabilized, supporting earlier observations that the F197W mutation does not perturb stability and/or unfolding/folding kinetics despite it being equivalent to residue F198 in human PrP, a site for the pathogenic mutation F198S associated with the inherited prion disease, the GSS syndrome (Jenkins et al., 2008). However, the W197-C169 mutant variant misfolded with slightly faster kinetics, compared to the WT moPrP, possibly due to its location in the loop between β2 and α2 (Agarwal et al., 2015; Gossert et al., 2005).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There were initial concerns among the reviewers about the number of novel findings and the apparent overall advance provided by this work.
