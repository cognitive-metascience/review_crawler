different hematopoietic waves. The current challenge is to understand whether these waves interact and whether this affects the function of the immune system. Here we report a molecular pathway regulating the immune response and involving the communication between embryonic and larval hematopoietic waves in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Down-regulating the transcription factor Gcm specific to embryonic hematopoiesis enhances the larval phenotypes induced by over-expressing the pro-inflammatory Jak/Stat pathway or by wasp infestation. Gcm works by modulating the transduction of the Upd cytokines to the site of larval hematopoiesis and hence the response to chronic (Jak/Stat over-expression) and acute (wasp infestation) immune challenges. Thus, homeostatic interactions control the function of the immune system in physiology and pathology. Our data also indicate that a transiently expressed developmental pathway has a long-lasting effect on the immune response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>JAK/STAT</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>Gcm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007379</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour l'Aide à la Recherche sur la Sclérose en Plaques</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research grant and postdoc fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003768</institution-id><institution>Université de Strasbourg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-0030-INRT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Distinct hematopoietic waves interact via transcriptional cascades specific to embryonic hemocytes to ensure the proper immune response in Drosophila.​.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In vertebrates, immune cells are generated from hematopoietic waves occurring at distinct places and times. The first wave occurs in the yolk sac and generates primitive erythrocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Perdiguero and Geissmann, 2016</xref>). Later waves occur at several time points from embryonic to adult stages and produce all the blood lineages of the adult organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cumano and Godin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orkin and Zon, 2008</xref>). Recent advances in lineage tracing approaches have made it possible to unambiguously assess the origin of immune cells and have shown that the immune cells from distinct hematopoietic waves coexist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Perdiguero and Geissmann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ginhoux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoeffel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2015</xref>). Despite these great advances, however, the precise contribution of each wave to the immune response is still poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ditadi et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, cells from the early wave could help those from later mounting an appropriate response, calling for homeostatic interactions in physiological and pathological conditions.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>, a first hematopoietic wave occurs in the procephalic mesoderm during the embryonic life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nardi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gold and Brückner, 2014</xref>). Pluripotent precursors called prohemocytes generate plasmatocytes and crystal cells that constitute the only immune cells until the larval stage. The crystal cells represent 5% of the hemocytes, they remain close to the proventriculus and play role in melanization; the plasmatocytes represent 95% of the hemocytes and are professional macrophages that populate the whole animal. During the larval life, the plasmatocytes shuttle between the hemolymph (circulating hemocytes) and a subepithelium compartment they transiently attach to (resident or sessile hemocytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gold and Brückner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stofanko et al., 2008</xref>). The second wave occurs at the larval stage in the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nardi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grigorian and Hartenstein, 2013</xref>), which starts forming during embryogenesis and keeps growing until the onset of metamorphosis, when it disintegrates to release plasmatocytes and crystal cells into the organism. Upon an acute challenge such as wasp infestation, the larva mounts a complex immune response and similar phenotypes are observed in genetic backgrounds in which pro-inflammatory pathways such as Jak/Stat are constitutively activated, a condition that could be considered as analogous to chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Luo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrison et al., 1995</xref>). Typically, the resident hemocytes leave the sessile compartment and enter in circulation, hemocytes proliferate and plasmatocytes transform into lamellocytes to form cell aggregates called ‘melanotic tumors’ that encapsulate the parasite wasp egg, the lymph gland undergoes premature histolysis and hemocyte release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Letourneau et al., 2016</xref>). The sequence of these events and the contribution of embryonic hematopoiesis to this immune response are not clear.</p><p>We here describe a link in the regulation of inflammation and its threshold of response between events that, in the past, have been described as independent events separated in time and location. We show that the embryonic wave is necessary to mount an adequate immune response upon signaling to the larval wave and that the only known transcription factor specific of the embryonic hemocytes, Glide/Gcm (Gcm throughout the manuscript) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernardoni et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfonso and Jones, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bataillé et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avet-Rochex et al., 2010</xref>) is a major player in this process. Gcm induces the expression of Jak/Stat inhibitors and in so doing inhibits the production of Jak/Stat dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines that eventually control the Jak/Stat pathway in the muscle. As a consequence, the second hematopoietic wave occurring in the lymph gland is affected as well. Thus, the embryonic hematopoietic wave contributes to the inflammatory response and modulates larval hematopoiesis, demonstrating the importance of interactions between embryonic hemocytes and the lymph gland during the inflammatory response. Finally, we highlight the long-lasting effect of a transcription factor expressed early and transiently during hematopoiesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gcm inhibits melanotic tumor formation and induces the expression of jak/Stat inhibitors</title><p>Our first step was to investigate the impact of the embryonic plasmatocytes on systemic inflammation.

Hemocytes start homing and localizing sub-epidermally by L2. The so-called sessile pockets become evident by Early L3 and the process continues until Late L3, when the population of resident hemocytes becomes very prominent and stereotyped. Upon wasp infestation, the resident compartments are already disrupted by Early L3 (30 hr after infestation), with many hemocytes being in circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c,d</xref>). We quantified the phenotypes and counted in average 7.4 sessile pockets/larva (s.e.m. 0.27) in control and 1.2 pockets (s.e.m. 0.31) in infested animals.

The hemocytes are all of embryonic origin by Early L3 as well (24 hr after infestation), but by this stage they start to differentiate into lamellocytes (48.8% express a lamellocyte identity). By contrast, most of the circulating hemocytes come from the lymph gland by Wandering L3 (72 hr after infestation), as only 10.4% are of embryonic origin, suggesting that the lymph glands histolyzed.

We here show that the embryonic <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemocytes represent major mediators of the immune response by transducing signals that eventually affect the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. A crucial player of the underlying cellular network is the Gcm transcription factor, which is specifically expressed in the embryonic hemocytes and modulates the response to chronic and acute challenges. This transiently expressed factor does so by, at least in part, regulating the expression of inhibitors of the Jak/Stat pathway. The activation of this pathway in the embryonic hemocytes induces the overproduction of Upd2 and Upd3, two pro-inflammatory cytokines that in turn activate the Jak/Stat pathway in the muscles and the precocious histolysis of the lymph gland. In sum, a molecular cascade specific to the first hematopoietic wave has long-lasting effects that modulate the second wave and the inflammatory response.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Impact of a developmental cascade on the function of the embryonic hemocytes</title><p>Gcm has been defined as a pioneer transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cattenoz and Giangrande, 2015</xref>). Its total loss triggers embryonic lethality associated with the reduction of hemocytes’ number and the almost complete lack of glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernardoni et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfonso and Jones, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vincent et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hosoya et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 1995</xref>). Using genetic backgrounds that trigger a partial loss of Gcm we could bypass the early defects and reveal its requirement in the immune response (this paper) and in glial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>), showing that pioneer factors have a much broader spectrum of activities than expected. The late functions (glial migration, hemocyte response to inflammation) require lower levels of Gcm than the early functions (glial and hemocyte differentiation), therefore the potential of this transcription actor depends on the cellular context. Interestingly, the late functions seem associated with a modulatory role. In glial migration, Gcm affects the timely initiation of migration and in the immune response as well, Gcm works as a modulator rather than an instructive factor. Typically, downregulating Gcm does not on its own trigger overt signs of inflammation (hemocyte mobilization, lamellocyte differentiation, melanotic tumors or precociously histolyzed lymph glands).</p><p>Gcm allows the proper development of hemocytes that are later able to respond to chronic or acute challenges. Such developmental role fits with the early and transient expression of Gcm in the hemocyte lineages together with the instability of its transcript and product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cattenoz and Giangrande, 2015</xref>). Gcm negatively controls the Jak/Stat pathway upon inducing the expression of the Ptp61F and Socs36E inhibitors in the embryonic hemocytes. We provide several lines of evidence for Jak/Stat pathway inhibition by Gcm to have long-lasting effects. First, over-activating the Jak/Stat pathway specifically in the embryonic hemocytes triggers the formation of melanotic tumors and precocious lymph gland histolysis. Second, silencing Gcm or activating the Jak/Stat pathway in the embryonic hemocytes triggers the overproduction of pro-inflammatory Upd cytokines that act non-autonomously and trigger both tumor formation and precocious lymph gland histolysis. Third, Gcm downregulation triggers the sustained expression of those cytokines in the larval hemocytes, likely through Jak/Stat auto- and cross-regulation. The fact that Gcm expression is not under the control of the immune challenge (Jak/Stat over-activation or wasp infestation) also supports the hypothesis that the observed phenotypes are due to a developmental defect.</p><p>Additional factors likely contribute to the long-lasting effects of modulating Gcm expression in the embryo. In addition, the DamID screen identified Gcm direct targets that are required late in hematopoiesis and/or in hemocyte functions, such as phagocytosis, autophagy and defense response to fungi and Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattenoz et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, Gcm may also directly impact late events in the immune system, as is the case in the nervous system where it induces threshold expression levels of a chemoattractant receptor that promotes glial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the exacerbated response to acute or chronic challenges due to the low levels of Gcm in the embryonic hemocytes indicate that active repression of the pro-inflammatory Jak/Stat pathway may be required to ensure a fast and efficient response upon challenges.</p><p>The finding that altering the expression levels of a developmental factor triggers an inflammatory response that is too strong or too weak, which are both detrimental conditions, constitutes an additional level of control and opens novel perspectives for understanding the molecular mechanisms that modulate the inflammatory response in humans as well. This is particularly exciting in view of recent findings showing that prenatal inflammation and altered development of microglia, the immune cells of the brain, affect the postnatal function of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thion and Garel, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interaction between gcm and the jak/Stat pathway</title><p>The role of Gcm is to prevent a state of chronic inflammation induced by the Jak/Stat pathway. Gcm controls the ‘inflammatory competence’ at least in part by inducing the expression of Ptp61F, Socs36E and Socs44A, which inhibit the Jak/Stat pathway. In so doing, Gcm prevents the production of the Upd2 and Upd3 pro-inflammatory cytokines, whose over-expression is sufficient to induce the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Gcm also directly interacts with dPIAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacques et al., 2009</xref>), which targets Stat92E for degradation via SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kotaja et al., 2002</xref>) and dPIAS induces melanotic tumors when mutated, due to Stat92E constitutive activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Betz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hari et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, Gcm can inhibit the Jak/Stat pathway at least in two ways, by regulating the transcription of the inhibitors, and, in cells in which the Jak/Stat pathway is activated, by binding dPIAS, which in turn inhibits the transcriptional activity of phosphorylated Stat92E.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34890.020</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Schematic model on the molecular cascade leading to tumor formation upon Jak/Stat activation in the embryonic hemocytes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) <italic>gcm&gt; hop<sup>Tum-l</sup></italic> activates the Jak/Stat pathway exclusively in the hemocytes at embryonic stage. This leads to the production of the Upd2/Upd3 pro-inflammatory cytokines in those cells and to the activation of the Jak/Stat pathway in the larval muscles. This ultimately results in the formation of melanotic tumors and in lymph gland histolysis. When <italic>gcm&gt; hop<sup>Tum-l</sup></italic> is combined with <italic>gcm KD</italic> (<bold>b</bold>), the levels of the inhibitors of the Jak/Stat pathway controlled by Gcm (i.e. Ptp61F, Socs36E and Socs44A) decrease in the embryonic hemocytes. This leads to a stronger activation of the Jak/Stat pathway in embryonic hemocytes, which enhances the production of Upd2/Upd3 and the activation of the Jak/Stat pathway in the muscles. As a consequence, <italic>gcm&gt; hop<sup>Tum-l</sup></italic>, <italic>gcm KD</italic> animals display stronger phenotypes in terms of lymph gland histolysis and melanotic tumors.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-34890-fig11-v1"/></fig><p>Despite the multiple levels of regulation, Gcm does not affect all the processes that depend on the Jak/Stat pathway, nor do all the Gcm dependent phenotypes seem to rely on the Jak/Stat pathway: on the one hand, silencing Gcm expression has modest impact on the hemocyte proliferation observed in <italic>hop<sup>Tum-l</sup></italic> animals. On the other hand, the conditional over-activation of the Jak/Stat pathway does not affect hemocyte mobilization, whereas silencing Gcm does, likely through the defective expression of genes required for the attachment of hemocytes to the sessile compartment such as <italic>eater</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderl et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, Gcm modulates the response to wasp infestation, which involves the Jak/Stat pathway and additional cascades.</p><p>How broad is the modulatory role of Gcm in the inflammatory response will await further investigation, but our findings call for a complex cellular network modulating the immune response through multiple organs and tissues including at least the embryonic hemocytes, the muscles and the lymph glands. The future challenge will be to dissect this network and assign specific role to the different tissues and cell types. This will likely include a major player in the humoral response orchestrated by the fat body, which also secretes molecules necessary to mobilize the sessile hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vanha-Aho et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The Gcm transcription factor provides a new key to investigate the basis of the inflammatory response driven by these complex cellular and molecular interactions. Given the overall evolutionary conservation of the hematopoietic cascades, Gcm orthologous genes may have similar roles. Interestingly, the sea urchin <italic>gcm</italic> orthologue is expressed and required for the differentiation of pigment cells, which function as immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calestani et al., 2003</xref>). Focusing on the murine Gcm orthologue will possibly reveal a conserved function in immune/inflammatory responses in higher organisms as well.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of the embryonic hemocytes in the inflammatory response</title><p>Previous studies have shown that circulating hemocytes play a central role in the inflammatory responses induced by the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pastor-Pareja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vanha-Aho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmid et al., 2014</xref>) and by the somatic muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). These circulating hemocytes comprise hemocytes of embryonic origin and hemocyte released from the lymph gland upon immune challenges. The use of <italic>gcmGal4</italic> and <italic>srp(hemo)Gal4</italic> drivers allowed us to dissect the role and the regulation occurring specifically in the embryonic hemocytes. These cells likely represent the earliest cellular target upon wasp infestation (extending on data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Márkus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zettervall et al., 2004</xref>]), in a sequence of events that include the mobilization of resident hemocytes, the formation of tumors and the histolysis of the lymph gland. Together with the finding that <italic>gcm KD</italic> leads to the production of hemocytes that respond much more strongly to inflammatory cues, this demonstrates that an adequate immune response relies on signaling from the embryonic to the larval hematopoietic wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><p>Embryonic hemocytes may play a primordial role by initiating the inflammatory response, which alerts all the tissues including the larval hematopoietic organs: this was observed by expressing <italic>hop<sup>Tum-l</sup></italic> in embryonic hemocytes and noticing the impact on the somatic muscles and the lymph gland. They can also act as transducers of the inflammatory signals between the different organs through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, as knocking down the cytokines in the embryonic hemocytes strongly decreases the systemic inflammation induced by the <italic>hop<sup>Tum-l</sup></italic> mutation.</p><p>In sum, the present work reveals the homeostatic interactions between hematopoietic waves, which ensure an appropriate inflammatory response to acute or chronic challenges. Given that different hematopoietic waves give rise to immune cells that coexist and are endowed with specific properties in vertebrates, it will be interesting to assess whether similar homeostatic interactions take place in higher organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Mouse anti-L4</td><td valign="bottom">Pr.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Embryonic hematopoiesis modulates the inflammatory response and larval hematopoiesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Élio Sucena (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Dr. Giangrande and coworkers describes the early events during the embryonic wave of hematopoiesis with the larval wave of de novo blood cell formation. The manuscript describes a link in the regulation of inflammation and its threshold of response between events that, in the past, have been described as independent events separated in time and location. The conclusions represent novel advancements to the field of <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis. Although the overall perception of the work is positive, several suggestions from the reviewers need to be attended to before the manuscript is reconsidered for publication.</p><p>Major changes necessary:</p><p>1) There is a persistent gap in linking a causal role played by between Gcm and the series of phenotypes that are attributed to its loss of function. As the authors realize, the number of hemocytes/lamellocytes changes as a consequence of LG integrity or by sessile clusters (SC) recruitment. The number of melanotic tumors is also a consequence of lamellocyte production, which in turn may (or may not) be a consequence of LG histolysis. It is unclear what is/are the phenotype(s) directly caused by GCM? It is important to address this question in order to clearly delineate the mechanism.</p><p>2) Related to the above, the broad term &quot;inflammatory response&quot; is neither justified nor necessary in explaining the phenotype. What needs to be made clear, instead, is a careful description of the timeline of events. For example, it is not clear whether histolysis precedes the situations described in Figures 1, 3, 4 and the corresponding text. Similarly, what was the SC status when these hemocyte counts were made? For example, it is unclear in most cases (e.g. Figures 1, 3 and 4, subsection “Gcm regulates signaling from the embryonic to the larval hematopoietic wave”, fourth paragraph) whether there had been histolysis or what was the status of the SCs when haemocyte counts were made.

They should be improved or removed. Figure 8—figure supplement 1A and B need to be improved.

For example, demonstrate that the drivers do not have even weak expression in the LG. Any expression of the driver in other tissues?

The change in levels or lack thereof needs to be demonstrated by qRTPCR. In general a series of RTPCRs will rule out changes due to LG or glial expression.

As the authors realize, the number of hemocytes/lamellocytes changes as a consequence of LG integrity or by sessile clusters (SC) recruitment. The number of melanotic tumors is also a consequence of lamellocyte production, which in turn may (or may not) be a consequence of LG histolysis. It is unclear what is/are the phenotype(s) directly caused by GCM? It is important to address this question in order to clearly delineate the mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Point 1, 2 will be dealt with together as they concern related issues.</p><p>The reviewers ask what is the timeline of events that involve LG histolysis and what is the role of Gcm. Altogether, our data allow us to propose that Gcm has direct effects on the hemocytes, including a negative impact on lamellocyte differentiation, and that this gene also affects the ability of the hemocytes to communicate with the rest of the body.</p><p>To further characterize the direct and the indirect effects of Gcm, we performed additional experiments on the circulating and on the sessile hemocytes as well as on the tumors and on the lymph gland, shown in Figure 2H, 3G-K, 6A-E, 9A-F, Figure 5—figure supplement 1J-K.</p><p>1) We describe the timeline of events.</p><p>We lineage traced the circulating hemocytes at different times upon wasp infestation and showed that the initial response comes from the embryonic hemocytes, followed by the recruitment of hemocytes of larval origin. We present these data in Figure 9F. By L2 (2 h after infestation), the circulating hemocytes are all of embryonic origin. By early L3 (24 h after infestation), they also are of embryonic origin and half of them express a lamellocyte identity. By wandering L3 (72 h after infestation), most of the circulating hemocytes come from the LG. Overall, fewer lamellocytes are in circulation, likely because they are recruited to the tumors.</p><p>2) We analyze the melanotic tumors induced by wasp infestation.</p><p>We lineage traced the hemocytes in the tumors and found that those of embryonic origin are the first contributors. We present these data in Figure 9E. By late L3 (48 h after infestation), the tumors are mostly composed of embryonic hemocytes. By wandering L3 (72 h after infestation), most hemocytes in the tumors are of LG origin.</p><p>3) We analyze the resident hemocytes during development and upon infestation.</p><p>Hemocytes home to the sessile compartment during larval development and are rapidly mobilized upon wasp infestation. We present these data in Figure 9A-D. In physiological conditions, the circulating hemocytes start homing and localize sub-epidermally by L2. This process continues until late L3, when the population of resident hemocytes becomes very prominent and stereotyped. Upon wasp infestation, the resident compartment is already disrupted by early L3 (30 h after infestation), with many hemocytes being in circulation. The early phenotype of the embryonic hemocytes is in line with the lineage tracing and the melanotic tumor data mentioned above.</p><p>To summarize, the embryonic hemocytes represent an early, maybe the earliest, cellular target of wasp infestation and are responsible for the initial formation of tumors. The LG is involved at later stages.</p><p>We summarize these phenotypes in a new schematic (Figure 10).</p><p>4) We analyze the impact of Gcm.</p><p>Quantitative analyses of the infestation assays require standardization of several parameters: number of flies/wasps, number of wasp eggs/fly larva, temperature, length of infestation time. For this reason, the role of Gcm in the immune response was assessed in a genetic approach using gcm KD flies in which the JAK/STAT pathway is over-activated. We present these data in Figure 3G-K. See also the response to point 3.</p><p>a) Silencing Gcm accelerates LG histolysis. hopTum wandering L3 animals with or without gcm show an equally strong LG phenotype, we hence hypothesized that down-regulating Gcm triggers a precocious defect. Indeed, hopTum LGs histolyze significantly earlier, before the wandering stage, when gcm is down-regulated.</p><p>b) Gcm positively controls hemocyte sub-epidermal localization.</p><p>i) The proportion of circulating vs. resident hemocytes increases in animals that are gcm&gt; hopTum, gcm KD compared to that found in gcm&gt; hopTum animals. Hence, Gcm helps the correct localization of the embryonic hemocytes (Figure 5C, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> columns). This finding is in line with the reduced expression of Eater in embryonic gcm KD hemocytes (Figure 1F, left panel). Eater is necessary for hemocytes to localize in the sessile compartment (Bretscher, Honti et al., 2015).</p><p>ii) Gcm likely affects the hemocytes non-autonomously as well. The levels of edin transcripts increase in the fat body of gcm KD animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, right panel). Edin codes for a secreted molecule that mobilizes the sessile hemocytes (Vanha-aho, Anderl et al., 2015). Thus, the embryonic hemocytes likely signal (directly or indirectly) to the fat body, although not through the JAK/STAT pathway (see below). We propose this hypothesis in the Discussion.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34890.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34890-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>In sum, the embryonic hemocytes play a major role in the immune response, which also requires the function of and the interaction with other cells and tissues. Gcm affects both the localization of the embryonic hemocytes (directly/indirectly) and the LG (indirectly). The future challenge will be to dissect the complex molecular cascade controlling tissue homeostasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the above, the broad term &quot;inflammatory response&quot; is neither justified nor necessary in explaining the phenotype. What needs to be made clear, instead, is a careful description of the timeline of events. For example, it is not clear whether histolysis precedes the situations described in Figures 1, 3, 4 and the corresponding text. Similarly, what was the SC status when these hemocyte counts were made? For example, it is unclear in most cases (e.g. Figures 1, 3 and 4, subsection “Gcm regulates signaling from the embryonic to the larval hematopoietic wave”, fourth paragraph) whether there had been histolysis or what was the status of the SCs when haemocyte counts were made.

Could the authors directly test this somehow, perhaps by determining the status of JAKSTAT activation across stages in Hop activated| mutants with or without gcmKD?</p></disp-quote><p>We were also intrigued by the impact of an embryonically expressed gene on a late phenotype. Based on our data, we propose that the embryonic hemocytes send a signal that eventually controls the second hematopoietic wave. In the gcm KD embryonic hemocytes this is, at least in part, mediated by the JAK/STAT pathway that cell-autonomously induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which then activate the JAK/STAT pathway in the somatic muscles. Here are the old and the new evidence for this:</p><p>1) Gcm induces the expression of JAK/STAT inhibitors in the embryo and in S2 cells (Figure 2E, F).</p><p>2) The JAK/STAT pathway can activate the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines Upd2/3 in S2 cells (Figure 4G).</p><p>3) Gcm inhibits the expression of those cytokines in S2 cells and in the larval hemocytes (Figure 4E-G). These data suggest that Upd2 and Upd3 can relay the triggering role of Gcm, as also confirmed by the LG and tumor phenotypes of animals over-expressing any of the cytokines in the embryonic hemocytes.</p><p>At this point, we still missed the demonstration that JAK/STAT activation in the embryonic hemocytes results in high levels of upd2 and upd3 expression in the hemocytes at the larval stage.</p><p>4) We filled the gap and showed that the over-expression of the JAK/STAT pathway in the embryonic hemocytes (srp(hemo)&gt; hopTum) leads to increased expression of upd2 and upd3 in those cells at the larval stage (qRT-PCR assays). This validates the hypothesis that JAK/STAT activation cell-autonomously induces the expression of the cytokines and that this is still detectable in L3 hemocytes, well after the pathway has been over-activated. To please the reviewer(s), for these new data we used the srp(hemo) driver. We present these data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1J-K.</p><p>5) We extended the data on the non-autonomous role of the JAK/STAT pathway. We analyzed the levels as well as the nuclear localization of the STAT protein in the muscles of srp(hemo)&gt; hopTum larvae. Nuclear STAT is generally associated with high STAT levels and indicates activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Interestingly, overexpressing hopTum solely in the embryonic hemocytes enhances the overall levels of STAT in the larval muscles but not its nuclear localization. In addition, down-regulating gcm in those animals further enhances the overall levels of STAT and also results in STAT nuclear localization. We present these data in Figure 6. Of note, we see no activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in the fat body of the srp(hemo)hopTum larvae (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Thus, the JAK/STAT pathway acts directly and indirectly on the immune response (Figure 11).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34890.025</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34890-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><p>6) JAK/STAT activation in the somatic muscles is known to affect the immune response to wasp infestation (Dan Hultmark and collaborators, Yang et al., 2015), a phenotype that involves the lymph gland. We agree with the reviewers that the role of Gcm is to prevent a state of chronic inflammation by the JAK/STAT pathway.</p><p>Altogether, our data indicate that the main role of Gcm is to sensitize the embryonic hemocytes and to enhance their response to an immune challenge (hopTum activation, wasp infestation). Gcm inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the embryonic hemocytes, these cytokines then talk to the muscles, which accelerates LG histolysis.</p><p>7) Due to known auto and cross-regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway with other pathways, the levels of upd2/3 remain high even after gcm expression fades away (Figure 4E-F).</p><p>We went further and showed that Stat expression is not over-activated in the</p><p>(srp(hemo)&gt; hopTum) larval hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). This may suggest that upd2 and upd3 expression becomes JAK/STAT independent in the 3<sup>rd</sup>instar. These data are not included in the manuscript, which is already quite dense.</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34890.026</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34890-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Improve the quality of the figures.

This panel shows that down-regulating gcm induces changes in blood cell specification. The expressivity of the phenotype is low, indicating that Gcm acts as a sensitizing rather than a pioneer (instructive) factor. It is also possible that some cells do not show the full phenotype but are on the go to become lamellocytes, as Hultmark and collaborators (Anderl, Vesala et al., 2016) identified hemocytes with different intermediate phenotypes in challenged conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The images in Figure 2A, C are out of focus and overexposed.

Individual cells in that case are not easy to identify. Moreover, we cannot compare the number of lamellocytes on histolyzed LG lobes, as this would lead to misinterpretation of the results. To that purpose, we relied on determining the percentage of L4 expressing lobes (LGs). Moreover, we did not count the number of circulating lamellocytes within the larvae where LG analysis was performed due to the fact that those larvae were selected and directly processed for LG dissections. It is not practical to count the total number of lamellocytes and perform LG analysis on the same larvae. On the other hand, we performed total hemocyte counts on other larvae that were not subjected to LG analysis, yet they are of the same genotype (Figure 1D, E; Figure 5—figure supplement 1D-F).

Nevertheless, we previously published that all these genes appear in the Gcm-DAM ID screen aimed at identifying the direct targets of Gcm (Cattenoz, Popkova et al., 2016). Not only do they contain Gcm-DAM ID peaks but also carry Gcm binding sites at their loci. All the other targets identified in the screen were found to be directly regulated by Gcm upon mutagenesis of the Gcm binding sites. Therefore, we are quite confident that is also the case for the JAK/STAT inhibitors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
