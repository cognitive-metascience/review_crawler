We find that multiple alphaviruses, including chikungunya (CHIKV), Ross River (RRV), and o’nyong ‘nyong (ONNV) viruses, are cleared from the circulation of mice by liver Kupffer cells, impeding viral dissemination. Clearance from the circulation was independent of natural antibodies or complement factor C3, and instead relied on scavenger receptor SR-A6 (MARCO). Remarkably, lysine to arginine substitutions at distinct residues within the E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV and ONNV (E2 K200R) as well as RRV (E2 K251R) allowed for escape from clearance and enhanced viremia and dissemination. Mutational analysis revealed that viral clearance from the circulation is strictly dependent on the presence of lysine at these positions. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized innate immune pathway that controls alphavirus viremia and dissemination in vertebrate hosts, ultimately influencing disease severity and likely transmission efficiency.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49163.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses transmitted by blood-feeding insects, such as mosquitoes and ticks, cause serious human diseases. In recent years these viruses (also known as arboviruses) have re-emerged at an unprecedented scale, leading to global outbreaks of diseases such as Zika or chikungunya fever. The severity of these diseases and how easily they can be transmitted depends, in part, on the level of virus in the host’s bloodstream following infection. The more viral particles present in the blood, the easier it is for other insects that bite the host to become infected and help spread the disease. Yet, the mechanisms that hosts use to control the amount of virus present in the blood and how long it persists are poorly understood.</p><p>To investigate this further, Carpentier et al. used a combination of molecular and genetic techniques to study how mice clear particles of arbovirus from their bloodstream. Surgically removing the spleen from infected mice revealed that this organ, which filters out unwanted or damaged materials from blood, is not required to clear some arbovirus particles. Carpentier et al. found that removing these arboviruses from the blood instead required Kupffer cells, a type of immune cell found in the liver.</p><p>Genetically manipulating mice so they no longer produced a protein on the surface of Kupffer cells known as MARCO revealed that this receptor is needed to clear chikungunya viral particles. When MARCO was genetically deleted this led to an increase in the number of viral particles in the mice’s bloodstream, and allowed the virus to spread more rapidly throughout the bodies of the mice. Further experiments on three different types of arboviruses showed that in order to be cleared by MARCO, each of these viruses needed a lysine residue – one of the building blocks that makes up proteins – at defined positions within their protein sequence.</p><p>These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism for how hosts remove arbovirus particles from their bloodstream. Future studies could use this information to identify new ways to control the transmission and reduce the severity of these viral diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>arbovirus</kwd><kwd>scavenger receptor</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>alphavirus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI123348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Thomas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 AI140567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carpentier</surname><given-names>Kathryn S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AI007405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carpentier</surname><given-names>Kathryn S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The scavenger receptor MARCO and liver phagocytes are required for clearance of circulating alphavirus particles and thereby limit viremia and viral dissemination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the past several decades, multiple arboviruses, including dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, have re-emerged to cause widespread epidemics affecting millions of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weaver, 2018</xref>). For example, DENVs are estimated to cause ~390 million infections per year resulting in ~500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome that can result in death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>). Since 2004, CHIKV has infected millions of people and expanded into Europe, Asia, the Pacific region, and the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Volk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zeller et al., 2016</xref>). Joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, and tenosynovitis, can endure for months to years after CHIKV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgherini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Couturier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gérardin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schilte et al., 2013</xref>). As chronic CHIKV disease is debilitating, large epidemics have severe economic impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardona-Ospina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soumahoro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vijayakumar et al., 2013</xref>). ZIKV caused outbreaks on Yap Island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duffy et al., 2009</xref>) and islands of French Polynesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Musso et al., 2018</xref>) in 2007 and 2013, respectively, before being introduced to the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Metsky et al., 2017</xref>). Here, ZIKV caused nearly one million confirmed and suspected cases and became recognized as a cause of congenital neurodevelopmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pierson and Diamond, 2018</xref>). The lack of safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics limits prevention and treatment of many arboviral diseases.</p><p>The magnitude and duration of viremia in vertebrate hosts are important determinants of arboviral emergence, transmission efficiency, and geographic spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weaver, 2018</xref>). A subset of arboviruses, including CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV, are capable of sustained human-mosquito-human transmission cycles, allowing for rapid spread through urban environments. This is in part due to the capacity of these viruses to generate a magnitude and duration of viremia in humans sufficient to infect mosquito vectors and propagate the transmission cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weaver, 2018</xref>). Moreover, for many arboviruses, viremia levels correlate with disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chow et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de St Maurice et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pozo-Aguilar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vaughn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Waggoner et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the critical role for viremia during arboviral infections, innate host defenses that determine the magnitude and duration of arboviral viremia in vertebrate hosts are poorly defined.</p><p>Phagocytic cells are strategically positioned within organs such as the spleen and liver to detect and capture circulating self and non-self molecules. In the murine spleen, blood released from terminal arterioles drains into the marginal zone, which separates the white and red pulp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lewis et al., 2019</xref>). Within the marginal zone, tissue resident marginal zone (MZM) and metallophilic (MMM) macrophages surveil the blood for circulating antigens, apoptotic cells, debris, and pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borges da Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lewis et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, splenic red pulp macrophages (RPM) also function to surveil the circulation by removing aberrant red blood cells as well as some pathogens, such as malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borges da Silva et al., 2015</xref>). Similar to the marginal zone of the spleen, cell populations in liver sinusoids, including tissue resident macrophages (i.e., Kupffer cells (KCs)), effectively survey blood as it percolates through the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hickey and Kubes, 2009</xref>). For example, following intravenous inoculation, bacteria are captured within seconds by KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), whereas the absence of KCs results in persistent bacteremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Although the surveillance function of these tissues and cells is well-established, how they influence viremia following arbovirus infections has not been defined.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that phagocytic cells are essential for efficient clearance of multiple alphaviruses from the circulation, thus limiting viremia and impeding viral dissemination. Experiments in splenectomized mice showed that the spleen is dispensable for clearance of these circulating alphaviruses. Consistent with this, we found that virus accumulates in the liver, and liver resident KCs play a dominant role in removing circulating alphavirus particles. Mechanistically, we identified SR-A6 (MARCO) as the receptor required for efficient alphavirus clearance. We also found that discrete lysine (K) to arginine (R) mutations in the E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV and o’nyong ‘nyong virus (ONNV) (E2 K200R), as well as Ross River virus (RRV) (E2 K251R), abrogated clearance of circulating alphavirus particles, and promoted rapid viral dissemination. Moreover, substitution of the lysine residues at CHIKV E2 200 or RRV E2 251 with a variety of other amino acids also allowed for clearance evasion, indicating an essential requirement for key lysine residues in E2 for efficient viral clearance from the circulation. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized innate immune pathway that controls alphavirus viremia and dissemination in vertebrate hosts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phagocytic cells efficiently clear multiple alphaviruses from the circulation</title><p>To explore whether phagocytic cells participate in the clearance of circulating arboviruses, we treated mice intravenously (i.v.) with PBS- (control) or clodronate-loaded liposomes (PLL or CLL, respectively) to deplete phagocytic cells in the spleen, liver, and circulation that are in direct contact with blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Seiler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Van Rooijen and Sanders, 1994</xref>). The uptake of CLL by phagocytic cells results in intracellular release of the encapsulated clodronate which is cytotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Rooijen, 1989</xref>). At 42 hr (h) post-treatment, mice were i.v. inoculated with clinical isolates of CHIKV, ONNV, or RRV, all pathogenic alphaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morrison, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Suhrbier et al., 2012</xref>), and viral RNA or infectious virus in the serum was analyzed at 45 minutes (min) post-inoculation. In PLL-treated mice, viral particles (CHIKV and RRV) or plaque forming units (ONNV) were nearly undetectable in the serum by 45 min post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In stark contrast, CLL-treated mice had 3–4 orders of magnitude higher amounts of viral particles (CHIKV and RRV) or plaque-forming units (ONNV) in the serum at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Viral RNA in PLL-treated mice also was absent from the clotted fraction of the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating that CHIKV particles had been removed from the circulation.

To determine the relative contribution of the spleen, viral clearance was evaluated in mice that underwent sham or splenectomy surgeries. CHIKV was efficiently cleared from the circulation of splenectomized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), demonstrating that the spleen is not required for clearance of circulating CHIKV. Moreover, CLL-pretreatment blocked CHIKV clearance in splenectomized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that the remaining phagocytic cells in the liver are sufficient to clear CHIKV from the circulation. Consistent with this, CHIKV RNA accumulated in the liver of control PLL-treated mice, and this specific accumulation was lost in CLL-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, viral RNA levels increased in the spleen and lung of CLL-treated mice compared with control PLL-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), likely due to the high amounts of virus present in contaminating blood. Moreover, CHIKV RNA is readily detectable by in situ hybridization in the livers of PLL-treated mice at 45 min post-inoculation, but not in CLL-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

These data suggest that clearance of circulating alphavirus particles is independent of receptors for fragments of C3 and of Fc receptors. Scavenger receptors (SRs) are a large family of transmembrane proteins that capture and eliminate a broad range of endogenous and microbial ligands via non-opsonic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Canton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mukhopadhyay and Gordon, 2004</xref>). To test the hypothesis that one or more SRs mediate clearance of alphavirus particles from the circulation, 5 min prior to inoculation of virus, mice were pre-treated i.v. with the polyanionic SR competitive inhibitor poly(I), or poly(C), a polyanion that is not a competitive inhibitor of SRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pearson et al., 1993</xref>). Similar to pretreatment with CLL, poly(I) pretreatment potently inhibited the clearance of circulating CHIKV and RRV particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similar results were observed following pretreatment of mice with dextran sulfate (DS), another SR ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Platt and Gordon, 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To identify SRs that are expressed by KCs, we mined publicly available single-cell transcriptomic data of the mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>), and found SR-A1 (MSR1), SR-A6 (MARCO), SR-B1 (SCARB1), SR-B2 (CD36), and SR-I1 (CD163) mRNAs to be robustly expressed in KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of these, only SR-A1 and MARCO are known to bind poly(I) and DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Platt and Gordon, 1998</xref>). To investigate the relative contributions of SR-A1 and MARCO, CHIKV clearance was evaluated in SR-A1<sup>-/-</sup> and MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice. CHIKV particles were efficiently cleared from the circulation of SR-A1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, and this clearance was inhibited by pre-treatment of SR-A1<sup>-/-</sup> mice with poly(I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating that CHIKV clearance was still occurring through a SR-dependent mechanism. In contrast, CHIKV particles remained readily detectable in the serum of MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 45 min post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Moreover, whereas pretreatment with CLL blocked clearance of circulating CHIKV particles in WT mice, this treatment had no effect on the level of CHIKV in the circulation of MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Furthermore, CHIKV RNA was detectable by in situ hybridization in the liver of PLL-treated WT mice, but not in the liver of PLL-treated MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice or CLL-treated WT and MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Despite the virological differences in the circulation and liver of PLL-treated WT and MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice, these mice had a similar number of KCs in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

In prior studies, DENV and West Nile virus (WNV) clearance from the circulation of mice was found to be influenced by N-linked glycans on viral envelope glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuchs et al., 2010</xref>). CHIKV E2 is predicted to be glycosylated at N345, N263 and N273 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Metz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Voss et al., 2010</xref>). N345 is located in the E2 stem near the transmembrane domain, making it unlikely that glycans at this position mediate interactions with MARCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Voss et al., 2010</xref>). To investigate if the more surface exposed glycosylation sites influenced clearance, we introduced asparagine to glutamine mutations at N263 and N273 to disrupt glycosylation. Mutation of positions N263 or N273 alone, or in combination, had no effect on the clearance of CHIKV particles from the circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating that clearance of CHIKV particles does not rely on glycosylation at these sites.</p><p>Previously, we identified a mutation in the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein (E2 K200R) in virus persistently circulating in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hawman et al., 2017</xref>). This mutation enhanced CHIKV dissemination in mice following subcutaneous inoculation and caused more severe disease outcomes. These effects were associated with a strongly elevated viremia. Having identified an important role for phagocytic cells and MARCO in the clearance of CHIKV particles from the circulation, we hypothesized that the E2 K200R mutation allows for viral escape from phagocytic cell-mediated clearance. Indeed, unlike WT CHIKV, which is efficiently cleared from the circulation, CHIKV E2 K200R particles remained stably detectable in the serum for at least 1 hr post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, the differential clearance was not dependent on the cell type from which the viral particles were derived, as differential clearance of WT and E2 K200R CHIKV particles was maintained when virions were derived from human fibroblasts, a clinically relevant cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Couderc et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The E2 K200R mutation did not impact the stability of viral particles in serum, demonstrating that this effect was not due to differential stability of WT and E2 K200R CHIKV particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Moreover, the levels of E2 K200R CHIKV particles in control PLL-treated mice were indistinguishable from WT and E2 K200R CHIKV particles in the circulation of mice pre-treated with CLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), demonstrating that CHIKV E2 K200R allows for evasion of phagocytic cell-mediated clearance.

To further map biochemical features of amino acid side chains that associate with efficient viral clearance by phagocytic cells, we introduced a variety of amino acid substitutions at CHIKV E2 200. The amino acid panel was designed to evaluate positively charged (K, R, H), negatively charged (D), hydrophobic (A, L), and polar, uncharged (Q, S) amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

These findings suggest that clearance of these alphavirus particles from the circulation is strictly dependent on the presence of a lysine residue at E2 200 (CHIKV) or E2 251 (RRV).

While liver KCs have been implicated as a critical innate defense against blood-borne bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jenne and Kubes, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krenkel and Tacke, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kubes and Jenne, 2018</xref>), this work expands their role to additionally serve as sentinels for circulating CHIKV, ONNV, and RRV. Mechanistically, this innate clearance pathway occurs independently of opsonization with natural antibody or fragments of C3, and instead is mediated by the scavenger receptor MARCO. While our data suggest that KCs in the liver are primarily responsible for clearance of these alphavirus particles from the circulation, MARCO is known to be expressed by other macrophage populations exposed to the blood, including MZM in the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borges da Silva et al., 2015</xref>). Although we found that the spleen is not necessary for the clearance of circulating CHIKV particles, it remains possible that MZM contribute to the clearance of this group of alphaviruses in intact mice. Further work is needed to evaluate whether KCs are required for the clearance of circulating CHIKV, ONNV, and RRV particles, or whether other macrophage populations can compensate in their absence.</p><p>Beyond the antiviral antibody response, the virus-host interactions that determine the magnitude and duration of vertebrate viremia following an arbovirus infection are poorly understood. In some cases, alphavirus particles interact directly with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparan sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byrnes and Griffin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heil et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klimstra et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smit et al., 2002</xref>), that are ubiquitously found on the surface of mammalian cells. Following serial passage in cell culture, alphaviruses frequently acquire adaptive mutations that enhance interactions between viral particles and GAGs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byrnes and Griffin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heil et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klimstra et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Silva et al., 2014</xref>). Alphaviruses that have acquired enhanced in vitro GAG binding are rapidly cleared from the circulation of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Byrnes and Griffin, 2000</xref>), suggesting that virion-GAG interactions are one mechanism that can determine the magnitude and duration of arboviral viremia. However, the extent to which specific GAGs contribute to clearance of circulating alphavirus particles has not been defined in vivo. Beyond GAGs, previous work demonstrated that opsonization of DENV particles by mannose binding lectin (MBL), which can neutralize particles via a C3-dependent mechanism, accelerated their clearance from the circulation of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuchs et al., 2010</xref>). However, we found that the innate clearance of circulating CHIKV and RRV was maintained in mice lacking C3 and in mice lacking antibodies, suggesting that the clearance of these circulating alphavirus particles occurs through a non-opsonic mechanism.</p><p>SRs are expressed on a variety of tissue resident macrophage populations, including those in the liver and spleen that surveil the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kubes and Jenne, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lewis et al., 2019</xref>). SRs mediate non-opsonic clearance of a variety of circulating self and non-self molecules due to their capacity to recognize a diverse range of ligands, including modified endogenous proteins or lipoproteins, as well as bacterial surface proteins, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and lipotechoic acid (LTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Areschoug and Gordon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Canton et al., 2013</xref>). We found that the clearance of circulating CHIKV and RRV particles was inhibited by pre-treatment of mice with the SR competitive inhibitors poly(I) and dextran sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Platt and Gordon, 1998</xref>), supporting a role for SRs in clearance of these alphaviruses from the circulation. Poly(I) and dextran sulfate are known ligands for the class A scavenger receptors SR-A1 and MARCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Platt and Gordon, 1998</xref>), both of which are transcriptionally expressed in liver KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>). SR-A1 and MARCO play a prominent role in host defense by functioning as phagocytic receptors for multiple bacterial pathogens. For example, mice deficient in SR-A1 are more susceptible to infection with <italic>L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, S. pneumonia and N. meningitides,</italic> and MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice have enhanced sensitivity to infection with <italic>S. pneumonia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Areschoug and Gordon, 2009</xref>). However, less is known about the role of class A scavenger receptors during viral infections. SR-A1 has a protective role during systemic herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Suzuki et al., 1997</xref>), and HSV-1 can utilize MARCO for attachment and entry into epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">MacLeod et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, vaccinia virus (VacV) binding to MARCO on keratinocytes enhances infection of these cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">MacLeod et al., 2015</xref>). MARCO also mediates transduction of macrophages by adenovirus in vitro, and appears to promote innate immune responses to the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maler et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that MARCO-virus interactions can regulate host cell responses to infection. Our studies in SR-A1<sup>-/-</sup> and MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice identified critical roles for MARCO in the efficient clearance of circulating CHIKV particles and for limiting viral dissemination and the magnitude and duration of viremia, suggesting that MARCO may limit disease severity following CHIKV infection.</p><p>Beyond identification of the cell type and specific receptor involved in the clearance of alphavirus particles from the circulation, we also defined viral features that facilitate host recognition and clearance of viral particles by phagocytic cells. N-linked glycosylation of DENV and WNV glycoproteins was previously found to influence clearance of these viral particles from the circulation of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuchs et al., 2010</xref>). However, we found that mutation of the predicted surface-exposed CHIKV E2 glycosylation sites had no impact on the clearance of CHIKV particles from the circulation, suggesting that clearance occurs independent of E2 glycosylation. To define the viral features that mediated clearance of circulating alphavirus particles, we identified CHIKV and RRV strains that evade phagocytic cell-mediated clearance. CHIKV E2 K200R was isolated from the serum of a <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse chronically infected with an Asian genotype CHIKV strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hawman et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that this mutation arose as a mechanism to evade phagocytic cell-mediated clearance from the circulation. Introduction of an E2 K200R mutation into CHIKV strains representative of the Asian-American, ECSA, and West African CHIKV clades also facilitated escape of viral particles from phagocytic cell-mediated clearance and enhanced viral dissemination following subcutaneous inoculation. Moreover, E2 K200 is conserved in the closely related alphavirus ONNV, and introduction of an E2 K200R mutation in this independent alphavirus species also allowed for escape from clearance from the circulation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that an E2 K200R mutation can function in a variety of distinct genetic backgrounds to facilitate escape of circulating alphavirus particles from MARCO-dependent clearance. While we found that circulating RRV particles also are susceptible to clearance by phagocytic cells, RRV has an asparagine at E2 200, suggesting that a viral feature other than E2 K200 promotes the clearance of circulating RRV particles. Analysis of a panel of RRV strains revealed that the RRV T48 strain, in contrast to strains SN11 and DC5692, was relatively resistant to clearance by phagocytic cells. Through chimeric and mutational analysis of susceptible (DC5692) and resistant (T48) RRV strains, we discovered that a lysine residue at E2 251 is essential for efficient clearance of RRV particles from the circulation. Thus, discrete lysine residues in the E2 glycoprotein of three independent alphaviruses promote their efficient clearance from the circulation.</p><p>We were surprised that single lysine to arginine mutations at discrete sites in E2 allowed circulating alphavirus particles to escape from clearance by phagocytic cells, as the side chains of lysine and arginine are both positively charged and similar in length. To more thoroughly evaluate biochemical features of the residue at CHIKV E2 200 or RRV E2 251 that promote particle clearance or particle escape from clearance, we generated panels of CHIKV and RRV strains encoding amino acids at positions E2 200 or 251 with positively-charged, negatively-charged, hydrophobic, or polar uncharged side chains. Moreover, this panel of amino acids also had a wide variety of side chain lengths and structures. Remarkably, with the exception of lysine, all amino acid substitutions at CHIKV E2 200 or RRV E2 251 allowed for evasion of clearance from the circulation. These findings suggest that a lysine residue at CHIKV E2 200 or RRV E2 251 is essential for MARCO-dependent clearance of circulating viral particles. Taken together, these observations suggest that these lysine residues may be post-translationally modified to facilitate capture and clearance of circulating alphavirus particles. A number of observations from this study and previously published studies support this idea, including (1) an E2 K200R mutation functions in a variety of distinct genetic backgrounds to facilitate escape of circulating CHIKV and ONNV particles from MARCO-dependent clearance; (2) a lysine residue at a distinct site in RRV E2 is essential for phagocytic-cell mediated clearance of circulating RRV particles; (3) while the lysine that mediates RRV clearance is conserved in CHIKV, mutating this lysine has no impact on clearance of circulating CHIKV particles; (4) lysine is frequently post-translationally modified, and can be modified with a diverse range of post-translational modifications (PTMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azevedo and Saiardi, 2016</xref>); and (5) SRs were initially identified based on their capacity to capture lysine acetylated low density lipoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Platt and Gordon, 1998</xref>). However, whether specific features of unmodified lysine residues within particular structural contexts of E2, or post-translational modifications of these lysine residues, allow for alphavirus recognition by phagocytic cells requires additional biochemical and structural analyses, and thus remains to be determined.</p><p>Despite the apparent benefit for the virus to encode an arginine or other amino acid at E2 200 or 251, lysine residues at CHIKV E2 200, ONNV E2 200, and RRV E2 251 are commonly found in virus isolates. Analysis of E2 protein sequences in the ViPR database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pickett et al., 2012</xref>) revealed that 1,333/1,335 CHIKV sequences encode a lysine at position E2 200 (2/1,335 encode an arginine), 8/8 ONNV sequences encode a lysine, and 187/204 available RRV sequences encode a lysine at position E2 251, while the remaining 17 encode an arginine. One possible explanation for this conservation could be that a lysine residue at this position provides a fitness advantage in the mosquito vector. However, we found that CHIKV E2 K200R replication and dissemination was indistinguishable from that of WT CHIKV in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, and no selective disadvantage of an arginine residue at this position was observed in direct competition experiments, suggesting that the conservation of lysine at CHIKV E2 200 is not due to constraints in the mosquito vector. Alternatively, the susceptibility or resistance of circulating alphavirus particles to clearance may be influenced by polymorphisms in SRs. Genes encoding SRs, including MARCO, exhibit substantial genetic variation in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowdish and Gordon, 2009</xref>) and this variation can have functional consequences. For example, position 252 of MARCO is known to be polymorphic in humans, and the less common variant has a decreased capacity to phagocytize bacteria in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Novakowski et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, SNPs within human SRs associate with differential susceptibility to various pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowdish et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">High et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Westhaus et al., 2017</xref>). Following alphavirus infections, human patients exhibit a high degree of variability in peak viremia and disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chow et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de St Maurice et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Musso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thiberville et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vaughn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Waggoner et al., 2016</xref>). Given this, inter- or intra-host variability within SRs may influence the susceptibility of alphaviruses to SR-dependent clearance from the circulation, contributing to variability in viremia and disease outcomes. Similar species-specific effects have been observed with multiple pathogen recognition receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, MARCO is evolving under positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yap et al., 2015</xref>), a signature often associated with host-viral conflicts. Thus, circulating alphaviruses may have adapted to their cognate hosts and can readily evade this defense mechanism in certain vertebrates, but the MARCO allele in the mouse strains evaluated in this study allows these alphaviruses to be efficiently cleared from the circulation. More work is needed to determine whether polymorphisms within or between vertebrate species influence SR-dependent clearance of circulating alphaviruses.</p><p>The efficient clearance of alphaviruses from the circulation by phagocytic cells has important implications for the course of infection. The CHIKV E2 K200R strain that escapes MARCO-dependent clearance generates a higher viremia, disseminates to distal sites more rapidly, and causes more severe disease outcomes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hawman et al., 2017</xref>). Analogously, infection of MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice with WT CHIKV also resulted in enhanced viremia and more rapid viral dissemination to distal sites, suggesting that the E2 K200R mutation allows the virus to escape from MARCO-dependent clearance. Consistent with our data, prior studies found that some strains of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus accumulated in the liver following i.v. inoculation of hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jahrling and Gorelkin, 1975</xref>) and that depletion of phagocytic cells with clodronate liposomes resulted in a higher magnitude and duration of viremia following subcutaneous CHIKV infection of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gardner et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, clodronate liposome depletion of phagocytic cells enhanced WNV viremia and disease severity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryan et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that phagocytic cell-mediated clearance of circulating arboviruses has implications that span virus genera. Beyond disease outcomes, the magnitude and duration of viremia also greatly influences transmission cycles. While some arboviruses, such as WNV and Japanese Encephalitis virus, are unable to generate a viremia of sufficient magnitude in humans to infect a mosquito vector and propagate the transmission cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weaver, 2018</xref>), others like CHIKV, DENV, and Zika virus are readily amplified through human-mosquito-human cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weaver, 2018</xref>). Susceptibility or resistance to clearance by liver macrophages, other scavenging cell types such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and SRs may contribute to whether humans are dead-end hosts for an arbovirus or can fuel widespread epidemics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for Key Resources Table.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

At 42 hours post-treatment, mice were i.v. inoculated with CHIKV. At 45 min post virus inoculation the following analyses were performed: (1) viral RNA in the serum was quantified by RT-qPCR, (2) viral RNA accumulation in the liver was assessed by in situ hybridization, and (3) F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells in the liver were visualized by immunohistochemistry and quantified by counting the number of F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells per field. These new analyses demonstrated that pretreatment with CLL blocked clearance of circulating CHIKV particles in WT mice, but had no effect on the level of CHIKV in the circulation of MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice (new Figure 3G). Furthermore, CHIKV RNA was detectable by in situ hybridization in the liver of PLL-treated WT mice, but not in the liver of PLL-treated MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice or CLL-treated WT and MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice (new Figure 3H). In addition, despite the virological differences in the circulation and liver of PLL-treated WT and MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice, these mice had a similar number of KCs in the liver (new Figure 3I). Finally, both WT and MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> KCs were efficiently depleted by CLL (new Figure 3H and 3I), indicating that MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> KCs retain the capacity to phagocytose liposomes. Thus, these new experiments support the conclusions that MARCO is required for clearance of circulating CHIKV particles and that MARCO is required for accumulation of CHIKV in the liver following i.v. inoculation of viral particles. In addition, these experiments address concerns raised in point #2 below. That is, the new data show that WT and MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice have a similar number of F4/80<sup>+</sup> KCs in the liver and that in both strains of mice these cells are efficiently depleted by CLL, which requires functional phagocytic processes.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers request for viral binding studies in matched MARCO+ and MARCO- cells. However, viral binding to cells in culture is influenced by a variety of factors, including cell type and the abundance and nature of a number of other attachment factors such as glycosaminoglycans and proteinaceous entry receptors (Mxra8 and one or more additional unknown receptors) (1, 2). Moreover, flow-induced shear forces that occur in liver sinusoids (the anatomical home of KCs) may promote the interaction between alphaviral particles and MARCO. This concept has been formally demonstrated for capture of leukocytes by selectins expressed on endothelial cells. That is, their ligand-binding is improved under flow conditions (3, 4). In addition, a similar process has recently been described for neutrophil arrest; flow conditions dramatically enhanced neutrophil arrest by the CD99 receptor PILR-β1, which displays low affinity for CD99 under static conditions (5). Thus, while we are currently developing cell-based assays to explore a role for MARCO in viral binding, including the use of primary Kupffer cells under flow conditions, we feel that these complex experiments are beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To consider alternative hypotheses, the authors should evaluate whether KC in MARCO KO mice are present in normal numbers, have normal function (uptake of latex beads, for example), and express other scavenger receptors at normal levels, particularly since SR knockout mice sometimes show compensatory effects on expression of other proteins (Mol Ther 2013, 21:767, PMID: 23358188).</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined above, we performed new experiments to address these reviewer concerns. We found that WT and MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice have a similar number of F4/80<sup>+</sup> KCs in the liver and that KCs are efficiently depleted by CLL, which requires functional phagocytic processes, in both strains of mice. These new data are displayed in new Figure 3H and 3I.</p><p>As the reviewers highlight, in some cases the lack of one SR is not sufficient to observe an effect due to functional compensation by other SRs. For example, in the study cited by the reviewers, in contrast to poly(I) treatment, genetic deletion of SR-A1 did not enhance transduction of hepatocytes with adenovirus. Instead, the authors found that adenovirus also interacted with SREC-I, and that SREC-I expression was increased in the liver of SR-A1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Thus, antibody-mediated blockade of both SR-A1 and SREC-I mimicked the effects of treatment with poly(I) on adenovirus transduction. However, in our studies, the level of CHIKV in the circulation (i.e., the inhibitory effect on CHIKV clearance) is similar in WT mice treated with poly(I) or CLL and MARCO<sup>-/-</sup> mice (Figure 3). Thus, our data suggest that other SRs are unable to compensate for the genetic absence of MARCO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Title: In its current form, the title suggests MARCO directly interacts with lysines in E2, which is premature until the Essential Revision #1 is addressed.
