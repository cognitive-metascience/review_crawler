Each strand was made of bases—represented by the letters ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’ and ‘T’—and the two strands were held together by bonds between pairs of bases, one from each strand. Moreover, ‘A’ always paired with ‘T’, and ‘C’ always paired with ‘G’. Therefore, if the two strands were separated, each could be used as a template to guide the synthesis of a new complementary strand and thus create two copies of the original double-stranded molecule. One of the first steps in this replication process involves a ring-shaped complex of six proteins, called an MCM helicase, separating the two strands.</p><p>To prepare for DNA replication, two MCM helicase rings wrap around the double-stranded DNA. Then, after the helicase has been activated, the bonds between the DNA base pairs break, and the two rings separate with one ring encircling each DNA strand. However, the details of the interactions between the helicase and the DNA during these events are not fully understood.</p><p>Now Froelich, Kang et al. have solved the three-dimensional structure of an MCM helicase ring—taken from a microbe originally found at deep ocean vents—on its own and also when bound to a short piece of single-stranded DNA. The helicase ring becomes more oval when the DNA binds to it. Moreover, rather than passing straight through the ring, the DNA wraps part of the way around the inside of the ring.</p><p>Specific amino acids—the building blocks of proteins—on the inside of the ring interact with the single-stranded DNA, and these amino acids are also found in MCM proteins in many other organisms. Furthermore, swapping these amino acids for different amino acids significantly reduced the ability of the ring to bind to single-stranded DNA, but its ability to bind to double-stranded DNA was only slightly affected. Engineering similar changes into the ring complexes of yeast cells was lethal, and the mutant complexes were less able to be loaded onto the DNA, or to be activated and separate the two strands ready for replication.</p><p>These insights into how helicases are loaded onto double-stranded DNA, and select one DNA strand to encircle, have improved our understanding of how DNA replication is initiated: a process that is vital for living things.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01993.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01993.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>crystallography</kwd><kwd>genetic</kwd><kwd>archaea</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enemark</surname><given-names>Eric J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM098771</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enemark</surname><given-names>Eric J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Center Support Grant, National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5 P30 CA021765-32</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enemark</surname><given-names>Eric J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM52339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The crystal structure of the MCM helicase bound to single-stranded DNA reveals a binding motif that is critical for cell viability, helicase activation and DNA replication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mcm proteins were first identified in yeast when mutations in their genes were defective for minichromosome maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maiorano et al., 2006</xref>). In eukaryotic cells, six related Mcm proteins (Mcm2-7) form a ring-shaped heterohexamer, the Mcm2-7 complex. Hexameric MCM rings act as the replicative DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bochman and Schwacha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>), encircling the leading strand DNA template at the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu et al., 2011</xref>). Replication forks are established in a cell-cycle-regulated manner at specific regions of DNA called replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bell and Dutta, 2002</xref>). Mcm2-7 complexes are loaded onto double-stranded DNA at each replication origin by the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Remus and Diffley, 2009</xref>). Because replication origins are located far from the DNA ends, loading of Mcm2-7 hexamers such that they encircle double-stranded DNA requires opening of the Mcm2-7 ring. A ‘gate’ between the Mcm2 and Mcm5 subunits has been identified and is the likely site of ring opening and closing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bochman and Schwacha, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costa et al., 2011</xref>). After helicase loading, the two Mcm2-7 complexes encircle double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as a head-to-head double hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Remus et al., 2009</xref>) that is inactive as a helicase.</p><p>Helicase activation requires substantial remodeling of the initially loaded Mcm2-7 double hexamer. The Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) drive recruitment of two Mcm2-7 activating proteins, Cdc45 and the tetrameric GINS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labib, 2010</xref>). These proteins together stimulate the Mcm2-7 ATPase and helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>) and with Mcm2-7 form the active replicative DNA helicase, the CMG complex (Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bochman and Schwacha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>). The initially loaded double-hexamer has the capacity to passively slide over dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Remus et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting MCM DNA interactions are not fixed at this stage. Upon activation, the two Mcm2-7 helicases translocate independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yardimci et al., 2010</xref>) in a 3′→5′ direction on the single-stranded leading strand DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu et al., 2011</xref>). This transformation necessitates two structural changes in the initially loaded double-hexamer that are poorly understood: (i) the double-hexamer interface must be broken to allow independent replisome movement; (ii) the dsDNA at the origin must be melted and the lagging strand DNA template excluded from the central channel of each MCM hexamer. How Mcm2-7 retains one strand in its central channel while excluding the other during this transition is unknown.</p><p>Each Mcm subunit contains three domains. The N-terminal domain (MCM<sub>N</sub>) possesses an OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding)-fold and usually a zinc-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fletcher et al., 2003</xref>). This domain mediates the head-to-head interaction of the two hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez-Llorente et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). The second domain contains a conserved ATPase AAA+ fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neuwald et al., 1999</xref>), which binds and hydrolyzes ATP at subunit interfaces around the hexameric ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwacha and Bell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davey et al., 2003</xref>) and is required for DNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bochman and Schwacha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>). A short domain at the C-terminus includes a helix-turn-helix fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aravind and Koonin, 1999</xref>), one of which (Mcm6) interacts with Cdt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wei et al., 2010</xref>). MCM hexamers demonstrate a two-tiered ring architecture in electron microscopy studies with an N-terminal domain tier and an ATPase domain tier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pape et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez-Llorente et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Costa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bochman and Schwacha, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Remus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costa et al., 2011</xref>). The MCM complexes of several archaeal organisms consist of six identical subunits and have provided powerful models to investigate the atomic details of MCM structure. Crystal structures have identified a consistent hexameric arrangement for MCM<sub>N</sub> of <italic>Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus</italic> (<italic>Mt</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fletcher et al., 2003</xref>) and <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (<italic>Sso</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2008</xref>) that correspond to the smaller tier observed by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Remus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costa et al., 2011</xref>). Although no atomic structure has been determined for the complete archaeal or eukaryotic Mcm hexamer, hypothetical atomic models for full-length archaeal MCM hexamers have been generated by superimposition of six copies of a monomeric crystal structure of nearly full-length MCM onto the hexameric structure of <italic>Mt</italic>MCM<sub>N</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brewster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bae et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Despite a growing understanding of the overall structure of the MCM complex, its multiple interactions with DNA during helicase loading, activation and elongation remain mysterious. Atomic structures of MCM bound to DNA have not been reported. Given the different forms of DNA that are bound to the MCM complex during the steps of the initiation pathway, the MCM proteins must transition between different DNA interactions during this process. To investigate the interactions after origin melting and how the MCM hexamer selectively encircles the leading strand template, we determined the crystal structure of the MCM<sub>N</sub> hexamer of <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> bound to ssDNA. We present an analysis of this the structure and biochemical and genetic characterizations of archaeal and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins with mutations in the identified ssDNA binding region. These findings reveal two residues on the surface of the MCM OB-fold that are critical for MCM DNA-binding and contribute to multiple Mcm2-7 functions during replication initiation. Our findings support a model in which the identified MCM-ssDNA interactions contribute to the selection of the leading strand DNA template during helicase activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To elucidate how MCM interacts with ssDNA, we determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of the <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> MCM (<italic>Pf</italic>MCM<sub>N</sub>) protein in complex with homopolymeric (dT)<sub>30</sub> ssDNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01993.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Data collection and refinement statistics</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01993.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01993.003</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th><italic>Pf</italic>MCM<sub>N</sub>:dT<sub>30</sub></th><th><italic>Pf</italic>MCM<sub>N</sub> (no DNA)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Data collection</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Space group</td><td>P2<sub>1</sub></td><td>P2<sub>1</sub></td></tr><tr><td> Cell dimensions</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, <italic>c</italic> (Å)</td><td>94.276, 113.397, 196.854</td><td>122.849, 103.064, 122.435</td></tr><tr><td> α, β, γ (°)</td><td>90, 101.354, 90</td><td>90, 119.85, 90</td></tr><tr><td> Resolution (Å)</td><td>50-3.20 (3.31–3.20)</td><td>50-2.65 (2.74–2.65)</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>R</italic><sub>sym</sub></td><td>0.109 (0.786)</td><td>0.100 (0.569)</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>I</italic>/σ<italic>I</italic></td><td>13.4 (1.64)</td><td>16.3 (2.26)</td></tr><tr><td> Completeness (%)</td><td>100 (100)</td><td>98.8 (98.2)</td></tr><tr><td> Redundancy</td><td>4.1 (4.1)</td><td>3.7 (3.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Refinement</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Resolution (Å)</td><td>50-3.20 (3.29–3.20)</td><td>50-2.65 (2.72–2.65)</td></tr><tr><td> No. reflections</td><td>63497/3376 (4453/218)</td><td>72376/3839 (5183/285)</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>R</italic><sub>work</sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub></td><td>0.257/0.294 (0.372/0.373)</td><td>0.259/0.270 (0.484/0.502)</td></tr><tr><td> No. atoms</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Protein</td><td>24359</td><td>12258</td></tr><tr><td> DNA</td><td>584</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td> Zn<sup>2+</sup></td><td>12</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td> Water</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>B</italic>-factors</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Protein</td><td>129</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td> DNA</td><td>179</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td> Zn<sup>2+</sup></td><td>204</td><td>145</td></tr><tr><td> Water</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td> R.m.s. deviations</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Bond lengths (Å)</td><td>0.008</td><td>0.011</td></tr><tr><td> Bond angles (°)</td><td>1.164</td><td>1.361</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><sec id="s2-1"><title>MCM-ssDNA molecular architecture</title><p>The asymmetric unit of the crystal of <italic>Pf</italic>MCM<sub>N</sub>:ssDNA contains two independent hexamers, each bound to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1,2</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

The ssDNA circles the interior of the <italic>Pf</italic>MCM<sub>N</sub> ring in a plane perpendicular to the central channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is in contrast to the ssDNA passing through the central channel, as observed in the structures of the nucleic acid complexes of the motor domains of the hexameric helicases E1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</xref>), Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</xref>), and DnaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>). This distinction suggests that the newly identified MCM-ssDNA interactions might serve a function distinct from motor-driven helicase and translocase activities. The ssDNA binds to the MCM<sub>N</sub> OB-fold subdomain C at a region consistent with that of the prototype OB-fold protein SSB, but the ssDNA is oriented approximately perpendicular to that seen in SSB-ssDNA structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raghunathan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2009</xref>). The ssDNA does not progress towards a specific end of the channel; therefore, the ssDNA does not have an assignable entry or exit direction from the ring. Instead, the ssDNA has a defined polarity relative to the MCM ring. When viewed from the C-terminal side of the complex (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the 5′ to 3′ direction of the bound ssDNA proceeds clockwise around the channel. This polarity is observed for both ssDNAs in each hexamer of the asymmetric unit.</p><p>The structure reveals that the individual MCM subunits do not all simultaneously participate in ssDNA binding. In each hexamer, the bound nucleotides are not continuous but are separated into two stretches. Overall, two 7-mer stretches are observed in hexamer 1, and 11-mer and 4-mer stretches are observed in hexamer 2. The subunits that interact with DNA use a consistent binding mode with four nucleotides per subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The fourth nucleotide from the 5′-end of this binding mode is visible in the cases where it spans binding at adjacent subunits, but it is often disordered at the 3′-end of a ssDNA stretch. The four nucleotide per subunit binding increment contrasts with the motor domains of other hexameric helicases that bind either one (E1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</xref>; Rho, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</xref>) or two (DnaB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>) nucleotides per subunit and indicates that 24 nucleotides can bind if all the subunits simultaneously engage the ssDNA. The absence of ssDNA binding at some subunits is not due to insufficient DNA length because a 30-mer oligonucleotide was used for crystallization. The discontinuous DNA could result from the hexamer binding two separate 30-mer strands simultaneously or from the hexamer tightly binding one 30-mer ssDNA strand at two regions with the intervening nucleotides binding either weakly or not at all. We consider the latter to be more likely because binding of two parts of the same strand is anticipated to be cooperative.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01993.013</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Stereoviews of the protein-DNA interaction details for two subunit interfaces.</title><p>The binding predominantly involves residues on the face of the OB-fold of one subunit, yellow, including an interaction between a thymidine base and main-chain atoms of the β-strand.

We refer to this conserved region as the MCM Single-Stranded DNA Binding motif (MSSB).

The arginine residues R124 and R186 make the most significant ssDNA interactions in the structure. R124A and R186A mutants each show a significant decrease in ssDNA binding (7- and 6-fold reduction, respectively).

Because the Mcm4, 6 and 7 subunits are adjacent to one another in the Mcm2-7 complex, each pairwise combination would be expected to interrupt at least three possible subunit pairs for binding (e.g., the Mcm4/6 double mutant would interfere with Mcm2/6, Mcm6/4 and Mcm4/7 subunit pairs for ssDNA binding).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01993.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Mutation of two MSSB motifs is lethal and causes helicase loading defects.

We also purified the Mcm4/6/7 triple mutant (Mcm4D/6D/7D) with associated Cdt1. After purification, all of the mutant complexes showed similar subunit composition and migration in gel filtration columns as wild-type Mcm2-7/Cdt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, these mutations do not inhibit the initial assembly of the Mcm2-7/Cdt1 complex.</p><p>We tested each of the mutant complexes for their ability to be loaded onto origin DNA using a reconstituted helicase-loading assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Remus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To ensure that all of the Mcm2-7 hexamers retained on the DNA were loaded, we washed the final DNA-associated proteins with high salt. This treatment removes all of the helicase loading proteins (ORC, Cdc6 and Cdt1) from the DNA but leaves loaded Mcm2-7 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Randell et al., 2006</xref>). Wild-type protein showed robust, Cdc6-dependent loading onto origin DNA. In contrast, each of the double mutant Mcm2-7 complexes showed reduced Mcm2-7 loading. The Mcm4D/6D and Mcm6D/7D complexes showed only modest defects (less than ∼ two-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The Mcm4D/7D complex showed a stronger defect (∼10-fold), and the Mcm4/6/7 triple mutant showed the most severe defect in helicase loading (∼20-fold reduction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To establish at what step in the helicase loading process these defects occurred, we studied the initial recruitment of the complexes to origin DNA. To this end, we replaced ATP with the poorly hydrolyzable ATP-γS in the assay. In the presence of ATPγS, all of the proteins required for helicase loading are recruited to the origin, but no loading occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Randell et al., 2006</xref>). Under these conditions, we observed a similar pattern of Mcm2-7/Cdt1 and ORC association for wild-type and the mutant Mcm2-7 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, middle panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, mutating two or three MSSB motifs did not alter the initial recruitment of the Mcm2-7/Cdt1 complex to the origin DNA. We also examined the DNA-associated proteins when ATP-containing reactions were washed with low-salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), a condition that retains helicase-loading proteins on DNA. Under these conditions, the mutant complexes showed a similar pattern of reduced Mcm2-7 DNA association as seen for the high-salt wash experiments. Cdt1 was not retained on the DNA under these conditions for mutant Mcm2-7 complexes, indicating that the MSSB mutations did not interfere with the release of Cdt1 from the Mcm2-7 complex during loading. Together, these data indicate that the loading defect for these Mcm2-7 mutants occurs after their initial recruitment to origin DNA but before the establishment of the ORC-independent association of Mcm2-7 with origin DNA.</p><p>We looked for additional replication initiation defects for the Mcm2-7 mutants that showed detectable loading using a modified in vitro replication assay that recapitulates origin-dependent DNA replication initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heller et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to our original studies, helicase loading in these assays was performed using purified proteins. In addition to measuring new DNA synthesis, we monitored association of Mcm2-7, the helicase activation proteins Cdc45 and GINS and the ssDNA binding protein, RPA, with the origin DNA during the reaction. The analysis of protein associations provided insights into the step during replication initiation during which the mutant Mcm2-7 complexes fail. Consistent with their inability to support cell growth, none of the mutant complexes supported significant DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Analysis of FLAG-Mcm3 DNA association showed that, as in the loading assays, the Mcm4D/6D and Mcm6D/7D complexes are retained on the DNA more strongly than the Mcm4D/7D complex. Cdc45 association mirrored the level of FLAG-Mcm3 association with the DNA, suggesting Cdc45 recruitment is independent of the MSSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, all of the Mcm2-7 double mutants showed similarly strong defects (≥10-fold) in both GINS and RPA DNA association. In the case of Mcm4D/7D mutant, the DNA replication, GINS and RPA DNA association defects are consistent with its helicase-loading defect. In contrast, for Mcm4D/6D and Mcm6D/7D, the extent of helicase loading and Cdc45 DNA association is distinct from the much larger losses in GINS and RPA DNA association and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data strongly suggest that an inability to recruit or maintain GINS and/or RPA is responsible for the replication defects exhibited by these mutants. Because RPA DNA binding is a readout for ssDNA formation and GINS is required to activate the Mcm2-7 helicase, both of these defects indicate that the Mcm4/6 and Mcm6/7 MSSB mutants are defective for helicase activation.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01993.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The Mcm2-7 MSSB double mutants are severely defective for in vitro DNA replication.</title><p>Proteins associated with the DNA template during DNA replication were analyzed by immunoblotting (top panels) and radiolabeled DNA replication products were analyzed by alkaline agarose electrophoresis (bottom panel).

These residues are important for binding ssDNA and, to a lesser extent, dsDNA. A DNA-binding role for positively charged residues in this region is consistent with previous mutational analysis of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM showing that K129A (equivalent to <italic>Pf</italic>MCM R124) displays very little binding to ssDNA, blunt duplex DNA, and bubble-DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pucci et al., 2004</xref>). Although a positive residue equivalent to <italic>Pf</italic>MCM R186 is not conserved in <italic>Sso</italic>MCM, mutation of an adjacent residue, K194A also displays very little binding to these DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pucci et al., 2004</xref>). As previously noted in overall sequence comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pucci et al., 2004</xref>), residues in the MSSB motif are conserved in specific families in eukaryotic Mcm2-7. Importantly, we show that conserved residues within this motif are critical for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cell division and multiple Mcm2-7 functions during replication initiation.</p><p>Biochemical analysis of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mutant complexes reveals multiple defects during replication initiation. Two mutant complexes (Mcm4D/7D and Mcm4D/6D/7D) show strong defects in Mcm2-7 loading. This is unexpected because Mcm2-7 proteins are loaded around dsDNA and there is no evidence for ssDNA at this stage of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that one or more MSSB motifs interact with dsDNA prior to ssDNA formation at the origin and that these interactions stabilize loaded Mcm2-7. This would be consistent with the dsDNA binding defects observed for the <italic>Pf</italic>MCM<sub>N</sub> R124A/R186A double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and also the (R124-equivalent) K129A mutant of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM. Alternatively, elimination of positive charges in the central channel could alter the opening and closing of the Mcm2-7 ring. The abundance of positive charges in the Mcm2-7 ring could predispose the ring to remain open prior to DNA binding. Encircling dsDNA could neutralize the repulsion and favor ring closing. It is possible that a reduction in positive charge in the mutant complexes leads to the Mcm2-7 ring spending more time in the closed state, inhibiting entry of the dsDNA during loading. Analogously, the reduced positive charge of the MSSB mutants could destabilize ring closure around dsDNA during loading. Consistent with this model, the Mcm2-7 complex appears as a cracked-ring in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costa et al., 2011</xref>). As we observe, both scenarios predict that the strongest loading defects would be observed for the Mcm4D/6D/7D mutant that eliminates the greatest number of positive charges. Among the double mutants, the strongest loading defect is observed when the Mcm4 and Mcm7 subunits are mutated, which are across from the Mcm2/5 gate and could influence opening and closing more than other subunits.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the MCM-ssDNA interactions that we have identified have a role during dsDNA melting. First, the MCM-ssDNA interactions identified in our structure predominantly involve the sugars and bases of the ssDNA, ideally suited to bind and shield one strand from its complement during melting. Also consistent with a role in dsDNA melting, the Mcm2-7 MSSB mutant complexes showed strong defects in events linked to helicase activation. The MSSB mutations did not alter Cdc45 recruitment, consistent with the observation that this event can occur in G1 phase prior to ssDNA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aparicio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the levels of GINS and RPA DNA association by each of the MSSB mutant complexes were strongly defective. The defect in RPA DNA binding is almost certainly due to reduced ssDNA generation by the mutant complexes. The reduction in DNA-associated GINS could be the result of a defect in recruitment or retention of GINS. Unlike Cdc45, GINS recruitment does not occur until entry into S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanemaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takayama et al., 2003</xref>) and, therefore, could require ssDNA formation. Alternatively, it is possible that the defect in ssDNA binding prevents the CMG complex from attaining a particular DNA binding state and this destabilizes GINS binding.</p><p>Interactions between the MSSB and ssDNA could also occur during elongation. Consistent with a role for the MSSB in unwinding, the <italic>Sso</italic>MCM K129A mutant (<italic>Pf</italic>MCM R124 equivalent) is defective for helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pucci et al., 2004</xref>). Although the MCM ATPase domain alone is sufficient to produce unwinding activity in <italic>Sso</italic>MCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pucci et al., 2007</xref>) and in <italic>Aeropyrum pernix</italic> MCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atanassova and Grainge, 2008</xref>), unwinding displays greater processivity in the presence of the N-terminal domain for <italic>Sso</italic>MCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barry et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, although the N-terminal domain and the residues of the MSSB are not intrinsically required to produce an unwinding activity, the N-terminal domain can regulate and enhance MCM unwinding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barry et al., 2007</xref>). The positively charged residues of the MSSB could help maintain a closed MCM ring as described above for loading, and thus contribute to the enhanced processivity afforded by the N-terminal domain. It is also possible that ssDNA binding by the MSSB has a more direct impact on DNA unwinding. For example, the directional ssDNA:MSSB interactions observed here could influence the polarity of unwinding either during initiation (see below) or elongation. To permit the ssDNA:MCM<sub>N</sub> interactions that we observe, the ssDNA would need to alter its trajectory as it passes through the MCM central channel. Alternatively, the MSSB could bind ssDNA differently during unwinding. An interesting possibility is that during elongation the MCM OB-fold binds ssDNA similar to the OB-fold prototype SSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raghunathan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2009</xref>). This mode of binding would place the ssDNA approximately parallel to the central channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), a position consistent with the expected ssDNA trajectory during unwinding. Different modes of interaction between the MSSB and ssDNA could be modulated by the AAA+ domain of MCM and a conserved ‘allosteric communication loop’ (ACL, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sakakibara et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barry et al., 2009</xref>) that projects from the N-terminal domain towards the anticipated position of the ATPase domain. The ACL directly follows the β-strand that contains the second positively charged MSSB residue (<italic>Pf</italic>MCM residue R186) and thus could couple the MSSB to the ATPase domains.</p><p>The polarity of ssDNA bound to MCM<sub>N</sub> observed in our structure has important implications for the transition between MCM dsDNA and ssDNA binding. In the view shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, the AAA+ motors are located above the MCM<sub>N</sub> domain, and the corresponding Mcm2-7 subunits occur clockwise in the order Mcm5, 3, 7, 4, 6, 2. Given that the Mcm2-7 complex is initially loaded around dsDNA, only one of the two strands of dsDNA can easily attain the 5′→3′ coplanar clockwise configuration observed in our structure: the DNA strand that passes from the C- to N-terminus of the MCM complex in a 5′→3′ direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Intriguingly, this strand corresponds to the leading strand DNA template that is encircled by the MCM complex during translocation/DNA unwinding. For the opposite strand to interact with the MCM<sub>N</sub> with the observed polarity, it would either need to pass through the other strand or dramatically re-orient. Thus, if ssDNA is formed within the MCM ring during origin melting (see below), our structure predicts that MCM<sub>N</sub> would preferentially bind to the translocating strand (i.e., the leading strand DNA template). Consistent with this model, the 3′→5′ helicase polarity of <italic>Sso</italic>MCM is only observed when the N-terminal domain is present, implicating this domain in substrate selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barry et al., 2007</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01993.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for MSSB-dependent selection of the translocating DNA strand during helicase activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The defined polarity of ssDNA binding by the MCM<sub>N</sub> would preferentially bind the leading-strand DNA template. The Mcm2-7 complex N-terminus is shown from the C-terminal side of the complex. This is the side where DNA is expected to enter during translocation. Duplex DNA is first encircled by the ring (left). Only the red strand can readily attain the 5′→3′ clockwise polarity observed in the crystal structure. This strand passes through the ring 5′→3′ from the C- to the N-terminal side and thus is the correct polarity to serve as the translocating strand. We propose the grey, lagging strand DNA template will exit through the Mcm2/5 gate, possibly as a result of accumulation of ssDNA in the central channel (right).

The dsDNA is first encircled by the MCM double hexamer (left panel). The dsDNA is driven toward the double hexamer interface by the dsDNA translocase activity of the AAA+ ATPase domains (not shown), which would be located above the light green surface and below the dark green surface. The dsDNA translocation creates strand separation where volume is available, enabling the MSSB to preferentially bind the strand with 5′→3′ clockwise polarity when viewed from the ATPase domain (middle panel). Importantly, the MSSB-bound strand corresponds to the strand upon which the MCM helicase will translocate during unwinding (right panel, magenta at top, cyan at bottom).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01993.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01993.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01993-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>The MCM helicase is conceptually similar to the Rho hexameric helicase because both possess an N-terminal OB-fold linked to a C-terminal ATPase. This analogy further supports a role for the MCM OB-fold during helicase activation prior to unwinding. The crystal structure of Rho with RNA bound at the OB-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skordalakes and Berger, 2003</xref>) suggests that 70–80 nucleotides of RNA would adopt a circular path around the ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skordalakes and Berger, 2003</xref>) that is roughly perpendicular to the hexameric channel. This arrangement is conceptually similar to our <italic>Pf</italic>MCM<sub>N</sub>:ssDNA structure. The Rho OB-fold is believed to bind RNA and facilitate encircling of single-stranded RNA during ring closure by the ATPase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skordalakes and Berger, 2003</xref>), a prerequisite for establishing an activated helicase. Subsequently, the proposed unwinding mechanism for Rho exclusively involves distinct interactions between the ATPase motor domain and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</xref>). The MCM N-terminal domain may also function to enable the ATPase domains to select and encircle one strand of DNA during ring closure. A key difference between MCM and Rho is that the Rho helicase ring is loaded on a species that is already single-stranded, whereas the MCM hexamer is first loaded onto double-stranded DNA that must somehow be converted to single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Remus et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Combining the features of eukaryotic MCMs with our new structural information, we suggest the following model for MSSB function during helicase activation. After helicase loading, we propose that DNA melting is initiated by activating the ATPase domains of the double-hexamer to pump dsDNA from the C-terminal lobe side towards the double-hexamer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). This is consistent with the known direction of MCM DNA translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGeoch et al., 2005</xref>) as well as observations that Mcm complexes can translocate on dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaplan et al., 2003</xref>). As additional nucleotides of DNA are forced to occupy the same distance along the DNA helical axis, a B-form structure can no longer be maintained. We predict that the DNA strands would be forced apart at the site where the diameter of the MCM central channel is largest. Intriguingly, the MSSB is on the surface of the largest diameter of the MCM<sub>N</sub> central channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), putting the MSSB in a prime position to bind the leading strand ssDNA upon DNA melting. The channel diameter elsewhere in the MCM<sub>N</sub> is too narrow to permit B-form DNA strands to separate. Such melting activity requires that the two hexamers are anchored to one another because the two hexamers would otherwise simply translocate away from one another without melting the DNA. Further dsDNA pumping after the volume around the MSSB has been filled would require the MCM ring to open and allow the unbound lagging strand DNA template to exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The presumed exit site would be through the Mcm2/5 gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bochman and Schwacha, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costa et al., 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, Mcm2 and Mcm5 are the only two subunits that lack a conserved positive residue at the <italic>Pf</italic>MCM R124 position, reducing ssDNA affinity and potentially facilitating strand exit. Following strand exit and extrusion of additional lengths of ssDNA, ring closure would poise each isolated hexamer to unwind DNA using a strand exclusion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu et al., 2011</xref>). The event that would drive double hexamer separation is unclear but could be facilitated by the change from encircling dsDNA to ssDNA, binding of additional factors (e.g., Mcm10) or modification of the helicase. A definitive test for this model awaits the development of assays that directly monitor the events of origin DNA melting and strand exclusion. Nevertheless, our studies provide structural and biochemical evidence that the MSSB is a critical ssDNA binding domain that functions during helicase loading and activation and provide initial insights into how ssDNA binding by MCM complex could facilitate selection of one strand during helicase activation.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-01993-media2.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01993.024</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Animation of a model for MCM to select the translocating strand during origin melting.</title><p>Symmetric surfaces in different shades of green represent the two MCM<sub>N</sub> portions of a double hexamer. The dsDNA is first encircled by the MCM double hexamer. The dsDNA is driven toward the double hexamer interface by the dsDNA translocase activity of the AAA+ ATPase domains (not shown), which would be located above the light green surface and below the dark green surface. The dsDNA translocation creates strand separation where volume is available, enabling the MSSB to preferentially bind the strand with 5′→3′ clockwise polarity when viewed from the ATPase domain. Importantly, the MSSB-bound strand corresponds to the strand upon which the MCM helicase will translocate (magenta at top, cyan at bottom), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, right panel.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01993.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01993.024</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, mutagenesis, expression, and purification</title><p>An N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-<italic>Pf</italic>MCM<sub>1-256</sub> expression construct was prepared.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Michael Botchan, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, James Berger, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The data and discussion presented in this manuscript are important contributions to our present knowledge as to how chromosomal duplex DNA is unwound by the Mcm helicases. Furthermore the crystal structure from the Archeal Mcm from <italic>Pf</italic> MCM combined with the in vivo and biochemical studies from the eukaryote <italic>Sc</italic> MCM's allow for exciting speculation as to how the earliest steps in initiation might occur. The work allows for a plausible model for the mechanism of how the leading strand might be selected in the duplex DNA concomitant with the melting and extrusion of the lagging strand from the central channel. It should be accepted for publication by <italic>eLife</italic> with minor revisions. A few significant points are listed below.</p><p>1) The double hexamer loading reactions with the purified <italic>Sc</italic> proteins show that the amino terminal OB fold DNA-binding residues revealed by the x-ray structure do in fact play a role in the establishment of the PreRC in the eukaryote. It seems possible that the triple mutations (in subunits 4, 6 &amp; 7) would be even more defective in that step than the double mutants. While we don't ask the authors to test this, perhaps a more balanced view would be that the amino terminal domain is important at all stages of the replication pathway as the DH transforms from an inactive structure to an active trans-locating structure. Rather than more important at one stage than another. This would be consistent with prior studies on Archeal Mcm's and the present study. It is hard to access how a fold drop in an in vitro reaction might translate to an in vivo complementation test. The OB fold DNA contacts may be key to the proper closure of the ring after first recruitment. Then again in the strand exclusion step that occurs simultaneously with tight GINS binding as the data here also show.</p><p>2) The discussion should also include the possibility that in full intact hexamers and double hexamers contacts in the MCM<sub>N</sub> domain might be a bit different at each stage. This leads to another question. Will duplex or single strand binding activities for the intact hexamer of the <italic>Pf</italic> Mcm's involve the same or additional contacts through the N-terminus in conditions when non hydrolyzable ATP is in the buffer? While we are not suggesting that the surprising path of the leading stand in the amino-terminal domain of the Mcm's would change in the intact protein subtle switches might add additional complexity to the binding mode(s). This should be discussed or additional data presented.</p><p>3) A final point that needs to be addressed in a revised manuscript: the authors postulate that the MSSB binding mode might be specific to helicase loading and origin activation, while not necessarily involved in the elongation step of DNA replication (MCM motor translocation). To substantiate this statement they point out that the isolated AAA+ domain from archaeal MCMs is an active helicase, while the N-terminal domain is not strictly required for DNA unwinding. The authors should consider and cite the work from Stephen D. Bell's laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barry et al. 2007</xref>, NAR, which they cite only in part), indicating that the isolated MCM AAA+ domain can indeed function as a helicase, but it contains a promiscuous activity, being able to unwind blunt duplex DNA as well as a primer-template junction containing either a 3' or a 5' tail. Addition of the MCM NTD in trans restores the 3'-&gt;5' polarity of DNA translocation for the MCM motor, as observed with the full-length enzyme. While S.D. Bell's biochemical experiments agree with the present study in indicating that the N-terminal domain has an important role in strand selection, they also show that strand selection is key to productive DNA unwinding. As a corollary, we believe that a possible role for the MSSB site during fork unwinding should be suggested with greater strength.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01993.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The double hexamer loading reactions with the purified</italic> Sc <italic>proteins show that the amino terminal OB fold DNA-binding residues revealed by the x-ray structure do in fact play a role in the establishment of the PreRC in the eukaryote.

This mutant is indeed more defective in loading than any of the double mutants. We have added the triple mutant loading experiments to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5, figure supplement 2</xref> and discuss these in the helicase loading sections of the Results and Discussion. This mutant supports the idea that there is a role of the MSSB in either loading or retention of the Mcm2-7 complex on the DNA during initiation of replication. In performing these experiments we repeated the analysis of the double mutants, and we have added quantitation of these data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5, figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>The discussion is more neutral in differentiating the relative importance of the MSSB for loading, activation, and potentially during elongation. The Discussion has been reorganized to describe these three possibilities in three sequential paragraphs that follow the initial Discussion paragraph.</p><p>We have removed the first sentence from the last paragraph of the Results section on in vitro reaction expectation from complementation experiments (“Because the extent of helicase loading defects did not account for the lethal phenotypes of the mutations, we looked for additional defects in replication initiation”). We agree with the reviewers that we cannot be sure how in vitro data will correlate with in vivo phenotypes.</p><p><italic>2) The discussion should also include the possibility that in full intact hexamers and double hexamers contacts in the MCM</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> <italic>domain might be a bit different at each stage.

This should be discussed or additional data presented</italic>.</p><p>Our structure indicates that subtle changes to the subunit:subunit configuration at the N-terminal domain strongly impact the ability of the MSSB to interact with ssDNA. A coupling of these subtle changes to the ATPase domains would provide a straightforward and attractive means for MCM to switch affinity or preference for different forms of DNA based upon ATP-binding, or even to repetitively change binding via the ATPase cycle.</p><p>We have added in the discussion on a possible role for the MSSB during unwinding that the ATPase domain could readily modulate the subunit:subunit configuration and thus change the behavior of MSSB:DNA binding, perhaps through a conserved “allosteric communication loop”, ACL, and we have added references for the ACL. While we envision that the presence of ATP at an associated ATPase domain could readily influence binding by the MSSB, we don’t have a basis to predict whether ATP binding would tend to increase or decrease binding to ssDNA by the MSSB. We have also added to this paragraph that the MSSB might bind ssDNA differently during unwinding, possibly binding in a mode more like the OB-fold protein SSB such that the ssDNA runs more parallel to the channel during that stage.</p><p><italic>3) A final point that needs to be addressed in a revised manuscript: the authors postulate that the MSSB binding mode might be specific to helicase loading and origin activation, while not necessarily involved in the elongation step of DNA replication (MCM motor translocation).

The paragraph also suggests the possibility that during unwinding, the MSSB:DNA interactions could change to a configuration that resembles that of the OB-fold SSB, which would orient the ssDNA along the central channel rather than perpendicular to it. The previously observed specificity of polarity derived from the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barry et al. 2007</xref>) has been added at the conclusion of the subsequent paragraph about strand selection during the transition from binding dsDNA to ssDNA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
