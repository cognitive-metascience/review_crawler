How this membrane skeleton is developed and why it preferentially forms in axons are unknown. Here, we studied the developmental mechanism of this lattice structure. We found that this structure emerged early during axon development and propagated from proximal regions to distal ends of axons. Components of the axon initial segment were recruited to the lattice late during development. Formation of the lattice was regulated by the local concentration of βII spectrin, which is higher in axons than in dendrites. Increasing the dendritic concentration of βII spectrin by overexpression or by knocking out ankyrin B induced the formation of the periodic structure in dendrites, demonstrating that the spectrin concentration is a key determinant in the preferential development of this structure in axons and that ankyrin B is critical for the polarized distribution of βII spectrin in neurites.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04581.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04581.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04581.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain contains hundred types of neurons, but they are all variations on the same basic structure. Each neuron consists of a cell body that is covered in short protrusions called dendrites and a long thin structure called the axon. The dendrites receive incoming signals from neighboring neurons and they transmit these signals via the cell body to the axon, which in turn relays them to the dendrites of the next neuron (or neurons).</p><p>Like all cells, neurons maintain their structure with the help of an internal cytoskeleton made up of many different proteins. However, it was discovered recently that axons have an additional lattice-like structure underneath their outer membrane. This structure, which consists of rings of actin filaments separated by molecules of a protein called spectrin, is preferentially formed in axons and is found much less frequently in dendrites.</p><p>Now Zhong, He et al., who are members of the research group that discovered the axonal skeleton, have used ‘super-resolution imaging’ to figure out how this skeleton forms and why it predominantly forms in axons. In brief, a basic version of the sub-membrane periodic skeleton is laid down early in development, starting next to the cell body before gradually spreading down the axon. The skeleton then continues to mature throughout development with the incorporation of several additional types of proteins.</p><p>The periodic skeleton only forms in regions which contain enough βII spectrin. Under normal conditions, dendrites contain too little βII spectrin to support the growth of such a periodic skeleton. However, artificially increasing the amount of βII spectrin present by overexpressing the corresponding gene, or by knocking out ankyrin B (a molecule that is important for establishing the preferential distribution of βII spectrin in axons), is sufficient to trigger periodic skeleton formation in dendrites. Given that axons and dendrites have distinct roles in neuronal signaling, this uneven distribution of spectrin is likely to be one way in which these regions maintain the specific structures that support their individual functions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04581.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04581.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>spectrin</kwd><kwd>ankyrin</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>super-resolution</kwd><kwd>STORM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Lorenzo</surname><given-names>Damaris</given-names></name><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>Vann</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhuang</surname><given-names>Xiaowei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Guisheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Ruobo</given-names></name><name><surname>Babcock</surname><given-names>Hazen P</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhuang</surname><given-names>Xiaowei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Super-resolution imaging reveals how the skeleton that supports the outer membrane of axons is assembled during development, and provides an explanation for why this structure preferentially forms in axons but rarely in dendrites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons are highly polarized cells with their somatodendritic regions receiving synaptic inputs and axons propagating electrical signals and sending synaptic outputs to target cells. Cytoskeletal proteins are important for maintaining the polarity of neurons. For example, actin and microtubules are essential for the growth and stabilization of axons, the trafficking of cargos to specific neurites, and the stabilization and plasticity of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dent and Gertler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cingolani and Goda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stiess and Bradke, 2011</xref>). Transient destabilization of actin at the tip of a neurite is sufficient to induce a dendrite to become an axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradke and Dotti, 1999</xref>). Increasing evidence also suggests an important role for spectrin in the maintenance of neuronal polarization, as well as the development and stabilization of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galiano et al., 2012</xref>). αII and βII spectrin are enriched in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Riederer et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galiano et al., 2012</xref>). Spectrin is known to be important for providing the mechanical stability for axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>) and protecting them from mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krieg et al., 2014</xref>), for axon path finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hulsmeier et al., 2007</xref>), for the stabilization of pre-synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pielage et al., 2005</xref>), and for maintaining specific membrane domains in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Susuki and Rasband, 2008</xref>). Mice lacking either αII or βII spectrin die in the embryo, highlighting the crucial function of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stankewich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galiano et al., 2012</xref>). Spectrin has also been shown to play a role in human neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ikeda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Writzl et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we discovered a periodic sub-membrane lattice structure made of actin, spectrin, and other associated molecules in the axons of mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). In this membrane skeleton, actin filaments form a ring-like structure that wraps around the circumference of axons. These actin rings are evenly spaced along the axon shaft with a period of ∼190 nm and show a remarkably long-range order. Actin filaments in the rings are capped by adducin. Adjacent actin rings are connected by spectrin, likely in the form of αII-βII-spectrin heterotetramers, given the observations that the periodic βII spectrin rings alternate with the actin–adducin rings along axons and that the observed 190 nm period matches the length of the spectrin tetramer. The ultrastructural organization of this quasi-one-dimensional, periodic lattice structure is different from the previously observed, two-dimensional polygonal membrane skeletal structure found in red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byers and Branton, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</xref>), whereas an erythrocyte-like polygonal membrane skeletal was observed in the axon terminals at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pielage et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, this periodic structure preferentially forms in axons, with the actin in dendrites primarily adopting the form of long filaments running along the dendrite shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> that lack β spectrin or carry a β spectrin mutant, axons break more easily during animal movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>) and exhibit impaired touch sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krieg et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that this structure may be important for the mechanical stability of axons and for sensing mechanical stimuli. This periodic lattice also organizes the axonal membrane by placing important membrane proteins, such as the voltage-gated sodium channels, into a periodic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, it is unknown how this highly regular membrane skeleton structure develops in axons and how its formation is regulated. For example, it is unclear whether the periodic lattice develops during early or late stages of axon differentiation. Although protein factors previously identified to be important for axon differentiation tend to be enriched and function at the growing tips of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stiess and Bradke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng and Poo, 2012</xref>), it is unknown whether the actin–spectrin lattice also initiates at the distal ends of axons or instead forms first in the proximal region near the cell body. Finally, the molecular mechanism that regulates the specific formation of this periodic structure in axons, instead of dendrites, remains a mystery. In this study, we addressed these important questions concerning the development of this newly discovered neuronal structure. We found that the periodic membrane skeleton initiated early during axon differentiation. The lattice structure originated in the axonal region adjacent to the cell body and propagated to the distal ends of axons. The lattice structure further matured by recruiting other components, and the matured membrane skeleton was highly stable. Multiple molecular factors played roles in regulating the formation of this structure. The lattice structure depended on intact microtubules. The high local concentration of βII spectrin in axons was the key determining factor for the specific formation of the lattice structure in axons, and artificially increasing the concentration of βII spectrin in dendrites was sufficient to induce the formation of the periodic lattice structure in dendrites. Remarkably ankyrin B was important for the polarized distribution of βII spectrin in neurites; in ankyrin B knockout mice, βII spectrin was evenly distributed in axons and dendrites, giving rise to a highly regular, periodic membrane skeleton in both dendrites and axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Early development and propagation of the periodic lattice structure in axons</title><p>Neurons exhibit distinct developmental stages with different morphological characteristics during polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng and Poo, 2012</xref>). In dissociated hippocampal neuronal culture, neurons first display intense lamellipodial protrusive activity in stage 1, which then leads to the emergence of multiple immature neurites in stage 2 (∼1 Day in Vitro [DIV]). In stage 3 (DIV 2–4), one of these neurites breaks the symmetry and extends rapidly to become an axon. The other neurites then gradually acquire dendritic properties in stage 4 (DIV 4–7). In stage 5 (&gt;DIV 7), neurons continue to mature and form axon initial segments, dendritic spines, and synapses. In order to determine the developmental course of the periodic membrane skeletal structure, we fixed dissociated neurons at different developmental stages, immunostained for βII spectrin, and imaged using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), a super-resolution imaging method that relies on switching and localizing single molecules to acquire sub-diffraction limit images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betzig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hess et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rust et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To illustrate how we systematically imaged and quantified this periodic structure in axons, we first imaged a neuron at DIV 10. Consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), βII spectrin adopted a highly regular, periodic pattern in all regions of the axonal shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>). Both Fourier transform and autocorrelation analyses showed that the βII spectrin adopted a periodic distribution with a period of ∼190 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, actin filaments exhibited a highly periodic distribution along axon shafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Depolymerizing the actin filaments with latrunculin A (LatA) disrupted the periodic distribution of βII spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and knocking-down βII spectrin using shRNA led to a loss of the periodic actin distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that the periodic organizations of actin and spectrin are interdependent, consistent with the model that adjacent actin rings are connected by the spectrin tetramers.</p><p>Next, we quantified the distribution of βII spectrin at earlier developmental stages in DIV 2, 4, and 6 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows a typical stage 3 neuron at DIV 2, with one neurite outgrowing the others and becoming an axon. Interestingly, the periodic pattern of βII spectrin has already formed in the proximal region of this axon near the cell body, as shown by both Fourier transform and autocorrelation analyses of the STORM image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). However, the periodic distribution did not extend far—the middle and distal parts of the same axon did not exhibit the periodic pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). Similar results were observed for other stage 3 neurons that we imaged. As neurons continued to mature, the periodic βII spectrin distribution extended to more distal regions of axons. By DIV 6, the periodic βII spectrin distribution extended for nearly the entire length of the axon, except for the very distal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). Using the autocorrelation amplitude at the first peak (∼190 nm) to quantify the degree of periodicity for the βII spectrin distributions, we found that the periodicity degraded quickly along axons in DIV 2 neurons but gradually extended to the distal end of the axon in later developmental stages until the structure eventually occupied nearly the entire axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the periodic membrane skeleton forms early during development, originates in proximal axon regions close to the cell body, and propagates toward the distal end of the axon.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04581.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Early development and propagation of the periodic lattice structure in axons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A DIV 2 neuron was stained with βII spectrin antibody and imaged by 3D STORM.

Treatment of neurons with actin-depolymerizing drugs, cytochalasin D (CytoD), or LatA disrupted the periodicity of βII spectrin in DIV 3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>). The effect of actin-depolymerizing drugs set in quickly with the periodic βII spectrin distribution substantially disrupted after several minutes of LatA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>), consistent with the drug acting directly on the lattice structure. These results indicate that actin is involved in the lattice structure during early neuronal development. The form of actin, however, appeared to be different during the early developmental stages as compared to that in mature axons. We have previously shown that the periodic pattern of actin was not directly observed in the STORM images during DIV 1–4. In DIV 5, the periodic actin pattern begins to appear in some neurons and become robustly observed in neurons at DIV 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Similar results were observed here (data not shown). One possible interpretation is that actin existed in a less stable form during the early developmental stages and was not preserved by our sample treatment (fixation and extraction) prior to imaging. Consistent with the notion that actin filaments in the lattice structure were less stable during early developmental stages, the periodic structure of βII spectrin was more quickly disrupted by LatA treatment during early development than in older neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04581.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The periodic structure of βII spectrin depends on actin during early development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) DIV 3 neurons were either untreated or treated with latrunculin A (LatA, 20 µM) or cytochalasin D (CytoD, 50 µM) for 1 hr and subsequently immunostained with βII spectrin antibody for 3D STORM imaging.

The lack of adducin capping may have contributed to the lower stability of actin during early development stages, although it is also possible that the lower stability of actin during the early development stages made it difficult to maintain the adducin pattern during cell fixation and extraction. Finally, it is formally possible that actin and adducin are not present in the periodic lattice structure during early developmental stages. However, we consider such a scenario to be less likely as it is difficult to imagine how spectrin tetramers themselves could self-assemble into a periodic lattice structure without the help of actin to crosslink multiple spectrin tetramers.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04581.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Recruitment of adducin into the periodic lattice structure during development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Neurons were immunostained for adducin and imaged by 3D STORM.

Next, we examined whether βIV spectrin and ankyrin G were also recruited to the periodic membrane skeleton and, if so, during which developmental stage these components were incorporated.</p><p>We labeled ankyrin G using an antibody against its spectrin-binding domain near the N-terminus and βIV spectrin using an antibody against its N-terminal domain. Both ankyrin G and βIV spectrin signals were weak during early developmental stages, and the signals became stronger in the proximal region of axons at DIV 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, the expression level of βII spectrin remained high throughout the axons during this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). At this time, the distributions of ankyrin G and βIV spectrin were not periodic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>), in contrast to the highly periodic βII spectrin in the proximal region of axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Over time, both ankyrin G and βIV spectrin signals further increased in the proximal region of axons, and by DIV 12, the N-terminal domains of both ankyrin G and βIV spectrin adopted highly periodic distributions, indicating that these molecules were incorporated into the periodic lattice structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). Interestingly, the periodicity was substantially less pronounced for the C-terminal domain of βIV spectrin and undetectable for the C-terminal domain of ankyrin G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). These results suggest that the N-terminal regions of these molecules were tightly incorporated in the periodic lattice structure, but their C-terminal regions were likely hanging off from the lattice structure and moving relatively freely. Notably, as ankyrin G and βIV spectrin became incorporated into the periodic lattice, we observed a decrease in the local concentration of βII spectrin at the AIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

The efficiency of knockdown was demonstrated by a lack of βII spectrin signal in virus-infected, GFP-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). When infected by the virus at DIV 3, the enrichment of βIV spectrin in the AIS region appeared partially impaired by βII spectrin knockdown, though at least 60% of the neurons still exhibited enrichment of βIV spectrin in AIS. For these neurons, the periodicity of βIV spectrin was also partially disrupted in the βII spectrin-depleted neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>), indicating that βII spectrin is important for the periodic assembly of βIV spectrin.

Ankyrin B (ANK 2) is a molecule that binds to βII spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</xref>). It is highly enriched in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kunimoto, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engelhardt et al., 2013</xref>) and recently found to be potentially linked with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Rubeis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iossifov et al., 2014</xref>). We have shown previously that ankyrin B also adopts a partially periodic pattern in axons albeit with a lower regularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), potentially due to an incomplete occupancy of the ankyrin B binding sites on the lattice structure and the presence of ankyrin B on intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</xref>). We thus asked whether ankyrin B is involved in regulating the formation of this periodic membrane skeleton in axons.</p><p>To address this question, we performed STORM imaging on disassociated hippocampal neurons from ankyrin B knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scotland et al., 1998</xref>) at DIV 10. Similar to wild-type neurons, ankyrin B knockout neurons still showed enrichment of MAP2 in dendrites with similar dendritic morphology, making dendrites easy to identify in these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The periodic pattern of βII spectrin in axons was not perturbed by ankyrin B deletion and appeared quantitatively similar to that observed in control wild-type neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly, βII spectrin also adopted a highly regular, periodic distribution in all dendrites, with the periodicity quantitatively similar to that observed in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). This is in stark contrast to what we observed in wild-type neurons, where the distributions of βII spectrin in dendrites were largely irregular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The actin-capping protein adducin also adopted a periodic distribution in dendrites of ankyrin B knockout neurons, with quantitatively similar periodicity to that of βII spectrin. Knocking-down βII spectrin disrupted the periodic distribution of adducin, indicating that the periodic lattice structure in the dendrites of the ankyrin B knockout neurons also depended on βII spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Many molecular components, including actin, βII spectrin, adducin, ankyrin B, βIV spectrin, ankyrin G, and sodium channels, are present in this structure. We have observed this periodic membrane skeleton with STORM imaging of fixed cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2 fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 1–3</xref>) and fixed brain tissue slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2013</xref>) using actin-binding phalloidin and immunolabeling of endogenously expressed proteins, as well as in live cultured neurons using fluorescent fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Recently, this periodic structure has also been observed in live neurons using a cell-permeable actin-binding dye and STED imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lukinavicius et al., 2014</xref>). Since a single actin filament can interact with multiple spectrin tetramers, and a single spectrin tetramer can bind to two actin filaments, one at each end of the symmetric tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</xref>), we reason that these crosslinking interactions are responsible for the formation of the lattice structure. Indeed, depolymerizing actin filaments disrupted the periodic distribution of βII spectrin, and knocking-down of βII spectrin disrupted the periodic distribution of actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2 fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 2–3</xref>). Because this lattice structure is associated with the axonal membrane, proper preservation of the membrane structure is essential for observing this structure. For example, a recent electron microscopy study of the AIS in neurons that has been subjected to detergent extraction of membrane before fixation did not show such periodic membrane skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed when we applied the same ‘fixation after membrane extraction’ protocol to neurons, the structure was destroyed and not observed in STORM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). In this study, we investigated the developmental mechanism of this newly discovered axonal membrane skeleton.</p><p>We found that this periodic membrane skeleton started to form early during axon development. In stage 3 neurons at DIV 2, when one neurite just broke the symmetry and became an axon (typically several times longer than other neurites), the periodic pattern of βII spectrin already emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It originated in the proximal axon regions near the cell bodies and gradually propagated to the distal ends of axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This spatial distribution is in contrast to most previously identified signaling molecules involved in axon differentiation and development, which are enriched and function at the growing tip of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stiess and Bradke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng and Poo, 2012</xref>). After its initial appearance, the lattice structure continued to mature with the actin filaments becoming more stable, potentially because of capping by adducin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2, 3</xref>). Once matured, the structure appeared highly stable with little movement and extremely slow turnover of its molecular components was observed in live neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This highly stable membrane skeleton may function to provide a stable mechanical support for axons. Indeed, deletion of β spectrin from <italic>C elegans</italic> causes axons to break when the animals move (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The emergence of this periodic lattice during early axon development and its origination in the proximal axon region near the cell body suggest that the periodic membrane skeleton may function as an independent mechanism for establishing or maintaining neuronal polarization in addition to the previously identified pathways that function at the distal ends of axons. However, the periodic membrane skeleton is not required for the initiation of axon differentiation because the periodic structure only started to form in stage 3, but not stage 2, a stage at which most signaling molecules for axon initiation exhibit high activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng and Poo, 2012</xref>). Moreover, neurons depleted of βII spectrin are also capable of forming long axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galiano et al., 2012</xref>), though these axons may not be fully functional. Indeed, removal of αII or βII spectrin is embryonically lethal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stankewich et al., 2011</xref>) and AIS, the structure important for action potential generation, fails to assemble properly in neurons that are depleted of βII spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galiano et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, molecules important for the specification of AIS, ankyrin G, βIV spectrin, and sodium channels were all incorporated into this periodic membrane skeleton. During the early stages of axon development, the expression levels of ankyrin G and βIV spectrin were low in the proximal axon region, which was instead occupied by the periodic lattice comprising βII spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Ankyrin G and βIV spectrin began to enrich in the proximal axon region later during axon development, at ∼DIV 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galiano et al., 2012</xref>). The incorporation of ankyrin G and βIV spectrin into the periodic lattice was observed even later, at around DIV 12, replacing βII spectrin from the structure in the AIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The enrichment and periodic assembly of the AIS components appeared to depend on βII spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our data suggest the following developmental course for the AIS formation. Before the AIS is formed, actin and βII spectrin form a cohesive periodic lattice structure that covers the entire axonal shaft including the proximal axonal region. The AIS then forms by the enrichment of ankyrin G and βIV spectrin in the proximal axonal region and the replacement of βII spectrin by βIV spectrin in the periodic membrane skeleton. Potentially, ankyrin G, the master regulator of AIS that recruits other AIS components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenkins and Bennett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2007</xref>), is first enriched in the proximal axon region. Ankyrin G then recruits βIV spectrin to the same region and causes it to be incorporated in the periodic lattice. βIV spectrin in turn anchors ankyrin G into a periodic pattern as well. As an adaptor, ankyrin G then places sodium channels into a periodic distribution pattern in the AIS.</p><p>Finally, we addressed the question why the cohesive, periodic lattice structure preferentially formed in axons, with dendrites showed at most isolated patches of periodic structure with much less regularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). We found multiple molecular factors participate in this regulation. The periodic lattice structure depended on intact microtubules. Treatment with a microtubule-depolymerizing drug disrupts the structure in axons, whereas treatment with microtubule-stabilizing drugs induces the formation of the lattice structure in multiple neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Importantly, we found that the local concentration of βII spectrin is a determining factor for the formation of the lattice structure. The local concentration of βII spectrin is ∼2 times higher in axons than in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Remarkably, increasing the dendritic concentration of βII spectrin by overexpression induced the formation of the periodic lattice structure in all dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, ankyrin B was critical for maintaining the polarized distribution of βII spectrin. Knocking out ankyrin B led to an even distribution of βII spectrin in dendrites and axons and the formation of a highly regular and cohesive periodic lattice structure in all dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Consistent with the notion that the increased concentration of βII spectrin in dendrites is responsible for inducing the formation of the periodic lattice structure in dendrites, knocking-down βII spectrin from ankyrin B knockout neurons disrupted the lattice structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that ankyrin B is critical for establishing a polarized distribution of βII spectrin in neurites with a higher concentration of βII spectrin in axons than in dendrites, which in turn promotes the formation of the periodic membrane skeleton in axons.</p><p>It is interesting to speculate how ankyrin B may establish such a polarized distribution of βII spectrin. The predominant form of ankyrin B during early neuronal development is a 440-kDa splice variant that is preferentially targeted to axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunimoto et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kunimoto, 1995</xref>). Given that ankyrin B specifically binds to βII spectrin, we speculate that the distribution of ankyrin B in axons may help establishing the enrichment of βII spectrin in axons during early neuronal development. Moreover, we recently found that ankyrin B is a major cargo adaptor for dynactin and promotes axonal transport of proteins and organelles and that disruption of ankyrin B–dynactin interaction significantly impairs the axonal transport of many proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35a">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>). It is thus possible that ankyrin B may also preferentially transport βII spectrin into axons instead of dendrites. By maintaining a polarized distribution of βII spectrin in neurons, ankyrin B functions as a negative regulator for preventing the formation of the periodic membrane skeleton in dendrites. The exact mechanism by which ankyrin B maintains a polarized distribution of βII spectrin remains an interesting question for future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Hippocampi were isolated and digested with 0.05% trypsin–EDTA (1×) (Invitrogen 25300-054, Grand Island, NY) at 37°C for 15 min. The hippocampi were transferred to the Hib A solution (BrainBits HA-Ca, Springfield, IL), washed several times with the Hib A solution, and pipetted up and down until the tissues were mostly dissolved. The solution was then passed through a cell strainer (VWR 21008-949, Philadelphia, PA) to remove the residual undissociated tissue and collected in a 50 ml conical tube. Neurons were spun down to the bottom of the tube, resuspended with the culture media made of 96 ml Neurobasal (Life Technologies 12349-015), 2 ml B-27 Supplement (Life Technologies 17504-044, Grand Island, NY), 1 ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Life technologies 15140-122) and 1 ml Glutamax (Life technologies 35050-061), and then plated onto poly-L-lysine/laminin-coated 12-mm coverslips (BD bioscience BD354087, San Jose, CA) or poly-L-lysine coated 8-well chambers. 5 μM cytosine-D-arabinofuranoside (Sigma C1768, St. Louis, MO) was added to the culture media to inhibit the growth of glial cells 3 days after plating. The neurons were fed twice a week with freshly made culture media until use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Reagents</title><p>The following primary antibodies were used in this study: guinea pig anti-Map2 antibody (Synaptic Systems, 188002, Goettingen, Germany); mouse anti-βII spectrin antibody (BD Biosciences, 612563); mouse anti-ankyrin G antibody (Santa Cruz, Sc-12719, Dallas, Texas; epitope mapping the spectrin-binding domain of ankyrin G near the N-terminal); goat anti-ankyrin G antibody (Santa Cruz, Sc-31778, epitope mapping the C-terminal of ankyrin G); rabbit anti-adducin antibody (Abcam, ab51130, Cambridge, MA); rabbit anti-HA antibody (Abcam, ab9110); rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Abcam, ab290); goat anti-βIII spectrin (Santa Cruz, sc-9660). Rabbit antibodies targeting the C- or N-terminus of βIV spectrin were kind gifts from Dr Matt Rasband at Baylor College of Medicine.</p><p>The following secondary antibodies were used in this study for conventional imaging: Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse (Invitrogen, A31571), Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse (Invitrogen, A31570), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse (Invitrogen, A21202), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, A31573), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, A10042), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, A21206), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-guinea pig (Invitrogen, A11073), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen, A21447), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen, A11057).</p><p>For STORM imaging, secondary antibodies were custom-labeled with a photoswitchable reporter dye, Alexa Fluor 647, and an activator dye Alexa Flour 405, which facilitates the photoswitching of the reporter dye. Donkey anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were each labeled with a mixture of amine-reactive activator and reporter dyes in a one-step reaction, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2013</xref>). In some experiments, commercial Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated donkey anti-mouse, anti-rabbit or anti-goat secondary antibodies were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Transfection of neurons with fusion protein constructs</title><p>βII spectrin-GFP and βII spectrin-HA plasmids (addgene, 31070, Cambridge, MA) used in this study were reported previously, with GFP inserted at the N-terminal of βII spectrin and the HA tag at the C-terminal of βII spectrin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galiano et al., 2012</xref>). To make the βII spectrin-mMaple 3 construct, we replaced the HA tag sequence with the mMaple 3 sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Plasmids were transfected into neurons using a calcium phosphate transfection kit from Invitrogen (K2780-01). The protocol for transfection was modified slightly for our neuronal cultures. Briefly, neurons were plated at a density of 40,000 cells/well in 12-well plates and cultured for 6–10 days before the transfection. After changing media from original neuronal culture media to Minimum Essential Media (MEM, Life Technology, supplemented with 20 mM HEPEs, pH 7.15), 100 µl plasmid mixture was added, and neurons were incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The media was subsequently aspirated and replaced with a lower pH MEM (supplemented with 20 mM HEPEs, pH 6.8) at 37°C for 4 min. After dissolving all calcium phosphate crystals, we added back the original neuronal culture media. Experiments were performed 2 or 3 days after transfection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Knockdown with shRNA</title><p>The βII spectrin-shRNA adenoviral construct used in this study was a kind gift from Dr Matt Rasband at Baylor College of Medicine and described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hedstrom et al., 2008</xref>). The two sense sequences of shRNA are: 5′-GCATGTCACGATGTTACAA-3′ and 5′-GGATGAAATGAAGGTGCTA-3′. For assaying the effect of βII spectrin knockdown on actin and adducin structure, neurons were infected with the virus at DIV 3 and fixed for STORM imaging at around DIV 9 or 10. For assaying the effect of βII spectrin knockdown on βIV spectrin structure, neurons were infected with the virus at DIV 3 or DIV 7 and fixed at DIV 12 for STORM imaging of βIV spectrin. Infected neurons were marked by a GFP signal expressed from the adenoviral construct. The knockdown efficiency was validated through immunostaining against βII spectrin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Drug treatment of neurons</title><p>The following chemicals were used in this study with their concentration and treatment time stated: latrunculin A (Sigma, L5163, 20 µM, 1 hr or indicated time series), cytochalasin D (Sigma, C8273, 50 µM, 1 hr), nocodazole (Sigma, M1404, 50 µM, 1 hr), taxol (Sigma, T7402, 5 nM), SB-216763 (Sigma, S3442, 5 µM). For taxol treatment, neurons were treated with the drug at DIV 3 with the indicated concentration and fixed at DIV 6 for STORM imaging. For SB216763 treatment, neurons were treated with the drug at DIV 1 with the indicated concentration and fixed at DIV 5 for STORM imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence labeling of neurons</title><p>Cultured neurons were fixed at various days in vitro (DIV). For imaging of actin, we used a similar method to label actin as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koestler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, the samples were simultaneously fixed and extracted for 1 min using a solution of 0.3% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde (GA) and 0.25% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in cytoskeleton buffer (CB, 10 mM MES, pH 6.1, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM glucose, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and then post-fixed for 15 min in 2% (vol/vol) GA in CB, a previously established protocol for maintaining actin ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koestler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). The GA-fixed samples were treated with freshly prepared 0.1% (wt/vol) sodium borohydride for 7 min to reduce background fluorescence caused by GA fixation. To label actin filaments, samples were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen A22287) overnight at 4°C or ∼1 hr at room temperature. A concentration of ∼0.5 µM phalloidin in PBS was used. To minimize the dissociation of phalloidin from actin during washing steps, actin labeling was performed after all other labeling steps (i.e., immunofluorescence of other molecular targets) were completed. The sample was washed 2–3 times with PBS and then immediately mounted for imaging.</p><p>To test whether strong membrane extraction prior to fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2014</xref>) disrupts the membrane skeleton structure, neurons were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer (100 mM Pipes–KOH, pH 6.9, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM EGTA) containing 2% polyethylene glycol, 2 µM phalloidin, and 2 µM taxol for 3 min at room temperature after a quick rinse with the PEM buffer containing 2 µM taxol and subsequently fixed with 0.2% GA in PBS for at least 20 min, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). Fixed samples were treated with freshly prepared 0.2% (wt/vol) sodium borohydride for 5–10 min to reduce background fluorescence caused by GA fixation and washed in PBS. Actin labeling was performed similarly as described above.</p><p>For imaging of molecular components not including actin (MAP2, βII spectrin, βIII spectrin, βIV spectrin, ankyrin G, and adducin), the samples were fixed using 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min. Fixed neuron samples were then permeabilized and blocked in blocking buffer (3% wt/vol bovine serum albumin or 10% wt/vol donkey serum, 0.2% vol/vol Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 hr and subsequently stained with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The samples were washed three times and then stained with secondary antibodies (described above) in blocking buffer for ∼1 hr at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fixed-cell STORM imaging</title><p>The imaging buffer was PBS containing 100 mM cysteamine, 5% glucose, 0.8 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), and 40 μg/ml catalase (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) for fixed neurons. To image the samples from 12-mm coverslips, approximately 4 μl of imaging buffer was dropped at the center of a freshly-cleaned #1.5 rectangular coverslip (22 mm by 60 mm), and the sample on the 12-mm coverslip was mounted on the rectangular coverslip and sealed with nail polish or Cytoseal. To image samples from 8-well chambers, 400 μl of imaging buffer was added to the imaging chamber.</p><p>The STORM setup was based on an Olympus IX-71 inverted optical microscope as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2011</xref>). 405-nm (CUBE 405-50C; Coherent, Santa Clara, CA), 460-nm (Sapphire 460-10; Coherent), 532-nm (GCL-200-I; CrystaLaser, Reno, NV), and 657-nm (RCL-300-656; CrystaLaser) lasers were introduced into the sample through the back focal plane of the microscope. A translation stage allowed the laser beams to be shifted towards the edge of the objective so that the emerging light reached the sample at incidence angles slightly smaller than the critical angle of the glass–water interface, thus illuminating only the fluorophores within a few micrometers of the coverslip surface. A T660LPXR (Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT) was used as the dichroic mirror and an ET705/72M band-pass filter (Chroma) was used as the emission filter. For 3-dimensional (3D) STORM imaging, a cylindrical lens was inserted into the imaging path so that images of single molecules were elongated in <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> for molecules on the proximal and distal sides of the focal plane (relative to the objective), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>During imaging, continuous illumination of 657-nm laser (∼2 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>) was used to excite fluorescence from Alexa Flour 647 molecules and switched them into the dark state. Continuous illumination of the 405-nm laser (when Alexa Flour 405 was used as the activator dye) or 532-nm laser (when Cy3 was used as the activator dye) was used to reactivate the fluorophores to the emitting state. The power of the activation lasers (typical range 0–1 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) was adjusted during image acquisition so that at any given instant, only a small, optically resolvable fraction of the fluorophores in the sample was in the emitting state.</p><p>A typical STORM image was generated from a sequence of about 30,000–60,000 image frames at a frame rate of 60 Hz. The recorded STORM movie was analyzed according to previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rust et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2008</xref>). The centroid positions and ellipticities of the single molecule images provided lateral and axial positions of each activated fluorescent molecule, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2008</xref>). Super-resolution images were reconstructed from the molecular coordinates by depicting each location as a 2D Gaussian peak.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Live-cell STORM imaging</title><p>Live-cell STORM experiments were performed on the same STORM setup as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shim et al., 2012</xref>). Neurons were initially transfected with βII spectrin-mMaple 3 at DIV 8 and imaged in an extracellular solution containing: 128 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM HEPES, 30 mM glucose, pH 7.3 at DIV 10 or DIV 11. Continuous illumination of the 405-nm laser was used to activate the mMaple 3 fluorescent protein. Continuous illumination of 561-nm laser was used to excite mMaple 3 and switched them to the dark state. Imaging analysis was performed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>FRAP analysis</title><p>FRAP experiments were performed on the same STORM setup as described above. Neurons were transfected with βII spectrin-GFP at DIV 8 and then imaged at DIV 10. Directly before FRAP experiments, neuronal culture media were replaced with an extracellular solution. After recording an image before photo-bleaching, a small region of the sample was bleached by shrinking the size of iris at the excitation light path for 10 s with the maximum laser power. Subsequently, the sample was imaged using the same power as that of pre-bleached image. The image was recorded at a frequency of 1 Hz. We used the unbleached regions in the image to calibrate the photo-bleaching effect during the entire recording time. The fluorescence recovery fraction was measured as the fluorescence intensity at the bleached region at indicated time vs the original intensity before photo-bleaching.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Matthew Rasband for providing the βIV spectrin antibodies and the shRNA against βII spectrin.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. All reviewers were very laudatory about your manuscript, and feel it will be a valuable and important contribution.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript “Developmental mechanism of the periodic membrane skeleton in axons” by Zhong et al. provides new insights how the lately discovered periodic lattice structure in axons containing actin and spectrin is formed. The authors showed that the membrane skeleton forms early on during neuronal differentiation, when axons are formed. Components of the axon initial segment, ankyrin G and βIV spectrin were integrated into the membrane skeleton late during development. βII spectrin was a positive regulator of membrane skeleton formation and ankyrin B was a negative regulator of membrane skeleton formation. In fact, overexpression of βII spectrin or knocking out of ankyrin B induced the formation of a periodic membrane skeleton in dendrites.</p><p>The Zhuang lab has recently made a big contribution to the cytoskeletal field by discovering that axons contain a periodic actin-spectrin based network (Xu et al., Science, 2013). Here, the authors reveal how the periodic skeleton is formed. It is a very exciting work that is suitable for a general audience. In addition, the authors demonstrate that detergent treatment causes the disruption of the periodic membrane skeleton, which shows why recent work from the Svitkina lab were unable to find a periodic membrane skeleton by EM. Before publication, the following points should be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors should clearly state, for each experiment, how many neurons they analyzed from how many independent preparations.</p><p>2) Please discuss potential mechanisms how ankyrin B, which is localized to the axon, can prevent formation of the lattice in dendrites.</p><p>3) Does the morphology of the dendrite change when the lattice is formed there, either by knocking out ankyrin B or by overexpression of βII spectrin? From the pictures, it looks like they are still thicker than axons and a tapered structure. Here a quantification would be important.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: the presented neuron is rather atypical for a neuron 10 days in culture. They have very short dendrites, more reminiscent of immature minor neuritis (please check Gomis-Rüth et al., Nature Protocols, 2014). Please provide an example of more mature dendrites, and show the absence of the skeleton compared to the axon.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, for images in A1, A2 and A3, how are the exposure times controlled for these images? Is it possible that the periodical distribution is already present in A2 but with less spectrin at each ring. As a result, when given the same exposure time as A1, less photo switching took place. In other words, is it possible that A2 is a partial pattern of A1?</p><p>6) The earliest developmental stages that actin and spectrin rings can be detected are different. This is a bit troublesome to reconcile with the complete interdependence between actin and spectrin.

We envision two potential mechanisms by which ankyrin B could lead to a higher local concentration of βII spectrin in axons and thereby function as a negative regulator for preventing the formation of the periodic structure in dendrites. We discussed these mechanisms in the last paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>3) Does the morphology of the dendrite change when the lattice is formed there, either by knocking out ankyrin B or by overexpression of βII spectrin? From the pictures, it looks like they are still thicker than axons and a tapered structure. Here a quantification would be important</italic>.</p><p>In light of this comment, we quantified the morphology of dendrites by two measures, the average length of the dendrites and the diameter variation along individual dendrites. We measured these quantities for both wild type and ankyrin B knockout neurons at DIV9. For comparison, we measured the same quantities for axons. The results are shown below in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1A-C</xref>.</p><p>We didn’t observe a significant difference in the average dendritic length upon knocking out ankyrin B, whereas the average length of the axons was significantly shortened in ankyrin B knockout neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1B</xref>). These findings are consistent with the results presented in our recent paper (Lorenzo et al, <italic>J. Cell Biol</italic>, in press), which shows that ankyrin B is a major cargo adaptor for dynactin and promotes axonal transport. To quantify the tapering feature of dendrites, we measured the variance (standard deviation) of the dendrite diameters measured at five locations evenly spaced along each dendrite and obtained statistical average of the variance number across many dendrites. The diameter variance reflects the extent of the tapering with a smaller variance indicating a less tapered and more uniform neurite. The diameter variance appeared similar in dendrites of wild type and ankyrin B knockout neurons, suggesting that there was no substantial difference in the tapering of dendrites upon ankyrin B deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1C</xref>). No significant changes were observed for the diameter variance of dendrites in the βII spectrin overexpressing neurons either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1C</xref>). For comparison, we measured the variance of the axonal diameter and found it to be substantially smaller than those of the dendrites, confirming that the axons are indeed much less tapered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1C</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we made an initial attempt to probe the axon-dendrite polarity in ankyrin B knockout neurons. Map2 and Tau are typically enriched in dendrites and axons, respectively. We therefore quantified the relative abundance of these proteins in dendrites and axons of wild type, and ankyrin B knockout neurons. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1D</xref> illustrate that the relatively abundance of these proteins in dendrites vs. axons did not change substantially upon deletion of ankyrin B.</p><p>The above results suggest that dendrites largely retained its dendritic nature in ankyrin B knockout neurons. However, these simple quantifications do not exclude the possibility that other properties of dendrites may have changed upon ankyrin B deletion. More systematic characterizations of the properties of dendrites in ankyrin B knockout neurons await future studies. For this reason, we did not include these results in the revised manuscript.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The dendrite morphology and axon-dendrite polarity of ankyrin B knockout neurons.</title><p>A) Conventional images of Map2 and Tau in wild type and ankyrin B knockout (KO) neurons.

Is it possible that the periodical distribution is already present in A2 but with less spectrin at each ring. As a result, when given the same exposure time as A1, less photo switching took place. In other words</italic>, <italic>is it possible that A2 is a partial pattern of A1?</italic></p><p>The images shown in the A1, A2 and A3 panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> were taken with the same exposure time. Indeed, the numbers of localizations in A2 and A3 are less (∼ 2 fold and ∼10 fold, respectively) than that in A1. However, since we projected the localization distribution into one dimension and performed the Fourier and autocorrelation analyses, if the highly regular periodic distribution were already present in A2 and A3, we would still have observed a pronounced peak in the Fourier analysis and a periodic function in the autocorrelation curve for A2 and A3. Indeed, when we randomly removed localizations from the A1 image to match up with the numbers of localizations in A2 and A3, the Fourier analyses still showed a much more pronounced peak than the corresponding ones for A2 and A3, and the autocorrelation analyses also showed a much clearer periodic function than the corresponding ones for A2 and A3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>, below). Therefore, we do not think A2 is a simply partial pattern of the A1-like structure, but the periodicity of the distribution is indeed degraded towards the distal end of axons.</p><p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2A-C</xref>, we noticed that although the autocorrelation amplitude is not sensitive to the changes in the localization density, it did show a slight reduction as the number of localizations decreased to the A3 level. To quantify how much this effect contributes to the dependence of the autocorrelation amplitude on the distance to cell body shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, we randomly removed localizations from the proximal axon regions to match the localization numbers measured in distal axons at various distances to the cell body, calculated the corresponding autocorrelation amplitudes for DIV2, 4 and 6 neurons, and included these results in the revised manuscript (see the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref>). It is clear from these results that the change in the localization density along the axons does not contribute significantly to the change of the autocorrelation amplitude measured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>A) Top panel: STORM image of βII spectrin reproduced from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>–A1.

This is a bit troublesome to reconcile with the complete interdependence between actin and spectrin. The explanation given by the authors is that the actin rings might be lost during the fixation and staining procedures</italic>. <italic>Why not do these experiments with live neurites and mMaple labeled actin, which would bypass the fixation problem?</italic></p><p>We have actually tried to image actin in live neurons with the actin-mMaple3 fusion protein. However, it was difficult to observe the periodic actin structure at any stage of the neuron (immature or mature neurons) using this approach, even though the actin structure is clearly periodic in the axons of mature neurons as we showed in the images of fixed neurons with phalloidin labeling. This is due to a well-known problem: fusion constructs of actin and fluorescent proteins do not efficiently incorporate into the actin filaments and hence cannot give adequate quality super-resolution images of actin.</p><p>This fact has been pointed out in multiple previous papers (see, for example, Burkel et al., Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton, 64: 822-832, 2007; Kanchanawong et al., Nature, 468: 580-584, 2010). We have also tried an alternative approach of using LifeAct fused to mMaple3 to image actin in live neurons. LifeAct is a 17 amino acid peptide that binds to actin filaments. However, LifeAct presents its own difficulty because of the low binding affinity of LifeAct to actin (Kd = 2.2 μM; Riedl, et al., Nature Methods, 5: 605-607, 2008). Therefore, most of the LifeAct-mMaple3 were not associated with the periodic lattice structure, but were diffusing in the axons and gave a large background that obscured the periodic structure.</p><p>With future method development, it might be possible to directly observe the periodic actin distribution in the early developmental stages, but this would require a long-term effort and is beyond the scope of this paper. Given that the periodic structure of βII spectrin was rapidly and efficiently disrupted by actin-depolymerizing drugs, we think actin is involved in the lattice structure during early neuronal development. However, since periodic actin distribution was not directly observed during early developmental stages, we also clearly stated in the manuscript that it is formally possible that actin is not present in the periodic lattice structure during early developmental stages. However, we consider such a scenario to be less likely, as it is difficult to imagine how spectrin tetramers themselves could self-assemble into a periodic lattice structure without the help of actin to crosslink multiple spectrin tetramers. We carefully discussed these points in the manuscript in the Results section.</p><p><italic>7) It is not clear how ankyrin B prevents the localization of βII spectrin in dendrites. To prove that βII spectrin is responsible for the actin rings in the dendrites of ankyrin B knockout cells, the authors could knockdown βII spectrin in the ankyrin B mutant cells</italic>.</p><p>We have now discussed a couple of possible mechanisms by which ankyrin B enriches βII spectrin in axons. See our response to comment #2 above as well as the text in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>As suggested here, we also tested whether βII spectrin knockdown affected the periodic lattice structure in the dendrites of ankyrin B knockout neurons. To study the dependence of the periodic lattice structure on βII spectrin, we monitored the periodic structure using a nonspectrin marker, adducin in this case. Indeed, adducin showed a periodic distribution in the dendrites of ankyrin B KO neurons. βII spectrin knockdown efficiently disrupted the periodic adducin structure in the dendrites of ankyrin B KO neurons. These new results suggest that βII spectrin is responsible for the formation of periodic lattice structure in the dendrites of ankyrin B knockout neurons. We have included these new results in the revised manuscript, in the Results section, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>8) It is not clear from the writing how microtubules contribute to the actin rings. The rationale of the microtubule experiments should be spelled out more clearly</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we have provided an explanation of our rationale to study the role of microtubules. Briefly, since the periodic lattice structure is specifically formed in axons during neuronal development, and microtubules are essential for the establishment of neuronal polarity and the formation of axons (Witte et al., J. Cell Biol, 180: 619-632, 2008), we wondered whether the formation of this periodic structure is dependent on microtubules.</p><p>Moreover, tubulin binds with ankyrin B, a molecule that also interacts with βII spectrin (Bennett et al, PNAS, 78: 7550-7554,1981). We thus tested whether microtubules play a role in the formation of the periodic structure. We have included these rationales in the revised manuscript, Results section. Our results indicate that the periodic lattice structure does depend on intact microtubules. Currently, we do not know the mechanism underlying the connection between microtubules and the period lattice structure yet.</p><p><italic>9) The invasion of the actin rings in the dendrites in the ankyrin B mutant cells provides the authors with the opportunity to understand the functional importance of these rings</italic>. <italic>Are there any morphological changes of the dendrites or defects in axon-dendrite polarity in these knockout neurons?</italic></p><p>Indeed, inducing the formation of the periodic lattice structure in dendrites by ankyrin B deletion provides an exciting opportunity to study the function of this lattice structure. We have followed the suggestion here and in comment #3 to study the dendrite morphology and axon-dendrite polarity in ankyrin B knockout neurons. We analyzed the lengths of the dendrites and the diameter uniformity (extent of tapering) of the dendrites, but did not observe any significant changes in these properties due to ankyrin B deletion. We also did preliminary analysis of the axon-dendrite polarity by measuring the abundance of MAP2 and Tau in dendrites and axons, and did not observe any significant change upon deletion of ankyrin B either. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>, in our response to comment #3 above.</p><p>These results suggest that dendrites largely retained its dendritic nature in ankyrin B knockout neurons. However, we note that these simple quantifications do not exclude the possibility that other properties of the dendrites may have changed upon ankyrin B deletion. For both dendrite morphology and axon-dendrite polarity, many more parameters could be measured.</p><p>There are also many other important properties in addition to morphology and polarity. A systematic characterization of the dendrite properties in ankyrin B knockout neurons would be a very interesting future direction but is beyond the scope of this manuscript, which is focused on the development mechanism of the periodic lattice structure in axons.</p></body></sub-article></article>
