As is the case for all voltage-gated channels, it is widely assumed that individual Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels behave independently with respect to voltage-activation, open probability, and facilitation. Here, we report the results of super-resolution imaging, optogenetic, and electrophysiological measurements that refute this long-held view. We found that the short channel isoform (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>), but not the long (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>), associates in functional clusters of two or more channels that open cooperatively, facilitating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels are coupled via a C-terminus-to-C-terminus interaction that requires binding of the incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> to calmodulin (CaM) and subsequent binding of CaM to the pre-IQ domain of the channels. Physically-coupled channels facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents as a consequence of their higher open probabilities, leading to increased firing rates in rat hippocampal neurons. We propose that cooperative gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels represents a mechanism for the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and electrical activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15744.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15744.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15744.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The electrical charge inside a cell is different from that outside of the cell. Neurons rely on this difference to send signals via electrical impulses. This process involves ions moving across the neuron’s membrane through proteins called ion channels. Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channels are ion channels that open when the membrane’s electrical charge changes to allow positively charged calcium ions into the cell. This generates an electrical current that enables neurons in the brain to produce repetitive impulses.</p><p>Calcium ions entering through a Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channel can encourage the channel to allow in even more calcium ions. A closely related channel called Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2, which is essential to the activity of heart muscle, behaves in a similar way. Researchers have recently found that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels are arranged in clusters in the membrane and that adjacent channels interact to allow more calcium ions through the channels. This was an unexpected finding because it had long been thought that all ion channels acted independently.</p><p>Moreno et al. have now used a range of different approaches to investigate the behavior of one form of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channel, called Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>, in human cells and in neurons from rat brains. Initial experiments confirmed that calcium ions stimulated these channels to open in a coordinated way and to allow in more calcium. High-resolution microscopy then revealed that the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels do form clusters in the cell membrane.</p><p>Moreno et al. went on to demonstrate that this simultaneous opening of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels first requires a protein called calmodulin to bind calcium inside the cell. Next, the calcium-calmodulin complex associates with the parts of the channels that are also inside the cell. Further experiments showed that coupling the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channels together allows them to cooperate, and makes them more likely to be open and generate bigger calcium flows, and allowed neurons to send electrical signals more frequently. Future challenges include investigating how the clusters of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channels are established and maintained, and determining how the channels’ cooperation plays a role in both healthy and diseased states.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15744.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15744.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>CaV1.3 channels</kwd><kwd>hippocampal neurons</kwd><kwd>calcium facilitation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL085870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santana</surname><given-names>Luis F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL085686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santana</surname><given-names>Luis F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS077863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Binder</surname><given-names>Marc D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15SDG25560035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dixon</surname><given-names>Rose E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels of the short isoform are coupled via their C-terminal domains in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-dependent manner, which facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and increases the discharge of hippocampal neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are widely expressed in neurons throughout the brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tan et al., 2011</xref>), where they serve a number of critical functions including the modulation of resting potentials, the amplification of synaptic currents and the generation and shaping of repetitive firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Striessnig et al., 2006</xref>). These channels are dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels composed of a pore-forming Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3α<sub>1</sub> subunit and accessory β and α<sub>2</sub>-δ subunits. The carboxy-terminus (C-terminus) of the α<sub>1D</sub> subunit is structurally complex, containing an EF hand domain as well as pre-IQ and IQ domains to which the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Johny and Yue, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Alternative splicing results in the expression of 'long' and 'short' Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel isoforms that differ in the length of the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Singh et al., 2008</xref>).

As Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels activate at low voltages, they are a particular good candidate for underlying the sustained the neuronal firing and the persistent low- voltage-activated current observed in CA3 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avery and Johnston, 1996</xref>). In fact, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels support spontaneous firing of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and mid-spiny striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olson et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The function of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels is tightly regulated by changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>). The opening of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels causes a local increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> that induces two opposing regulatory mechanisms: Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation (CDF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Johny and Yue, 2014</xref>). CDF manifests as an increase in the magnitude of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 current (<italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>) with repetitive activation. In neurons, CDF can induce a persistent <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> that increases firing rate and may even lead to self-sustained firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fransen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Major and Tank, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheffield et al., 2013</xref>). It has been proposed that CDF of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII)-mediated phosphorylation, as has also been proposed for the closely related Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudmon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiao et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan and Bers, 1994</xref>). This phosphorylation requires the presence of a second protein, densin, which binds to the PDZ domain located in the most distal part of the C-terminus of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jenkins et al., 2010</xref>). Because Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> lacks that PDZ domain, CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation is unlikely to be responsible for CDF in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels. Thus, the mechanisms underlying the CDF of the widely expressed Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel have not yet been resolved.</p><p>Two recent studies by Dixon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2015</xref>) have suggested the tantalizing hypothesis that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced interactions between the C-termini of neighboring Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by increasing the activity of adjoined channels in cardiac muscle. At present, however, whether this physical and functional coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels is a common mechanism for the control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel function, including Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels is unknown. Furthermore, the possibility that cooperative Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel gating regulates neuronal excitability is also unclear.</p><p>In the present study, using electrophysiological, optogenetic, and super-resolution imaging approaches, we discovered that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels form functional clusters of two or more channels along the surface membrane of hippocampal neurons. Clustered Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels undergo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced physical interactions that increase the activity of adjoined channels, facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and thereby increase firing rates in hippocampal neurons. We propose that cooperative gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels is a new general mechanism for the amplification of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in excitable cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanism mediates facilitation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>, but not Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>, channels</title><p>Because Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are alternatively spliced, we first sought to determine whether Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels are differentially regulated by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Macroscopic currents were recorded from tsA-201 cells expressing either Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels in the presence of 2 mM Ba<sup>2+</sup> or 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Currents were activated by a depolarizing pulse (300 ms) from a holding potential of -80 mV to -10 mV. With Ba<sup>2+</sup> in the external solution, membrane depolarization induced large Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> currents that inactivated slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, center). Switching to a perfusion solution containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> decreased the amplitude of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> currents by nearly 40% and increased the rate of inactivation. Like Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> currents, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> currents inactivated faster when Ca<sup>2+</sup> was used as a charge carrier however, in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Singh et al., 2008</xref>), we observed more pronounced CDI (defined as the difference between inactivation of <italic>I<sub>Ba</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>) in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels compared to the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). As discussed above, this difference in the magnitude of CDI has been attributed to the lack of the CTM domain in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels. Curiously, the amplitude of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> currents decreased to a lesser extent (only about 15% at -10 mV) upon changing the external solution from Ba<sup>2+</sup> to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, center).</p><p>We investigated whether differences in the amplitude of elementary Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel currents could, at least in part, account for these disparities in macroscopic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents. Single Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel currents were recorded from cell-attached patches with pipettes containing 20 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Ba<sup>2+</sup>. With Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier, the amplitudes of elementary Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channel currents were similar. For example, at -30 mV they were -0.48 ± 0.07 and -0.49 ± 0.01 pA for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C–F</xref>). These values are in accordance with the unitary currents reported by Guia et al. for cardiac L-type channels using Ca<sup>2+</sup> as charge carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guia et al., 2001</xref>). Ensemble averages revealed currents that activated quickly and then inactivated likely due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Furthermore, as is the case for other Ca<sub>V</sub>1 channels, the single channel currents produced during the opening of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels were both larger with Ba<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier than with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (-1.14 ± 0.02 pA and -1.10 ± 0.02 pA for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> at -30 mV, respectively), but not significantly different from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The amplitude of the unitary currents with Ba<sup>2+</sup> is also in accordance with previously reported values for these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bock et al., 2011</xref>). These data suggest that the difference observed in the macroscopic currents between the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels is not due to differences in unitary currents.</p><p>We then tested the hypothesis that Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances the activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>, but not Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels by increasing the channel activity (<italic>NP</italic><sub>o</sub>). We performed a quantitative analysis of <italic>NP</italic><sub>o</sub>. The whole-cell current (I) is given by the equation I = <italic>i*N*P</italic><sub>o</sub>, where <italic>i</italic> is the amplitude of the elementary current, <italic>N</italic> is the number of functional channels, and <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> is the channel open probability. Since elementary Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> currents are larger when Ba<sup>2+</sup> rather than Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the charge carrier, for I<sub>Ca</sub> to be similar to I<sub>Ba</sub>, the <italic>NP</italic><sub>o</sub> of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> must be higher in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> than Ba<sup>2+</sup>. We estimated <italic>NP</italic><sub>o</sub> with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> as charge carriers by dividing the amplitude of whole-cell Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> currents at -10 mV, by the values of unitary current. Our analysis relies on the assumption that the relatively larger peak of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> currents in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was not due to faster activation kinetic of this channel than that of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels. This assumption is reasonable, as we found no significant difference in the activation time constants for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> currents that were 1.60 ± 0.22 and 1.17 ± 0.051 ms (-10 mV, n = 6 for each channel, p = 0.112), respectively. We used elementary currents values recorded with 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (-0.16 pA) and Ba<sup>2+</sup> (-0.24 pA) at -10 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guia et al., 2001</xref>). We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions entering the cell through the channels increased the <italic>NP</italic><sub>o</sub> nearly 1.5-fold for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels, but not at all for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1I and J</xref>). Thus, assuming that the number of functional Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels (<italic>N</italic>) in the membrane remained constant, a reasonable assumption given the short time lapse (~2 min) between recording I<sub>Ba</sub> and I<sub>Ca</sub> from the same cell, these data suggest that a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanism enhances inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents by increasing the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels, but not that of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels gate cooperatively, increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx</title><p>One possible explanation for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx–dependent increase in the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels is cooperative gating among channels in small clusters, as we have previously reported for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Navedo et al., 2010</xref>). To test this possibility, we made optical recordings of individual Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx events (called 'sparklets') in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-expressing tsA-201 cells loaded with 200 µM Rhod-2 using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> sparklets were recorded at a membrane potential of -80 mV in the presence of 20 mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup>; 10 mM EGTA was included in the patch pipette to confine the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signal to within ~1 µm of the point of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zenisek et al., 2003</xref>). A quantal analysis of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> sparklets revealed the presence of single-level (elementary) events with a mean amplitude of ~40 nM for both channels, in agreement with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navedo et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, consistent with our single channel data, we found that multi-quantal sparklets, which presumably result from the simultaneous opening of several Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, were more commonly observed in cells expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> than Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To determine whether channels in a cluster opened cooperatively or independently, we calculated the coupling coefficient (κ) among channels within a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> sparklet site by applying a coupled Markov-chain model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chung and Kennedy, 1996</xref>). Channels with κ &gt; 0.1 were considered coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Navedo et al., 2010</xref>). Using this approach, we found that the average κ value for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels was 0.21 ± 0.05 (n = 15) and 0.08 ± 0.04 (n = 12), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels are more likely to undergo cooperative gating, generating persistent and greater Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx than Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15744.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> but not Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels gate cooperatively to increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TIRF images of spontaneous Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> (top) and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> sparklets (bottom) at a holding potential of -80 mV in tsA-201 cells expressing the respective channels.

No evidence of staining was observed in the untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, n = 4). As our antibody cannot distinguish between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels isoforms, we expressed Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels separately and found that both channel subtypes form clusters of similar size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>). The mean areas of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel clusters were 2543 ± 50 nm<sup>2</sup> and 2119 ± 73 nm<sup>2</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>, n = 7). GSD images were acquired in the TIRF focal plane with a penetration depth of 130 nm.</p><p>To determine the number of channels within Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel clusters, we used step-photobleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>), of expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>) and tsA-201 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>). The rationale for using only Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-GFP channels in these studies is twofold. <italic>First</italic>, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and not Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels have the ability to undergo coupled activation. <italic>Second</italic>, the size of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> puncta (at least in tsA-201 cells) is similar. Thus, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> clusters are likely composed of the same number of channels. We identified and excited single Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel clusters in hippocampal neurons and tsA-201 cells using TIRF microscopy with a penetration depth of 130 nm. Although some intracellular signal could be collected, the use of TIRF restricts the signal mainly to the plasmalemmal fraction of the channels. After continuous photobleaching we counted the number of step-wise decreases in fluorescence intensity of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-GFP clusters. The majority (65%) of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> clusters underwent at least five stepwise decreases in fluorescence, with the remaining clusters showing fewer steps. A single photobleaching step was observed in only 4% of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> clusters. The mean number of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels per cluster determined through sequential photobleaching was 8 ± 1 (n = 1105 clusters, 18 cells) in hippocampal neurons, this number is consistent with the average cluster area calculated from our super-resolution data and is similar to that reported in two different studies on the L-type channel distribution in hippocampal neurons using immunogold-labeling with electron microscopy and high-resolution immunofluorescence techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Obermair et al., 2004</xref>).

Cells in the first group (controls) were dialyzed with a standard Cs<sup>+</sup>-based intracellular solution. Cells in the second group were dialyzed with a CaM-inhibitory peptide corresponding to a 15-aa fragment of the wild-type CaM-binding domain of myosin light chain kinase (MLCKp; 1 μM), which binds to CaM with high affinity (apparent dissociation constant, ~6 pM) in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torok and Trentham, 1994</xref>) and has been used by others as a competitive inhibitor of CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciampa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mercado et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Piper and Large, 2004</xref>). The third group consisted of cells co-expressing a dominant-negative mutant form of CaM (CaM<sub>1234</sub>) that does not bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> through its N- or C-terminal lobes. Dialysis of MLCKp or co-expression of CaM<sub>1234</sub> prevented Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VN and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VC fusion upon membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). Although MLCKp and CaM<sub>1234</sub> were equally effective in preventing Venus reconstitution, they had differential effects on I<sub>Ca</sub> inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Whereas the fraction of peak <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub> </italic>remaining at 300 ms (r<sub>300</sub>) in MLCKp-dialyzed cells (0.11 ± 0.03, n = 5) was similar to that of controls (0.14 ± 0.03, n = 5), the rate of inactivation of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> was slower in cells expressing CaM<sub>1234</sub>, as reflected in a much higher r<sub>300</sub> value (0.75 ± 0.05, n = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Our interpretation of these findings is that the CaM molecules involved in CDI are distinct from those involved in functional coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels. The results suggest that CaM molecules that mediate coupling could be both attached to the channels or recruited to the C-terminus during depolarization. This could explain why they are accessible to MLCKp blockade, unlike the CaM molecules that mediate CDI, which are tethered to the IQ domain of the channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pitt et al., 2001</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15744.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> coupling requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) TIRF images of Venus fluorescence reconstitution in the presence of 20 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in tsA-201 cells expressing (<bold>A</bold>) Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VN and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VC, (<bold>B</bold>) Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VN and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VC and dialyzed with the MLCK peptide (MLCKp), (<bold>C</bold>) Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VN, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VC and CaM<sub>1234</sub>. Fluorescence reconstitution was measured in response to depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of -80 mV to test potentials of -60 mV to +60 mV.

Although multi-quantal Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> sparklets were observed in control cells at rest (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, trace 2 left), sparklets in CaM<sub>1234</sub> cells prior to depolarization were long, single-quantal events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, traces 1 and 2, left). These long Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> sparklets were likely due to decreased CDI of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels in cells expressing CaM<sub>1234</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the overall Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> sparklet density was lower in cells expressing CaM<sub>1234</sub> than WT, suggesting that Apo-CaM does not increase Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel activity.</p><p>The coupling coefficient for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> sparklet sites in WT cells was 0.07 ± 06, whereas that in CaM<sub>1234</sub> cells was 0.02 ± 0.02 (n = 5). Membrane depolarization increased the coupling coefficient of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels within multi-quantal sparklet sites in control cells (0.18 ± 0.03, n = 5), but not in CaM<sub>1234</sub> cells (0.08 ± 0.05, n = 5). The opposing effects of CaM<sub>1234</sub> on Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> sparklets — longer, but decoupled — resulted in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> sparklet activity before depolarization that was similar in control (<italic>nP</italic><sub>S</sub> = 0.07 ± 0.05; p&gt;0.05) and CaM<sub>1234</sub> (<italic>nP</italic><sub>S</sub> = 0.12 ± 0.09) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). However, depolarization increased Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 sparklet activity nearly 7-fold in control cells, but had no effect on sparklet activity in CaM<sub>1234</sub> cells. Taken together with the <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> and Venus reconstitution results described above, these data strongly suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM is required for physical and functional Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-to-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel coupling.</p><p>Finally, to establish the molecular mechanism by which CaM might mediate these effects, we mutated different CaM-binding domains of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>. L-type channels have two binding sites for CaM in their C-terminus: the IQ domain (aa K1601-Q1621) and the pre-IQ domain (aa T1545-Q1587) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fallon et al., 2009</xref>). These sites have different affinities for CaM; whereas CaM is “pre-associated” and binds tightly to the IQ domain, the association of CaM with the pre-IQ domain is seemingly weaker and likely transient. To determine which of these sites is necessary for CaM-mediated Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> coupling, we generated two mutants of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VN and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VC channels. The first contained a single point mutation I1608E (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-I1608E) that disrupts CaM binding to the IQ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zuhlke et al., 1999</xref>), and the second contained a triple mutation (L1569A, V1572A, and W1577E; Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-AAE) that prevents CaM binding to the pre-IQ domain and anti-parallel coiled-coil arrangement of the pre-IQ domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fallon et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-I1608E channels showed a slower rate of inactivation than control and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-AAE channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), consistent with the lack of CDI.

These data suggest that binding of CaM to the pre-IQ domain is critically involved in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel coupling during membrane depolarization and further supports our previous assertion that the CaM pool involved in CDI is distinct from that involved in channel coupling.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15744.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The pre-IQ domain is required for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-mediated Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> coupling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> mutations introduced to disrupt CaM binding to the IQ (I1608E) or the pre-IQ (AAE) domain; the position of the mutated amino acid is shown in the sequence below. (<bold>B</bold>) Normalized <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> currents evoked by a 30-ms depolarizing pulse from a holding potential of -80 mV to a test potential of 0 mV in tsA-201 cells expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> (Control, black), Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>(I1608E) (blue), or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>(AAE) (red).

We began by recording spontaneous Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 sparklets from these cells. As in tsA-201 cells expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets in neurons were restricted to specific sites and had multi-quantal amplitudes resulting from the simultaneous opening and closing of multiple channels. The quantal unit of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was about 40 nM. The coupling coefficient (κ) of sparklet sites ranged from 0.14 to 0.33. The average κ value was 0.23 ± 0.04 (n = 6). Importantly, sparklet site activity was decreased by application of 300 nM of the dihydropyridine antagonist isradipine and completely eliminated when the concentration of the drug was increased to 10 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>).

Both Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are expressed in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hell et al., 1993</xref>) and although it is impossible to distinguish between these two L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels using either electrophysiological or pharmacological methods, it has been shown that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels have a reduced sensitivity to dihydropyridines compared to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lipscombe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu and Lipscombe, 2001</xref>).

This clustering has important physiological consequences for the short-splice variant of the channel (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>), enabling proximal channels to engage in cooperative gating, generating more persistent and greater Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Functional coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels is promoted by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and involves physical interactions via channel C-termini mediated by physical interactions between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM and the pre-IQ domain. We propose that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel coupling constitutes a novel feed-forward mechanism for the activation of these channels during membrane depolarization and provides an apparatus for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation of inward L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents. Further, these findings challenge a fundamental tenet of the classic Hodgkin-Huxley model of ion channel gating: that voltage-gated channels open and close independently.</p><p>Our data suggest that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel coupling is critically dependent on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CaM. During membrane depolarization, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels open. Ca<sup>2+</sup> flowing through these channels creates a local increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> — a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 sparklet — near the mouth and C-terminus of the channel where the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein CaM resides. Upon binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM associates with the pre-IQ domain of the channels, enabling the formation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> ‘couplets’. The observation of pre-IQ dimers of the structurally similar Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel undergoing coiled-coil interactions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fallon et al., 2009</xref>) and functionally couples to neighboring channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dixon et al., 2015</xref>) gives credence to this model. An interesting question suggested by this model is which CaM pool is involved in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel coupling? The observation that CaM<sub>1234 </sub>and MLCKp prevent Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> coupling would suggest that soluble as well as apo-CaM pre-associated with the channel could be involved in inducing physical channel-to-channel interactions. Because physically coupled Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels exhibit higher open probabilities, the overall activity of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels within a cluster would then depend on the number of channels forming dimers or the probability of the formation of higher order oligomers.

At hyperpolarized potentials (e.g., -80 mV), where [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and P<sub>o</sub> of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels is very low, the number of coupled channels is very low. Membrane depolarization increases the probability of stochastic (i.e., uncoupled) openings of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels. Ca<sup>2+</sup> flow through these channels creates a local increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (yellow gradient). This Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to apoCaM, which can be tethered to the pre-IQ domain or soluble in the cytoplasm. Once CaM is activated it promotes channel-channel interaction at the pre-IQ domain.

However, they failed to obtain any clustering when the channels were expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. The cause for this apparent lack of clustering of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in the frog egg are unclear, but suggest that clustering and functional coupling may be features of Ca<sub>V</sub>1 channels expressed only in mammalian cells, as we have shown here for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels.</p><p>Our results suggest that while close proximity is necessary, it is certainly not sufficient to allow channel interactions. Super-resolution imaging shows that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels form clusters of similar size along the surface membrane, but Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels, unlike Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels, do not undergo physical and functional coupling. Our experimental results with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>∆116 channels open the question as to whether there is another regulatory domain inside the long C-terminus, capable of blocking the interaction of CaM with the pre-IQ domain. These results also suggest that the mechanism allowing neighboring Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels to interact seems to be structural rather than organizational.</p><p>Although Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are generally classified as high-voltage activated channels, their lower activation range allows them to generate subthreshold depolarizations that support repetitive firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olson et al., 2005</xref>). This is in particular true for the short variants of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3, which are more voltage-sensitive than Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tan et al., 2011</xref>). Our results reveal a new and striking characteristic of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels: they can coordinate their openings through a physical interaction to facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry at low membrane potentials. In addition, the fact that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are clustered in dendritic spines in these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jenkins et al., 2010</xref>) raises the possibility that their coordinated gating and boosting of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry may have a significant effect on synaptic plasticity.</p><p>Subthreshold activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels is also a key component of pacemaking and oscillatory behavior in neurons in the brain, such as dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, the principal neurons affected in Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Puopolo et al., 2007</xref>). In this context, it is tempting to speculate that alterations in the cooperative gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> might contribute to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> excitotoxicity observed in multiple pathological conditions, including Parkinson’s neurodegeneration. Future studies should examine the extent to which the cooperative gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels can affect the Ca<sup>2+</sup> load in neurons.</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven physical interactions among clustered Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels lead to cooperative gating of these channels and the enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that underlies the self-sustained firing of hippocampal neurons. It is anticipated that future studies may reveal that cooperative Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel gating plays an important role in pathological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, spasticity, and memory loss, as well as in physiological functions as diverse as hearing and the modulation of heart rate, where Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels play a key role.</p><p>Finally, our findings point to a novel, general mechanism for the dynamic modulation of ionic currents through L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. For example, in SA node cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels is a key feature in the generation of pacemaker activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mangoni et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Platzer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Striessnig et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, it has been shown in a recent paper that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels play a critical role in controlling pacemaker activity in SAN cells through the activation of RyR and the triggering of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Torrente et al., 2016</xref>). The present results suggest a potential new mechanism for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent control of pacing in these cells. Accordingly, spontaneous junctional SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events could induce multimerization of nearby Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>, which, once fused, could produce persistent inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents that increase the number of RyR activated, thereby driving SA node cells closer to the threshold for action potential generation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructs and tsA-201 cell transfection</title><p>The pcDNA clones of the rat Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 isoforms were obtained from Addgene.

Successful transfection was corroborated by detection of tRFP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were recorded using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique in voltage-clamp mode. Currents were sampled at a frequency of 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier. During the experiments, tsA-201 cells were superfused with a solution containing 5 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 140 mM N-methyl-D-glucamine, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> or 2 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub>, depending on the experiment. pH was adjusted to 7.4 with HCl. For the experiments using 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, the osmolarity was adjusted by decreasing the concentration of NMDG to 113 mM. Borosilicate patch pipettes with resistances of 3–6 MΩ were filled with an internal solution containing 87 mM cesium aspartate (CsAsp), 20 mM CsCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA and 5 mM MgATP, adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. A voltage offset of 10 mV, attributable to the liquid junction potential of these solutions, was corrected offline. Current–voltage relationships were obtained by subjecting cells to a series of 300-ms depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of -80 mV to test potentials ranging from -70 to +50 mV. The voltage dependence of channel activation (G/G<sub>max</sub>) was obtained from the resultant currents by converting them to conductances using the equation, G = <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>/(test pulse potential – reversal potential of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>); normalized G/G<sub>max</sub> was plotted as a function of test potential. We found that the reversal potential for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> (+51 ± 4 mV) and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> (+54 ± 3 mV) currents in the presence of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> were not significantly different (p=0.49). The same was true with 2 mM Ba<sup>2+</sup> in the bath (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> = +60 ± 5 mV; Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> = +65 ± 2 mV; p=0.31). Thus, while E<sub>rev</sub> is similar in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels with the same permeating ion, the reversal potential of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents through these channels differ. In our patch clamp experiments in which the external solution was switched from Ba<sup>2+</sup> to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 2-min intervals were inserted between the onset of the whole cell configuration to the first pulse and again after switching the external solution, to rule out any effect of the run-up of the <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tiaho et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Single-channel currents (<italic>i<sub>Ca</sub></italic>) were recorded from tsA-201 using the cell-attached configuration. Cells were superfused with a high K<sup>+</sup> solution to fix the membrane potential at ∼0 mV. The bathing solution had the following composition: 145 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES and 10 mM glucose; pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH. Pipettes were filled with a solution containing 10 mM HEPES and either 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> or 20 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub>; pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. The dihydropyridine agonist BayK-8644 (500 nM) was included in the pipette solution to promote longer channel open times. A voltage-step protocol from a holding potential of −80 mV to a depolarized potential of −30 mV was used to elicit currents. The single-channel event-detection algorithm of pClamp 10.2 was used to measure single-channel opening amplitudes. We generated all-points histograms from our cell-attached patch-clamp recordings. These histograms were fit using Prism 5.0a software (GraphPad software Inc. La Jolla, CA) with a multi-Gaussian function that included a quantal (<italic>q</italic>; i.e., elementary current) parameter using the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mstyle><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>N</italic> is the number of events, <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are constants, <italic>i<sub>Ca</sub></italic> is the amplitude of the current measured and <italic>q</italic> is the quantal elementary current of the channel.</p><p>Spontaneous discharge of cultured hippocampal neurons was recorded in current-clamp mode using the perforated-patch configuration. Neurons were superfused with a solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM Na-pyruvate, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Borosilicate patch pipettes with resistances of 3–6 MΩ were filled with an internal solution containing 5 mM NaCl, 140 mM KCl, 15 mM HEPES and 7 mM MgATP, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH; 60 μM amphotericin B was added to the solution before starting the recording. Series resistances lower than 30 MΩ were obtained within 5 min of seal formation. The sampling frequency was 10 kHz filtered at 2 kHz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunofluorescence and super-resolution microscopy</title><p>For immunostaining Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 in tsA-201 cells or hippocampal neurons, cells were fixed by incubating in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 15 min. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with 50 mM glycine at 4ºC for 10 min (aldehyde reduction), washed again with PBS, and blocked by incubating with 20% SEA BLOCK (Thermo Scientific) and 0.25% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS (blocking buffer) for 1 hr. The cells were incubated overnight at 4ºC with primary antibodies recognizing the residues 809 to 825 located at the intracellular II-III loop of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel (DNKVTIDDYQEEAEDKD, rabbit; provided by Drs. William Catterall and Ruth Westenbroek) and the neuronal marker MAP2 (mouse; Abcam), diluted in blocking buffer to a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Cells were then washed with PBS, incubated for 1 hr with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (2 µg/ml; Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated chicken anti-mouse (2 µg/ml; Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies, and washed again with PBS. Our antibody was designed to bind to the intracellular loop linking the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> membrane domains of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3. It cannot distinguish between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>.</p><p>For super-resolution microscopy, coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with a round cavity using MEA-GLOX imaging buffer (NeoLab Migge Laborbedarf-Vertriebs GmbH, Germany) and sealed with Twinsil (Picodent, Germany). The imaging buffer contained 10 mM MEA, 0.56 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 34 μg/ml catalase, and 10% w/v glucose in TN buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM NaCl).</p><p>A super resolution ground-state depletion system (SR-GSD, Leica) based on stochastic single-molecule localization was used to generate super-resolution images of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 in hippocampal neurons and tsA-201 cells. The Leica SR-GSD system was equipped with high-power lasers (488 nm, 1.4 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>; 532 nm, 2.1 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>; 642 nm, 2.1 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>) and an additional 30 mW, 405 nm laser. Images were obtained using a 160× HCX Plan-Apochromat (NA 1.43) oil-immersion lens and an EMCCD camera (iXon3 897; Andor Technology). For all experiments, the camera was running in frame-transfer mode at a frame rate of 100 Hz (10 ms exposure time). Fluorescence was detected through Leica high-power TIRF filter cubes (488 HP-T, 532 HP-T, 642 HP-T) with emission band-pass filters of 505–605 nm, 550–650 nm, and 660–760 nm.</p><p>Super-resolution localization images of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel distribution were reconstructed using the coordinates of centroids obtained by fitting single-molecule fluorescence signals with a 2D Gaussian function using LASAF software (Leica). A total of 50,000–100,000 images were used to construct the images. The localization accuracy of the system is limited by the statistical noise of photon counting. Thus, assuming the point-spread functions are Gaussian, the precision of localization is proportional to DLR/√N, where DLR is the diffraction-limited resolution of a fluorophore and N is the average number of detected photons per switching event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dempsey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Folling et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, we estimated a lateral localization accuracy of 16 nm for Alexa 647 (~1900 detected photons per switching cycle). Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 cluster size was determined using binary masks of the images in ImageJ software (NIH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Step-wise photobleaching</title><p>The number of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels in clusters along the surface membrane was estimated using a single-molecule bleaching approach similar to that described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ulbrich and Isacoff (2007)</xref>. Briefly, TIRF images of tsA-201 or hippocampal neurons expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels fused to the monomeric GFP were acquired using our Leica GSD microscope in TIRF mode. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min prior to the acquisition. Images were acquired using an oil immersion 160x objective (NA 1.43) and an Andor iXON EMCCD camera. GFP was excited with a 488 nm laser and image stacks of 2000 frames were acquired at 30 Hz. During analysis, the first 5 images of the stack were averaged and a rolling-ball background subtraction was applied using ImageJ (NIH). This image was then low-pass filtered with a 2 pixel cut-off and high-pass filtered with a 5 pixel cut-off. Thresholding was then applied to identify connected regions of pixels that were above threshold. The ImageJ plugin ‘Time Series Analyzer v2.0’ was used to select 4x4 pixel ROIs, centered on the peak pixel in each spot. These ROIs were used to plot Z-axis intensity profiles (where z is time) of the entire image stack to manually detect the bleaching steps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Split Venus bi-molecular fluorescence complementation</title><p>The spontaneous interaction between the C-terminus of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels was assessed using the split Venus system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shyu et al., 2006</xref>). In this approach, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels were fused to either the VN fragments (N<sub>1–154</sub>) or the VC fragment (C<sub>155–238</sub>) of the Venus fluorescent protein. The Venus protein emits fluorescence only when the two fragments are close enough to interact and reconstitute the whole protein, providing a measure of the proximity between the C-terminus of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> -VN and/or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> -VC constructs were expressed at a 1:1 ratio in hippocampal neurons; tRFP fluorescence was used as an indicator of successful transfection. Confocal images were acquired with a Fluoview FV1000 microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) equipped with a UPlanS-Apochromat 60× (NA 1.2) water-immersion objective. The Venus protein was excited using a 488 nm laser line. The calcium dependence of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 spontaneous interactions was studied in tsA-201 cells expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> -VC alone or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> -VN and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> -VC in a 1:1 ratio. Using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, cells were depolarized from a holding voltage of -80 mV to test potentials ranging from -60 to +60 mV, administered as 9-s pulses. Maturation of newly reconstituted Venus protein takes some time, hence the long depolarizing pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagai et al., 2002</xref>). Images were acquired at a frequency of 100 Hz during each depolarizing pulse using a through-the-lens TIRF microscope built around an inverted microscope (IX-70; Olympus) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat (60×; NA 1.49) oil-immersion lens (Olympus) and an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (iXON; Andor Technology, UK). The last 10 images of each stack were averaged, and total fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH). The images were pseudo-colored using the ‘red hot’ lookup table in ImageJ. F<sub>0</sub> was calculated by dividing the total fluorescence for each voltage by the initial fluorescence at -80 mV. The change in F/F<sub>0</sub> was plotted against voltage and compared to G/G<sub>max</sub> curves constructed as described in the electrophysiology section. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of Venus reconstitution was tested in cells bathed in an external solution containing 20 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> or 2 mM Ba<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> sparklet imaging and analysis</title><p>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> sparklets were recorded using the TIRF microscopy system described above.

The much slower Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer EGTA (10 mM) was included with the relatively fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, Rhod-2, to restrict Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to the vicinity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry source.

Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-CIBN and/or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-CRY2 constructs were expressed in a 1:1 ratio in hippocampal neurons. Forty-eight hours after transfection, spontaneous action potential firing was recorded in current-clamp mode. One minute after initiating recordings, neurons were exposed to a 30-s blue light pulse to induce dimerization, and the changes in the firing pattern were measured. In tsA-201 cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were recorded before and after light illumination in response to a 20-ms depolarizing pulse at +10 mV from a holding potential of -80 mV.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor and reviewing editor) and two reviewers: Jorg Stressing and Henry Colecraft. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The required revisions should be easily accomplished and are detailed in the individual reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have done a remarkable job in revising their manuscript. There are only a few issues remaining:</p><p>Introduction: As mentioned in my previous comments, the Chan et al. paper should not be cited in the context of pacemaking in dopamine neurons because their role for pacemaking as described in this paper has been corrected in a second paper by the same authors. In the first paragraph it therefore would make sense to replace the Chan et al. reference by their Guzman et al., 2009 reference. In the third paragraph &quot;drive the&quot; should be replaced by &quot;support&quot;. Also here the Chan reference should be replaced by Guzman.</p><p>In the third paragraph of the Introduction and in the first paragraph of the subsection “Coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels increases the firing rate of hippocampal neurons”: The estimated fraction of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in hippocampal neurons is 20%: total 22.3% of current; 4.4% remaining in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockout (Moosmang paper).</p><p>In the second paragraph of the subsection “A Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanism mediates facilitation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>, but not Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>, channels”: The authors should somehow make clear what leads them to conclude opening of 2 and more channels.

Which one is correct?</p><p>4) Results: &quot;We found that, with 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the bathing solution, cells expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>Δ116 channels failed to reconstitute Venus fluorescence, similar to what we observed for the full length Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D-8G</xref>).&quot;</p><p>Experiment should be done with 20 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to mimic conditions used for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>. The failure to observe Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>Δ116 reconstitution of Venus fluorescence could be simply due to the 10-fold less extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> used in this experiment. If so, this would change the conclusion reached for this experiment.</p><p>5) Discussion: &quot;An intriguing observation in our study is that physical Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel coupling (assessed by Venus reconstitution) and the normalized conductance of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> (i.e., G/G<sub>max</sub>) have similar voltage dependencies. We propose that this is a consequence of two factors. First, Venus fluorescence (i.e., reconstitution) and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> conductance have similar sigmoidal relationships suggesting that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> coupling is primarily determined by the open probability of these channels. This is consistent with our model, as the extent of Venus reconstitution depends on the local calcium concentration produced by the coordinated opening of clustered channels and less on magnitude of the flux through individual channels. The second factor contributing to the shared voltage dependencies is the irreversible nature of the Venus reconstitution, resulting in an increased number of fluorescent proteins with each successive depolarization as the open probability of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels increases.&quot;</p><p>These lines should be removed as they represent an over-interpretation of the data. As the authors note in their second point, the sigmoidal nature of the Venus reconstitution dependence on voltage most likely reflects the irreversible nature of the Venus reconstitution such that fluorescence accumulates with successive depolarizations. I suspect if the experiments were done in reverse (i.e., test pulses stepping down from +60 mV to -60 mV) that the relationship would also show a sigmoidal relationship but with the fluorescence lower at the higher voltages where channel Po is higher. This thought experiment suggests the idea that &quot;…Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> coupling is primarily determined by the open probability of these channels…&quot; is an oversimplification.</p><p>6) Please include the procedures for single-channel recordings in the Methods. The single channel traces appear to have quite long openings (particularly for the Ba<sup>2+</sup> traces; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This physical coupling leads to co-operative opening of the channels and facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Here they extend this analyses to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels and observe the same phenomenon in a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 short but not Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 long splice variant. They further suggest that this phenomenon occurs and contributes to excitability in hippocampal neurons.</p><p>The work is impressive in the amount of different techniques and experiments the authors bring to bear on the question at hand. If correct, this would certainly be an important contribution to the literature on gating mechanisms and physiological regulation of L-type channels. However, in its current form the work has a number of inconsistencies and issues with interpretation of the data that significantly weaken the strength of the overall conclusions. Given that this work adheres closely to previously published work on Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 it is my opinion that the presentation here should go substantially beyond the phenomenology of the observation and provide a more rigorous mechanism for the effect.</p><p>1) Single channel traces with Ca<sup>2+</sup> as charge carrier show no signature of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation despite this being so prominent in whole-cell currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-1D</xref>). Why is this? The authors should provide ensemble averages of the single channel data to increase confidence that the unitary currents actually correspond to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3.</p><p>2) A central point of the paper is that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3s but not Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> displays the phenomenon of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced channel coupling and facilitation. Ultimately, this is attributed the distal C-terminus competing away CaM binding to the channel. However, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> used in the paper demonstrates quite a robust CDI (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>), indicating that CaM is bound to the channel. The comparable CDI between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3s and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> observed in the paper is likely due to the use of the rat clones which are known to display similar CDI at ambient CaM concentrations (Yang et al., 2006, J. Neurosci. 26:10677-89). This is because the rat Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> has a point mutation relative to the human clone, which weakens its affinity for the CaM-binding domain such that ambient CaM is sufficient to (by competition) access its site on the channel (Liu et al., 2010, Nature, 463:968-973). Given this, it is unclear why Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> would lack the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation described here. At the very least the interpretation that this due to CaM being excluded from these channels is not supported?</p><p>3) What is the kinetics of the facilitation? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref> suggest it occurs immediately upon channel activation within 1 ms. This seems very fast for the inter-molecular binding mechanism proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. Also, how fast does the system reset after closing the channel?</p><p>4) Does CaM<sub>1234</sub> prevent the facilitation observed with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3s in whole-cell currents (i.e. what does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref> look like with CaM<sub>1234</sub>)?</p><p>5) Light-induced dimerization experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Seems to me that these experiments should be done with Ba<sup>2+</sup> and not Ca<sup>2+</sup> as charge carrier? If idea is the dimerization is sufficient to induce facilitation, having Ca<sup>2+</sup> also present complicates the interpretation.</p><p>6) What is the CaM that actually produces the proposed channel coupling? The ability of CaM<sub>1234</sub> to prevent facilitation would suggest that apoCaM preassociated with the channel is responsible. However, the effectiveness of MLCKp suggests a soluble CaM. If both of these are true then it is inconsistent with the simple model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. The authors need to provide a model that fits all the facts they present.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: Is the increase in firing rate decreased by L-type channel antagonists?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In their manuscript, Moreno and colleagues extend their previous finding (published in <italic>eLife</italic>) of cooperative gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to structurally and functionally highly related Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels. As for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 in cardiomyocytes they made a big effort in using a battery of experimental paradigms to demonstrate calmodulin-dependent physical coupling leading to higher open probabilities in tsA-201 cells and hippocampal neurons. Their findings contrast with the current view of independent gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>-channels. By discovering a novel modulatory mechanism this paper is potentially very important to advance calcium channel research.</p><p>The paper is clearly written, well-illustrated and of appropriate length.</p><p>Two major points need to be considered to fully support the conclusions drawn from the experiments presented:</p><p>1) The authors describe the use of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 alpha1 rat constructs Addgene plasmid 26577 (long) and 26576 (short). This selection is very unfortunate. Both constructs contain a number of mutations originally introduced by cloning the full-length alpha1-subunits. Addgene (meanwhile?) also provides the corrected versions (plasmids 49332 and 49333).</p><p>Unfortunately, the mutations are not functionally silent. The Yue group (Liu et al. Cell, 2010) reported that one of the mutations (Val to Ala in ICDI) disrupts the function of a distal modulatory domain (ICDI, also termed DCRD; a finding later confirmed by others: Huang et al. Mol Pharmacol, 2013; Lieb et al., Biophys J 2014). Since this domain competitively tunes the interaction of calmodulin with its upstream binding sites (pre-IQ, IQ) the long mutant Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel behaves functionally more like short splice variants (that lack ICDI due to splicing), with higher CDI and higher open probability, properties that are crucial for the interpretation of the author's data. The authors should have been aware of this because the difference between Ca<sup>2+</sup> current inactivation of their Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3L and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3delta116 was much smaller than expected between rat (and human) Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> variants (shown in many publications e.g. by the groups of Yue, Soong, and Striessnig).</p><p>To get around this problem, at least some key experiments affected by the use of mutant constructs should be repeated with their corrected counterparts, in particular those involving Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals generated by the long isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This is justified due to the lower open probability and less pronounced CDI expected for the corrected (wildtype) rat Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> construct. Although there are also good arguments to repeat all other experiments with the correct constructs, the authors should be able to provide convincing arguments that this is not necessary, e.g. by discussing that CDI does not seem to be a determinant for coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>2) Evidence for the specificity of staining of endogenous Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 alpha1 subunits in hippocampal neurons should be provided. So far no Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 antibody staining has been reported in hippocampal neurons or brain sections that was shown to be absent in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 knockout controls. I would therefore not be surprised if this is also true for their antibody. If there is no evidence for such convincing specificity, the authors should either remove data showing staining of native channels or clearly state this caveat in their paper. Obviously, they cannot be blamed for the fact that no anti-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 antibody with proven specificity exists. In any case, they should show the typical somatodendritic clusters also on spines of their Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 constructs transfected in hippocampal cultures using high resolution light microscopy as has been shown in previous work (e.g. Jenkins et al., J Neurosci, 2010).</p><p>3) In the subsection “Coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels increases the firing rate of hippocampal neurons”: According to Moosmang et al. (2005; PMID: 16251435), Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 current components are minimal in hippocampal neurons and L-type currents seem to comprise only a small fraction of total voltage-gated calcium current. So how do the authors know their sparklets are produced by L-type currents? If so, they should vanish after treatment with a dihydropyridine Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker. This important control appears to be missing in the manuscript. They should also consider that there is no way to distinguish between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 sparklets (not even by membrane voltage as stated in their manuscript).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15744.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p> <italic>The authors have done a remarkable job in revising their manuscript.

Briefly, we generated all-points histograms from our cell-attached patch-clamp recordings. These histograms were fit with a multi-Gaussian function that included a quantal (<italic>q;</italic> i.e., elementary current) parameter. This equation is included in the Methods section (subsection “Electrophysiology”) and the parameters used are included in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>In the presence of 20 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, our analysis revealed that the amplitude of the elementary current (i.e., <italic>q</italic>) was -0.48 ± 0.07 pA and -0.49 ± 0.01 pA for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels at -30 mV, respectively. Our <italic>q<sub>Ca</sub></italic> is similar to previously reported values (Guia et al., 2001). This is now clarified in the Results.

However, we did not observe intermediate peaks between the current levels expected for sets of fully conducting channels. Thus, we concluded that the values reported correspond to the quantal values of the unitary current rather than to any sub-conductance state and that the double and multiple amplitudes of the currents correspond to the simultaneous opening of 2 or more channels.</p><p><italic>Also: &quot;the frequency of currents…is higher…(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C-F</xref>)”.

In this revision, we improved the fit of the multi-Gaussian function to the new Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> data (i.e., better goodness of fit). Although this analysis is consistent with the view that the frequency of currents resulting from the simultaneous opening of 2 or more channels is higher for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> than Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels, we believe that additional work is necessary to carefully investigate the degree of coupling between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels. Thus, as suggested by the reviewers, we scaled back the conclusions of these experiments to the following:</p><p>“These data suggest that the difference observed in the macroscopic currents between the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels is not due to differences in unitary currents”.</p><p><italic>In the third paragraph of the subsection “A Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanism mediates facilitation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>, but not Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>, channels”: &quot;We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions entering the cell through the channels increased the NPo nearly 1.5-fold for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels&quot;.

L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents typically reach their run-up peak after 2 minutes (Tiaho et al., 1993). In the patch-clamp experiments in which the external solution was switched from Ba<sup>2+</sup> to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 2-minute intervals were inserted between the onset of the whole cell configuration to the first pulse and again after switching the external solution to rule out any effect of the run-up of the <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>.

The authors should either provide more quantitative information to back up this statement or remove it.</italic> </p><p>Please see our response above (“We thank Reviewers 1 and 2 for pointing this out […]).</p><p><italic>2) Results: &quot;This assumption is reasonable, as we found no significant difference in the activation time constants for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> currents that were 1.60 ± 0.22 and 1.17 ± 0.051 ms (-10 mv), respectively.&quot; Please provide n and P values for the statistical analyses.</italic> </p><p>We had a sample size of 6 for each channel in these experiments. The <italic>p</italic> value was 0.112. This information has been added to the text (subsection “A Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanism mediates facilitation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>, but not Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>, channels”, last paragraph).</p><p> <italic>3) Sparklet data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> have not changed from previous version, yet now they are labeled as being recorded at -80 mV whereas the original version had them recorded at -70 mV. Which one is correct?</italic> We thank the reviewer for the comment. -80 mV is the correct voltage. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have corrected the values for a liquid junction potential offset of 10 mV. On the previous version, we had not done so which is why all the sparklet figures were labeled with -70 mV. As all of the electrophysiology data presented were corrected for the LJP, we decided to correct sparklet data as well.</p><p><italic>4) Results: &quot;We found that, with 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the bathing solution, cells expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>Δ116 channels failed to reconstitute Venus fluorescence, similar to what we observed for the full length Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D-8G</xref>).&quot; Experiment should be done with 20 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to mimic conditions used for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and 6. The failure to observe Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>Δ116 reconstitution of Venus fluorescence could be simply due to the 10-fold less extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> used in this experiment. If so, this would change the conclusion reached for this experiment.</italic> The reviewer raises an important point about the possibility that increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 20 mM could induce Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>Δ116 coupling. We had performed the experiments using 20 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> previously and did not observe any increase in Venus reconstitution for the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>Δ116.</p><p>The reason we did not include those data in the revised manuscript is because if removing the C116 fragment were to generate a channel capable of coupling, we should be able to discern Venus reconstitution even at 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as was true for the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nonetheless, for clarity we now added a new supplemental figure to the revised manuscript displaying these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). The new Figure is referred to in the last paragraph of the subsection “Deletion of DCRD is not sufficient to allow coupling in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels”.</p><p><italic>5) Discussion: &quot;An intriguing observation in our study is that physical Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel coupling (assessed by Venus reconstitution) and the normalized conductance of I<sub>Ca</sub> (i.e., G/G<sub>max</sub>) have similar voltage dependencies. We propose that this is a consequence of two factors. First, Venus fluorescence (i.e., reconstitution) and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> conductance have similar sigmoidal relationships suggesting that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> coupling is primarily determined by the open probability of these channels. This is consistent with our model, as the extent of Venus reconstitution depends on the local calcium concentration produced by the coordinated opening of clustered channels and less on magnitude of the flux through individual channels. The second factor contributing to the shared voltage dependencies is the irreversible nature of the Venus reconstitution, resulting in an increased number of fluorescent proteins with each successive depolarization as the open probability of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels increases.&quot; These lines should be removed as they represent an over-interpretation of the data. As the authors note in their second point, the sigmoidal nature of the Venus reconstitution dependence on voltage most likely reflects the irreversible nature of the Venus reconstitution such that fluorescence accumulates with successive depolarizations. I suspect if the experiments were done in reverse (i.e., test pulses stepping down from +60 mV to -60 mV) that the relationship would also show a sigmoidal relationship but with the fluorescence lower at the higher voltages where channel Po is higher. This thought experiment suggests the idea that &quot;…Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> coupling is primarily determined by the open probability of these channels…&quot; is an oversimplification.</italic> We agree that the sigmoidal nature of the Venus reconstitution dependence on voltage is likely to be a consequence of the irreversibility of Venus reconstitution as we have stated. Accordingly, we removed the discussion of the relationship between physical Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel coupling and the <italic>P<sub>o</sub></italic> of clustered channels. We have also moved our explanation of Venus reconstitution irreversibility to the Results section, since we consider this information essential in following the inferences we draw from our data (subsection “Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels couple under membrane depolarization in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) Please include the procedures for single-channel recordings in the Methods. The single channel traces appear to have quite long openings (particularly for the Ba<sup>2+</sup> traces; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Was an L-type channel agonist included for these experiments? If so this should be explicitly stated in the Methods.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for alerting us to this omission. The following description of our single-channel recording protocol has been added to the revised Methods section:</p><p>“Single-channel currents (<italic>i<sub>Ca</sub></italic>) were recorded from tsA-201 using the cell-attached configuration. Cells were superfused with a high K<sup>+</sup> solution to fix the membrane potential at ∼0 mV. […] The single-channel event-detection algorithm of pClamp 10.2 was used to measure single-channel opening amplitudes and the all-points histograms were constructed using Prism 5.0a software (GraphPad software Inc. La Jolla, CA)”</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the previous round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for their thoughtful comments on our work and for giving us the opportunity to submit a revised version of the manuscript. Indeed, we are particularly grateful for alerting us to the mutations contained in the plasmids we used to generate the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels that we were completely unaware of. As a consequence, we have repeated virtually all of our experiments and analyses using the corrected versions of the channels. The new manuscript contains a total of 16 new sets of experiments that address the reviewers comments.</p><p>The paper is re-submitted nearly nine months after receiving the first round of reviews because the list of necessary experiments was long. That said, we believe the new data were important and think that they have significantly strengthened and improved the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p> <italic>1) Single channel traces with Ca<sup>2+</sup> as charge carrier show no signature of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation despite this being so prominent in whole-cell currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-1D</xref>). Why is this? The authors should provide ensemble averages of the single channel data to increase confidence that the unitary currents actually correspond to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3.</italic> We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point. We have added new single channel recordings from cells expressing the corrected forms of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>). As requested, we also generated ensemble currents from these recordings (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> currents were rapidly activated by depolarization and then inactivated likely due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage-dependent mechanisms.</p><p><italic>2) A central point of the paper is that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3s but not Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> displays the phenomenon of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced channel coupling and facilitation. Ultimately, this is attributed the distal C-terminus competing away CaM binding to the channel. However, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> used in the paper demonstrates quite a robust CDI (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>), indicating that CaM is bound to the channel. The comparable CDI between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3s and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> observed in the paper is likely due to the use of the rat clones which are known to display similar CDI at ambient CaM concentrations (Yang et al., 2006, J. Neurosci. 26:10677-89). This is because the rat Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> has a point mutation relative to the human clone, which weakens its affinity for the CaM-binding domain such that ambient CaM is sufficient to (by competition) access its site on the channel (Liu et al., 2010, Nature, 463:968-973). Given this, it is unclear why Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> would lack the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation described here. At the very least the interpretation that this due to CaM being excluded from these channels is not supported?</italic> We thank Reviewers 1 and 2 for noting that using the mutated Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> could confound the central conclusion of our study. As requested, we repeated all our experiments using the corrected version of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channel to be completely sure that the lack of coupling of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> was not an effect of the mutations contained in the construct. Virtually all the results were identical to what we have seen with the previous construct containing the substitution of V by A in position 2075 (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L(V2075A)</sub>) and they are summarized below:</p><p>a) As expected, the currents produced by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels inactivated at a slower rate and had a smaller CDI when compared to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>);</p><p>b) Macroscopic Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> currents were not enhanced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1H – 1J</xref>);</p><p>c) Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels showed a lower sparklet coupling coefficient compared to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>. (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>);</p><p>d) When expressed in tsA-201 cells, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels organized in clusters with a similar average size area compared to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>);</p><p>e) The Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels did not exhibit any current facilitation when they were forced to couple using the light-activated cryptochrome system (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B and 4C</xref>);</p><p>f) When fused to the split Venus system, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels failed to reconstitute Venus fluorescence after depolarization (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</p><p>The only difference observed between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and the previously used Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L(V2075A)</sub> was that, after removing the DCRD domain, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>∆116 channels were still unable to couple (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The answer to the question of why the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L(V2075A)</sub> is able to couple when the DCRD is removed is still unclear to us. Although interesting, the study of the implication of this difference in the molecular mechanisms by which the channel coupling is translated to longer channel openings is a topic that we will pursue in future studies.</p><p>For the present study, we restricted our discussion to the fact that as Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>∆116 channels still have a C-terminus (396 aa) that is considerably longer than that of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels, it is possible that another domain inside this region might be responsible for occluding the binding of CaM to the pre-IQ domain, and preventing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>∆116 channel coupling. This discussion was added in the last paragraph of the subsection “Deletion of DCRD is not sufficient to allow coupling in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels”.</p><p>In addition, we performed experiments with the corrected version of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> where a single point substitution of a glycine by a serine at position 244 is corrected. We found that both channels have similar voltage-dependencies of activation and rate of activation (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and 2B</xref>). The corrected Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels were also capable of undergoing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dimerization (split Venus reconstitution) and functional coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>–2F). On the basis of these data, we concluded that the G244S substitution in the plasmid #26576 is functionally silent with respect to activation, rate of activation as well as the ability of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels to undergo allosteric interactions. Therefore, we decided to clarify in the Methods section of the manuscript (subsection “Plasmid constructs and tsA-201 cell transfection”), that both plasmids were used to express and design the functional Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> constructs reported in this study.</p><p><italic>3) What is the kinetics of the facilitation? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref> suggest it occurs immediately upon channel activation within 1 ms. This seems very fast for the inter-molecular binding mechanism proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. Also, how fast does the system reset after closing the channel?</italic> We certainly agree with the reviewer that determining the kinetics of the coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels is an interesting question. We have shown recently for the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels that it can be done using FRET (Dixon et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2015). However, we have not yet done those experiments for the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels and would like to defer that work for inclusion in our subsequent study.</p><p><italic>4) Does CaM<sub>1234</sub> prevent the facilitation observed with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3s in whole-cell currents (i.e. what does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref> look like with CaM<sub>1234</sub>)?</italic> This is an interesting question. We presented evidence showing that CaM<sub>1234</sub> prevents the increase in coupling coefficient and the increase in sparklet activity (n<italic>Ps</italic>) in response to depolarization, compared to the 7-fold increase seen in control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G – 6I</xref>). We consider that the reduction of the n<italic>Ps</italic> is a good piece of evidence that CaM<sub>1234</sub> prevents the coupling and the facilitation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels.</p><p><italic>5) Light-induced dimerization experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Seems to me that these experiments should be done with Ba<sup>2+</sup> and not Ca<sup>2+</sup> as charge carrier? If idea is the dimerization is sufficient to induce facilitation, having Ca<sup>2+</sup> also present complicates the interpretation.</italic> We appreciate the reviewer's comment, as it made us cognizant of the fact that the rationale for these experiments and their interpretation were not clearly described in the original version of the manuscript. We now clarify in the subsection “Physical interaction between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels induces <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> facilitation”, that we do not believe dimerization itself is sufficient to induce facilitation. We have adduced many lines of evidence showing that Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CaM are critically required for physical and functional channel coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels. Thus we propose that fusing adjoined Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels at the tip of their C-termini with the CIBN-CRY2 system increases the probability of functional coupling, but is not likely sufficient to induce functional channel coupling.</p><p><italic>6) What is the CaM that actually produces the proposed channel coupling? The ability of CaM<sub>1234</sub> to prevent facilitation would suggest that apoCaM preassociated with the channel is responsible. However, the effectiveness of MLCKp suggests a soluble CaM. If both of these are true then it is inconsistent with the simple model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. The authors need to provide a model that fits all the facts they present.</italic> Thanks for the suggestion to make a more complete model. Our results suggest that both tethered and soluble apoCaM bind the pre-IQ domain to induce channel coupling. We modified the model accordingly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) and stated both possibilities in the figure legend and in the manuscript (subsection “Functional Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-to-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel coupling is mediated by physical interactions between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM and the pre-IQ domain“, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: Is the increase in firing rate decreased by L-type channel antagonists?</italic> </p><p>Determining the effect of L-type antagonists in the increase in firing rate is a good suggestion. We performed additional experiments to answer this question. The application of 10 μM nifedipine in hippocampal neurons, expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S-</sub>CIBN/CRY2, not only eliminated the light-induced increase in firing rate but decreased significantly the spontaneous firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and 10C</xref>). This highlights the importance of low-voltage-activated L-type channels in the firing pattern of hippocampal neurons.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p> <italic>Two major points need to be considered to fully support the conclusions drawn from the experiments presented: 1) The authors describe the use of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 alpha1 rat constructs Addgene plasmid 26577 (long) and 26576 (short). This selection is very unfortunate. Both constructs contain a number of mutations originally introduced by cloning the full-length alpha1-subunits. Addgene (meanwhile?) also provides the corrected versions (plasmids 49332 and 49333).</italic> </p><p> <italic>Unfortunately, the mutations are not functionally silent. The Yue group (Liu et al. Cell, 2010) reported that one of the mutations (Val to Ala in ICDI) disrupts the function of a distal modulatory domain (ICDI, also termed DCRD; a finding later confirmed by others: Huang et al. Mol Pharmacol, 2013; Lieb et al., Biophys J 2014). Since this domain competitively tunes the interaction of calmodulin with its upstream binding sites (pre-IQ, IQ) the long mutant Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel behaves functionally more like short splice variants (that lack ICDI due to splicing), with higher CDI and higher open probability, properties that are crucial for the interpretation of the author's data. The authors should have been aware of this because the difference between Ca<sup>2+</sup> current inactivation of their Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3delta116 was much smaller than expected between rat (and human) Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> variants (shown in many publications e.g. by the groups of Yue, Soong, and Striessnig).</italic> </p><p> <italic>To get around this problem, at least some key experiments affected by the use of mutant constructs should be repeated with their corrected counterparts, in particular those involving Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals generated by the long isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This is justified due to the lower open probability and less pronounced CDI expected for the corrected (wildtype) rat Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> construct. Although there are also good arguments to repeat all other experiments with the correct constructs, the authors should be able to provide convincing arguments that this is not necessary, e.g. by discussing that CDI does not seem to be a determinant for coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</italic> </p><p><italic>2) Evidence for the specificity of staining of endogenous Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 alpha1 subunits in hippocampal neurons should be provided. So far no Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 antibody staining has been reported in hippocampal neurons or brain sections that was shown to be absent in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 knockout controls. I would therefore not be surprised if this is also true for their antibody. If there is no evidence for such convincing specificity, the authors should either remove data showing staining of native channels or clearly state this caveat in their paper. Obviously, they cannot be blamed for the fact that no anti-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 antibody with proven specificity exists. In any case, they should show the typical somatodendritic clusters also on spines of their Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 constructs transfected in hippocampal cultures using high resolution light microscopy as has been shown in previous work (e.g. Jenkins et al., J Neurosci, 2010).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that, so far, no anti-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 antibody with proven specificity in KO controls exist and thank for the suggestion to clarify this caveat in the manuscript. As suggested, this limitation in our study is now noted in the revised manuscript (subsection “Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in hippocampal neurons aggregate in dense clusters”, first paragraph). In addition, we now clarify in the manuscript that as we were not able to test the specificity of the antibody on Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-KO neurons, we pursued our analyses of channel clustering using a heterologous expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in tsA-201 cells. The specificity of the antibody in tsA-201 cells was tested by immunostaining untransfected and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-transfected cells. No evidence of staining was observed in the untransfected cells (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We also consider that our results using the step-photobleaching of expressed Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-mGFP is a strong piece of evidence that these channels organize in clusters in hippocampal neurons. In addition, the average number of channels per cluster in both hippocampal neurons and tsA-201 cells correlates with the mean areas calculated from the super-resolution data. Finally, we were able to see an increase in the cluster number when we compared untransfected and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>VC/VN transfected hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p> <italic>3) In the subsection “Coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels increases the firing rate of hippocampal neurons”: According to Moosmang et al. (2005; PMID: 16251435), Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 current components are minimal in hippocampal neurons and L-type currents seem to comprise only a small fraction of total voltage-gated calcium current. So how do the authors know their sparklets are produced by L-type currents? If so, they should vanish after treatment with a dihydropyridine Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker. This important control appears to be missing in the manuscript. They should also consider that there is no way to distinguish between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 sparklets (not even by membrane voltage as stated in their manuscript).</italic></p><p>We performed the control experiment suggested by the reviewer. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> includes data showing that sparklet site activity was decreased by application of 300 nM of the dihydropyridine antagonist isradipine and completely eliminated when the concentration of the drug was increased to 10 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and 9B</xref>). This is consistent with the hypothesis that sparklets in hippocampal neurons were produced by L-type calcium channels. Both Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are expressed in hippocampal neurons (Hell et al., 1993) and although it is impossible to distinguish between these two L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels using either electrophysiological or pharmacological methods, it has been shown that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels have a reduced sensitivity to dihydropyridines compared to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels (Lipscombe et al., 2004; Xu and Lipscombe, 2001). A previous study by Koschak et al. found that 100% of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels but only ~60% of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are inhibited by 300 nM isradipine (Koschak et al., 2001), given this, it is reasonable to assume that any sparklet remaining after application of 300 nM isradipine is more likely to be generated by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels than Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2. This discussion was added to the manuscript (subsection “Coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels increases the firing rate of hippocampal neuron”, first paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
