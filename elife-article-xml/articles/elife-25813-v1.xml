The 2La inversion is a widespread polymorphism in the <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> species complex, the major African mosquito vectors of human malaria. Here we show that alleles of the 2La inversion are associated with natural malaria infection levels in wild-captured vectors from West and East Africa. Mosquitoes carrying the more-susceptible allele (2L+<sup>a</sup>) are also behaviorally less likely to be found inside houses. Vector control tools that target indoor-resting mosquitoes, such as bednets and insecticides, are currently the cornerstone of malaria control in Africa. Populations with high levels of the 2L+<sup>a</sup> allele may form reservoirs of persistent outdoor malaria transmission requiring novel measures for surveillance and control. The 2La inversion is a major and previously unappreciated component of the natural malaria transmission system in Africa, influencing both malaria susceptibility and vector behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25813.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25813.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Anopheles</kwd><kwd>Plasmodium</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>insect vector</kwd><kwd>chromosome rearrangement</kwd><kwd>host-pathogen interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>323173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vernick</surname><given-names>Kenneth D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI121587</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riehle</surname><given-names>Michelle M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>228421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vernick</surname><given-names>Kenneth D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>731060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vernick</surname><given-names>Kenneth D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vernick</surname><given-names>Kenneth D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A common chromosome inversion in African malaria mosquito (<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>) is associated with differences in malaria infection, adult resting behavior and ecology, and may aid the most efficient vectors to evade malaria control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mosquitoes of the <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> species complex are primary African vectors of the human malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, which is responsible for extensive human morbidity and mortality. At least part of the widespread geographic success of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> and its sister taxon <italic>A. coluzzii</italic> (previously called the <italic>A. gambiae</italic> S and M molecular forms, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coetzee et al., 2013</xref>]) can be attributed to segregating paracentric chromosomal inversions. Inversions are physical rearrangements of a chromosome segment that suppress recombination and limit exchange of variation between two alternate suites of alleles. These diverged adaptive gene complexes function as supergenes in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thompson and Jiggins, 2014</xref>) and influence diverse phenotypes including butterfly color mimicry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Joron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nishikawa et al., 2015</xref>), ant colonial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), avian reproductive morphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamichhaney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huynh et al., 2011</xref>), human fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stefansson et al., 2005</xref>), and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ecological adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corbett-Detig and Hartl, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balanyá et al., 2006</xref>). In African <italic>Anopheles</italic>, inversion polymorphism is thought to enable fine-grained adaptation of malaria vectors to diverse ecological conditions, thus expanding the range of an important malaria vector throughout Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coluzzi et al., 1979</xref>).</p><p>The 2La inversion comprises ~10% of the genome size and segregates in <italic>A. gambiae</italic> and <italic>A. coluzzii</italic>, the only species of the complex in which it is polymorphic. Field-based studies have found no inherent difference in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> susceptibility between these main vector species of the <italic>A. gambiae</italic> complex, <italic>A. gambiae</italic> and <italic>A. coluzzii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fryxell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gnémé et al., 2013</xref>). Polymorphism of the 2La inversion has been correlated with aspects of vector bionomics, particularly adaptation to aridity or humidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coluzzi et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fouet et al., 2012</xref>), and biting and resting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coluzzi et al., 1977</xref>). The two forms of the inversion are allelic, by convention designated as 2L+<sup>a</sup> and 2La. The inversion polymorphism is widespread in Africa, but the alleles are not evenly distributed across geography. An allelic frequency cline was described in West Africa, where high frequencies of 2L+<sup>a</sup> are present in humid southern forest and coastal regions, with the 2La allele gradually becoming predominant northward, until becoming essentially fixed in the arid sub-Saharan savanna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coluzzi et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Touré et al., 1998</xref>). Subsequent studies have tended to confirm a correlation of the 2L+<sup>a</sup> allele with ecological humidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A prior cytogenetic study detected differences in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection rates of chromosome inversion karyotypes of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> in Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Petrarca and Beier, 1992</xref>). In that report, mosquitoes homozygous for the 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> karyotype displayed a two-fold higher prevalence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection than sympatric inverted 2La/2La homokaryotypes. However, as observed in that work, the intraspecific differences in infection rate required confirmation at other geographic sites to generalize the findings and could potentially be due to many interacting factors, including differential longevity, physiological susceptibility to <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and feeding behavior. To our knowledge, association of the 2La inversion with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection has only been examined once since the initial cytogenetic study, and no significant effect was detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matoke-Muhia et al., 2016</xref>), but the small sample size of infected mosquitoes in the study (n = 15) would yield low statistical power to detect an effect among three genotypes, even if one existed.</p><p>Vector genetic heterogeneity for parasite transmission is an important question during the malaria pre-elimination stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brady et al., 2016</xref>). Reservoirs of highly efficient vectors, or vectors that evade control, can contribute unevenly and cryptically to residual malaria transmission. After implementing existing vector control approaches such as insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS), and drug treatment of symptomatic human cases, it may be necessary to develop specialized tools to detect and control persistent sources of residual transmission.</p><p>In the current study, we detect differential <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection rates among carriers of 2La inversion genotypes at study sites across the African continent, and we test potential hypotheses regarding the underlying mechanism of the infection phenotype. A single evolutionary origin of the 2La inversion across geography and <italic>A. gambiae</italic> taxa indicates that the differential infection phenotype probably results from a shared, common mechanism rather than multiple local ones. We dissect the influence of multiple epidemiological factors, including vector blood-feeding behavior, survival rates, and general antimicrobial immune competence, to provide information about potential factors underlying the phenotype. Taken together, the results point toward a mechanism that includes physiological differences for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> susceptibility encoded by the 2La inversion haplotypes. We discuss possible candidate genes in the genomic region, as well as the limitations of genetically resolving a trait encoded by long non-recombining inversion haplotypes. We also examine correlation of 2La inversion genotype with mosquito feeding and resting behaviors, which has implications both for infection epidemiology and vector control strategies. Finally, we correlate the nonrandom geographic distribution of 2La inversion alleles with ecological conditions important for malaria transmission. This work describes and characterizes a novel heterogeneity of the natural malaria transmission cycle present across the African continent, with potentially significant effect on transmission dynamics as well as vector control strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The 2La inversion is significantly associated with differential malaria infection</title><p>Infection rates of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> were measured in mosquitoes of the <italic>A. gambiae</italic> species complex in the Western Highlands of Kenya, in the forested zone of southern Republic of Guinea (Guinea-Conakry), and in the Sudan-Savanna zone of Burkina Faso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The infection samples were generated by three distinct infection regimes, in order to control for potential biases of any individual method: (i) wild-caught mosquitoes that took a bloodmeal, if at all, under entirely natural conditions and were dissected after holding for 1 week in the insectary (Kenya) to measure infections acquired in nature and developed under controlled conditions, or (ii) wild-caught and dissected within 2 days of capture (Guinea-Conakry) to measure infections acquired and developed entirely in nature; or (iii) mosquitoes challenged with wild gametocytes by membrane feeding under controlled conditions (Burkina Faso). Exposure of the wild-caught mosquitoes (Kenya and Guinea-Conakry) to parasites occurred freely in nature, and thus infection outcome is the combined effect of intrinsic genetic susceptibility plus the influence of factors such as human or animal blood-feeding preference, mosquito age, previous infection history, influence of resting-site preference, and other uncontrolled environmental variables. In contrast, the experimentally infected samples control for all behavioral and environmental factors that could influence mosquito infection in nature, and measure intrinsic genetic susceptibility.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25813.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>African study sites used in study of the 2La inversion.</title><p>Samples of <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> complex from sites in Kenya (dark green), Republic of Guinea (Guinea-Conakry, orange) and Burkina Faso (blue) were used to assess the association between the 2La inversion and susceptibility to <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

The test sets thus display an average infection prevalence of 50%, and have statistical power to detect genetic association for either increased or decreased infection prevalence. This analytical approach normalizes statistical power to query genetic effects in both phenotypic directions across heterogeneous sample sets, which would otherwise display different levels of statistical power if not normalized.</p><p>Association of oocyst infection intensity and 2La genotype was also tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Infection intensity is defined as the number of midgut oocysts in mosquitoes with ≥1 oocyst, because including uninfected mosquitoes would confound infection prevalence with intensity. In the Burkina Faso samples, infection intensity was significantly higher in the 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> homozygotes as compared to 2La/2La homozygotes (p=0.01). The samples from Kenya displayed a trend in the same direction, although non-significant. The Burkina Faso sample set was larger than the Kenya samples, which may generate greater statistical power. The samples from Guinea-Conakry did not have statistical power for analysis of infection intensity because all seven 2La/2La homozygotes were uninfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, infection association was analyzed as the proportion of each 2La inversion haplotype present in the infected and uninfected groups at each geographic study site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). If the 2La inversion genotype has no influence upon infection outcome, then inversion frequencies should be randomized among uninfected and infected mosquitoes. However, 2La/2La homozygotes were present at higher frequency in uninfected mosquitoes, while 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> homozygotes were at higher frequency in infected mosquitoes. All the results are significant, in the same direction, and with similar p-values, as in the infection prevalence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>The effect of the 2La inversion across taxa was examined in the infection samples containing multiple taxa. The Burkina Faso samples were comprised of <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, <italic>A. coluzzii</italic>, and the Goundry form, while the infection samples from Guinea-Conakry and Kenya were comprised entirely of <italic>A. gambiae</italic>. Thus, infection was analyzed both within and across the taxa of the Burkina Faso samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The same association of 2La genotype and infection levels as in the pooled Burkina Faso samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) was observed independently of taxa when analyzed on this fine scale. In all pairwise comparisons, 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> homozygotes were significantly more susceptible than 2La/2La homozygotes from any taxon.</p><p>All three infection regimes displayed significant association between 2La inversion genotypes and infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The greater statistical significance of association in the membrane-infected (Burkina Faso) mosquitoes as compared to wild-caught (Kenya and Guinea-Conakry) is probably due in part to greater sample size, but another factor is the method of infectious challenge. In the membrane infections, all mosquitoes were challenged with known <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-gametocytemic blood, and unfed mosquitoes were removed before analysis. Conversely, for the wild-caught mosquitoes, exposure to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> gametocytes or even human blood was unknown, and thus uninfected individuals could result from the genetic effect of the 2La inversion but also from absence of any parasite challenge in previous bloodmeals. Consequently, the wild-caught samples are a more stringent test of association, because multiple irrelevant causes can generate uninfected mosquitoes. The 2La inversion association with infection under the controlled experimental infection regime (Burkina Faso) indicates that differences in intrinsic physiological susceptibility explain at least some of the observed infection difference between mosquitoes carrying alternate inversion forms.</p><p>The previous study of the 2La inversion and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection, using wild-caught <italic>A. gambiae</italic> in Kenya with cytogenetic karyotyping of 2La and circumsporozoite protein (CSP) immunoassay for parasite detection, found that the higher rate of CSP-positives in 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes was observed in the mosquito midgut, head-thorax, and salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Petrarca and Beier, 1992</xref>). This indicates that the higher prevalence of midgut oocyst infection was translated into sporozoites, and therefore a higher prevalence of infectious 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes with positive salivary glands. The current study used molecular genotyping of the 2La inversion with microscopic counting of midgut oocysts to confirm and strengthen the genetic association, to geographically extend the effect to West as well as East Africa, and to indicate that the effect is at least partly due to genetically controlled physiological difference in susceptibility. However, in addition to physiological susceptibility, to which we return in the Discussion, other factors could contribute to a 2La-associated mechanism influencing malaria transmission and epidemiology. These factors could potentially include variation for mosquito longevity, general immune competence, and behavior, and here we examine each of these possible components of the mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The 2La inversion is not associated with mosquito longevity in semi-field conditions</title><p>A possible explanation for the greater <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection levels of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes could be that these individuals display a low overall level of immune competence. In other words, perhaps they are highly infected with malaria not as a specific effect, but because they have poor antimicrobial defenses against all infections. Moreover, if the more infected 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes die sooner than 2La/2La individuals, regardless of the cause, then the epidemiological impact of the 2La inversion effect on susceptibility could be diminished, because infected mosquitoes become infectious for malaria transmission only when sporozoites invade the salivary glands 12–14 days after the infective bloodmeal.</p><p>To test these two hypotheses, we compared longevity of 2La genotypes in a natural Kenyan <italic>A. gambiae</italic> population segregating all three 2La genotypes. Mosquitoes grown from wild-collected larvae were maintained in open outdoor screen cages under semi-field conditions, exposed to natural environmental fluctuation, and environmental pathogens and microbes, and survivorship was measured. There was no significant difference in mosquito life span between 2La/2La and 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquito genotypes in the sympatric population across three replicate experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, p = 0.478, average median survival across replicates 19.3 days). This result also suggests that the greater <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection levels of 2L+<sup>a</sup> carriers is not due to a general low immune competence to all pathogens, or else the 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes should have displayed lower survival under these conditions. It is expected that under fully wild conditions, the different inversion genotypes would physically migrate to preferred ecological niches, and thus holding all genotypes under uniform conditions as done here probably represents a more stringent test for difference in survivorship.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25813.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>2La inversion homozygotes display equivalent longevity under semi-field conditions.</title><p>Wild <italic>A. gambiae</italic> larvae were collected in western Kenya, and the emerged adults were maintained in outdoor cages, exposed to ambient conditions including environmental microbes and pathogens.

However, we could not be certain that the ambient natural microbes in the longevity test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) included highly virulent mosquito pathogens. Therefore, we employed a known virulent pathogen, the entomopathogenic fungus, <italic>Metarhizium</italic>, in a direct assay for difference in functional immunity between 2La inversion genotypes. Entomopathogenic fungi are model eukaryotic pathogens used in studies of mosquito immunity and are a proposed biopesticide for vector control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong and Dimopoulos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thomas and Read, 2007</xref>). We reasoned that if the 2L+<sup>a</sup> -associated susceptibility to malaria is a non-specific effect of lower general immune competence, then patterns of 2La genotype association similar to those observed with malaria infection should be observed after fungal infection.

Mosquito samples collected inside of houses (indoor HLC) and outside ≥10 m from a dwelling (outdoor HLC) indicate endophilic and exophilic tendencies, respectively. Site and time-matched larval collections were also sampled from larval pools present in the villages. Larval pools are a limiting resource for female oviposition, and collection of larvae thus provides an unbiased measure of overall population genotype frequencies, independent of adult mosquito behavior or resting site preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fillinger and Lindsay, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gordicho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Riehle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Killeen et al., 2002</xref>). Unbiased sampling of adult mosquitoes is not currently possible by other methods.</p><p>Examination of the Guinea-Conakry population sampling data reveals two interesting behavioral effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). First, 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes are less likely than 2La/2La genotypes to be captured indoors attracted to human bait, suggesting that 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes are less likely than 2La/2La to feed inside habitations. The deficit of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> homozygotes among indoor captured mosquitoes was significant (double asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, Chi-squared = 6.99, df = 1, p=0.008, for the fraction of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> caught on HLC indoor versus caught on all other methods, as compared to the same fraction for 2La/2La). Second, the reduced indoor capture rate of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes was not compensated by elevated outdoor HLC collection of this genotype. Thus, proportionally fewer 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes were captured by HLC overall (HLC outdoor and indoor combined), relative to their total representation in the population based on larval site frequencies (2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> were 27% of total HLC versus 42% of total larvae). This under-representation in adult population sampling of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> genotypes as compared to 2La/2La was also significant (Chi-squared = 5.92, df = 1, p=0.02). In contrast, the inverse pattern was observed for 2La/2La mosquitoes, which represented 28% of total larvae but 40% of total HLC. Heterozygotes represented the balance of the sample, about one third of larvae and of total HLC. These two effects, a lower rate of indoor host-seeking for 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> relative to 2La/2La, and apparent under-sampling of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> adults relative to their overall population frequency, are also observed as a consistent tendency at each of the two individual sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Most previous genetic studies of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> susceptibility to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> were laboratory studies, and the traits were not tested in the natural population. Several previous genetic association studies of susceptibility were done in the natural vector population, but the variants were not geographically replicated, and the frequencies of the traits in nature were not determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Horton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luckhart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Riehle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mitri et al., 2015b</xref>). Thus, based on results of the current study, the 2La inversion is, to our knowledge, the only frequent and widespread natural genetic polymorphism with significant influence on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection rates in the vector population.</p><p>The association of malaria infection and 2La inversion genotype is probably due to a common underlying genetic mechanism throughout Africa rather than a series of local adaptations, because of the monophyletic origin of the 2La inversion within the <italic>A. gambiae</italic> species complex, and the Africa-wide distribution of the allele-phenotype association. The inversion genotype was significantly associated with oocyst infection prevalence at all three sites tested, and with infection intensity at the Burkina Faso site. Oocyst prevalence is the most relevant parameter for malaria transmission, because it distinguishes between mosquitoes competent for transmission from those that are not. In nature most mosquitoes carry &lt;5 oocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pringle, 1966</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of differential infection of 2La inversion genotypes is at least partly based on genetically controlled physiological differences for parasite development efficiency in 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> as compared to 2La/2La mosquitoes. The molecular mechanism of differential susceptibility must be relatively specifically addressed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, because the 2La genotypes do not display detectable differences in general immune competence. The pathogen spectrum of the 2La susceptibility trait, if it extends to other microbes beyond malaria, is unknown. However, attempts to identify the underlying causative genetic mutations or causative mechanism distinguishing the 2La and 2L+<sup>a</sup> alleles are not likely to be fruitful, because the mechanism is probably an additive or synergistic effect among variants dispersed throughout the 22 Mb inversion. The inversion alleles are non-recombining haplotypes carrying ~2000 genes. SNPs within many of these genes, both the few relevant genes and the large mass of irrelevant ones, are probably equally linked to inversion-associated phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corbett-Detig and Hartl, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite the challenges of genetic comparison between inversion alleles with suppressed recombination, standard genetic approaches can be applied in crosses of inversion homozygotes, in which chromosomes are free to recombine. Genetic mapping carried out in wild pedigrees from homozygous 2La/2La crosses in Mali identified a cluster of quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to oocyst infection prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Niaré et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Riehle et al., 2006</xref>). The cluster is located within the proximal 2La inversion breakpoint, and the region was termed the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Resistance Island. Within the resistance island, the APL1 gene family of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins display a protective phenotype for <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection prevalence in functional assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mitri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Riehle et al., 2008</xref>). Another LRR immune factor, LRIM1, is also located within the 2La inversion, and additional nearby LRR genes with a similar protective phenotype for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> were recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mitri et al., 2015a</xref>). However, to date, there is no evidence that genetic variation at these candidate genes is associated with the observed phenotypic differences between 2La and 2L+<sup>a</sup> inversion alleles, and identification of such variation between inversion alleles may remain elusive for the reasons enumerated above.</p><p>If <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection is deleterious to the vector, the elevated infection prevalence of 2L+<sup>a</sup> carriers might seem inconsistent with the locally high 2L+<sup>a</sup> allele frequencies. However, evidence is lacking that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> imposes a fitness cost upon infected mosquitoes in nature, and deleterious effects of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> are mainly seen using artificial vector-parasite combinations or unnatural infection levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Hurd, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferguson and Read, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robert et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Parasite reproductive fitness should be maximized by maintaining active, flying vectors that can successfully transmit sporozoites. Alternatively, if natural malaria infection imposes a fitness cost, then the 2L+<sup>a</sup> chromosome presumably would carry linked compensatory mutations for tolerance to higher levels of parasites to mitigate such cost.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Behavioral tendencies of 2La inversion genotypes</title><p>The most likely explanation for the observed behavioral results is that 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes are significantly more exophilic, and 2La/2La more endophilic. Exophilic mosquitoes tend to rest outdoors to digest the bloodmeal and complete their gonotrophic cycle, although they may bite either outdoors or indoors, while endophilic mosquitoes both bite and rest indoors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bockarie et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coluzzi et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gillies, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Riehle et al., 2011</xref>). Endophilic mosquitoes are efficiently sampled by capture of house-resting mosquitoes within the enclosed space using pyrethroid spray or aspirator, while sampling methods for exophilic mosquitoes are inefficient because the outdoor resting sites are spatially scattered at largely uncharacterized sites anywhere in the outdoor environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gillies, 1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">1954</xref>). Therefore, we presume that the 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes not collected in the peridomestic environment by either indoor or outdoor HLC were located in more distant and dispersed outdoor resting sites. An alternate hypothesis could be that 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> larvae simply fail to survive to the adult stage with the same success as 2La/2La carriers. This argument is unconvincing for several reasons, including (i) the above data that 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes do not display lower survival, and are not immunologically weaker than 2La/2La, (ii) evidence that females preferentially choose oviposition sites that maximize survival of larval progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diabaté et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Munga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Suh et al., 2016</xref>), and (iii) if 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> larvae consistently displayed elevated mortality in nature, it would be difficult to explain the observed frequencies of a genotype with high negative fitness load.</p><p>The feeding behavior of the presumably exophilic fraction of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes that are not captured as adults by HLC cannot be determined directly, and it cannot be ruled out that they could be feeding on animals and resting outdoors. However, among the large fraction of capturable 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes, the rate of human bloodmeal carriage was 100%, and the level of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection was significantly elevated as compared to 2La/2La. It is not likely that the non-captured 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes would display a radically different behavior (i.e. zoophilic) or biology than the capturable ones, for several reasons. First, most knowledge of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> behavior to date indicates strong human-feeding propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costantini and Diallo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garrett-Jones et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gillies and Coetzee, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">White, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pates et al., 2001</xref>), with very few accounts of zoophily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diatta et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duchemin et al., 2001</xref>), so an exclusively zoophilic group within <italic>A. gambiae</italic> would be unexpected. Second, the only previous test of association of the 2La inversion with endophilic or exophilic behavior, in northern Nigeria, found that 2L+<sup>a</sup> carriers were less likely than 2La carriers to be captured indoors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coluzzi et al., 1979</xref>), which is consistent with the current results. Third, carriage of the 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> genotype is a hallmark of the sylvan-adapted Forest chromosomal form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coluzzi et al., 1979</xref>), which was observed to be highly exophilic and human-biting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bockarie et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">1994</xref>).</p><p>Taking together our results and the literature, the non-captured 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes in our study most likely indicate a behavioral tendency toward exophily of anthropophilic 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes. In other words, the non-captured fraction represent one tail of an overall 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> distribution that is skewed toward exophily, while 2La/2La behavior is skewed toward endophily, and both are probably equally anthropophilic. It is this behavioral tendency of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> mosquitoes that makes them a potential concern, because under the pressure of indoor-based vector control such as ITNs and IRS, the relative population frequencies of the 2L+<sup>a</sup> allele would be expected to increase, and the resulting population could become more exophilic. In the only examination of 2La genotypes under indoor selection pressure to our knowledge, the 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> frequency increased from 0% detectable in 1994 before ITN rollout in western Kenya to 66% by 2011 after rollout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matoke-Muhia et al., 2016</xref>). The 2La inversion is not genetically associated with resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides used on ITNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooke et al., 2002</xref>), so the underlying mechanism is more likely to be behavioral avoidance rather than chemical selection. At the time of the current collections in Guinea-Conakry, the country had the lowest use of ITNs in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">President's Malaria Initiative, 2014</xref>), which provides the opportunity to monitor 2L+<sup>a</sup> allele frequencies there as ITNs are rolled out.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Epidemiological significance</title><p>Here, we demonstrate consistently higher <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection rates of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> complex 2L+<sup>a</sup> inversion carriers across the African continent. Consequently, it might be expected that the frequency of 2L+<sup>a</sup> in local vector populations would correlate with human malaria incidence. Targeted studies to correlate the 2La inversion and the prevalence of human <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection (referred to as <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite rate, PfPR) will be necessary to separate multiple potentially confounding factors, and here we discuss the main considerations.</p><p>In the absence of consistent public health data from many malaria-endemic African countries, cartographic approaches are used to impute the spatial distribution and epidemiological parameters of PfPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hay et al., 2008</xref>). Examination of ecological correlates found that proxies for humidity (high annual rainfall and vegetation density) were the covariates most strongly correlated with PfPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>). The 2L+<sup>a</sup> allele generally correlates geographically with humidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coluzzi et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, in a broad sense, the ecological conditions associated with the highest PfPR as well as vector 2L+<sup>a</sup> frequency are positively correlated, but detailed ecological genetic studies are needed.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate a significant positive correlation between annual precipitation and the proportion of the 2L+<sup>a</sup> inversion along an ecological transect in Guinea-Conakry and Southern Mali. Epidemiological data do not yet exist to analyze correlation of PfPR and 2La inversion genotype directly because health data in Guinea-Conakry are ‘either inaccurate or sparse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tiffany et al., 2016</xref>). However, the highest PfPR in Guinea-Conakry is in the southern forested zone, where about 85–90% of the 5–14 year-old group was <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-positive during the period 2011–2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tiffany et al., 2016</xref>), near the current study sites of Koraboh and Koundara where vector populations displayed the highest 2L+<sup>a</sup> frequencies of up to 57%, while in the northern humid savanna the 2L+<sup>a</sup> frequency decreased to 27% and in the arid savanna, 4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coulibaly et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the core habitats of 2L+<sup>a</sup> carrying mosquitoes appear to be ecologically synonymous with the foci or hotspots of the most stable, endemic core transmission of African <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. It is perhaps not surprising that high PfPR is correlated with availability of water and humidity, conditions that promote robust vector populations. This could suggest that the presence of high frequencies of 2L+<sup>a</sup> carrying mosquitoes directly contributes to stable malaria transmission, but distinguishing between correlation and causation will require detailed village-based epidemiological surveys that incorporate 2La inversion genotyping and measurement of ecological parameters.</p><p>We speculate that in high-PfPR foci, the epidemiological influence of high 2L+<sup>a</sup> frequencies could be partially masked by current high levels of transmission mediated by all vector genotypes together. Under such favorable ecological conditions for both vectors and PfPR, transmission levels may be saturating, and variation in vectorial capacity may not be the most important limiting factor for PfPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brady et al., 2016</xref>). Under the current conditions, human short-duration immunity maintained by frequent exposure to infectious bites may contribute more strongly to defining the upper limit of PfPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Langhorne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tran et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The current regions of high PfPR, 2L+<sup>a</sup> frequency, and humidity are also some of the economically poorest and geographically remote, where malaria control has been less consistently implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tiffany et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatt et al., 2015</xref>). However, as sustained malaria control interventions at these high-PfPR foci depress vector populations and baseline PfPR, the more susceptible and exophilic 2L+<sup>a</sup> vectors may begin to disproportionately mediate residual transmission. The numbers of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> in the population, as well as their contribution to the entomological inoculation rate (EIR), are likely to be systematically underestimated if, as suggested above, they are not efficiently sampled by standard adult collection methods. The propensity of 2La/2La to rest indoors and be oversampled may cause overestimation of the impact of ITNs and IRS, while the exophilic behavior and undersampling of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> may generate a partially invisible reservoir of efficient transmission.</p><p>Collection of additional empirical data from multiple sites will be required for accurate modeling of the contribution of 2La inversion genotypes to transmission during ITN and IRS rollout. The necessary data include <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection prevalence per 2La inversion genotype, seasonal inversion genotype frequency, and the force of negative and positive selection by ITNs and IRS upon the different inversion genotypes. Another relevant variable is declining human protective immunity as the parasite challenge rate decreases. The key question is whether, in the humid high-PfPR and high-2L+<sup>a</sup> core ecological niches of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission, existing tools could sufficiently depress the parasite reproductive rate in residual transmission hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bousema et al., 2012</xref>). Or, alternatively, whether an exophilic vector reservoir would require additional or novel vector control solutions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The humid equatorial zones in Africa are core ecological niches of the malaria transmission system, where transmission is particularly well adapted to the environment and should be most stably implanted. High frequencies of the malaria-susceptible 2L+<sup>a</sup> vector type is a correlated feature of these humid, high-PfPR zones. The specific contribution of 2L+<sup>a</sup> carriers to the ecological durability of malaria transmission may currently be obscured by conditions of high general PfPR in 2L+<sup>a</sup>-rich zones, combined with relatively low coverage of these areas by large-scale malaria control efforts, as well as sparse research and health statistics. As PfPR recedes in these sites with the expansion of large-scale malaria control measures, the influence of high frequencies of 2L+<sup>a</sup> could become more apparent, and pose new challenges. The presence of abundant 2L+<sup>a</sup> carriers may require different methods to efficiently sample and measure exophilic adult mosquitoes, coupled with new approaches for their control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mosquito collections for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection levels</title><p>Mosquitoes collected at multiple African sites were comprised of taxa of the <italic>A. gambiae</italic> species complex.

Briefly, indoor-resting, bloodfed females were collected with aspirators from dwellings in the morning during the main rainy seasons of 2002 and 2003 (mid-March to June). Mosquitoes were collected each year for 10 weeks in each of the villages. Following collection, mosquitoes were brought to an insectary, maintained at ambient temperature, humidity, and light with access to sugar solution for 7 days. Mosquito midguts were then dissected to detect and count oocysts. Because mosquitoes were held under controlled conditions for 7-day post-bloodmeal, the design controls for differential mortality of either mosquitoes or parasites based on resting behavior, climatic and temperature variables. This design had the advantage, as compared to the previous study in the same region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Petrarca and Beier, 1992</xref>) that oocysts were counted directly instead of using CS-ELISA as a measure of infection. Mosquitoes were stored in absolute ethanol.</p><p>In the Republic of Guinea (Guinea-Conakry), indoor-resting mosquitoes were collected with aspirators between 06:00 and 12:00 hr in semi-forest (Kenemabomba and Koraboh) and deep forest (Koundara) sites during May 2008. Sites were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coulibaly et al., 2016</xref>). Collected mosquitoes were maintained in a field insectary for 48 hr, midguts were dissected, and oocysts were counted microscopically. Carcasses were stored in 80% ethanol at −20 C until DNA extraction. Distinct from the collections in Kenya, these samples were not maintained in the insectary for 7 days.</p><p>In Burkina Faso, wild larvae were collected by dipping from breeding sites in the region of Goundry, raised to adults in the insectary, and were fed on gametocytemic blood from naturally infected volunteers from the Goundry vicinity, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Riehle et al., 2011</xref>). Unfed mosquitoes were removed, and mosquitoes were dissected 7–8 days post-infection to determine midgut oocyst counts. Membrane feeding sessions resulting from non-infectious or poorly infectious blood were removed using quality filters as defined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Riehle et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, only membrane-feeding experiments that included all three genotypes of the 2La inversion are analyzed. Filtering for infection quality and 2La genotypes yielded six distinct membrane-feeding experiments from the 2008 rainy season, which included the <italic>A. gambiae</italic> complex members, <italic>A. coluzzii</italic>, <italic>A. gambiae</italic> and the Goundry form that types as <italic>A. coluzzii</italic> or <italic>A. gambiae</italic> by standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fanello et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The infection samples were generated by three distinct infection regimes, in order to control for potential biases of any individual method: (i) wild-caught mosquitoes that took a bloodmeal, if at all, under entirely natural conditions and were dissected after holding for 1 week in the insectary (Kenya) to measure infections acquired in nature and developed under controlled conditions, or (ii) wild-caught and dissected within two days of capture (Guinea-Conakry) to measure infections acquired and developed entirely in nature; or (iii) mosquitoes challenged with wild gametocytes by membrane feeding under controlled conditions (Burkina Faso). Exposure of the wild-caught mosquitoes (Kenya and Guinea-Conakry) to parasites occurred, if at all, freely in nature, and thus infection outcome is the combined effect of intrinsic genetic susceptibility plus the influence of factors such as human or animal blood-feeding preference, mosquito age, previous infection history, influence of resting-site preference, and other uncontrolled environmental variables. In contrast, the experimentally infected samples control for these behavioral and environmental factors that could influence mosquito infection in nature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Genotyping for 2La inversion and species</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from individual female mosquitoes using DNeasy Tissue (Qiagen, CA) or DNAzol (Invitrogen, CA, USA) reagents, and molecular diagnostic tests were used to determine species for all reported samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fanello et al., 2002</xref>).

Non-standard amplicons of 672, 687, 760 and 1020 bp were described, which result from insertion of mobile elements into the breakpoint regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ng'habi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Obbard et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2009</xref>). These larger bands are interpretable derivatives of the standard amplicon sizes and therefore can be assigned to one of the two inversion alleles. All 2La inversion genotyping calls were additionally confirmed by sizing the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis. Eight of the 273 Kenyan samples yielded a larger band size (n = 7 for 687 bp and n = 1 for 1020 bp). Of these eight individuals, four were infected and four were non-infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. No samples from Guinea-Conakry or Burkina Faso yielded non-standard band sizes.

Otherwise, natural infection levels in wild mosquitoes would be too low to robustly test association in a tractable sample size. In the Guinea-Conakry collection, raw <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection prevalence was 3.3% (for the presence of any parasite stage as detected by molecular assay), and represented completely unfiltered wild-collected samples, in which some mosquitoes did not take any bloodmeal, or did not feed on a gametocyte carrier, or fed too recently to develop oocysts. In the Kenya collection, raw oocyst infection prevalence was 25.5%, and represented wild mosquitoes filtered for the presence of bloodmeal and then incubated in the insectary for 7-day post-capture to allow oocysts, if present, to develop.</p><p>For both Guinea-Conakry and Kenya samples, the association test sets include all infected mosquitoes from the collection (i.e., individuals with ≥1 midgut oocysts), and an equal number of randomly chosen uninfected mosquitoes from the same collection (i.e., individuals with zero midgut oocysts). The test sets thus display an average infection prevalence of 50%. This analytical approach normalizes statistical power to query genetic effects in both phenotypic directions across heterogeneous sample sets, and normalizes statistical power to detect an effect across sample sets, which would otherwise display different levels of statistical power if not normalized. In contrast, in the Burkina Faso samples, which were membrane-fed on infectious wild gametocytes and unfed mosquitoes removed, the raw oocyst infection prevalence was 54%, and thus all mosquitoes were directly used as the association test set. All statistical analyses compare samples within a given geographic site, and no comparisons are done across sites.</p><p>For association of 2La inversion genotype with oocyst infection intensity (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were done in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">R Core Team, 2012</xref>) comparing oocyst intensity by 2La inversion genotype for all individuals that carried ≥1 midgut oocyst. All analyses were done within a geographic site and no comparisons were carried out across sites.</p><p>For analysis of the proportion of each 2La inversion genotype present in the infected and uninfected phenotypic groups (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the same samples as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> were analyzed except instead of comparing prevalence rates across inversion types, the relative frequencies of 2La inversion genotypes were analyzed in uninfected and infected mosquitoes.

In Koraboh and Koundara, mosquitoes attracted to human hosts were captured by aspirator (human-landing capture, HLC) at night between 18:00 and 06:30 hr. Mosquitoes were sampled by indoor HLC (within dwellings) and outdoor HLC (≥10 m from a dwelling). Indoor-resting mosquitoes were also collected by aspirator between 06:00 and 12:00 hr. All mosquitoes were <italic>A. gambiae</italic>. The bloodmeal source was determined by PCR as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coulibaly et al., 2016</xref>) to compare animal and human bloodmeal rates across 2La inversion genotypes. Bloodmeal sources were tested in wild-caught <italic>A. gambiae</italic> adult mosquitoes carrying visibly detectable blood in Guinea-Conakry (indoor-resting aspirator capture described above n = 126, indoor HLC n = 72, and outdoor HLC n = 12). To assess partitioning of adult mosquito spatial behavior in wild <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, we compared the 2La inversion genotype frequencies of individuals captured by indoor and outdoor HLC. Larvae were sampled from breeding sites in the same villages by dipping with a cup. Larval pools of all known ecological types were sampled within the villages, collecting small numbers of larvae per pool from large numbers of pools, to avoid oversampling siblings and to generate ecologically representative larval samples of the peridomestic village habitat, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gnémé et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Riehle et al., 2011</xref>).

Chromosome 2L genome sequences were clustered by Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Included in the cluster analysis were internal genotyping standards from previously described wild samples from Burkina Faso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Markianos et al., 2016</xref>) that had been manually genotyped for the 2La inversion using the standard PCR-based diagnostic test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">White et al., 2007</xref>). These internal genotyping standards included all three genotypes, and their distribution among the three PCA clusters of Ag1000 samples was used to assign 2La inversion genotype calls to the PCA clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Independently, analysis by the Ag1000 Consortium clustered 2L chromosome sequences using the ADMIXTURE program, and assigned genotype calls to the resulting three clusters based on sequence divergence from the <italic>A. gambiae</italic> PEST strain reference genome, which is fixed for 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miles et al., 2016</xref>). Our 2La inversion calls and the Ag1000 calls for the same individuals by independent methods were completely concordant (765/765 matching calls for all three genotypes). The <italic>A. gambiae</italic> Goundry form samples were genotyped for the 2La inversion using the PCR diagnostic assay as described above.</p><p>For analysis of evolutionary history of the inversion, only inversion homozygotes were analyzed, to avoid any potential biases that could be introduced by computational phasing methods. A total of 222 whole genome sequences were used from individuals sampled in five countries across Africa in which homozygotes were sympatric within the country sample set (in total, 103 2La/2La and 107 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> individuals; Guinea-Conakry n = 18, Guinea-Bissau n = 17, Cameroun n = 98, Kenya n = 22, Uganda n = 55, Burkina Faso Goundry form n = 12). For analysis, 5 Mb windows were identified that (i) were outside the inversion and on another chromosome 3L.15–20 Mb, 3R.15–20 Mb, or (ii) were outside the inversion but on the same chromosome 2L.8–13 Mb, or (iii) spanned the proximal and distal breakpoints of the inversion, 2L.18–23 Mb, and 2L.39–44 Mb, or (iv) were entirely within the inversion 2L.29–34 Mb. Using VCF files for these defined genomic regions, maximum likelihood trees were constructed to examine the evolutionary relationship of windows across all 222 individuals. The sequences with degenerate UIPAC code were derived from the VCF files for these defined genomic regions, and phylogenetic trees were inferred by the maximum likelihood approach using the GTR+Gamma substitution model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang, 1994</xref>) implemented in IQ-TREE version 1.5.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>).

Using collections made across the African continent comprised of 2La/2La, 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup>, and heterozygous individuals, they explore the association of the 2La genotype with several components of vectorial capacity that would lead to asymmetric malaria transmission among individuals with different 2La genotypes. Specifically, the authors find that the 2La inversion is associated with intrinsic Plasmodium susceptibility and exophilic feeding behavior, but not longevity, human feeding rate, or immune function. The reviewers agree this report sheds light on how polymorphisms within the species complex affect transmission dynamics and, by extension, malaria epidemiology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raise several issues that must be adequately addressed before they can accept the paper for publication.

In particular, the initial experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) identifies an intrinsic difference in Pf susceptibility but, rather than explore the mechanism for that, subsequent experiments explore additional behavioral differences.

The artificial 50% prevalence set for both of these groups is also deceiving.

Please revise the paper structure to present a unified study.</italic> </p><p>We modified the text throughout to unify the scientific narrative.</p><p>We also modify the text to clarify insight derived about the potential mechanisms underlying the inversion 2La-associated infection phenotype. Briefly, we find that the infection association is not a local phenomenon, but is Africa-wide, consistent with the single monophyletic origin of the 2La inversion across geography and <italic>A. gambiae</italic> taxa. Consequently, the differential infection phenotype is probably a shared, common mechanism. The mechanism is not due to differential human blood feeding or survival, and is not a consequence of overall immune competence. Thus, the differential infection is relatively specifically addressed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. These mechanistic observations are confirmed by the detection of the association in wild-caught adult mosquitoes, which combine together the effects of survival, immunity, and bloodfeeding behavior, which we also dissect as separate tests of mechanism. Moreover, these observations are further confirmed and extended by detection of the association in controlled experimental infections. Taken together, these results provide considerable information about the mechanism of the trait, and they all point in the same direction: towards a genetically-controlled physiological difference in 2La inversion genotypes that underlie differences in parasite development efficiency.</p><p>The genetically-controlled difference must have a cellular and molecular basis. Functional dissection of a molecular mechanism is beyond the scope of a field-based study like the current one. However, some mosquito genetic loci and candidate genes involved in malaria susceptibility are located in the 2La inversion, and we discuss their potential to be involved in the 2La inversion association. We also discuss the main limitation involved in genetically resolving the trait, which is the extent of linkage across the 22 Mb 2La inversion. Because there is almost no recombination between alternate forms, the haplotypes probably comprise supergenes, and it is likely that multiple synergistic gene products together underlie the phenotype. Thus, as we now clarify, a single “locus” or gene explaining the mechanism is not likely to exist, because the phenotype probably results from the synergistic effect of multiple/many genes dispersed throughout the 22 Mb haplotype.</p><p><italic>2) The samples from west Africa appear to be pooled from all taxa, potentially including A. gambiae, A. coluzzii, the Goundry form and/or A. gambiae/A. coluzzii hybrids. Please provide data on the relative abundance of each of these taxa in the west African samples and the frequencies of the 2La genotype in each.</italic> </p><p>Multiple taxa were present in collections used for two analyses: infection association in Burkina Faso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and ecological correlation in Guinea and Mali (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The other collections used, Guinea infection samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and behavior samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and infection samples from Kenya (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) were all <italic>A. gambiae</italic>.</p><p>In all cases, the collections used for the different analyses are representative of the taxa that were present at the study sites, and no sample sets were filtered for taxa. The breakdown of taxa composition and allele frequencies for the above two analyses with multiple taxa are now added to the manuscript as follows.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> – Burkina Faso, infection association. Samples were comprised of <italic>A. gambiae, A. coluzzii</italic>, and the Goundry form. We generated a new figure supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) that indicates the numbers of each taxon and frequencies of 2La genotypes. The same association of 2L+<sup>a</sup> and infection levels as seen in the Burkina Faso pooled samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) is also consistent on a fine scale in the breakdown of the figure supplement. Specifically, in all pairwise comparisons, 2L+<sup>a</sup> is significantly more susceptible than 2La from any taxon, either within Goundry, or as compared to 2La of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> or <italic>A. coluzzii</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> – Guinea and Mali, ecological correlation. Samples were comprised of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> and <italic>A. coluzzii</italic>. Numbers of each taxon and 2La frequencies per study site are now listed in the Methods section, “Correlation between 2La inversion allele frequency and annual precipitation”.</p><p>In addition, we used new whole-genome sequence data from Goundry mosquitoes to generate a new phylogenetic tree of the 2La inversion including Goundry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is now revised to include Goundry mosquitoes. This analysis now extends the observation of monophyletic ancestry of the 2La inversion to also include the 2La alleles segregating within the Goundry form. The new tree demonstrates that 2La inversion alleles share a common evolutionary history that is deeper than taxonomic group or geography, even to the Goundry form.</p><p><italic>3) While infection prevalence may be the most important metric to determine infectiousness, the reviewers agree oocyst intensity data provides necessary insight into pathogen susceptibility. Please include it.</italic> </p><p>We now include data on oocyst infection intensity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This analysis shows that the 2L+<sup>a</sup> inversion allele is significantly associated with greater infection intensity in the experimentally infected Burkina Faso samples (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), in addition to with higher infection prevalence as shown in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The same trend for infection intensity, although non-significant, possibly due to smaller sample size, is also seen in the Kenyan population. The Guinea samples did not have statistical power for analysis of infection intensity because of small sample size, and because all 7 2La/2La homozygotes were uninfected. Infection intensity is analyzed using only individuals carrying ≥1 oocyst, to avoid confounding effects of intensity and prevalence.</p><p><italic>4) Data collection for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is very convoluted as each collection site had a different way of assessing infection and prevalence, yet the figure presents as if they were treated identically. For example, the Kenyan mosquitoes have a much greater chance of being considered infected via oocyst counting than the Guinea-Conakry due to the longer incubation time. The artificial 50% prevalence set for both of these groups is also confusing. The data could be better described as proportions of each haplotype in infected and uninfected groups rather than true prevalence. Either way, the inconsistencies should be up front in the text and not just the Methods.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we now also present the proportions of each 2La inversion haplotype in the infected and uninfected groups (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As suggested by the reviewers, this alternative analysis does not rely on infection prevalence. All of these results are significant, in the same direction, and with similar p-values, as the original figure (the prevalence analysis, now renamed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This alternative analysis using haplotype and infection strengthens the association result, and we thank the reviewers for the suggestion.</p><p>Regarding the association analysis by infection prevalence in current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we previously described the analytical method with extensive detail in Methods. However, we now add text also in Results to clarify the analytical approaches used. By constituting association test sets with all infected mosquitoes from each collection, and an equal number of randomly chosen uninfected mosquitoes from the same collection, “the test sets display an average infection prevalence of 50%, and therefore have the power to detect genetic association for either increased or decreased infection prevalence.” This analytical approach normalizes statistical power to query genetic effects in both phenotypic directions across heterogeneous sample sets, which would otherwise display different levels of statistical power if not normalized.</p><p>Regarding the different infection methods used at the different study sites, they are not “inconsistencies” but were purposely included to augment the power of the study to query different physiological aspects of infection. However, the design is complex and we agree that it could be confusing for the reader. We now add additional explanatory text in Results to clarify the infection methodologies, and to clarify that observing the same empirical results under three distinct experimental regimes reinforces the robust nature of the findings. Conversely, applying a single homogeneous infection design would have been a less stringent test, and would have generated less information about the phenotype and its potential mechanisms (for example, behavioral versus physiological).</p><p>Finally, we clarify with additional text in Methods and Results that all comparisons are made between 2La genotypes <italic>within</italic> a geographic location, and no comparisons are made <italic>across</italic> sites. Put differently, analysis of 2La association with infection were made among sympatric samples using the same infection methodology, that is, within Kenya samples, or within Guinea samples, but not between Kenya and Guinea.</p><p><italic>5) Justify why exposure to a single fungal species is representative of &quot;generalized pathogen susceptibility&quot; and immunity to P. falciparum.</italic> </p><p>One possible explanation for the greater <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection levels of 2L+<sup>a</sup> carriers could be that these individuals display a low overall level of immune competence, generalized across all of their antimicrobial defenses. In other words, perhaps they are highly infected with malaria not as a specific effect, but because they have poor defenses against all infections. We now clarify in the text that the longevity test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) comprised a comprehensive natural test for 2La genotype differences in immune competence to natural microbes and pathogens. In this test, mosquitoes grown from wild-caught larvae in Kenya were kept in outdoor open cages, fully exposed to all environmental microbes and pathogens. There was no difference in survival among 2La inversion genotypes, suggesting that the greater <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection levels of 2L+<sup>a</sup> carriers is not due to a general low immune function or competence.</p><p>However, because we could not be certain that the ambient natural microbes in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> test included any highly virulent pathogens, we decided to employ a known virulent Anopheles pathogen, the entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium, in a more stringent assay for survival difference between 2La inversion genotypes. Entomopathogenic fungi are model eukaryotic pathogens commonly used in studies of mosquito immunity, as well as a proposed biopesticide for vector control. The virulence of Metarhizium as a pathogen was confirmed by the elevated mortality effect, but the mortality curves were not different between 2La genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Of course, Metarhizium is just one eukaryotic pathogen, as pointed out by the reviewers. However, the two results taken together indicate that the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> susceptibility of 2L+<sup>a</sup> carriers is more specific than, and cannot be explained by, generalized immune incompetence.</p><p><italic>6) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, discuss the possibility that the 2L+a/2L+<sup>a</sup> individuals may be feeding on animals and resting outdoors, so not represented in your collections. This outcome would alter the conclusions.</italic> </p><p>We added new text in the Discussion on this point. In Results, we reported a deficit of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> captured as HLC adults as compared to 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> among larvae (2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> were 27% of total HLC versus 42% of total larvae). Nevertheless, a large fraction of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> were capturable. Among these capturable 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup>, the rate of human bloodmeal carriage was 100% (Results), and the level of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection was significantly elevated as compared to 2La/2La (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The feeding behavior of the noncaptured or “missing” fraction of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> cannot be determined directly, and it cannot be ruled out that they could be less anthropophilic. However, it is not likely that the missing 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> display a radically different (i.e., zoophilic) behavior than the capturable ones, for several reasons. First, most knowledge of <italic>A. gambiae/coluzzii</italic> behavior to date indicates strong human-feeding propensity, with very few accounts of zoophily, so an exclusively zoophilic group within <italic>A. gambiae</italic> would be unexpected. Second, 2L+<sup>a</sup> carriers were previously described as more exophilic (Coluzzi et al. 1979). Third, mosquitoes of the Forest Form of <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, which are 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup>, are both exophilic and anthropophilic (Bockarie et al. 1993, Bockarie et al. 1994).</p><p>Thus, the missing 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> in our study most likely indicate a behavioral <italic>tendency</italic> towards exophily of the anthropophilic 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup>. In other words, the missing fraction represent one tail of an overall 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> distribution that is skewed towards exophily, while 2La/2La behavior is skewed towards endophily, and both are likely equally anthropophilic. It is this behavioral tendency of 2L+<sup>a</sup>/2L+<sup>a</sup> that makes them a potential threat, because they could respond in an exophilic direction when placed under selective pressure by ITNs and IRS, consistent with empirical data from ITN distribution in Kenya (Matoke-Muhia et al., 2016).</p><p><italic>7) Following Comment 1, integrate results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and 8 into the Results section and discuss in the Discussion section.</italic> </p><p>The old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> has been integrated into the Results (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and is discussed in the Discussion section.

These larger bands are a result of insertion/deletion derivatives of the standard PCR amplicon sizes 207 bp (expected size for 2L+<sup>a</sup>) and 492 bp (expected sized for 2La), and therefore can be assigned to an inversion form (2La or 2L+<sup>a</sup>). To survey for any amplicon sizes outside of the expected 207 bp and 492 bp, the 2La genotyping PCR reactions of all samples reported were amplified using a fluorescent primer and size-separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI sequencing machine, as well as verified on agarose gels. For the Kenyan samples, 8 of 273 samples generated non-standard band sizes (n=7 for 687 bp and n=1 for 1020 bp). Of these 8 samples, 4 were infected and 4 were non-infected. To be thorough, we ran an additional infection association analysis after removing these 8 individuals, and the results were unchanged. Therefore, the analyses presented include all samples.</p><p><italic>9) The references section needs to be restructured.
