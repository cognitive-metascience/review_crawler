We found that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is critical for the development of CD4 T cells, as HDAC3-deficient DP thymocytes generate only CD8SP thymocytes in mice. In the absence of HDAC3, MHC Class II-restricted OT-II thymocytes are redirected to the CD8 cytotoxic lineage, which occurs with accelerated kinetics. Analysis of histone acetylation and RNA-seq reveals that HDAC3-deficient DP thymocytes are biased towards the CD8 lineage prior to positive selection. Commitment to the CD4 or CD8 lineage is determined by whether persistent TCR signaling or cytokine signaling predominates, respectively. Despite elevated IL-21R/γc/STAT5 signaling in HDAC3-deficient DP thymocytes, blocking IL-21R does not restore CD4 lineage commitment. Instead, HDAC3 binds directly to CD8-lineage promoting genes. Thus, HDAC3 is required to restrain CD8-lineage genes in DP thymocytes for the generation of CD4 T cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HDAC3</kwd><kwd>lineage commitment</kwd><kwd>T cell development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56 AI122746</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shapiro</surname><given-names>Virginia Smith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000871</institution-id><institution>Mayo Clinic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Biomedical Discovery</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shapiro</surname><given-names>Virginia Smith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000871</institution-id><institution>Mayo Clinic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate School</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Philips</surname><given-names>Rachael Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007048</institution-id><institution>Mayo Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shapiro</surname><given-names>Virginia Smith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AI007425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Philips</surname><given-names>Rachael Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CD4 lineage commitment requires HDAC3 to prevent premature upregulation of CD8 lineage genes during T cell development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T cells are essential components of the adaptive immune system that directly kill pathogen-infected cells (CD8 cytotoxic T cells) or orchestrate other immune cells in host defense (CD4 helper T cells). The decision to become either a CD8 or CD4 T cell occurs in the thymus. Proper lineage choice involves the coordination of various cellular signals with the regulation of gene expression by lineage dependent transcription factors. According to the kinetic signaling model (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singer et al., 2008</xref>), lineage choice is determined by TCR signaling persistence versus cytokine signaling. After positive selection, thymocytes downregulate the CD8 coreceptor to become ‘intermediate’ CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> thymocytes to test for coreceptor specificity. MHC class II-restricted thymocytes experience persistent TCR signaling, upregulate the CD4-lineage determining transcription factor ThPOK, and commit to the CD4 lineage. Alternatively, TCR signaling ceases with MHC class I-restricted thymocytes, allowing for common gamma chain cytokine signaling (mainly IL-7R) to predominate, induction of the CD8-lineage determining transcription factor Runx3, and commitment to the CD8-lineage.</p><p>While many transcription factors have been identified in regulate lineage choice, less is known about the contribution of different chromatin modifiers. HDAC3 is a critical regulator of gene expression. HDAC3 exists in a large (~270 kDa) multiprotein co-repressor complex containing the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR) and/or its homolog silencing mediator of retinoic and thyroid receptors (SMRT) (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karagianni and Wong, 2007</xref>). HDAC3 can also associate with p300 coactivator complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) to modulate histone acetyltransferase activity. HDAC3 does not have a DNA-binding domain, therefore it must be recruited to different areas of the genome via interactions with different transcription factors. Within the nucleus, HDAC3 can be found at promoters or enhancers and functions to deacetylate specific lysine residues on histones H3 and H4. Therefore, HDAC3 is a dynamic protein that represses gene expression depending upon the complexes HDAC3 interacts with and where it is recruited in the genome.</p><p>HDAC3 is ubiquitously expressed and plays important and specific roles in cell biology and disease. Genomic deletion of HDAC3 is embryonically lethal due to defects in gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Montgomery et al., 2008</xref>), therefore conditional knockout models are necessary to elucidate HDAC3 function in particular cell types. Within the immune system, HDAC3 is important for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Summers et al., 2013</xref>), peripheral T cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>), regulatory T cell development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), iNKT cell development and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thapa et al., 2017</xref>), B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stengel et al., 2017</xref>), and macrophage function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mullican et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition, HDAC3 is required during thymocyte development for positive selection and CD4-lineage development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Philips et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stengel et al., 2015</xref>). Mice with CD2-icre-mediated deletion of <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked <italic>Hdac3</italic> (CD2-icre HDAC3-cKO, referred to as HDAC3-cKO) exhibit a positive selection block due to the failure to down-regulate RORγt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Philips et al., 2016</xref>). Deletion of RORγt and transgenic expression of Bcl-xl corrects the positive selection defect in HDAC3-cKO mice (RORγt-KO Bcl-xl Tg HDAC3-cKO, referred to as RB3), as RORγt-KO corrects for the failure to down-regulate RORγt and the Bcl-xl transgene restores the DP-survival defect in RORγt-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Philips et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2000</xref>). However, thymocytes almost exclusively develop into CD8SP with very few CD4SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Philips et al., 2016</xref>). RORγt-KO Bcl-xl Tg mice exhibited normal numbers of CD4SP and CD8SP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Philips et al., 2016</xref>), demonstrating that the defect in CD4-lineage development in RB3 mice is specific to HDAC3.</p><p>Here, we elucidate how HDAC3 is essential for CD4-lineage commitment. The failure to generate CD4-lineage cells is due to the redirection of MHC class II-restricted thymocytes to the CD8-lineage. After positive selection, HDAC3-deficient thymocytes exhibit a failure to induce the CD4-lineage program and acceleration of commitment towards the CD8-lineage. HDAC3 binds to regulatory elements of CD8-lineage promoting genes <italic>Runx3</italic> and <italic>Patz1</italic> in DP thymocytes, and deletion of HDAC3 results in an increase in histone acetylation and mRNA levels. In addition, HDAC3 binds to <italic>Runx3</italic> and <italic>Patz1</italic> regions in OT-II CD4SP thymocytes and was absent in OT-I CD8SP thymocytes. Therefore, our data demonstrates that HDAC3 functions in DP thymocytes to repress CD8-lineage genes in order for DP thymocytes to maintain a bi-potential state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MHC class II restricted thymocytes are redirected to the CD8-lineage when HDAC3 is absent</title><p>To examine why few CD4SP thymocytes develop in RB3 mice, T cell development was examined in RB3 mice expressing a transgene encoding the OT-II MHC class II-restricted TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnden et al., 1998</xref>). While mature SP thymocytes and splenic T cells from OT-II mice were primarily CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, OT-II RB3 mice generated CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, mature SP thymocytes from OT-II RB3 mice expressed Runx3 and lacked ThPOK expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), demonstrating that MHC class II-restricted thymocytes are re-directed to the CD8-lineage in OT-II RB3 mice. Control OT-II RORγt-KO Bcl-xl tg (OT-II RB) mice showed normal commitment to the CD4 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), indicating that the redirection observed in OT-II RB3 mice is a result of HDAC3 deletion. Redirection was not dependent on Bcl-xl expression, as OT-II RORγt-KO HDAC3-cKO mice also showed redirection to the CD8-lineage compared to OT-II RORγt-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), despite a reduction in the number of SP thymocytes in RORγt-deficient mice. To determine whether redirection also led to the acquisition of CD8-lineage function, SP thymocytes from OT-II RB3 mice were TCR stimulated and analyzed for Granzyme b and Perforin production. MHC class I-restricted OT-I cells, as well as OT-II cells and OT-II RB cells, were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. As expected, OT-I cells produced Granzyme b and Perforin, while OT-II and OT-II RB cells did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, CD8SP cells from OT-II RB3 mice made Granzyme b and Perforin upon TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), demonstrating that CD8-lineage cells from OT-II RB3 mice are functionally cytotoxic-lineage cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43821.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MHC class II restricted thymocytes are redirected to the CD8-lineage when HDAC3 is absent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CD4/CD8 profile of mature thymic SP (Vβ5<sup>+</sup>Vα2<sup>+</sup>H2K<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>lo</sup>) and splenic T cells (Vβ5<sup>+</sup>Vα2<sup>+</sup>) from OT-II, OT-II RORγt-KO Bcl-xl tg (RB) and OT-II RB3 mice.

To examine whether expression of these lineage-determining transcription factors was altered during lineage commitment in OT-II RB3 mice, we used a previously established gating scheme that outlines three main phases of CD4/CD8-lineage choice defined by CD69 and CCR7 expression ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>): <italic>Phase 0</italic> identifies pre-positive selection thymocytes (Stage 1, CD69<sup>-</sup>CCR7<sup>-</sup>), <italic>Phase 1</italic> identifies thymocytes that down-regulate the CD8 coreceptor to test for TCR signal persistence (Stages 2–4, CD69<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>-/lo/int</sup>, highlighted in orange), and <italic>Phase 2</italic> identifies thymocytes that have committed to either the CD4 or CD8 lineage (Stages 5–6, CD69<sup>-/+</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup>). In addition to examining lineage choice in OT-II RB3 and OT-II RB mice, OT-I and OT-II mice were used as controls for normal CD8-lineage and CD4-lineage commitment, respectively. As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>), MHC class I-restricted OT-I-expressing thymocytes decreased CD8α during Phase 1 and re-expressed CD8α during Phase 2, coinciding with CD8-lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, Runx3 was induced during Phase 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), demonstrating that Runx3 is expressed when cells commit to the CD8-lineage. OT-II and OT-II RB thymocytes exhibited a consistent decrease in CD8α expression through Phases 1–2 and no expression of Runx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), as expected for MHC class II-restricted thymocytes that commit to the CD4-lineage. However, OT-II RB3 mice showed premature expression of Runx3 during Phase 1 of lineage choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This pattern coincides with high CD8α expression during Phase 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

In <italic>Selecting</italic> (CD69<sup>+</sup>) cells, 679 genes and 347 genes were down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively, from OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice compared to OT-II mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Alternatively, housekeeping gene expression did not change upon HDAC3 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating that deletion of HDAC3 did not change gene expression globally. Rather, there was evidence that CD4-lineage associated genes were down-regulated in OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice. In particular, <italic>Zbtb7b</italic> (encodes ThPOK) was markedly decreased in <italic>Immature</italic> (DP) and <italic>Selecting</italic> (CD69<sup>+</sup>) cells compared to OT-II (Log<sub>2</sub> FC −2.38 and −3.83, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). This led us to investigate whether genes corresponding to the CD4-lineage or the CD8-lineage were differentially regulated when HDAC3 was absent. To restrict our analysis to genes that distinguish between the CD4 and CD8-lineages, two gene sets were generated using the Immunological Genome Consortium Database (immgen.org, detailed in Materials and methods). To confirm specificity of the gene sets, the expression of these genes in DP, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup>, CD4SP and CD8SP thymocytes was examined. The CD4-lineage gene set showed low expression in DP and CD8SP thymocytes, induction at the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> stage, and high expression in CD4SP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The CD8-lineage gene set was only expressed in CD8SP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Since expression of the CD4-lineage gene set started at the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> stage and neither gene sets were expressed at the DP stage, we examined how the CD4-lineage gene set was differentially expressed at the <italic>Selecting</italic> (CD69<sup>+</sup>) stage between OT-II and OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice. 64% of CD4-lineage genes in this gene set were significantly down-regulated in HDAC3-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Examples include <italic>CD4</italic>, <italic>Zbtb7b</italic> (ThPOK), <italic>Itgb3</italic>, <italic>Nrp1</italic>, <italic>Cd40lg</italic>, and <italic>St8sia6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3A</xref>). However, 53% of CD8-lineage genes were significantly up-regulated in OT-II HDAC3-cKO cells compared to OT-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), such as <italic>Snai3</italic>, <italic>Cd8a</italic>, <italic>Cd8b1</italic>, <italic>Prf1</italic>, <italic>Itgae</italic>, <italic>Gpr114</italic>, and <italic>Runx3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3B</xref>). Protein expression showed a similar pattern, as there was a decrease in ThPOK expression and slight increase in Runx3 expression at the <italic>Selecting</italic> (CD69<sup>+</sup>) stage in OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice compared to OT-II mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Of note, this pattern was also observed in OT-II RB3 mice, where there was an increase in Runx3 and decrease in ThPOK protein expression early in lineage choice compared to OT-II cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>), illustrating convergence between OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice and OT-II RB3 mice. This distinct pattern suggests that lack of HDAC3 leads to a gene expression pattern predisposed to the CD8-lineage and against the CD4-lineage prior to positive selection.</p><p>To determine whether the different patterns of gene expression between OT-II and OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice at the <italic>Selecting</italic> (CD69<sup>+</sup>) stage was reflective of changes in histone acetylation, the level of H3K27ac and H3K9ac around the transcription start site (TSS) was examined at CD4-lineage and CD8-lineage genes. Interestingly, there were minimal changes in the average H3K27ac signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) or average H3K9ac signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>) at CD4-lineage genes. This was either due to the lack of change in acetylation between OT-II and OT-II HDAC3-cKO cells (e.g. <italic>Cd4, Nrp1,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>) or a decrease in H3K9ac or H3K27ac signal (e.g. <italic>Zbtb7b</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). However, there was a significant increase in the average H3K27ac signal and average H3K9ac signal around the TSS of CD8-lineage genes (e.g. <italic>Cd8a, Cd8b1, Snai3, Runx3</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Consistent with the RNA-seq data, genes that are normally silenced in thymocytes (i.e. macrophage genes, B-cell genes, HSC/progenitor genes) or housekeeping genes (i.e. mitochondrial genes, ribosomal genes) showed no change in histone acetylation between OT-II and OT-II HDAC3-cKO thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A–B</xref>). Altogether, this shows that HDAC3-deficient thymocytes induce CD8-lineage genes and fail to prompt the CD4-lineage program after receiving a TCR signal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DP thymocytes from HDAC3-cKO mice show a CD8-lineage bias at the chromatin level</title><p>Regulation of cell identity occurs at the chromatin level through <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> elements, such as enhancers.

Therefore, alterations in super-enhancers may play a role in the re-direction of MHC class II-restricted cells to the CD8-lineage in HDAC3-deficient cells. Very high levels of H3K27ac reliably characterize super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the H3K27ac ChIP-seq dataset was used to identify super-enhancers in <italic>Immature</italic> (DP) cells from OT-II and OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice to determine whether prior to receiving a TCR signal, HDAC3-deficient DP thymocytes show a CD8-lineage bias. Using the ROSE (Rank Ordering of Super-Enhancers) algorithm to identify super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lovén et al., 2013</xref>) within the <italic>Immature</italic> (DP) compartment, 5967 typical-enhancers were identified from OT-II mice and 7496 typical enhancers from OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice, while 263 super-enhancers were identified from OT-II mice and 360 super-enhancers from OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), demonstrating that deletion of HDAC3 leads to an increase in the number of enhancers. Further examination revealed a significant increase in H3K27ac signal at super-enhancers from HDAC3-deficient cells compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>), while the average H3K27ac signal at typical enhancers remained largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Not only was the H3K27ac signal increased at super enhancers in HDAC3-cKO cells but the median length was also increased compared to the OT-II mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, the increase in acetylation at super-enhancers from OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice corresponded to an increase in gene expression of genes associated with super-enhancers, compared to OT-II mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). To determine whether the increase in super-enhancer number in HDAC3-deficient <italic>Immature</italic> (DP) cells was due to the acquisition of new super-enhancers, the number of overlapping super-enhancers between OT-II and OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice was examined. 197 super-enhancers overlapped between the two mice, 66 super-enhancers were unique to OT-II mice, and 163 super-enhancers were unique to OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Upon further examination of the 66 unique super-enhancers from OT-II mice, the level of H3K27ac at these regions was comparable between OT-II and OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), as well as the expression of genes associated with those super enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). The H3K27ac signal SE cutoff for OT-II mice was lower than the SE cutoff for OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice (~10,000 versus~35,000, respectively), suggesting that the ‘unique’ super-enhancers in OT-II mice were similarly acetylated between the groups even though they did not reach the threshold for super enhancers in OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice. Alternatively, the unique super-enhancers from OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice exhibited an increase in H3K27 acetylation signal compared to the same regions in OT-II mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Among the 163 unique super-enhancers in OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice, super-enhancers near <italic>Runx3</italic> and <italic>Patz1</italic> (encodes MAZR) were especially notable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Runx3 and MAZR have been shown to promote CD8-lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakaguchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kohu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Woolf et al., 2003</xref>), therefore the formation of <italic>Runx3</italic> and <italic>Patz1</italic> super-enhancers suggests that HDAC3-deficient DP thymocytes are biased for the CD8-lineage prior to positive selection and lineage choice. Interestingly, the super-enhancer regions near <italic>Runx3</italic> from OT-II HDAC3-cKO mice were identified as multiple typical enhancers in OT-II mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), demonstrating that the lack of HDAC3 leads to an increase in acetylation at enhancer regions near <italic>Runx3</italic>, stitching of enhancers together, and categorizing the region as a super-enhancer. In fact, this increase in H3K27ac signal corresponds with an increase in mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), which is a feature of super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>).

Since pre-selection thymocytes show a transcriptomic and chromatin bias for the CD8-lineage when HDAC3 is absent, cytokine signaling may also be altered in HDAC3-deficient DP thymocytes. Therefore, the expression of common gamma chain receptors were examined in DP thymocytes between WT and HDAC3-cKO mice. In WT mice, DP thymocytes did not express IL-7Rα, IL-15Rα, and IL-2Rβ, and expressed common gamma chain (γc), IL-4Rα, and IL-21R at low levels compared to isotype control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similarly, DP thymocytes from HDAC3-cKO mice did not express IL-7Rα, IL-15Rα, and IL-2Rβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), however common gamma chain (γc), IL-4Rα, and IL-21R expression were significantly increased compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

However, IL-4 and IL-21 receptor expression was markedly increased in HDAC3-cKO mice. To determine whether stimulation by IL-4 or IL-21, as well as other common gamma chain-containing receptors, leads to STAT5 activation in DP thymocytes, STAT5 phosphorylation (p-STAT5) was measured after stimulation with IL-4, IL-7, IL-15, or IL-21. There was no change in p-STAT5 levels after IL-7 or IL-15 stimulation of thymocytes from WT or HDAC3-cKO mice, as expected since DP thymocytes lack IL-7R and IL-15R expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Alternatively, IL-21 stimulation led to a significant increase in p-STAT5 in HDAC3-deficient thymocytes, with about a 2-fold increase over WT cells and a 4-fold increase over no stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Similarly, DP thymocytes from OT-II RB3 mice exhibited a significant increase in p-STAT5 after IL-21 stimulation compared to DP thymocytes from OT-II, OT-I, and OT-II RB mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This increase in p-STAT5 in HDAC3-deficient thymocytes was not due to a change in total STAT5a or STAT5b levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To determine whether the increased IL-21R expression in HDAC3-deficient DP thymocytes also leads to enhanced activation of STAT3 and STAT1, p-STAT3 and p-STAT1 levels were measured after IL-21 stimulation. There was no change in p-STAT3 levels between WT and HDAC3-cKO mice after IL-21 stimulation, while p-STAT1 levels showed a slight increase in HDAC3-cKO mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Similarly, there was no change in p-STAT6 levels between WT and HDAC3-cKO mice after IL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Therefore, in DP thymocytes from HDAC3-cKO mice, STAT5 activation was enhanced in response to IL-21 stimulation.</p><p>To determine whether IL-21R expression and signaling occurs prior to the DP stage in HDAC3-cKO mice, we examined IL-21R expression and pSTAT5 signaling in DN and immature SP (ISP; CD8<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>-</sup>TCRβ<sup>-</sup>) thymocytes from WT and HDAC3-cKO mice. IL-21R expression was similar in DN thymocytes between mice, however ISPs from HDAC3-cKO mice exhibited a significant increase in IL-21R expression compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Of note, the level of IL-21R expression in ISPs from HDAC3-cKO mice was less than what was observed in DP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, upon IL-21 stimulation, ISPs from HDAC3-cKO mice exhibited a significant increase in phospho-STAT5 levels compare to WT mice, while stimulation with IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 showed no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Therefore, IL-21R expression and signaling precedes the DP stage.</p><p>A major function of HDAC3 is to repress gene expression. To determine whether HDAC3 associates with the <italic>Il21r</italic> gene locus in DP thymocytes to regulate IL-21R expression, HDAC3 binding was measured by quantitative ChIP (qChIP). Interestingly, HDAC3 was enriched at the <italic>Il21r</italic> promoter in DP thymocytes from WT mice compared to HDAC3-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), demonstrating that HDAC3 interacts with the <italic>Il21r</italic> promoter directly. The <italic>Il21r</italic> gene locus resides next to <italic>Il4ra</italic> on chromosome 7 in mice. As shown previously, deletion of HDAC3 results in elevated histone acetylation at both <italic>IL21r</italic> and <italic>Il4ra</italic> gene loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, the increase in acetylation in HDAC3-deficient cells resulted in a dramatic expansion of a super-enhancer detected near the transcription end site of <italic>Il21r</italic> in OT-II cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting regulation of <italic>Il21r</italic> and <italic>Il4ra</italic> may be coordinated.

Since cytokine signaling drives CD8-lineage commitment and HDAC3-deficient thymocytes exhibit accelerated commitment to the CD8-lineage, elevated IL-21R signaling may promote the redirection of MHC class II-restricted thymocytes to the CD8-lineage when HDAC3 is absent. To test this, OT-II and OT-II RB3 mice were treated with an anti-IL-21R blocking antibody and assessed for CD4-lineage commitment. After two weeks of antibody injections, the CD4/CD8 profile was analyzed within the mature SP thymocyte compartment.

Rather, HDAC3 binds to the CD8-lineage promoting genes <italic>Runx3</italic> and <italic>Patz1</italic> to restrain CD8-lineage genes for CD4-lineage commitment.</p><p>Regulation of cytokine signaling is critical for proper T cell development. In particular, cytokine signaling is restrained in DP thymocytes and drives CD8-lineage commitment after positive selection. 75% of MHC class I-restricted thymocytes undergo CD8-lineage commitment via γc cytokine receptor signaling, primarily through IL-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McCaughtry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Etzensperger et al., 2017</xref>). IL-7R signaling is shut off in DP thymocytes, as enforced IL-7R signaling results in the CD8-lineage fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2010</xref>). Whether overexpression of STAT5-inducing cytokine receptors in DP cells other than IL-7R can induce CD8-lineage commitment was unknown. Here, we show that HDAC3 deletion leads to increased IL-21R expression in DP thymocytes. IL-21 is secreted by thymic epithelial cells, therefore overactive IL-21R signaling in DP thymocytes may promote CD8-lineage commitment. However, blocking IL-21R signaling did not restore CD4-lineage choice in HDAC3-deficient thymocytes.</p><p>Thymocytes navigate through distinct steps to undergo error-free lineage choice. Recently, Kimura <italic>et al</italic> identified two phases of lineage commitment in MHC class I-restricted thymocytes—phase one identifies cells testing for TCR signal persistence, and phase two classifies cells receiving cytokine signaling that results in CD8-lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>). Expression of ThPOK and Runx3 corresponds with these two phases, as ThPOK is induced in phase 1and Runx3 in phase 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>). Cytokine signaling is confined to phase 2 and drives Runx3 expression, as SOCS1 transgenic OT-I mice failed to induce Runx3 expression in phase 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>). However, this study focused on MHC class I-restricted cells. In our study, we found that MHC class II-restricted thymocytes erroneously committed to the CD8-lineage. Using the same gating scheme to distinguish the two phases of lineage commitment, Runx3 was expressed pre-maturely in phase 1 in OT-II RB3 mice. Correspondingly, ThPOK was not induced in OT-II RB3 mice, suggesting that a true ‘phase 1’ may not have occurred and commitment to the CD8-lineage was accelerated. Consistent with this, CD8α was not downregulated in OT-II RB3 mice at phase 1. We show an epigenetic mechanism where HDAC3 is required to restrain Runx3 expression in DP thymocytes to maintain a bipotential state. In DP thymocytes, HDAC3 binds to a regulatory element upstream of <italic>Runx3</italic>, and deletion of HDAC3 results in hyperacetylation at this locus, as well as an increase in <italic>Runx3</italic> mRNA levels. Therefore, HDAC3 functions to restrain CD8-lineage promoting genes for CD4-lineage development.</p><p>While class I HDACs play a role in regulating CD4/CD8-lineage identity, our study identifies a distinct role for HDAC3 to prevent redirection of MHC class II-restricted cells to the CD8-lineage. Combined deletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 via CD4-cre results in loss of CD4-lineage integrity, as peripheral CD4 helper T cells aberrantly express the CD8 coreceptor (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) as well as the CD8 effector T cell program upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boucheron et al., 2014a</xref>). It appears that CD4/CD8-lineage commitment is unaffected in these mice, but rather HDAC1/2 function to constitutively repress CD8-lineage genes in CD4 T cells in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boucheron et al., 2014b</xref>). Alternatively, deletion of HDAC3 by CD2-icre results in a transcriptomic and histone acetylation bias for the CD8-lineage prior to positive selection and misdirection of thymocytes to the CD8-lineage. In fact, HDAC3 binds to <italic>Runx3</italic> and <italic>Patz1</italic> regulatory elements in DP and CD4 SP thymocytes in WT mice. However, CD4-cre mediated deletion of HDAC3 resulted in no defect in CD4/CD8-lineage integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>), as HDAC3 protein is still present at the DP stage in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Philips et al., 2016</xref>). This demonstrates that HDAC3 is specifically required for restraining CD8-lineage genes is DP thymocytes, however redundant mechanisms in addition to HDAC3 are required for maintenance of CD8-lineage gene repression in CD4SP thymocytes. Compared to HDAC1/2 maintaining CD4-lineage identity in the periphery, HDAC3 functions to limit CD8-lineage genes in DP thymocytes prior to CD4-lineage commitment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Hdac3</italic> fl/fl mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knutson et al., 2008</xref>) mice were previously described.

HDAC3-deficient mice have defects in intrathymic selection, previously studied by these workers. In this work, the authors correct for defects in RORγT down-regulation using mice deficient for RORγT and correct for the survival defect resulting from RORγT deficiency by introducing a transgene for Bcl-xl. Such mice were previously shown to produce only CD8 but not CD4 cells, although subsequent investigation in the manuscript largely use a simpler OT-II TCR-transgenic HDAC3-deficient model, and thymocytes that initiate TCR signaling are isolated and studied. The authors attempt to unravel the molecular basis for this highly penetrant CD4/CD8 cell fate phenotype, revealing changes in the expression of cytokine receptors and in responsiveness to cytokine signaling. They find that HDAC3 deficiency leads to increased H3K27Ac deposition specifically on genes associated with the CD8 lineage, including <italic>Runx3</italic>, which is critical for commitment to the CD8 lineage. Surprisingly, enhanced Runx3 expression is shown to be secondary to IL-21 signaling. Finally, the authors use an antibody blocking strategy to demonstrate the IL-21R signaling is responsible for changes in acetylation and STAT5 binding the Runx3 locus in HDAC3-deficient mice, since antibody blockade of IL-21R reverses the changes in H3K27Ac, including the increased H3K27Ac at the <italic>Il21r</italic> locus. It is thus concluded that HDAC3-deficiency regulates lineage commitment through effects on cytokine signaling, mostly likely <italic>Il21r</italic>; specifically, that HDAC3 is critical to restrain cytokine signaling in thymocytes, and in its absence IL-21 signaling leads to STAT5 activation, and so CD8 lineage commitment.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the manuscript by Philips et al. show data supporting an interesting role for HDAC3 in regulating the genomic preparedness for thymocyte lineage differentiation into the CD4 branch, the data do not yet quite provide for the visualisation of a robust mechanistic pathway, and there are a number of more formal concerns as well. If these limitations are addressed substantively, it would increase enthusiasm for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) How HDAC3 restrains IL-21R cytokine signaling remains unresolved. Also, does IL-21R expression and signaling precede the immature-DP super-enhancer alterations? Does the role of IL-21R in regulating genome-wide acetylation patterns indicate that acetylation is not driven directly by HDAC3? And instead, that HDAC3 has a limited role, for this function, in regulating IL-21R expression and/or signaling alone? The mechanistic model appears to be HDAC3-IL-21R-STAT5-PIAS. Is PIAS in fact essential for this specific functional role of HDAC3? Evidence for these mechanistic steps in mediating the final functional outcome of lineage choice would be very useful. A cartoon of the mechanistic pathways involved would also be very helpful.</p><p>2) Another serious omission is that the authors do not appear to address whether blockage of IL-21R blocks CD8 development in OTII-RB3 mice. While authors have demonstrated some effects of HDAC3 loss on cytokine signaling, they have not definitively demonstrated that this is the cause of altered lineage fate, as they have made no attempt to normalize cytokine signaling in HDAC3 mice and link this to restoration of CD4 lineage commitment. If the effect of HDAC3 on IL-21R expression and responsiveness is thought to play a key role, then it should be possible to extend the IL-21R blockade and examine effects on lineage commitment.</p><p>3) The functional role of HDAC3 is revealed primarily in RORγT-null Bcl-xl-transgenic mice. While the argument for this complex genotypic background is reasonable, it leaves open an uncertainty about the role of HDAC3 in wild-type double-positive (DP) thymocyte differentiation. Even limited functional data supporting such a role in functional assays in closer-to-wild-type mice would be useful.</p><p>4) The lack of inclusion of a Rag1/2-null genotype in the OT-II experiments (Figure 1) leaves the formal possibility open that endogenous MHC class I-restricted TCRs have provided positive selection into the CD8 lineage. Data to rule out such a possibility would be helpful.</p><p>5) The ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data in Figure 2 have been done on background genotypes (OT-II and OT-II+HDCA3-null) that are different from the ones used in Figure 1. It would be useful to provide data showing convergence between these various background genotypes.</p><p>6) In a number of instances, comparisons are offered between OT-II and OT-II-RB3 mice. It would be advisable to include OT-II-RB genotypes in these comparisons, to ensure formally that the major genotypic distinction is indeed in HDAC3.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the revision plan was rejected after consideration by the editor and reviewers, but the authors submitted for reconsideration.

In this work, the authors correct for defects in RORγT down regulation using mice deficient for RORγT and correct for the survival defect resulting from RORγT deficiency by introducing a transgene for Bcl-xl. Such mice were previously shown to produce only CD8 but not CD4 cells. Here, the MHC-II restricted TCR transgenic mice OT-II are shown to develop into the CD8 lineage when RORγT and HDAC3 is missing and a Bcl-xl transgene (OTII-RB3 mice) is present. Subsequent investigation largely uses a simpler OT-II TCR transgenic HDAC3 deficient model, and thymocytes that initiate TCR signaling are isolated and studied. The authors find that HDAC3 deficiency leads to increased H3K27Ac deposition specifically on genes associated with the CD8 lineage. This is an interesting finding. Among these are genes for Runx3, which is critical for commitment to the CD8 lineage. Surprisingly, enhanced Runx3 expression is shown to be secondary to IL-21 signaling, as expression of the IL-21R receptor is enhanced on signaled thymocytes in OTII-RB3 mice, and this enhanced expression is reversed when antibody to IL-21R is injected into OTII-RB3 mice. Antibody blockade of IL-21R also reverses the changes in H3K27Ac, including the increased H3K27Ac at the <italic>Il21r</italic> locus. The authors suggest that HDAC3 is critical to restrain cytokine signaling in thymocytes, and in its absence IL-21 signaling leads to STAT5 activation, and so CD8 lineage commitment. How HDAC3 restrains <italic>Il21r</italic> cytokine signaling is unresolved.</p><p>There are observations of interest here. One serious omission is that the authors do not appear to address whether blockage of IL-21R blocks CD8 development in OTII-RB3 mice. Further, the mechanism by which HDAC3 normally suppresses expression of IL-21R is also not resolved, because some measured changes in HDAC deficient cells are shown to be secondary to IL-21R signaling.

Two groups have published HDAC3 ChIP-seq in either peripheral human CD4 T cells (Wang et al., 2009) or in the murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 (Nanou et al., 2017). Using the publicly available datasets, we find that in each system, HDAC3 binds to the IL-21R promoter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Warren Leonard’s group (Wu et al., 2005) identified that the primary regulator of the IL-21R promoter is Sp1 which binds to the promoter at approximately -45 relative to the transcriptional start site. Several groups have identified that Sp1 and HDAC3 interact, and that HDAC3 interaction with Sp1 inhibits transcriptional activation. To test this, we will:</p><p>– perform HDAC3 ChIP-qPCR to determine if HDAC3 interacts directly with the IL-21R promoter, using primers that flank the Sp1 site, and</p><p>– determine if HDAC3 overexpression inhibits transcriptional activation of an IL-21R reporter construct.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>HDAC3 binding at the <italic>Il21r</italic> promoter in human CD4 T cells and mouse pro-B cells.</title><p>Accession numbers for publicly accessible HDAC3 ChIP-seq: human CD4 T cells (GSM393952) and mouse pro-B cells (GSM2096648).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43821-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, does IL-21R expression and signaling precede the immature-DP super-enhancer alterations?</p></disp-quote><p>To determine whether IL-21R expression and signaling occurs prior to DP thymocytes, we examined IL-21R expression and pSTAT5 signaling in DN (CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>) and immature SP (ISP; CD8<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>-</sup>TCRb<sup>-</sup>) thymocytes from WT and HDAC3-cKO mice. We found no change in IL-21R expression in DN thymocytes between mice, however ISPs from HDAC3-cKO mice exhibited a significant increase in IL-21R expression compared to WT mice. Of note, the level of IL-21R expression in ISPs from HDAC3-cKO mice was less than what was observed in DP thymocytes. In addition, upon IL-21 stimulation, ISPs from HDAC3-cKO mice exhibited a significant increase in phospho-STAT5 levels compare to WT mice, while stimulation with IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 showed no effect. Therefore, IL-21R expression and signaling does precede the DP stage.

In order to determine the relative contribution of IL-21 receptor signaling to CD8-lineage commitment in OT-II RB3 mice, we will transfer bone marrow from OT-II RB3 mice (or OT-II controls) into IL-21-cytokine-knockout recipients. Bone marrow chimeras will be analyzed for lineage redirection in the thymus and spleen. A previous study showed that thymic epithelial cells, rather than haematopoietically-derived cells, are the source of IL-21 in the thymus (Rafei et al., 2013). Therefore, using bone marrow chimeras with the host thymic stroma deficient in IL-21 can address whether removing IL-21 may restore CD4-lineage development in OT-II RB3 mice. Cryopreserved IL-21 heterozygous mice were ordered from JAX, and these mice were recently received. We are currently interbreeding in our facility to generate IL-21-homozygous-knockout specifically for this experiment. One caveat is that IL-4R expression is also significantly higher in HDAC3-deficient DP thymocytes (Figure 5A) and IL-4 leads to enhanced Stat5 activation (although this was not quite statistically significant). We will also examine whether there is enhanced IL-4R expression and signaling in the HDAC3-deficient thymocytes in an IL-21-deficient recipient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The functional role of HDAC3 is revealed primarily in RORγT-null Bcl-xl-transgenic mice.

However, if desired by the reviewers, we can perform bone marrow chimeras in which bone marrow from OT-II RB3 mice or OT-II controls will be transferred into irradiated β2m-knockout recipients. Thymocytes from β2m-knockout mice largely fail to positively select MHC class I-restricted TCRs, leading to the development of only CD4 T cells (Broussard et al., 2006, their Figure 4A).

We appreciate the time and effort devoted by the reviewers and editors.</p><p>As γc cytokines have an established and critical role in CD8 lineage commitment, we initially focused on the role of enhanced IL-21R expression in CD8 lineage commitment. Based on the reviews, a longer 14-day time course of IL-21R blockade was performed to analyze changes in CD4/CD8 lineage commitment, ThPOK and Runx3 expression in OT-II and OT-II RB3 mice. 14-day blockade of IL-21R did not alter OT-II RB3 lineage commitment to CD8 or modulate expression of either ThPOK or Runx3. This data has been added as Figure 6, and the previous data on changes in histone acetylation has been removed. Therefore, blockade of IL-21R is insufficient to normalize lineage commitment in the absence of HDAC3, and HDAC3 must have additional mechanisms for regulation of CD8 lineage commitment. We have now added HDAC3 ChIP-qPCR studies, and demonstrate that HDAC3 binds to the Runx3, Patz1 and IL-21R loci in DP thymocytes, showing a direct role for HDAC3 in the regulation of these genes. In addition, we examined the binding of HDAC3 at Runx3 and Patz1 loci in (HDAC3-sufficient) OT-I CD8 SP thymocytes and OT-II CD4-SP thymocytes. Similar to WT DP thymocytes, HDAC3 remained bound to Runx3 and Patz1 loci in OT-II CD4 SP thymocytes. However, very little HDAC3 bound to the Runx3 and Patz1 loci in OT-I CD8 SP thymocytes, indicating that HDAC3 must be removed from these loci in the CD8 lineage. This data has been added as Figure 7 in the manuscript.
