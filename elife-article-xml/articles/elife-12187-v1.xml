congression, but the role of its catalytic activity remains controversial. Here, we use two novel Bub1 inhibitors, BAY-320 and BAY-524, to demonstrate potent Bub1 kinase inhibition both in vitro and in intact cells. Then, we compared the cellular phenotypes of Bub1 kinase inhibition in HeLa and RPE1 cells with those of protein depletion, indicative of catalytic or scaffolding functions, respectively. Bub1 inhibition affected chromosome association of Shugoshin and the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), without abolishing global Aurora B function. Consequently, inhibition of Bub1 kinase impaired chromosome arm resolution but exerted only minor effects on mitotic progression or SAC function. Importantly, BAY-320 and BAY-524 treatment sensitized cells to low doses of Paclitaxel, impairing both chromosome segregation and cell proliferation. These findings are relevant to our understanding of Bub1 kinase function and the prospects of targeting Bub1 for therapeutic applications.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12187.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12187.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12187.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA in our cells is packaged into structures called chromosomes.

This evolutionarily conserved surveillance mechanism monitors the status of kinetochore (KT)-microtubule (MT) interactions and delays anaphase onset until all chromosomes have undergone bipolar attachment to the spindle. Both KT-MT interactions and SAC activity are regulated by several KT-associated protein kinases, including Aurora B, Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) and Budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 (Bub1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Maciejowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Meraldi and Sorger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Santaguida et al., 2011</xref>). SAC activity depends on a diffusible inhibitor of the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), termed mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Musacchio, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sacristan and Kops, 2015</xref>). Once the SAC is silenced in response to chromosome biorientation, APC/C activation then triggers the onset of chromatid separation and mitotic exit, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Funabiki and Wynne, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The serine/threonine kinase Bub1 is one of the first proteins to accumulate at unattached kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jablonski et al., 1998</xref>). Its recruitment is governed by Mps1-dependent phosphorylation of MELT motifs on the KMN complex member KNL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">London et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Overlack et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shepperd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vleugel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yamagishi et al., 2012</xref>). Bub1 has been implicated in the regulation of chromosome cohesion, KT-MT interactions and SAC function. In particular, Bub1 was shown to be important for the centromere/KT recruitment of Shugoshin proteins (Sgo1 and Sgo2), the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) comprising Aurora B kinase, CENP-E, CENP-F, BubR1, Mad1 and Mad2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyarchuk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kitajima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klebig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perera et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>).</p><p>So far, only few substrates of Bub1 have been identified. Best characterized is the phosphorylation of histone H2A on threonine 120 (T120) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawashima et al., 2010</xref>). Phosphorylation of this site by Bub1 can be demonstrated not only in vitro but also in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawashima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sharp-Baker and Chen, 2001</xref>). Histone H2A phosphorylation on T120 triggers the centromere localization of Sgo1, which in turn recruits the CPC subunit Borealin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawashima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tsukahara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yamagishi et al., 2010</xref>). Centromere recruitment of the CPC is further enhanced by the kinase Haspin, which phosphorylates histone H3 at T3 and triggers the centromere binding of the CPC component Survivin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Another intriguing potential substrate of Bub1 is the APC/C co-activator Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tang et al., 2004a</xref>). Whether Bub1 phosphorylates Cdc20 in living cells remains to be determined, but recent studies strongly suggest that Bub1 binding to Cdc20 is important for SAC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Fiore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vleugel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Genetic, biochemical or siRNA-mediated depletion of Bub1 protein clearly interferes with chromosome alignment and SAC activity, but the importance of Bub1 catalytic activity has long been subject to debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolanos-Garcia and Blundell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elowe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Funabiki and Wynne, 2013</xref>). For example, while a Bub1 mutant completely lacking the kinase domain is checkpoint proficient in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernius and Hardwick, 2007</xref>), conflicting data have been reported on the importance of Bub1 kinase activity in fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rischitor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vanoosthuyse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yamaguchi et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, catalytically inactive Bub1 can sustain the SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sharp-Baker and Chen, 2001</xref>), although kinase-proficient Bub1 may be more efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyarchuk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen, 2004</xref>). In mammalian cells, several studies point to the conclusion that Bub1 mutants devoid of catalytic activity are able to restore many, albeit not all, aspects of chromosome congression and SAC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klebig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McGuinness et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Perera and Taylor, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ricke et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To address the role of Bub1 kinase activity in mammalian mitosis, we have made use of two novel small molecule inhibitors, BAY-320 and BAY-524. Using biochemical and cellular assays, we show that these ATP-competitive inhibitors potently and specifically block human Bub1 both in vitro and in living cells. By comparing phenotypes provoked by Bub1 kinase inhibition and Bub1 protein depletion, we are able to differentiate between catalytic and non-catalytic functions of Bub1. Our data indicate that Bub1 catalytic activity is largely dispensable for chromosome alignment and SAC function, arguing that Bub1 largely operates as a scaffolding protein. However, even though Bub1 inhibition per se exerts only minor effects on mitotic fidelity, BAY-320 and BAY-524 treatment sensitizes cells to clinically relevant low doses of Paclitaxel, resulting in remarkable impairment of chromosome segregation and cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BAY-320 and BAY-524 specifically inhibit Bub1 kinase</title><p>The chemical synthesis of small molecule inhibitors against Bub1 has recently been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hitchcock et al., 2013</xref>).

These studies revealed that near-maximal inhibition of Bub1 could be achieved by using BAY-320 at 3–10 μM and BAY-524 at 7–10 μM and these concentrations were therefore used in all future experiments on intact cells. To corroborate the above immunofluorescence data, histones were purified from control and inhibitor-treated cells. Examination of histone H2A phosphorylation by Western blotting revealed that treatment of cells with either BAY-320 or BAY-524 drastically reduced T120 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

In a first series of experiments, we used time-lapse imaging to compare progression through mitosis in asynchronously growing HeLa and RPE1 cells in response to either Bub1 inhibition or siRNA-mediated Bub1 depletion. In line with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kitajima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tang et al., 2004b</xref>), depletion of Bub1 from HeLa cells significantly prolonged duration of mitosis, due to delayed chromosome alignment and delays in prometa- and metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We therefore used an RPE1 cell line expressing one endogenous allele of Aurora B tagged with EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">von Schubert et al., 2015</xref>) to monitor the subcellular localization of this kinase in living cells. Following Bub1 inhibition, Aurora B-EGFP levels at chromosome arms increased approximately twofold, concomitant with the described reduction of Aurora B at centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyarchuk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ricke et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, this change in localization showed a strong correlation with the redistribution of Sgo2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). In contrast, treatment of cells with the Haspin inhibitor 5-Iodotubercidin did not induce any significant redistribution of Aurora B from centromeres to chromosome arms; instead, inhibition of Haspin caused an overall reduction of EGFP signals at both centromeres and chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Combined inhibition of Bub1 and Haspin displaced Aurora B from both centromeres and chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), in line with the analysis of fixed cells described above. Taken together, these data corroborate the notion that Bub1 and Haspin cooperate in the recruitment of CPC to centromeres through phosphorylation of histone H2A-T120 and histone H3-T3, respectively. In addition, they reveal a role for Bub1 kinase activity, but not Haspin, in restricting CPC localization to the centromere.</p><p>Considering the role of Aurora B kinase in the regulation of KT-MT interactions and SAC signaling, the above results raised the question of what contributions Bub1 activity might possibly make to chromosome congression and/or the SAC. Although our initial analyses had not revealed a major impact of BAY-320 or BAY-524 on the overall timing of mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we considered the possibility that inhibition of Bub1 might provoke compensatory effects on mitotic timing, notably a delay in congression and a concomitant acceleration of mitotic exit. According to such a scenario, effects on timing might conceivably cancel each other. In support of this possibility, we emphasize that the inhibition of mitotic kinases with pleiotropic functions have previously been shown to provoke opposing phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Santaguida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">von Schubert et al., 2015</xref>).

In the case of the SAC kinase Mps1, autophosphorylation constitutes a major mechanism for controlling Mps1 levels at KTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hewitt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jelluma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">von Schubert et al., 2015</xref>), and a recent study suggests that Bub1 turnover at KTs is also regulated by autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghar et al., 2015</xref>). To determine whether Bub1 dynamics at KTs is affected by inhibition of Bub1 activity, we made use of an RPE1 cell line harboring one allele of Bub1 tagged by EGFP at the endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). After the treatment of cells with nocodazole to assure complete MT depolymerization and full SAC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Santaguida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yang et al., 2009</xref>), Bub1 levels and turnover at KTs were measured by immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), respectively. In comparison to control cells, neither BAY-320 nor BAY-524 detectably affected steady-state Bub1 levels at KTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>), in line with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). More importantly, FRAP experiments revealed only minor effects of Bub1 inhibition on Bub1 dynamics at KTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The extent of fluorescence recovery after FRAP was not significantly different in control cells and inhibitor treated cells, revealing an immobile fraction of ~42%, in excellent agreement with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howell et al., 2004</xref>). The half-time of Bub1 recovery at KTs after FRAP was ~18 sec in controls, again in good agreement with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howell et al., 2004</xref>). However, whereas Asghar and colleagues observed a ~50% reduction in the half-time of recovery of an exogenously expressed, catalytically inactive EGFP-Bub1 mutant, we found that recovery of endogenously tagged wild-type EGFP-Bub1 was only marginally accelerated by Bub1 inhibition (half-time reduced from 18 s to 12–15 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). When considering this discrepancy, it is important to bear in mind that our data reflect turnover of chemically inhibited wild-type Bub1 expressed at endogenous levels, whereas Ashghar and colleagues monitored mutant versions of overexpressed Bub1, raising the possibility that their results may have been influenced by expression levels and/or mutation-induced structural alterations. We conclude that the effects of Bub1 activity on Bub1 turnover at KTs are at most minor, particularly when compared to the striking effects of Mps1 activity on Mps1 dynamics at KTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hewitt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jelluma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">von Schubert et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As a further read-out for the effects of Bub1 inhibition on SAC activity, we used live cell imaging to monitor the responses of nocodazole-arrested HeLa and RPE1 cells to BAY-320 or BAY-524 and compared these to the responses seen in Bub1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Over a 24 hr observation period, the percentage of HeLa cells maintaining a SAC arrest dropped from 17% in controls to 4% and 2% in response to Bub1 inhibition by BAY-320 and BAY-524, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, left panel). These shifts in cell fates were largely compensated by increases in the percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis, from 74% in controls to 94% in Bub1-inhibited cells. In contrast, although the duration of mitosis was slightly reduced upon Bub1 inhibition, the extent of mitotic slippage remained at less than 10% under all conditions. In RPE1 cells, maintenance of SAC arrest over 24 hr was more pronounced, but again the percentage of arrested cells dropped from 61% in controls to 51%/44% in response to Bub1-inhibition, with increasing proportions of cells undergoing apoptosis or mitotic slippage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, left panel). For comparison, depletion of Bub1 from either HeLa or RPE1 cells resulted in a 2–3 fold increase in mitotic slippage at the expense of apoptosis, while the proportion of cells sustaining an arrest remained roughly constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>, right panels). Collectively, these results indicate that Bub1 activity contributes to the maintenance of maximal SAC activity, but that Bub1 protein levels are more important, most likely reflecting the observed role of Bub1 in the KT recruitment of SAC components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we also compared the requirements for Bub1 activity and Bub1 protein in a cellular background in which SAC activity was partially compromised by the treatment of HeLa or RPE1 cells with a low dose of Reversine, a widely used inhibitor of the SAC kinase Mps1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Santaguida et al., 2010</xref>). In agreement with the results described above, Bub1 inhibition marginally reduced the time that Reversine-treated cells remained arrested before overriding nocodazole-induced arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>, left panels). Addition of Aurora B or Plk1 inhibitors, used as positive controls, led to the expected shortening of the duration of mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>, left panels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Saurin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">von Schubert et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, Bub1 depletion also caused a drastic shortening of arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>, right panels). Taken together with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klebig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Perera and Taylor, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perera et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ricke et al., 2012</xref>), these observations demonstrate that the scaffolding function of Bub1 is required for the SAC, but its catalytic activity is largely dispensable.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Bub1 inhibition does not significantly impair chromosome congression</title><p>To analyze the impact of Bub1 inhibition on chromosome alignment, we treated cells with the Eg5 inhibitor Monastrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kapoor et al., 2000</xref>) and then monitored the restoration of KT-MT attachments during spindle bipolarization in response to drug washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). While nearly 28% of Bub1-depleted cells failed to completely align all chromosomes, more than 90% of Bub1-inhibited cells showed complete alignment that was indistinguishable from control cells. Inhibition of Aurora B, analyzed for control, resulted in the expected impairment of alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). To complement these assays, we also used immunofluorescence microscopy to quantify the frequency of micronucleation, a read-out for chromosome segregation errors, in HeLa and RPE1 cells. While partial inhibition of Aurora B kinase provoked an increase in micronucleation in both cell lines, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gohard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tao et al., 2009</xref>), Bub1 inhibition only marginally increased the frequency of micronucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This result supports the view that Bub1 inhibition causes surprisingly mild defects in chromosome congression or segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). Further corroborating this conclusion, we found that BAY-320 or BAY-524 treatment exerted no significant effects on the kinetochore recruitment of the motor protein CENP-E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>, left panels). In contrast, Bub1 depletion reduced CENP-E levels at KTs by ~40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>, right panels), in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sharp-Baker and Chen, 2001</xref>). Taken together, these results show that Bub1 kinase activity is largely dispensable for chromosome congression and segregation. It follows that even though Bub1 inhibition results in a marked reduction of Aurora B levels at centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), these levels are still sufficient to ensure largely faithful chromosome segregation. Conversely, Bub1 protein is clearly important for efficient chromosome congression, presumably reflecting the role of Bub1 in CENP-E recruitment to KTs.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12187.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Bub1 inhibition does not significantly affect chromosome congression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa S3 cells were transfected with control (Gl2) or Bub1 siRNA-oligonucleotides for 48 hr, synchronized by thymidine block and released for 12 hr in the presence of the Eg5 inhibitor monastrol to induce the formation of monopolar spindles.

Thus, we asked how inhibition of Bub1 kinase activity by BAY-320 or BAY-524 would impact on cells in which MT dynamics was compromised by low doses of Paclitaxel. Importantly, when used at clinically relevant doses of 1–4 nM, Paclitaxel induces spindle defects and aneuploidy without delaying mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brito and Rieder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Horwitz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ikui et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janssen et al., 2009</xref>). While single treatment with 1–4 nM Paclitaxel produced modest impairment of cell proliferation, the concomitant application of the Bub1 inhibitors, BAY-320 at 3 μM or BAY-524 at 7 or 10 μM, clearly exacerbated inhibition of proliferation. Effects were particularly drastic in aneuploid HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>, top panels), while diploid RPE1 cells were less affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>, bottom panels).

However, the role of the catalytic activity of Bub1 in different species remained a matter of debate. Here, we have characterized two novel small molecule inhibitors of Bub1, BAY-320 and BAY-524, and used these reagents to explore the role of Bub1 catalytic activity in mitotic processes. A systematic comparison of the phenotypic consequences of Bub1 inhibition with those of siRNA-mediated Bub1 depletion leads us to conclude that Bub1 functions primarily as a scaffolding protein. However, we see prominent effects of Bub1 kinase inhibition on chromosome arm cohesion and CPC localization and subtle effects on mitotic progression, including the efficacy of the SAC. Finally, we demonstrate a striking synergy between inhibition of Bub1 activity and Paclitaxel-induced interference with MT dynamics, which manifests itself in a marked increase in chromosome segregation errors and drastically reduced cell proliferation. Our results contribute to clarify the role of Bub1 kinase activity in different mitotic processes.

In addition to inhibiting phosphorylation of histone H2A-T120, both compounds cause a persistence of chromosome arm cohesion, validating their efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawashima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, in vitro assays performed on a large panel of kinases showed that inhibition of off-target substrates required at least 20x higher concentrations of BAY-320 than inhibition of Bub1, and for one potentially relevant off-target, the kinase Haspin, we show that intracellular phosphorylation of a major substrate of this kinase is not decreased by inhibitor concentrations that effectively inhibit Bub1. Furthermore, a binding assay performed on a panel of 403 human kinases documents exquisite selectivity of BAY-320 for Bub1. Thus, we are confident that these new Bub1 inhibitors constitute highly effective and specific tools to explore the role of Bub1 kinase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Impact of Bub1 inhibition on mitotic progression</title><p>The major conclusion emerging from the present study is that the overall impact of Bub1 inhibition on mitotic progression is surprisingly mild, clearly less severe than the impact of Bub1 depletion. This reinforces the notion that the requirement for Bub1 during chromosome congression and segregation primarily reflects a scaffolding function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernius and Hardwick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klebig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Perera and Taylor, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rischitor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sharp-Baker and Chen, 2001</xref>). It is difficult to exclude that a small fraction of total Bub1 kinase activity might be refractory to inhibition and suffice for functionality, but we emphasize that genetic elimination of Bub1 kinase activity is compatible with mouse development, arguing similarly against an essential role of Bub1 kinase activity for mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ricke et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, inhibitor studies and genetic data concur to indicate that lack of Bub1 kinase activity produces only mild disturbances of mitotic progression.</p><p>We show that Bub1 inhibition by BAY-320 or BAY-524 results in loss of Shugoshin and CPC subunits proteins from centromeres/KTs, and that CPC levels at these locations are further reduced upon simultaneous inhibition of Bub1 and Haspin, in line with the established roles of these kinases in the phosphorylation of histones H2A-T120 and H3-T3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yamagishi et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, both Sgo2 and Aurora B relocalize to chromosome arms when Bub1 is inhibited. Phosphorylation of Sgo2 by Aurora B promotes Sgo2 interaction with phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tanno et al., 2010</xref>), and PP2A in turn protects cohesin proteins against phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kitajima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Riedel et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, colocalization of Sgo2 and Aurora B in Bub1-inhibited cells provides a straightforward explanation for the observed persistence of arm cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kitajima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perera et al., 2007</xref>). However, alternative mechanisms should not be excluded and it might be rewarding to explore a possible connection between Bub1 kinase and the Sororin-Wapl pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peters and Nishiyama, 2012</xref>).</p><p>It may appear surprising that the persistent chromosome arm cohesion observed in Bub1 inhibited cells did not markedly prolong mitotic timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, we note that depletion of Wapl also causes persistent cohesion without significantly affecting mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lara-Gonzalez and Taylor, 2012</xref>). In contrast to Bub1 inhibition, depletion of Bub1 markedly extended mitotic timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). One straightforward explanation for this observation is that Bub1 depletion, but not Bub1 inhibition, caused the displacement of CENP-E from KTs, a motor protein required for efficient chromosome congression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bancroft et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Putkey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tanudji et al., 2004</xref>). A mechanism centered on CENP-E may also explain the observation that Bub1 depletion exerted a more extensive mitotic delay in the hypertriploid HeLa cells than in diploid RPE1 cells. Considering the important role of Aurora B in the regulation of KT-MT interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carmena et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Funabiki and Wynne, 2013</xref>), it is remarkable that the observed reduction of centromere/KT-associated CPC caused by Bub1 inhibition did not exert a more profound effect on the fidelity of chromosome segregation. This suggests that approximately half the normal centromere/KT levels of CPC are sufficient to confer functionality. In line with this conclusion, we note that partial impairment of CPC recruitment to centromeres/KTs did not abolish viability or trigger extensive defects in chromosome segregation in budding yeast or chicken DT40 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Desai, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yue et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition of Bub1 kinase activity did not significantly reduce the KT recruitment of Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1 and barely affected the ability of nocodazole-treated cells to maintain a SAC arrest. Even when SAC activity was compromised by partial inhibition of the SAC kinase Mps1, Bub1 inhibition triggered only minor weakening of SAC signaling. In striking contrast, Bub1 depletion produced a drastic weakening of the SAC in this sensitized background. For comparison, combined inhibition of Mps1 and either Plk1 or Aurora B resulted in a complete SAC shutdown and immediate mitotic exit, in line with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Saurin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">von Schubert et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively these findings confirm that mitotic functions of Bub1 depend primarily on Bub1 protein rather than kinase activity. In future, it will be interesting to explore whether Bub1 activity contributes to purported non-mitotic functions of Bub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nyati et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yang et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Use of Bub1 inhibitors for therapeutic applications</title><p>Inhibition of SAC kinases has emerged as a potentially attractive strategy to kill tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janssen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Salmela and Kallio, 2013</xref>). Several inhibitors of the SAC kinase Mps1 were shown to exert anti-tumor effects in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colombo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kusakabe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tannous et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tardif et al., 2011</xref>), but toxicity associated with single agent therapy remains a concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, combination of anti-SAC compounds with MT-targeting agents may constitute a more rewarding strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jemaà et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maia et al., 2015</xref>). Our present data suggest that it may be attractive to use inhibitors of Bub1 in combinatorial therapy. While BAY-320 and BAY-524 had comparatively little effect on mitotic progression when used as single agents, they showed extensive anti-proliferative activity, accompanied by strong increases in chromosome segregation errors, when combined with therapeutic doses of Paclitaxel. A plausible explanation for this synergy is that Paclitaxel increases KT-MT attachment errors to levels that can no longer be corrected when Aurora B/CPC is partially displaced upon Bub1 inhibition. Interestingly, these synergistic effects were substantially more pronounced in aneuploid HeLa cells than in near-diploid RPE1 cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic window. These findings clearly encourage further exploration of the potential use of Bub1 inhibitors for therapeutic applications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of BAY-320 and BAY-524 inhibitors</title><p>BAY-320 and BAY-524 were synthesized as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hitchcock et al., 2013</xref>).

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Probing the catalytic functions of Bub1 kinase using the small molecule inhibitors BAY-320 and BAY-524&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors (Jonathon Pines). The evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study the authors have developed small molecule inhibitors that specifically inhibit the Bub1 kinase. They demonstrate the specificity of their inhibitors in vitro on a panel of kinases, and in vivo using phosphorylation of Histone H2A threonine 120 as a read out. They show that inhibiting Bub1 causes mild effects on the timing of mitosis and on chromosome congression, but causes persistent cohesion of chromosomes arms concomitant with the chromosome passenger complex remaining on the arms. Although the effects of the Bub1 kinase inhibitors alone only mildly affect mitosis, they have a synergistic effect with low doses of taxol.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers recognised the quality of the study, and that specific Bub1 kinase inhibitors would be very useful research tools. There were two major experimental concerns, however:</p><p>1) More evidence for the specificity of the compounds should be presented. At present this mostly consists of a patent and kinase assays on a panel of kinases.</p><p>2) Are the effects of the compounds in cells specific to inhibiting Bub1? The authors are using a relatively high concentration of the inhibitors (3 and 7 μM for BAY-320 and BAY-524, respectively), and the toxic concentration is 10 μM. Moreover, there is still some residual H2A-T120 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), which suggests Bub1 activity is not maximally inhibited under these conditions.</p><p>Please address these concerns by providing further experimental data. For example, what are the phenotypes of cells treated with the inhibitors in which Bub1 has been depleted and rescued with a kinase-dead construct? If the inhibitors are specific to Bub1 there should be no further effect of the inhibitors.</p><p>In addition to this experimental concern, the reviewers suggest some re-writing is required to clarify what is currently known about the function of Bub1 kinase activity. One reviewer makes the following suggestions:</p><p>“I would suggest that much of the general introductory material in paragraphs 1 and 2 be condensed. Also, the last paragraph that summarises the results can be replaced by a single sentence, e.g. ‘To address the role of Bub1 kinase activity we characterised two novel inhibitors BAY-320 and BAY-524’. Condensing this text will then allow the authors to provide more detail with regards to what is known about Bub1. For example, in the Results they describe Sgo1, that H2A is a substrate, the link with Haspin etc.; this should all be in the Introduction. Also, what is the prior art regarding Bub1's kinase activity? They say it is controversial but I don't think that is sufficient. Indeed, there is literature that supports the authors’ claims and this should be included. By way of an example, Perera at al deleted Bub1 in MEFs and added back kinase-dead mutants showing that a catalytic mutant or a mutant lacking the entire kinase domain restored BubR1 localisation, SAC function and chromosome alignment but failed to restore Sgo1 localisation. Klebig et al. described similar findings using an RNAi-complementation assay. Similarly, McGuinness et al. showed that in meiosis I, a Bub1 mutant lacking the entire kinase domain restored SAC function. There are other primary papers that should be cited here, e.g. describing work in various model systems. NB, as alluded to above, the authors could highlight the technical challenges with complementation assays as a means of justifying the use of small molecule inhibitors.”</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12187.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>All three reviewers recognised the quality of the study, and that specific Bub1 kinase inhibitors would be very useful research tools. There were two major experimental concerns, however:</italic></p><p><italic>1) More evidence for the specificity of the compounds should be presented. At present this mostly consists of a patent and kinase assays on a panel of kinases.</italic></p><p>In the original manuscript we had reported the results of inhibition assays on a panel of 222 protein kinases. To further document the specificity and selectivity of the Bub1 inhibitors we have now performed two additional experiments:</p><p>Firstly, using BAY-320 we have conducted an inhibitor-binding assay (DiscoveRx assay) on a vast panel of human kinases, including mitotic kinases. As we show in the new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>, BAY-320 showed exquisite binding to Bub1 and at most marginal interaction with any one of 407 other human kinases. This survey thus demonstrates high selectivity of BAY-320 for its target.</p><p>Secondly, we have generated dose-response curves using an “in-cell western assay” detecting phospho-Thr 120 signals in mitotically arrested HeLa cells (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This assay yielded an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 379 +/- 156 nM for BAY-320 (at cellular levels of ATP), in reasonable agreement with the IC<sub>50</sub> determined by in vitro phosphorylation at 2mM ATP (680 nM).</p><p>As with all small molecules, definitive proof of selectivity in a cellular context is nearly impossible to obtain. However, we emphasize that both BAY-320 and BAY-524 have gone through extensive validation in the course of drug development at Bayer; this, combined with the absence of any unpredicted phenotypic effects, makes us highly confident of the selectivity of these compounds.</p><p><italic>2) Are the effects of the compounds in cells specific to inhibiting Bub1? The authors are using a relatively high concentration of the inhibitors (3 and 7 μM for BAY-320 and BAY-524, respectively), and the toxic concentration is 10 μM. Moreover, there is still some residual H2A-T120 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), which suggests Bub1 activity is not maximally inhibited under these conditions.</italic></p><p><italic>Please address these concerns by providing further experimental data. For example, what are the phenotypes of cells treated with the inhibitors in which Bub1 has been depleted and rescued with a kinase-dead construct? If the inhibitors are specific to Bub1 there should be no further effect of the inhibitors.</italic></p><p>As we stated above (see response to concern No. 1), dose-response curves obtained from “in-cell western” assays show maximal reduction of Thr120 phosphorylation between 3.0 and 10.0 μM, a concentration range used in key experiments throughout this study. These new results are in full agreement with the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, even though they were obtained using different methodology and a different anti-phospho-Thr120 antibody. Thus, although the argument of ‘residual activity’ is difficult to rigorously exclude, we are confident that an increase in concentration &gt;10 μM would be unlikely to change the outcome of our experiments.</p><p>To further document the specificity of the phenotypes produced by BAY-B320 and BAY-B524 treatment, we have included additional data to complement the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> (see new Figure—figure supplement 1 A and B). Specifically, we compared the effects of inhibitor treatment on Thr120 H2A phosphorylation and Aurora B signals at centromeres/KTs over a vast range of inhibitor concentrations. Interestingly, changes in H2A phosphorylation and Aurora B centromere/KT levels correlate nicely at all concentrations below 10 μM, but no further effect on Aurora B could be observed at concentrations above 10 μM. This argues that, once Bub1 is maximally inhibited (at 10 μM), no further impact on Aurora B localization is triggered by our compounds, attesting to specificity.</p><p>From a more general perspective, we emphasize that the two Bub1 inhibitors did not trigger any phenotypes that could not also be observed in response to Bub1 depletion, arguing strongly against off-target effects. Thus, we are confident that our observations specifically reflect Bub1 inhibition.</p><p>We have also carefully considered the suggested rescue experiment, but in the end decided against attempting it. Although such an experiment appears plausible at first glance, it would be technically very difficult and, in our opinion, not necessarily conclusive. Any additional effect produced by Bub1 inhibition in a cell depleted of wild-type Bub1 (and rescued by catalytically inactive Bub1) could in fact be attributed to inhibition of residual, depletion-resistant wild-type Bub1.</p><p><italic>In addition to this experimental concern, the reviewers suggest some re-writing is required to clarify what is currently known about the function of Bub1 kinase activity. One reviewer makes the following suggestions:“I would suggest that much of the general introductory material in paragraphs 1 and 2 be condensed. Also, the last paragraph that summarises the results can be replaced by a single sentence, e.g. ‘To address the role of Bub1 kinase activity we characterised two novel inhibitors BAY-320 and BAY-524’.

There are other primary papers that should be cited here, e.g. describing work in various model systems.”</italic></p><p>We have re-written major parts of the Introduction and Results sections. In particular, we have shortened the opening paragraphs of the Introduction, moved introductory material from the former Results section, and discussed prior studies on the role of Bub1 activity in more detail. We are grateful for these referee suggestions and feel that the text of our revised manuscript has gained in clarity.</p><p><italic>“NB, as alluded to above, the authors could highlight the technical challenges with complementation assays as a means of justifying the use of small molecule inhibitors.”</italic></p><p>To address this comment, we have added a sentence on technical challenges of genetic studies and advantages of small molecule inhibitors (Discussion).</p></body></sub-article></article>
