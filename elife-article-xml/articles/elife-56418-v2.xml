IMPDH1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, impacting the cellular pools of GMP, GDP and GTP. Guanine nucleotide homeostasis is central to photoreceptor cells, where cGMP is the signal transducing molecule in the light response. Mutations in IMPDH1 lead to inherited blindness. We unveil a light-dependent phosphorylation of retinal IMPDH1 at Thr<sup>159</sup>/Ser<sup>160</sup> in the Bateman domain that desensitizes the enzyme to allosteric inhibition by GDP/GTP. When exposed to bright light, living mice increase the rate of GTP and ATP synthesis in their retinas; concomitant with IMPDH1 aggregate formation at the outer segment layer. Inhibiting IMPDH activity in living mice delays rod mass recovery. We unveil a novel mechanism of regulation of IMPDH1 in vivo, important for understanding GTP homeostasis in the retina and the pathogenesis of adRP10 IMPDH1 mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mutations in inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1), the enzyme responsible for the first and rate-limiting step in GTP synthesis, are associated to severe forms of inherited blindness. At least nine mutations have been associated to the RP10 form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, that primarily manifests as night blindness and gradually progresses to loss of central vision: R224P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kennan et al., 2002</xref>); D226N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowne et al., 2002</xref>); R231P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grover et al., 2004</xref>); T116M, V268I, G324D, H372P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowne et al., 2006a</xref>); K238E and K238R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wada et al., 2005</xref>). Together they account for about 1% of adRP cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sullivan et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>IMPDH1</italic> mutations have also been associated to rare autosomal dominant Lebers Congenital Amaurosis (adLCA), characterized by nearly complete blindness from an early age: R105W and N198K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowne et al., 2006a</xref>). Despite the ubiquitous nature of guanine nucleotide synthesis, clinical manifestations of <italic>IMPDH1</italic> mutations are limited to the retina, for reasons that are not yet understood.</p><p>RP10 mutations are allegedly ‘gain-of-function’ mutations, given that IMPDH1 knock-out mice present only a mild retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aherne et al., 2004</xref>). Mutations do not directly affect IMPDH1 catalytic activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aherne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mortimer and Hedstrom, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). IMPDH1 capacity to bind single-stranded nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mortimer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hedstrom, 2008</xref>) as well as IMPDH1 tendency to aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aherne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tam et al., 2008</xref>) have been proposed to contribute to the pathophysiology. More recently, structural studies have provided a new framework to interpret the effect of mutations, by revealing the allosteric inhibition of eukaryotic IMPDHs by GDP/GTP binding to the Bateman domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buey et al., 2015</xref>). GDP/GTP binding sites at the Bateman domain overlap with several of the residues mutated in adRP10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buey et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>There are two IMPDH isozymes, IMPDH1 and IMPDH2, that are 84% identical. While most human tissues show only basal IMPDH1 and high IMPDH2 expression, the retina is one of a few exceptions where IMPDH1 predominates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hedstrom, 2009</xref>). In the retina, major unique IMPDH1 spliced forms outweigh the canonical 514aa protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowne et al., 2006b</xref>).</p><p>Purine nucleotide homeostasis is vital for many basic functions of the cell. Cells use different pathways to synthesize purine nucleotides and balance the guanine and adenine pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In de novo biosynthesis, a purine ring is assembled over ribose 5´-phosphate by sequential enzymatic steps that use precursors of the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pedley and Benkovic, 2017</xref>). In this pathway, inosine monophosphate (IMP) is the first molecule with a complete purine ring and is the common precursor for GTP and ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). IMPDH catalyzes the first committed step to GTP synthesis. In <italic>de salvage</italic> pathways, nucleotides are produced from recycled purine bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>De novo and <italic>salvage</italic> pathways of purine synthesis in eukaryotic cells.</title><p>Metabolites and enzymes of the de novo pathway in black, and the salvage pathway in blue.

IMPDH1 is responsible for the rate-limiting and first committed step in de novo GTP biosynthesis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56418-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>IMPDH monomers consist of a catalytic and a regulatory domain. The catalytic domain is a (β/α)<sub>8</sub> TIM barrel that catalyzes two sequential reactions that convert IMP to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) in a NAD dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hedstrom, 2009</xref>). GMP acts as a competitive inhibitor of enzymatic activity at this level, by binding to the IMP pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hedstrom, 2009</xref>). The regulatory Bateman domain consists of two cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) repeats that act as ATP and GTP sensors to mediate allosteric modulation of catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labesse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anthony et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Justel et al., 2019</xref>). In eukaryotes, binding of adenine nucleotides (ATP/ADP/AMP) induces the formation of extended octamers that remain fully active, while GDP/GTP binding induces the formation of compacted octamers with significantly reduced catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labesse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buey et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The fact that most <italic>IMPDH1</italic> mutations associated to RP10 overlap with GDP/GTP binding sites at the CBS domain and result in diminished GDP/GTP negative allosteric control of human IMPDH1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Justel et al., 2019</xref>) points to the physiological relevance of this allosteric mechanism in vivo.</p><p>IMPDH can form mesoscale filamentous structures in mammalian cells (spicules or cytoophidia) under conditions that require higher IMPDH activity to keep with GTP demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aughey and Liu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keppeke et al., 2018</xref>), like high rates of proliferation, or Gln/Ser/folate-metabolite deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keppeke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calise et al., 2016</xref>). Formation of these reversible fiber-like subcellular structures is believed to transiently boost IMPDH activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keppeke et al., 2018</xref>). Reversible formation of IMPDH fibers could be recently induced in vitro from recombinant proteins, revealing that most adRP10 IMPDH1 mutants form filaments but fail to disassemble them due to their inability to sense adenine and guanine nucleotides at the Bateman domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Justel et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about the relevance of IMPDH1 catalytic activity in photoreceptor cells of the retina or its physiological regulation in vivo. We here report the first posttranslational modifications of IMPDH1 in native retinal tissue, associated to dark/light states. We show that the predominant retinal splice form of IMPDH1 is phosphorylated at the Bateman domain (T159/S160) in response to light in vivo; and that this phosphorylation desensitizes the enzyme to GDP/GTP allosteric inhibition of catalytic activity in vitro. Together, these results reveal a novel light-dependent regulatory mechanism that impedes IMPDH allosteric inhibition, facilitating the elevated GTP levels required for phototransduction. Supporting the proposed mechanism, we show that exposure of living mice to bright light results in an increase in the global flux through de novo purine nucleotide synthesis in the retina, which correlates with a progressive accumulation of IMPDH1 aggregates at the outer segment layer. Furthermore, inhibition of IMPDH activity in living mice by intravitreal injection of IMPDH inhibitors has a moderate but consistent effect on mass rod response recovery measured by electroretinogram. Thereby, our results point to the de novo GTP synthesis being relevant to sustain the GTP pool during constant light exposure, likely to withstand the increased cGMP turn-over.

In the bovine system, in which calf eyes were dark-adapted in situ for 1 hr and retinas were processed in darkness or after 5 m of bright light exposure, T159/S160 was preferentially phosphorylated in response to light, S477 in the dark-adapted state, and S416 indistinctly at both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The effect of these phosphorylation events on hIMPDH1 catalytic activity in vitro was determined in enzymatic assays with the corresponding phosphomimetic mutants. The S416D mutation significantly reduces retinal hIMPDH1 catalytic activity. However, because S416 phosphorylation does not appear to be regulated by light, we speculate that this phosphorylation event may respond to metabolic stress or nutrient deficiency (manifested in the phosphoproteomic analysis due to the 1 hr maintenance of the retinas in Locke´s -lacking Ser/Gly- during dark adaptation), to direct IMP towards ATP synthesis. In this respect, S416 maps at a region that resembles a consensus site for AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hardie, 2011</xref>), although the AMPK (A2/B2/G1) recombinant human isoform did not recognize hIMPDH1-546aa as a substrate in in vitro phosphorylation assays in this study. We believe that S416 phosphorylation would have a limited contribution to regulation of the enzyme by light in vivo under physiological conditions.</p><p>Actually, isoelectrofocusing separation of retinal extracts from dark-adapted or light-adapted living mice revealed that &gt;60% of the protein is phosphorylated under physiological conditions; with the predominant monophosphorylated form corresponding to phosphorylated T159/S160 in the light state and S477 in the dark state (based on the mass spectrometry data); and di-phosphorylated forms likely reflecting slow dephosphorylation kinetics of the reciprocal site.</p><p>S477D substitution did not have a direct effect on enzymatic activity neither on GTP allosteric regulation of the enzyme. Thereby, we speculate that S477 phosphorylation might be involved in other aspects of enzyme regulation in vivo: for example inducing filament disassembly. To this respect, a recently reported structure of IMPDH2 polymers has revealed details of the interface that mediates cytoophidia assembly: the 12 amino-terminal residues of the canonical IMPDH2 isoform extend from the catalytic domain to bind into the adjacent molecule, in a shallow surface groove formed by a short helix (476-485), two beta strands (51-63), and two short loops (355-360, 379-380), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson and Kollman, 2020</xref>). Strikingly, S477 maps into the short helix at the IMPDH2 cytoophidia longitudinal contact interface, allowing us to speculate that phosphorylation of S477 in IMPDH1 might disrupt cytoophidia assembly. Additionally, S477 phosphorylation might also be implied in protein translocation from outer to proximal photoreceptor compartments during dark-adaptation after a period of bright light exposure, or regulating local IMPDH1 interactions with other proteins. Further experiments are needed to corroborate these hypotheses.</p><p>We here demonstrate that the T159D and S160D (or T159E and S160E) substitutions increased about 5-fold the K<sub>1/2</sub> for GDP/GTP inhibitory allosteric regulation of the enzyme in vitro, suggesting that light-dependent phosphorylation of these residues in vivo would effectively desensitize the enzyme to GDP/GTP allosteric control and promote enzyme activation.</p><p>Light-dependent activation of IMPDH1 might seem at odds with the assumption in the field that GMP, generated from cGMP hydrolysis during light exposure, would act as a negative feedback regulator of purine nucleotide synthesis by inhibiting IMPDH1, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate synthetase (PRS), and the first enzyme of the purinosome Glutamine phosphoribosyl amidotransferase (GPA). However, by performing an in vivo metabolic flux analysis of purine nucleotide synthesis in dark/light conditions following an intravitreal injection of labeled glycine, we found that the purinosome activity was substantially increased with light, with IMP levels nearly doubling in light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We found that IMP, GMP and AMP levels all increased with light; as did the incorporation of labeled atoms of glycine into these nucleotides. The overall de novo purine nucleotide synthesis increased in the retinas of living mice exposed to bright light.</p><p>Considering these results, we believe that most of the GMP increase observed upon light exposure by HPLC actually reflects the light-driven overall increase in de novo purine nucleotide synthesis, rather than the GMP coming from cGMP hydrolysis alone. It is likely that the fraction of GMP coming from the hydrolysis of cGMP would be under detection by HPLC, given that cGMP itself is under detection by HPLC in retinal extracts. cGMP levels in retinal extracts have been classically determined by radioimmunoassay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farber and Lolley, 1974</xref>).</p><p>By aligning our results with recent IMPDH structure/function studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Justel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson and Kollman, 2020</xref>), we propose the model of IMPDH1 regulation outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of regulation of IMPDH1 activity in photoreceptor cells by light-dependent phosphorylation at T159/S160.</title><p>In the dark, IMPDH1 is sensitive to GTP. GTP can bind to the nucleotide binding sites at the Bateman domain and shift IMPDH1 conformation towards GTP-bound IMPDH1 compacted octamers that are inactive (negative feedback regulation in red). Upon light exposure, phosphorylation at T159/S160 desensitizes the enzyme to GTP, coinciding in time with the increase in IMP levels. We propose that these concurring conditions would cause filamentation of the enzyme, leading to protein aggregation at the outer segment layer. In this way, light exposure would stabilize IMPDH1 in an active conformation permissive to the increased flux towards guanine and adenine nucleotide synthesis (thicker arrows in light). This increased flux is likely required to compensate for ATP and GTP consumption in the phototransduction process, to sustain the pools of ATP and GTP. IMPDH1 localization at the outer segment layer in these macrostructures would be reverted by dephosphorylation and gradual decrease of IMP levels during dark-adaptation. The model would predict a concerted modulation of ADSS/ADSL and the purinosome.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56418-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In the dark, IMPDH1 would be sensitive to GDP/GTP inhibitory allosteric control (negative feedback in red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).

This fact reflects that GTP levels are much higher in photoreceptors than in most cell types, where ATP:GTP levels are between 3:1 to 5:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Traut, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sumita et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Upon light exposure, phosphorylation at T159/S160 would dramatically decrease the affinity for GDP/GTP for the canonical site 1 in the Bateman domain, impeding IMPDH1 allosteric inhibition (decreased negative feedback, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This would be consistent with the increase in the overall flux towards de novo purine nucleotide synthesis measured in light (thicker arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Furthermore, structural models have shown that depletion of guanine nucleotides induces the assembly of extended octamers into enzymatically active filaments in vitro, that are further stabilized at high IMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson and Kollman, 2020</xref>). Accordingly, our results suggest that IMPDH1 filamentation is concurrent with the light-driven increase in IMP levels. We speculate that filament formation is what leads to the gradual accumulation of IMPDH1 protein aggregates at the outer segment layer of the retina upon constant light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This aggregate formation in vivo is reversible and does not correlate with changes in protein expression, which excludes that it results from transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>IMPDH cellular aggregates are a landmark of cells or tissues with increased GTP demand and/or circumstances of metabolic GTP deficiency that require stimulation of GTP biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aughey and Liu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keppeke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calise et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu, 2016</xref>). A recent in vivo study has shown, for instance, that IMPDH1 formation of filaments is inherent to T cell activation and proliferation, triggered at a post-translational level by NFAT or mTOR signaling, and serves to increase guanine nucleotide levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duong-Ly et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>IMPDH1 aggregation upon light exposure points to a requirement to expand the GTP pool in the light condition. Furthermore, the increased synthesis of IMP, AMP and GMP points to an expansion of both ATP and GTP pools. In this context, the light exerted regulation on IMPDH1 could serve to promote and stabilize an active conformation of the protein that is permissive to this increased flux to purine nucleotides. Presumably IMPDH1 regulation would be part of a concerted global regulation of the purine synthesis pathway in vivo, involving other metabolic enzymes.</p><p>The fact that light-dependent IMPDH1 aggregates accumulate at the outer segment layer suggests that the light induced GTP demand is due to phototransduction. In light conditions, GTP at the outer segment would be consumed in its conversion to GDP by transducin GTPase, and to cGMP by retinal guanylate cyclase activity. By performing simultaneous electroretinogram recordings from both eyes of mice intravitreally injected with an IMPDH inhibitor or control saline buffer we discarded that inhibiting IMPDH had a noticeable effect on activation of the light response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, inhibiting IMPDH caused a delay in mass rod response recovery, that was modest but statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thereby, we conclude that de novo GTP biosynthesis contributes to cGMP replenishment during the recovery phase of the light response, even if cGMP can be substantially sustained in dark-adapted responses by the <italic>salvage</italic> pathways.</p><p>In this respect, retinal GTP levels upon light exposure were reported to be maintained when it was living mice that were exposed to light, or in situ retinas kept in supplemented tissue culture medium (with glycine and serine), like in Du et al. study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2016</xref>) and this study. In contrast, reports of light causing a clear decrease in GTP come from determinations performed in isolated ROS/RIS preparations or retinas kept in Ringers, that cannot sustain one-carbon metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biernbaum and Bownds, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salceda et al., 1982</xref>).</p><p>According to our model it might seem surprising that Impdh1-/- mice display only a slowly progressive retinal degeneration. However, despite maintenance of the retinal structure, these mice present gradually diminished ERG responses from normal at 5 m to nearly extinguished at 13 m of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aherne et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, compensatory changes like upregulation of IMPDH2 cannot be excluded in this chronic scenario.</p><p>We here demonstrate that the light-dependent phosphorylated residues T159 and S160 in retinal hIMPDH1 were selective in vitro substrates for PKCα kinase; but not for the other kinases tested [PKA, PKC, PKG, CamKII, CKII, PKB-Akt and AMPK]. We also show that treatment of retinas with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide in situ led to a noticeable decrease of GTP retinal levels upon light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>); and its intravitreal injection caused a delay in mass rod recovery similar to that caused by IMPDH inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We know from our phosphoproteomic analysis that the phosphorylation events that prime PKCα occur in the retina in response to light. Therefore, we propose a model in which light triggers a signaling pathway that activates PKCα, that in turn phosphorylates IMPDH1 at the Bateman domain, desensitizing the enzyme to GTP/GDP inhibition. None of the tested kinases phosphorylated S416 or S477 residues of IMPDH1 selectively, so the signaling pathways involving phosphorylation at these residues remain unknown.</p><p>Our proposed model that GDP/GTP allosteric regulation of IMPDH1 is controlled by phosphorylation in vivo to adapt GTP synthesis to the illumination conditions supports our previous hypothesis that IMPDH1 mutations would cause the pathology by resulting in higher than normal IMPDH1 activity; and/or by forming irreversible filaments. Abnormally high IMPDH1 activity could conceivably result in abnormally high cGMP synthesis, which is one of the well-known causes of photoreceptor cell damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2017</xref>); or could cause an ATP/GTP unbalance in darkness. On the other hand, the formation of filaments –in moments of sporadic bright light exposure in the natural world- would be reversible in healthy individuals, but irreversible in adRP10 patients by their impaired capacity to sense GDP/GTP levels. This could result in the gradual accumulation of protein aggregates that would eventually turn toxic.</p><p>Most <italic>IMPDH1</italic> mutations in adRP10 and adLCA, including the mutations N198K, R224P and D226N analyzed in this study, desensitize the enzyme to GDP/GTP allosteric inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Justel et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, we here show that out of the few IMPDH1 mutations that do not significantly reduce GDP/GTP allosteric inhibition directly, like R105W, V268I and H372P, mutant H372P resulted in abnormally high phosphorylation at T159/S160 by PKCα in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This means that the H372P mutation would ultimately result in desensitization of the enzyme to GDP/GTP allosteric inhibition as well, even if H372P mutation would do it indirectly.</p><p>This study provides key insights into the complex IMPDH1 regulation in the retina, and proposes that phosphorylation-controlled GDP/GTP allosteric regulation of the enzyme plays an important role in vivo by serving to adjust the rate of de novo GTP synthesis to changes in illumination. We propose that IMPDH1 mutations lead to retinal dystrophies by disrupting this mechanism of control. This study calls for the development of adRP10 and rare adLCA animal models in which to test this model and assay novel therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Pertaining to animal research, this study was conducted in accordance with the ARVO statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research and in compliance with acts 5/1995 and 214/1997 for the welfare of experimental animals of the autonomous community (Generalitat) of Catalonia; and approved by the ethics committee on animal experiments of the University of Barcelona (Generalitat Reference #9906, protocols Bell 216/17; 217/17 and 218/17).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of enriched phosphopeptides from dark- and light-adapted bovine retinas</title><p>Fresh calf eyes were obtained immediately postmortem and processed at the slaughterhouse premises.

Mouse recovery from anesthesia in the dark or light setting was promoted by keeping the mouse body temperature with a heating pad. After 4 hr, retinas were collected, frozen in dry ice and kept at −80°C until mass spectrometry analysis.</p><p>Metabolites were extracted from the retina by vortexing retinas in cold acetonitrile: methanol: water (5:4:1 v:v:v) in 1.5 ml tubes protected from light. After vortex, samples were subjected to four cycles of freezing/thawing by immersion in liquid nitrogen and sonication. Samples were kept in ice for 1 hr and then clarified by centrifugation (15200 rpm, 10 m, 4°C).</p><p>Extracts were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a 6490 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) with electrospray ion source (LC-ESI-QqQ) working in positive mode. 10 µl of extract were injected to the liquid chromatographic system. Metabolites were separated using an InfinityLab Poroshell 120 HILIC-Z, 2.1 × 100 mm, 2.7 μm (PEEK lined) column (Agilent Technologies). Mobile phase A was water with 50 mM ammonium acetate and 5 μM medronic acid, and mobile phase B was acetonitrile. Separation of the samples was conducted under the following gradient: 0–0.5 min 80% of B; 0.5–7.5 min decrease to 70% of B; 7.5–8.5 min decrease to 50% of B; 50% B was maintained for 30 s; 9–9.5 min raise to 80% of B; 9.5–11 min 80% of B. The flow was 0.7 ml/min. The mass spectrometer parameters were: drying and sheath gas temperatures 270°C and 400°C, respectively; source and sheath gas flows 12 and 12 l/min, respectively; nebulizer flow 20 psi; capillary voltage 3000V; nozzle voltage 1500V; and iFunnel HRF and LRF 70 and 80V, respectively. QqQ worked in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using two transitions (quantitation and confirmation transition) for each compound. The transitions for unlabelled metabolites and the collision energy (CE(V)) were: AMP 348→136(16), 348→119(56); ATP 508→136(32), 508→410(12); GMP 364→152(8), 364→135(52); GDP 444→152(32), 444→135(60); GTP 524→152(32), 524→135(56); cGMP 346→152(12), 346→135(54); IMP 349→137(16), 349→110(60); Gly 76→30(8),76→58(20). For labelled metabolites were: AMP 351→139(16), 351→122(56); ATP 511→139(32), 511→413(12); GMP 367→155(8), 367→138(52); GDP 447→155(32), 447→138(60); GTP 527→155(32), 527→138(56); cGMP 349→155(12), 349→138(54); IMP 352→140(16), 352→113(60); Gly 79→32(8), 79→61(20), as stated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>. The percentage of labeled metabolites in the total pool of a particular metabolite was calculated as ‘[labeled/(labeled + unlabeled)]x100’. The average percentage of labeled (*) metabolites in the samples were: % IMP* [dark samples: 0,64%; light samples: 1,7%]; % AMP* [dark samples: 0,31%; light samples: 0,53%] and % of GMP% [dark samples: 0,33%; light samples: 0,52%]. This percentage of incorporation of label from <sup>13</sup>C2; <sup>15</sup>N-Glycine into purine nucleotides is in line with the reported range of incorporation [0–0,8%] in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2019</xref>), given that exogenous glycine is much less efficient than endogenous glycine at fueling purine nucleotide synthesis in vivo. However our results were very robust in that the experimental ratio of the isotopologues M+3/M+0 for each metabolite was two orders of magnitude higher in the samples than in the corresponding non-labeled metabolite standard. The abundance of M+3 at metabolite standards reflects the natural abundance of isotopologues or ‘background labeling’.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions in LC-QqQ MS.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Compound</th><th>RT (min)</th><th>Quantitation transition (CE)</th><th>Confirmation transition (CE)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">AMP</td><td valign="top">3.21</td><td valign="top">348 → 136 (16)</td><td valign="top">348 → 119 (56)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">AMP<sup>*</sup></td><td valign="top">3.21</td><td valign="top">351 → 139 (16)</td><td valign="top">351→ 122 (56)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ATP</td><td valign="top">5.91</td><td valign="top">508 → 136 (32)</td><td valign="top">508 → 410 (12)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ATP<sup>*</sup></td><td valign="top">5.91</td><td valign="top">511 → 139 (32)</td><td valign="top">511 → 413 (12)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">GMP</td><td valign="top">4.60</td><td valign="top">364 → 152 (8)</td><td valign="top">364 → 135 (52)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">GMP<sup>*</sup></td><td valign="top">4.60</td><td valign="top">367 → 155 (8)</td><td valign="top">367 → 138 (52)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">GDP</td><td valign="top">6.13</td><td valign="top">444 → 152 (32)</td><td valign="top">444 → 135 (60)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">GDP<sup>*</sup></td><td valign="top">6.13</td><td valign="top">447 → 155 (32)</td><td valign="top">447 → 138 (60)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">GTP</td><td valign="top">7.07</td><td valign="top">524 → 152 (32)</td><td valign="top">524 → 135 (56)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">GTP<sup>*</sup></td><td valign="top">7.07</td><td valign="top">527 → 155 (32)</td><td valign="top">527 → 138 (56)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cGMP</td><td valign="top">1.38</td><td valign="top">346 → 152 (12)</td><td valign="top">346 → 135 (54)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cGMP<sup>*</sup></td><td valign="top">1.38</td><td valign="top">349 → 155 (12)</td><td valign="top">349 → 138 (54)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">IMP</td><td valign="top">3.82</td><td valign="top">349 → 137 (16)</td><td valign="top">349 → 110 (60)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">IMP<sup>*</sup></td><td valign="top">3.82</td><td valign="top">352 → 140 (16)</td><td valign="top">352 → 113 (60)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gly</td><td valign="top">1.79</td><td valign="top">76 → 30 (8)</td><td valign="top">76 → 58 (20)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gly<sup>*</sup></td><td valign="top">1.79</td><td valign="top">79 → 32 (8)</td><td valign="top">79 → 61 (20)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>*</sup>labeled (isotopologue M+3); RT: retention time; CE: collision energy (eV).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Electroretinogram analysis</title><p>A group of four mice was used for benzamide (BZM) injection, and a group of 7 mice for mycophenolate mofetyl (MMF) injection. A group of four mice was used for injection of bisindolylmaleimide PKC inhibitor. Dark-adapted (&gt;12 hr) animals were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (70 mg/kg; Ketalar, Parke-Davis, Wellington, New Zealand) and xylazine (7 mg/kg; Rompun, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) in saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) and pupils were dilated with one drop of 1% tropicamide. For each mouse the right eye was injected with the drug of interest, and the left eye with the physiological saline buffer used for drug dilution. MMF was injected intravitreously to an effective concentration of 200 nM (1 μl injection of 1 μM stock); benzamide riboside was injected to an effective concentration of 80 μM (1 μl injection of 400 μM stock); and bisindolylmaleimide was injected intravitreously to an effective concentration of 250 nM (1 μl injection of 1,25 μM stock).</p><p>Two corneal electrodes were used to record simultaneous ERGs from both eyes (Burian-Allen, Hansen Ophthalmic Development Lab, Coralville, IA). Electrodes were placed in the visual axis 2–3 mm from the cornea, with a drop of 2% methyl-cellulose (Methocel, Ciba Vision, Hetlingen, Switzerland) between corneas and electrodes. Mice were maintained for &gt;10 m in absolute darkness before the recordings, initiated 20 m after drug injection. Mouse temperature during the recording was maintained at 37°C with a heating pad (Hot-Cold, Pelton Shepherd Industries, Stockton, CA). Full-field flash ERG was performed, with the retina illuminated with a Ganzfeld dome. To test the effect of the drug under study on rod mass recovery after a saturating light flash, we applied the paired-flash paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lyubarsky and Pugh, 1996</xref>), by triggering a test flash (3 Cd·s/m<sup>2</sup>) followed by a probe flash of identical intensity at increasing inter-stimulus (IST) intervals: 400, 600, 800, 1200, 1500 and 2000 ms (double flash). The rate of recovery for the a- and b-waves at each IST was obtained by calculating the ratio of a- or b-wave of the probe flash to the a- or b-wave of the test flash. Cone responses were recorded following 5 m of light-adaptation with background white light (50 Cd/m<sup>2</sup>) to a flash light of 3 Cd·s/m<sup>2</sup>. Recorded electrophysiological responses were amplified; filtered (CP511 AC amplifier; Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA), and digitalized (ADInstruments Ltd, Oxfordshire, UK). The recording process was controlled with Scope version 3.8.1 software (Power Lab, ADInstruments Ltd). The stimulation protocols were designed according to the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>IMPDH1 immunofluorescence localization in retinal sections</title><p>For the analysis of spicula formation in response to mycophenolic acid (MPA) treatment, retinas from 16 hr dark-adapted mice were dissected under dim red light and placed in DMEM-high glucose in the presence or absence of 10 μM MPA, protected from light in a 5% CO2 incubator for 1 or 2 hr. Retinas were then fixed and embedded in acrylamide as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoyo et al., 2014</xref>). Cryosections were obtained at 18 µm thickness in a CM15105 Leica Cryostat (Leica Microsystems). Sections were subjected to an antigen retrieval protocol [2 m incubation with proteinase 0.05 mg/ml proteinase K in PBS pH 7.4 and an 8 s heat shock at 70°C]. Sections were then incubated with blocking solution (3% normal goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS pH 7.4) for 1 hr at room temperature; with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C [anti-IMPDH1 pAb and anti-Rhodopsin 1D4 mAb]; with Lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hr at room temperature to label cones; and with secondary antibodies anti-rabbit Alexa-488 and anti-mouse Alexa-555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hr at room temperature. Sections were mounted with Mowiol (Calbiochem).</p><p>For analysis of the effect of living mice exposure to constant bright light, 16 hr dark-adapted mice were exposed to 1600 lux bright light for 20 m, 2 hr or 4 hr after pupil dilation with a drop of phenylephrine and tropicamide. Retinas were processed and IMPDH1 immunolocalization assays were performed as indicated above.</p><p>For 15d constant-dark or 15d constant-light rearing, 4wk-old mice were either housed in a dark cabinet or in a set of constant bright light exposure (1600 lux) for 15 days. Mice were sacrificed, retinas were processed and IMPDH1 immunolocalization was analyzed.</p><p>Confocal microscopy images were acquired with a confocal laser scanning microscope Leica SP5 equipped with two HyD detectors. The spectral bands were set to 491–546 nm and 566–663 nm for 488 nm and 555 nm, respectively. The used objective was a HC PL APO 100x/1.4NA Oil and the samples were mounted on type 1.5 coverglasses (170 mm thick). The stacks covered approximately 2 μm in the z-axis with a 0.13 μm step size. The settings of the image acquisition provided a pixel size of about 74.8 nm x 74.8 nm.</p><p>The image analysis of the immunofluorescence data was performed using Fiji (ImageJ). In order to maximize the signal to noise ratio, we used the average projection of groups of 3 planes from large z-stacks. For the particle quantification, we selected a region of interest (e.g. magnified frames of rod outer segment layer) and we applied a light Gaussian filter (radius of one pixel). To determine the size of the areas with concentration of fluorescence we selected the pixels from the image that had a signal beyond a certain value. This value was determined from the statistics of intensity, taking only the 8% of the brighter pixels. Then, the areas of the spots were analyzed by using the plugin ‘analyze particles’ from Fiji. Counted spots were plotted according to its size and the statistical analysis were performed with Graph Pad Prism (unpaired t-tests).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to Eduard Sabidó and Guadalupe Espadas from the CRG/UPF Proteomics Unit for the technical execution of the retinal phosphoproteome analysis.

The phototransduction pathway results in the destruction of cGMP, and thus channel closure, resulting in hyperpolarization and a reduction in the release of glutamate. The production of GMP, GDP, and GTP is via the enzyme, IMPDH1. The importance of this enzyme to vision is illustrated by the effects of mutant alleles in humans, where retinitis pigmentosa, or loss of night vision followed by loss of daylight vision, occurs with changes at specific amino acids. The regulation of the activity of this enzyme is thus of interest and has been shown to be at least in part regulated by negative, allosteric feedback by GDP/GTP. The study by Plana-Bonamaiso et al. reports that a PKC-dependent phosphorylation event that is regulated by light relieves the feedback inhibition. This mechanism is part of a regulatory pathway that help to keep the levels of cGMP high during light exposure. The data are novel and are part of an emerging story of the regulation of IMPDH enzymes, which are regulated in several ways, including by formation of larger structures, or cytoophidia, and now phosphorylation, and allostery.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

(3) T159/S160 changes allosteric regulation by GDP/GTP and increases in the light. Poor quality figures and missing experimental details make it difficult to assess these findings. Assuming these issues are oversights, these findings are interesting and significant new insights into the pathological mechanism of IMPDH1 mutations that cause retinitis pigmentosa. The authors also show that IMPDH forms higher order structures in rod cells in response to light and inhibitors. The authors propose an intriguing model for the regulation of IMPDH activity by phosphorylation: light induced phosphorylation of T159/S160 relieves GDP/GTP inhibition, activating IMPDH1 to replenish the guanine nucleotide pool. Unfortunately, the supporting evidence is weak. The paper is also marred by shifting nomenclature and overstatements.</p><p>1) The phosphorylation experiments are not consistent: the mass spec experiments suggest that T159/S160 phosphorylation increases with light exposure, but other experiments show that the overall phosphorylation status does not change. This conundrum should be resolved with additional experiments to monitor the phosphorylation status of individual sites. (Subsection “Dark/light-dependent phosphorylation of IMPDH1 predominant retinal isoform”, the statement &quot;monophosphorylated species predominating&quot; is inaccurate. Figure 3D, E show that the mono and di-phosphorylated forms have the same abundance, ~5.9 – the measurements are not accurate to 4 significant figures).</p><p>2) The critical panel B of Figure 2 is illegible and the colors are not explained.</p><p>3) The retinal guanine nucleotide levels do not appear to change significantly with light. Perhaps this is because the authors are looking at the entire retina, which contains other kinds of cells in addition to photoreceptor cells. Of course, this also means that the phosphorylated IMPDH1 can be in the other cells.</p><p>4) Important details are missing in the allosteric regulation experiments – what exactly is V<sub>max</sub>/V<sub>max</sub><sup>app</sup>? It is not defined in the text or figure legend.</p><p>5) Table 1 appears to report a mixture of different constants – some are Ki determined for competitive inhibitors and some are K<sub>1/2</sub> were more complex sigmoidal inhibition is observed. Note that the text sometimes uses the term Ki for all, other times uses IC50. The nomenclature should be consistent. The title should reflect that both kinds of measurements are reported, as should the column headings. Which substrates were varied, which were held constant? Are the units really mM? The values of Ki for GMP and XMP are 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than expected. The data are not provided. The authors need to report the concentration of NAD and enzyme in the experiment, as well as the temperature and buffer, in the figure and table legends.</p><p>6) The phosphomimetic mutations at T159/S160 do have a significant effect on allosteric inhibition, but &quot;abolish&quot; is too strong a term – it is just a 5-fold increase. How exactly is the IC50 for GTP determined? The sigmoidal dependence on GTP concentration is very steep – what is the value of the Hill coefficient? What equation was used?</p><p>7) Why does Figure 8 report nucleotide levels in picomole/retina? Isn't picomole/mg protein the better measure? Also, how much of the nucleotides come from photoreceptor cells as opposed to the other cells in the retina?</p><p>8) In vitro kinase assays are of questionable physiological relevance.</p><p>9) Is the S477 phosphorylation likely to affect formation of rods and rings?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript aims to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate IMPDH1, an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, in the retina. Using a range of proteomic, biochemical, physiological and imaging techniques, they show that IMPDH1 isoform in the retina is regulated by light-dependent phosphorylation of T159/S160 residues in the Bateman domain by PKC. This abolishes the inhibition of IMPDH1 by GDP/GTP enabling GTP levels to be maintained during the light response.</p><p>This is an interesting study that provides new insight into the allosteric regulation of the enzyme IMPDH1 in the retina. IMPDH1 plays a central role in maintaining guanine nucleotides, key components of the visual response in photoreceptors. The importance of IMPDH1 is highlighted by the finding that mutations in IMPDH1 are known to cause severe retinal degenerative diseases including retinitis pigmentosa (RP10) and Lebers Congenital Amaurosis. Accordingly, insight into the regulatory mechanisms underlying IMPDH1 activity is important for understanding the visual response and molecular mechanisms underlying retinal degenerative diseases. The studies are well done with sufficient statistical analysis and controls. They incorporate both in vitro and in vivo experiments to examine the role of phosphorylation in controlling the GDP/GTP regulation of IMPDH1 activity and provide support for importance of the GDP/GTP allosteric regulation of IMPDH1 as the principle mode of in modulation of this enzyme as earlier proposed by Buey et al. The experiments and analysis also argue against the competitive inhibition by GMP as a primary mode of regulation of IMPDH1. As part of this study, the authors have also determined the effect of several disease-linked mutations on the PKC catalyzed phosphorylation of IMPDH1 at the T159/S160 sites and showed that two mutants (N198K and R224P) have statistically reduced phosphorylation. Although these studies are incomplete since enzymatic activities were not examined, nonetheless they serve as a basis for a more thorough analysis of how these mutations may affect the control of guanine nucleotide levels and lead to disease.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Further discussion on the following points would enhance this manuscript.</p><p>It is unclear what the underlying mechanism is for light dependent phosphorylation of IMPDH1 at the T159/S160 residues. The authors nicely show that PKC is involved in the phosphorylation. Is PKC activated directly or indirectly in the light or does IMPDH1 undergo a conformational change in the light to enable phosphorylation by PKC? Discussion or speculation on this point would be useful.</p><p>The mechanism appears to be mainly involved in controlling guanine nucleotide levels in rods. Is a similar mechanism proposed for cones?</p><p>The authors show that the N198K and R224P disease-causing mutations display a decreased level of phosphorylation (Figure 6C). Do these mutations affect GDP/GTP interaction and/or the enzymatic activity of IMPDH1 or just its phosphorylation by PKC? Further discussion would be useful.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>IMPDH1 mutations cause retinal degeneration but its mechanisms and regulation are still poorly understood. Plana-Bonamaiso et al. identified four phosphorylation sites, T159/S160, S416 and S477 and found T159/S160 phosphorylation was light-sensitive. Additionally, they measured the activities of phosphorylation-mimic mutants in response to GTP and GDP and identified the upstream kinase for T159/S160. By using ERGs and immunofluorescence with or without IMPDH1 inhibitor in live mice, they conclude that phosphorylation controls GDP/GTP allosteric regulation of IMPDH activity in response to light.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Light-regulated phosphorylation of T159/S160 is not solid. The difference between light vs dark in Figure 2 is from bovine retinas. The splicing isoforms of IMPDH1 in bovine retina are still unknown although the phosphorylation sites are conservative for known isoforms. As the authors pointed out in the discussion, they were also under nutritional deficit. Additionally, Figure 3C in comparing phosphorylation in mouse isoform is not statistically significant. It will be important to know whether T159/S160 is the major site of phosphorylation in 603/604 aa IMPDH1. It should be easily done by proteomics or PKC inhibitor.</p><p>2) The GMP is significantly increased but GTP/GDP remains unchanged by light. However, the authors proposed that GTP/GDP but not GMP regulates IMPDH1 by light. One argument is that Ki of GMP is much higher (1.94 mM) for hIMPDH1-514 than physiological mouse retina. HIMPDH1-514 is not the major isoform in the human retina. (PMID: 16936083) (546 and 595 are the major ones). It is unknown whether hIMPDH1-514 is phosphorylated in vivo (HIMPDH1-514 is the similar isoform to mouse 514aa is not phosphorylated in Figure 3). Furthermore, Ki of GMP varies in big ranges with different IMPDH1 proteins (PMID: 26558346). The second argument is GTP/GMP ratio (GTP is constant but GMP is increased) is more important than GMP in regulating IMPDH1. Is there data that support this hypothesis?</p><p>3) The author proposed that light activates IMPDH activity through phosphorylation. Using PKC inhibitor to block the phosphorylation will give a strong evidence. Will the IMDPH1 inhibitor affect GTP, GMP and IMP levels?</p><p>4) In the Discussion section &quot;IMPDH1 mutations would cause the pathology by resulting in higher than normal constitutive IMPDH1 activity… Abnormally high IMPDH1 activity could conceivably result in abnormally high cGMP synthesis.,Consequently, every clue would lead to unregulated, constitutive IMPDH1 activity as the underlying cause of the adRP10 phenotype.&quot; How would the author explain the discrepancy by other reports: (1) IMPDH1 human mutants have similar IMPDH activity including D226N (PMID: 1829559); (2) Supplement with GTP improves ERGs from IMPDH1 -/- mice (PMID: 19822744).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56418.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

The in situ metabolic labeling revealed something we could not extract from the mass spectrometry result: that &gt;60% of the protein is phosphorylated at any light condition. The electrofocusing experiments confirmed that two sites are phosphorylated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This conundrum should be resolved with additional experiments to monitor the phosphorylation status of individual sites.</p></disp-quote><p>The phosphorylation status of individual sites has been monitored by LC-MS/MS, on dark/light bovine retinas – biological triplicates – (Figure 1), and the statistical results are provided.</p><p>The analysis of phosphopeptides by mass spectrometry typically require large amounts of starting material, because the process entails a step of phosphopeptide enrichment (phosphopeptides are much harder to ionize and therefore harder to detect than peptides by mass spectrometry). We used about 0,75 mg total protein in each homogenate (18 samples) in the phosphoproteomic analysis. Because this corresponded to fractionated tissue, we estimate that we would have needed pools of at least 6 murine retinas per sample (~ 108 retinas in all). That is one of the reasons why we performed the phosphoproteomic analysis with bovine retinas. The cost of the LC-MS/MS analysis was over 10,000€, which is why it is not straight-forward to repeat it now in the murine system, with a number of samples that would allow us to perform robust statistics again.</p><p>Previous to the phosphoproteomic analysis we had performed IMPDH1 immunoprecipitation in dark/light bovine samples, followed by LC-MS/MS. We had detected peptide A0JNA3[154-169] LVGIVTSRDIDFLAEK with a phosphate assigned to either Thr159 or Ser160 (50:50 probability) in the light sample; and the same peptide unphosphorylated in the dark sample. However, this simple experiment allows the detection of the phosphopeptide, but not a quantitative comparison between samples.</p><p>Another attempt at doing quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis in dark/light bovine retinas by iTRAQ (use of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation in proteomic analysis of different samples in a single experiment) and LC-MS/MS failed to reach the depth of analysis required for IMPDH1 detection. These type of phosphoproteomic analysis are not simple, and are very expensive.</p><p>In brief, we have demonstrated by in situ metabolic labeling and isoelectrofocusing experiments that the major isoform of IMPDH1 in the murine retina (603/604aa) is phosphorylated at two sites. We have based the identity of those two sites on the mass spectrometry analysis performed with bovine retinas. This is not uncommon in the field. Rhodopsin phosphorylation sites were originally characterized in the bovine system, and were assumed and later shown to be conserved in the murine system. The same happened with phosducin phosphorylation, and with practically any well-established phosphorylation event in signaling proteins in response to dark/light.</p><p>Besides, we are providing a supplementary figure that shows that we detected previously reported, well-established phosphorylation sites in rhodopsin, rhodopsin kinase and phosducin with the proper dark/light-preference in our phosphoproteomic analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(Subsection “Dark/light-dependent phosphorylation of IMPDH1 predominant retinal isoform”, the statement &quot;monophosphorylated species predominating&quot; is inaccurate.

We have consistently observed that GMP increases with light, while GTP levels are maintained. We have also observed that AMP levels increase with light while ATP levels are maintained.</p><p>It must be noted that although our nucleotide determinations were done in whole retinal extracts, guanine nucleotide levels largely reflect nucleotide content in photoreceptor cells, as cGMP and GTP levels are reduced to less than 20% their values in retinas that lack the photoreceptor cell layer [rd1 mouse model (Du et al., 2016)]. This is now mentioned in this Results section.</p><p>There are numerous studies since the 70s that have determined guanine nucleotides levels in whole retinas, in rd1 mice lacking the photoreceptor cell layer (Farber and Lolley´s work, including their seminal paper in 1974); and in the different retinal layers obtained by tangential sectioning [e.g. Berger et al., (1980)]. It is well established that cGMP and guanine nucleotide levels are much higher in the photoreceptor cell layer than at inner retinal layers.</p><p>IMPDH1 is expressed to a much higher extent in the photoreceptor cell layer of the retina than at the inner retina. If the gain at the confocal microscope is adjusted to avoid saturation of the IMPDH1 signal at the photoreceptor cell layer, then the signal at the inner retina is negligible.

We have thought about this issue and have concluded that our competitive Ki constants might be biased by the use of a relatively large concentration of enzyme (100 microg / mL, i.e. 1.8 microM) for the enzyme kinetic experiments. This should not significantly influence the V<sub>max</sub> values, determined at high substrate concentration (up to 5 millimolar IMP), but the K<sub>m</sub> values, which are strongly affected by the low substrate concentrations. The lowest IMP concentrations used for these experiments were 19 microM and the enzyme concentration was 1.8 microM. Thereby, these are not Michaelis-Menten conditions, and the K<sub>m</sub> values for the lowest IMP experiments might have been not reliably estimated. Consequently, the Ki values might be biased by the wrong K<sub>m</sub> values, since K<sub>m</sub> is used to calculate Ki.</p><p>Therefore, we repeated the enzyme kinetic experiments using a much lower enzyme concentration (50 nM) and monitored the reaction progress using the NADH fluorescence, which is more sensitive than monitoring NADH absorbance, as we used in our previous experimental setup.</p><p>The new K<sub>m</sub> and competitive Ki,<sub>GMP</sub> values are now orders of magnitude lower, in accordance to the reviewer´s comment and the previously published literature.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56418-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>However, the demonstration that de novo synthesis of IMP, GMP and AMP increases with light in vivo, overcomes the discussion on the kinetic constants of inhibition for GMP and GDP/GTP (that has been removed).

In Johnson´s et al., reported structure of IMPDH2 polymers, details are revealed of the interface that mediates cytoophidia assembly: the 12 amino-terminal residues of the canonical IMPDH2 isoform extend from the catalytic domain to bind into the adjacent molecule, in a shallow surface groove formed by a short helix (476-485), two beta strands (51-63), and two short loops (355-360, 379-380) (51). Strikingly, S477 maps into the short helix at the IMPDH2 cytoophidia longitudinal contact interface, allowing us to speculate that phosphorylation of S477 in IMPDH1 might disrupt cytoophidia assembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Further discussion on the following points would enhance this manuscript.</p><p>It is unclear what the underlying mechanism is for light dependent phosphorylation of IMPDH1 at the T159/S160 residues.

Discussion or speculation on this point would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a very interesting point. T159/S160 residues are exposed to the bulk solvent in the IMPDH1 tetramers, so PKC can easily access them. These residues only get buried when a nucleotide (ATP and or GTP) induces IMPDH octamerization. Thereby, we think it is rather PKC that gets activated in light and phosphorylates IMPDH1.</p><p>We have observed in our phosphoproteomic analysis that the phosphorylation sites that prime PKC for activation occur in the retina in the light condition.

Our overall phosphoproteomic analysis reveals that light changes the metabolic fluxes in retinal cells (likely rod photoreceptors) by controlling the phosphorylation of key metabolic switches. We believe that key phosphorylation events rapidly re-structure the metabolic roadmap in photoreceptor cells in dark/light. These metabolic adaptive changes might be different in rods and cones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that the N198K and R224P disease-causing mutations display a decreased level of phosphorylation (Figure 6C). Do these mutations affect GDP/GTP interaction and/or the enzymatic activity of IMPDH1 or just its phosphorylation by PKC? Further discussion would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>Both mutations N198K and R224P affect GTP/GDP interaction, but they do not affect enzymatic activity (Fernandez-Justel et al., JMB 2019). N198K is involved in the direct binding of GTP/GDP to the third non-canonical site, which is needed for GTP/GDP-mediated allosteric inhibition. On the other hand, R224P is necessary for GTP/GDP-induced IMPDH octamerization, which is also needed for allosteric inhibition.</p><p>We do not know at this point the mechanism by which these mutants display a decrease level of phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Light-regulated phosphorylation of T159/S160 is not solid. The difference between light vs dark in Figure 2 is from bovine retinas. The splicing isoforms of IMPDH1 in bovine retina are still unknown although the phosphorylation sites are conservative for known isoforms. As the authors pointed out in the discussion, they were also under nutritional deficit. Additionally, Figure 3C in comparing phosphorylation in mouse isoform is not statistically significant. It will be important to know whether T159/S160 is the major site of phosphorylation in 603/604 aa IMPDH1. It should be easily done by proteomics or PKC inhibitor.</p></disp-quote><p>We have demonstrated by in situ metabolic labeling that the major isoform of IMPDH1 in the murine retina (603/604aa) is phosphorylated at two sites. We base the identity of those two sites on the mass spectrometry analysis performed with bovine retinas, that is correct. This is not uncommon in the field. Rhodopsin phosphorylation sites were originally characterized in the bovine system, and are conserved in the murine system. The same happens with phosducin phosphorylation, and with practically any well-established phosphorylation event that happens in signaling proteins in response to dark/light.</p><p>Please see the answer provided to reviewer #1 on the sensitivity limitations and the cost of phosphoproteomic experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The GMP is significantly increased but GTP/GDP remains unchanged by light. However, the authors proposed that GTP/GDP but not GMP regulates IMPDH1 by light. One argument is that Ki of GMP is much higher (1.94 mM) for hIMPDH1-514 than physiological mouse retina. HIMPDH1-514 is not the major isoform in the human retina. (PMID: 16936083) (546 and 595 are the major ones). It is unknown whether hIMPDH1-514 is phosphorylated in vivo (HIMPDH1-514 is the similar isoform to mouse 514aa is not phosphorylated in Figure 3). Furthermore, Ki of GMP varies in big ranges with different IMPDH1 proteins (PMID: 26558346). The second argument is GTP/GMP ratio (GTP is constant but GMP is increased) is more important than GMP in regulating IMPDH1. Is there data that support this hypothesis?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding GMP Ki values, please see the answer provided to reviewer #1.</p><p>Whether GDP/GTP allosteric regulation of IMPDH1 or GMP competitive inhibition of IMPDH1 prevails in vivo… the ultimate question for us is: – <italic>Is IMPDH1 activity increased or decreased with light exposure?</italic> The answer, new Figure 7, is that in vivo the flux through de novo purine nucleotide synthesis increases with light, and that includes IMPDH1 activity (metabolic flux analysis in new Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The author proposed that light activates IMPDH activity through phosphorylation.
