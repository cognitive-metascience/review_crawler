How JAKs structurally respond to changes in receptor conformation induced by ligand binding is not known. Here, we present two crystal structures of the human JAK2 FERM and SH2 domains bound to Leptin receptor (LEPR) and Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), which identify a novel dimeric conformation for JAK2. This 2:2 JAK2/receptor dimer, observed in both structures, identifies a previously uncharacterized receptor interaction essential to dimer formation that is mediated by a membrane-proximal peptide motif called the ‘switch’ region. Mutation of the receptor switch region disrupts STAT phosphorylation but does not affect JAK2 binding, indicating that receptor-mediated formation of the JAK2 FERM dimer is required for kinase activation. These data uncover the structural and molecular basis for how a cytokine-bound active receptor dimer brings together two JAK2 molecules to stimulate JAK2 kinase activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>JAK2</kwd><kwd>erythropoetin</kwd><kwd>Leptin</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd><kwd>Interferon</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An intracellular cytokine receptor 'switch' motif is critical for the dimerization of JAK2 and activation of the JAK2 kinase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family of multi-domain non-receptor tyrosine kinases responsible for pleiotropic regulatory effects on growth, development, immune and hematopoietic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leonard and O'Shea, 1998</xref>). The JAK family consists of four conserved members, including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, which are differentially activated in response to cytokine and interferon stimulation. JAKs are constitutively bound to the intracellular domains of their cognate cytokine signaling receptors, and are activated after cytokine-mediated dimerization or rearrangement of these receptors establishes a productive receptor signaling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haan et al., 2006</xref>). The canonical JAK signaling pathway initiates with kinase trans-autophosphorylation, followed by phosphorylation of receptor intracellular domains, recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors, and translocation of active STAT dimers to the nucleus to initiate transcription of target genes. In the quarter century since their discovery, the JAKs and their cognate cytokines and receptors have emerged as critical drug targets for immune disorders as well as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kontzias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>JAKs share a conserved four domain structure, with each domain playing a distinct and understood role in JAK function. The C-terminal half of the archetypical JAK contains hallmark tandem pseudokinase and kinase domains, with the C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain essential for its enzymatic activity, and the pseudokinase playing a role in regulation of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saharinen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saharinen and Silvennoinen, 2002</xref>). At the N-terminus, sequential FERM and SH2 domains are responsible for distinct receptor interactions. The FERM domain is itself made up of three subdomains, including a ubiquitin-like fold (F1), an acyl CoA-binding protein-like domain (F2), and a Plextrin Homology (PH)-like fold (F3). These three domains form an interwoven cloverleaf-like structure and are closely associated with the SH2 domain to form a receptor binding holodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferrao and Lupardus, 2017</xref>). Prior structures of the FERM–SH2 module have identified several receptor peptide-binding sites within the FERM–SH2, including a ‘box1' binding site on the FERM F2 subdomain, and a second ‘box2'-binding site on the SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wallweber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferrao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>JAK2 is in many ways the prototypical member of the JAK family, with an essential signaling role for cytokines and interferons involved growth and energy homeostasis (HGH, Leptin), hematopoiesis (GMCSF, EPO, TPO, IL-3), immunity and allergy (IL-12, IL-23, IL-5), and antiviral responses (IFNγ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babon et al., 2014</xref>). JAK2 ablation in mice results in embryonic lethality due to disruption of erythropoiesis <italic>in utero</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neubauer et al., 1998</xref>), underlying a critical need for JAK2 signaling in the development of the hematopoietic system. JAK2 is also a proto-oncogene, with constitutively activating pseudokinase mutations such as V617F shown to drive a subset of myelo- and lympho-proliferative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vainchenker and Constantinescu, 2013</xref>).</p><p>As the diversity of JAK2-dependent cytokines suggests, JAK2 activity can result from ligation of a number of homodimeric and heterodimeric pairs of signaling receptors. While JAK2-activating heterodimeric pairs are found in both the class I and class II cytokine receptor families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ihle et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), receptors that utilize JAK2 in a homodimeric assembly are a smaller group and fall into two class I subfamilies: the growth hormone family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ihle et al., 1995</xref>) and the ‘tall’ receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is emblematic of the first group, and includes a canonical extracellular cytokine binding homology region (CHR) motif consisting of tandem FNIII-like domains that form a 2:1 complex with a single EPOR molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Syed et al., 1998</xref>). In the tall receptor family, only gp130 and the leptin receptor (LEPR) have the ability to homodimerize in response to cytokine binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Waters and Brooks, 2015</xref>). Gp130 and LEPR contain six and seven Ig/FNIII-like domains, respectively, and require two cytokines (i.e. IL-6 or LEPR) for assembly of the signaling homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulanger and Garcia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mancour et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>While cytokine-induced dimerization of dispersed monomeric receptors is the canonical model of cytokine signaling, mounting evidence suggests that at least a subset of receptors can exist in a pre-dimerized state, and that conformational shifts in the transmembrane (TM) helices are a switch that initiates JAK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seubert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matthews et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Defour et al., 2013</xref>). If cytokine-induced conformational change in the receptor dimer is indeed the trigger for JAK activation, we hypothesized that these changes may produce a dimeric JAK conformation that brings together the kinase domains to initiate trans-phosphorylation and downstream signaling. We therefore set out to structurally characterize the JAK2 FERM–SH2 bound to peptides from homodimeric signaling receptors, with the goal of capturing the membrane-proximal domains of JAK2 in an activated dimeric state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal structures of the JAK2 FERM-SH2 bound to EPOR and LEPR</title><p>JAK FERM–SH2 domains have been successfully crystallized with their receptors by either fusing the JAK-binding receptor fragment to the C-terminus of the SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wallweber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), or by co-expression of GST-receptor fusion proteins with the JAK FERM–SH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferrao et al., 2016</xref>). To obtain structures of JAK2 with a homodimeric receptor, we utilized both methods across a number of receptors to identify the best possible samples for crystallography, with the goal of having a representative structure from both class I receptor subfamilies, the growth hormone family and the tall receptor family. Ultimately, we identified two receptors, EPOR and LEPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), that produced well-behaved complexes with JAK2 for crystallization trials. For the JAK2/EPOR complex, fusion of the cytoplasmic box1 and box2 containing fragment of EPOR (Ser273-Cys338) to the C-terminus of the human JAK2 FERM–SH2 (Asp36-Thr514) resulted in a protein complex that was stable and purified to high yield. During the final stages of purification, this JAK2/EPOR fusion spontaneously crystallized at neutral pH. To decrease the rate of spontaneous nucleation and allow for further concentration for crystallization trials, the pH was lowered to pH 5.5 and the protein subjected to crystallization screening. For crystallization of JAK2 with LEPR, we generated a LEPR construct containing the predicted Box1 and Box2 domains (Ser863-Glu933) with an N-terminal GST fusion tag and a TEV protease site for co-expression with the JAK2 FERM–SH2. Following TEV cleavage to remove GST, the JAK2/LEPR complex was purified, concentrated, and subjected to crystallization screening. Ultimately, we were able to obtain complete native datasets for JAK2/EPOR and JAK2/LEPR that diffracted to 2.65 and 2.83 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38089.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The structure of the JAK2 FERM–SH2 domain bound to EPOR and LEPR.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and leptin receptor (LEPR) bound to JAK2.

At the terminus of the helix, Asp312 forms a salt bridge with JAK2 Lys253, followed by a tandem tryptophan motif (Trp316/317) that occupies two different conformations within the asymmetric unit of the crystal. After this tandem tryptophan motif, we see a 10 residue stretch of amino acids that make only tangential contact with JAK2. Contact is regained with JAK2 at Pro328, followed by the binding of Leu331 and Val333 into the canonical box2 binding groove on the SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), originally described for the TYK2/IFNAR1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wallweber et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The EPOR and LEPR ‘switch’ motif residues bridge a JAK2 dimer</title><p>Although the JAK2/EPOR and JAK2/LEPR complexes crystallized in two distinct crystal forms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), similarities were immediately evident after analysis of packing interactions between JAK2 monomers in the crystal lattices.

For EPOR, this segment has been previously branded the ‘switch’ region, with several residues within the segment required for JAK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Constantinescu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2001</xref>). Both the JAK2/EPOR and JAK2/LEPR crystal structures show that this switch region interaction is mediated by hydrophobic residues inserting into the same pocket on the PH-like F3 subdomain of the JAK2 FERM. In addition, the switch residues in EPOR and LEPR are similarly positioned in sequence just N-terminal to the box1 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), an area that is highly enriched in aromatic residues in other cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For EPOR, the key switch region contact residues are Ile282 and Trp283 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and for LEPR the key contact residues are Leu870, Phe871, and Trp872 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The receptor-binding pocket on the F3 subdomain is created by the intersection of the β1-β4 sheet and β7 strand, and is lined on one side by a β3 strand tryptophan residue (JAK2 Trp298) that is conserved among JAK family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). EPOR Ile282 and Trp283 insert directly into this F3 pocket, while for LEPR Leu870 inserts into the pocket and Trp872 makes an edge-face π-π interaction with the opposite face of JAK2 Trp298. This pocket on the PH-like F3 subdomain is also the conserved interaction site for inositol phosphate headgroups in a number of classical PH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lemmon, 2007</xref>), and facilitates dimerization of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) FERM domains via a topologically similar tryptophan-mediated interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brami-Cherrier et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>While the contact sites for the EPOR and LEPR switch residues on the JAK2 F3 subdomain are similar, the contacts between the JAK2 F2 and F3 subdomains are unique between the two complexes. This is primarily due to the different contact angles for each complex, with each JAK2 in the EPOR complex opposed at approximately 120°, versus each JAK2 in the LEPR complex opposed at approximately 180° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>). In the JAK2/EPOR complex the one significant contact between JAK2 molecules is a salt bridge between Glu173 in F2 α2 helix, and Arg300 in the opposing F3 β3 strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the JAK2/LEPR structure, there are a number of contacts between the F2 and F3 subdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Instead of forming a salt bridge with the opposing JAK2 F2, Arg300 is folded back and forms an intra-domain ionic pairing with F3 Glu274. JAK2 F3 Asp313 forms a polar contact with the backbone amide of F2 His172, and the sidechains of His172 and His222 in the F2 subdomain intercalate into the interface between LEPR and the two JAK2 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These differing JAK2 F2/F3 dimer contacts in the EPOR and LEPR structures highlight the permissiveness of the JAK2–JAK2 interface, and suggest the driving force for dimerization is receptor-mediated contact with the opposing JAK2 molecule. Importantly, this dimeric JAK2/receptor conformation was only observed in the context of a crystal lattice formed at high-protein concentration, and we were unable to reconstitute this dimer in solution. This is likely due to a low-affinity between the soluble JAK FERM–SH2/receptor monomers, which would normally encounter one another in the context of a membrane tethered and conformationally restricted receptor dimer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The switch motif is dispensable for JAK2 binding, but essential for STAT phosphorylation</title><p>Based on prior studies suggesting that the switch region is essential for signaling but not JAK binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Constantinescu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haan et al., 2002</xref>), we hypothesized that the JAK dimers observed in our crystal structures represent functional signaling complexes, with switch-mediated dimer formation required for JAK activation. To first interrogate the role of LEPR switch residues on binding to JAK2, we utilized BioLayer Interferometry (BLI) to alanine-scan the interaction between JAK2 and biotinylated LEPR peptides generated by in vitro translation. Wild-type LEPR peptide bound to JAK2 with an equilibrium affinity constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 18.7 ± 1.3 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Yet when we tested alanine mutations in juxtamembrane residues between Lys869 and Asp874, including the switch contact residues Phe871 and Trp872, these peptides retained affinity for JAK2. These results indicate that the switch residues in LEPR are not required for JAK2 binding.

Non-contact residues Gln279 and Lys280 did not appreciably affect STAT5 phosphorylation, and mutation of Pro283 had only a minor effect.

Mutation of switch residue Leu868, which is also a contact residue, had a less substantial effect on STAT3 phosphorylation when compared to Phe869 and Trp870. Mutation of solvent-facing LEPR residues Lys867 or Asp871 had only a minor effect on STAT3 phosphorylation. Based on these experiments, we conclude that interactions between EPOR and LEPR switch region residues and the JAK2 FERM F3 subdomain on an opposing JAK2 molecule are required for STAT phosphorylation, indicating that our structures represent active JAK2-receptor dimer complexes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on the studies presented here, we propose a model by which receptor-mediated intracellular dimerization of the JAK2 FERM–SH2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) positions both JAK2 molecules in a conformation that enables activation of the kinase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This model assumes that the C-terminus of the FERM–SH2 is facing the cytoplasmic side, so that the linked pseudokinase/kinase module would not sterically clash with the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The distances between the structurally resolved C-termini (residue Asn515) of the dimerized JAK2 FERM–SH2 domains in complex with EPOR and LEPR are 27 and 46 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the two SH2-linked pseudokinase domains would be close together upon dimerization.

The ability of these switch mutations to ‘decouple’ downstream STAT phosphorylation from JAK2/receptor binding is key evidence supporting the functional relevance of the dimeric JAK/receptor conformations seen in our structures. While STAT phosphorylation is generally regarded as a marker of JAK activation, it remains an indirect measure of JAK kinase activity. However, our data corroborate results published by Constantinescu and colleagues that describe the EPOR/JAK2 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Constantinescu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2001</xref>). In these studies, it was shown that mutation of EPOR switch region residues Ile257 and Trp258 was able to disconnect EPO-dependent JAK2 phosphorylation and cell growth from JAK2-dependent EPOR cell surface expression. Another study using IL5R-gp130 receptor chimeras to assess JAK1 activation demonstrated that mutation of a switch region tryptophan from the gp130 intracellular domain (Trp562) disrupted JAK1 signaling, yet did not affect JAK1 co-immunprecipitation with the chimeric receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haan et al., 2002</xref>). These parallel results, obtained in three receptor systems utilizing two different JAKs, firmly substantiate the hypothesis that juxtamembrane switch residues play a key role in JAK activation.</p><p>The FERM domain is a remarkably prolific protein-protein interaction module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferrao and Lupardus, 2017</xref>), and the identification of new cytokine receptor interactions with the JAK2 PH-like (F3) subdomain adds to this compendium. The switch residue binding site on the F3 subdomain is typically recognized as the binding pocket for phosphatidyl-inositol triphosphate (PIP3) headgroups in PH domain-containing kinases such as AKT and BTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baraldi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thomas et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, Focal Adhesion Kinase, which contains a FERM domain, has also been shown to depend on its F3 subdomain to mediate dimerization and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brami-Cherrier et al., 2014</xref>). FAK dimerization is mediated by symmetric exchange of tryptophan (Trp266) residues found in the F3 β1/β2 loop, with each tryptophan sidechain interacting with the opposite PH-like domain in a similar manner to EPOR and LEPR switch residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the key role of the PH domains in function of a number of kinases, disruption of PH-mediated interactions by small molecule inhibitors has been proposed as a potential approach for inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miao et al., 2010</xref>). The mechanistic insights described here suggest targeting the switch-binding pocket on a JAK PH-like domain could be a novel approach for pharmacological inhibition of JAK signaling.</p><p>Cytokine-mediated reorientation of receptor transmembrane (TM) sequences into a specific ‘activated’ conformation has previously been suggested as an important trigger for JAK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seubert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matthews et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Defour et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Staerk et al., 2011</xref>). Recent studies of growth hormone receptor (GHR) suggest that growth hormone binding induces a transition from a parallel to a crossed-over TM dimer conformation which physically separates the JAK2-binding receptor box1 sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>). Other work on EPOR and the thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR) has also suggested that TM dimer tilt angle may play a role in cytokine-induced JAK2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Defour et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seubert et al., 2003</xref>).

Instead, a specific ligand-induced crossed-over or asymmetric TM dimer conformation could trigger switch region binding to the opposing F3 subdomain, and subsequent formation of the JAK2 dimer as we see in our structures. The requirement of a specific TM conformation for maximal JAK activation can also help explain data obtained using receptor dimerization methods such as antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Müller-Newen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Livnah et al., 1996</xref>), diabodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moraga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakano et al., 2009</xref>), and engineered cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moraga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rafei et al., 2007</xref>). While these non-natural means of dimerization do engage JAK signaling pathways, JAK kinase activity, as measured by receptor or STAT phosphorylation, is rarely induced at the same maximal levels seen for the native ligands. These findings correlate with studies that show that JAK activation is sensitive, but not entirely disrupted, by changing the juxtamembrane peptide length by adding alanine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Constantinescu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greiser et al., 2002</xref>). Atypical TM conformations produced using surrogate dimerizing agents could plausibly alter the structure and kinetics of JAK dimer formation, producing unique levels of JAK activation and varied downstream signaling outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moraga et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Syed et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>A number of studies on the EPOR/JAK2 and gp130/JAK1 systems have suggested that the receptor juxtamembrane region takes on a specific helical conformation important for maximal JAK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Constantinescu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seubert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greiser et al., 2002</xref>). While we do not see a helical conformation for the juxtamembrane peptides in our EPOR or LEPR structures, the receptor peptides used in our studies do not include a TM segment, which would likely anchor the juxtamembrane helices in place. The movement of a rigid pair of TM/juxtamembrane helices following cytokine engagement remains a plausible means for a ligand-bound receptor to enforce a specific conformation compatible with the JAK2 dimeric complexes presented here. While our structures cannot fully refute alternative scenarios such as a requirement for the switch residues in ‘active state’ dimerization of the receptor juxtamembrane regions, the evidence provided by our two dimeric JAK2 structures with similar architecture along with supporting functional data strongly suggests the presence of a JAK2 dimer in the context of an active cytokine receptor complex. A high-resolution structure of an active JAK-bound receptor signaling complex in the membrane will be required to fully describe the interplay between JAK and receptor subunits.</p><p>In our two structures, we see the JAK2/EPOR and JAK2/LEPR dimers interface at different angles. Currently, we are unable to ascertain whether these differing angles are due to crystal packing or are a result of differences in the receptor sequences between EPOR and LEPR. Regardless, the flexibility of the JAK2–JAK2 interface seen in these two examples suggests that contact between the two JAKs is not required for dimerization and that the receptor switch residues instead drive dimer formation. Given that most cytokine receptor signaling dimers consist not of homodimeric pairs, but instead involve two unique receptor chains uniting two unique JAKs (i.e. JAK1/JAK2), a lack of specific contacts between the dimerized JAKs may be a feature to preserve the modularity of the JAK system. Receptor-driven dimerization would allow for receptor sequence variation to fine-tune JAK dimer formation and binding affinity to regulate kinase signaling strength. Our working model presented here further illuminates the inherent modularity and flexibility found in the JAK-coupled receptor systems, which underlies their propagation and success as key signaling nodes in higher eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Receptor-mediated dimerization of JAK2 FERM domains is required for JAK2 activation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yibing Shan as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jeffrey J Babon (Reviewer #2); Stefan Constantinescu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report two crystal structures of the JAK2 FERM/SH2 domains, one with fragments of Leptin receptor (LEPR) bound and another with fragments of Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) bound. Although homologous FERM/SH2 structures have been reported, these structures are the first of the prototypical JAK2 protein. The authors propose that the crystal dimers they captured, in which the FERM domains are cross-linked by the juxtamembrane region of the receptors, reflect the functional dimer structures in JAK2 signaling. Consistent with this notion, it was shown that mutations at LEPR juxtamembrane region abates JAK2 signaling but does not disrupt JAK2-LEPR binding. The reviewers think these results are potentially highly important, given that there is no clear structural understanding of JAK2 activation and this is the first plausible proposal with support from crystallographic data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raised several points that need to be addressed, which mostly concern the Discussion.</p><p>1) While this study offers elegant structural validation of previous functional studies which first proposed this switch motif in EPOR, as well as demonstrating that a single EPOR binds both JAK2 FERM domains within a JAK2 dimer, it is not clear whether this crystal structure necessarily represents a fully active structure, as claimed in the Discussion (fourth paragraph), or some intermediate dimer between fully active and inactive. Without including the kinase and pseudokinase domains, it is not obvious whether this arrangement of receptor and JAK is the same when the pseudokinase domain inhibits the kinase domain or not. It would be useful to explain in the last paragraph of the Introduction how the authors envisage intracellular changes in JAK2 conformation that are required to transition two JAK2 kinases to an active state.</p><p>2) The JAK2 SH2-JH2 linker is about four times as long as stated here (Discussion, first paragraph), maybe this increased inter-domain flexibility would change the model of KD/psKD auto-inhibitory complex described in this paragraph? Alternatively perhaps the authors referred to the short nJH2-JH1 linker.</p><p>3) This model implies a membrane orientation of the FERM/SH2 domains by which the prominently positively charged C-terminal helical subdomain of FERM will not be in an ideal position to contact the membrane; in the meantime, the extensive regions of the FERM/SH2 domains will be in membrane contact without much sign of positive electrostatic property. This raises question as to whether this dimer represents the stable active state of JAK2.</p><p>4) There could be other interpretations for the mutagenesis date at the receptor's juxtamembrane region. For instance, one alternative scenario could be that the receptor juxtamembrane regions are dimerized in the active state, and the mutations disrupt the dimerization. Excluding such possibilities would be beyond the scope of this manuscript, but they should be acknowledged and discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38089.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raised several points that need to be addressed, which mostly concern the Discussion.</p><p>1) While this study offers elegant structural validation of previous functional studies which first proposed this switch motif in EPOR, as well as demonstrating that a single EPOR binds both JAK2 FERM domains within a JAK2 dimer, it is not clear whether this crystal structure necessarily represents a fully active structure, as claimed in the Discussion (fourth paragraph), or some intermediate dimer between fully active and inactive.

We have also made a number of changes to the last paragraph of the Introduction to clarify our starting hypothesis at the outset of these studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The JAK2 SH2-JH2 linker is about four times as long as stated here (Discussion, first paragraph), maybe this increased inter-domain flexibility would change the model of KD/psKD auto-inhibitory complex described in this paragraph? Alternatively perhaps the authors referred to the short nJH2-JH1 linker.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for catching this error. Our analysis of the linker length (~10 amino acids as stated) was incorrect, and after careful review of our structures (JAK2 FERM/SH2) as well as analysis of PDB structures (4FVQ, Bandaranayake NSMB 2012) we have found that the ordered C-term of the JAK2 FERM/SH2 is Asn515 and ordered N-term of the JAK2 pseudokinase (psKD) is Val536, so the linker length is approximately 20 residues. We have adjusted our manuscript accordingly (Discussion, first paragraph). Interestingly, analysis of JAK1 FERM/SH2 and pseudokinase structures (PDB 5IXD and 4L00) shows the resolved C-term of the SH2 to be Glu563 and resolved N-term of pseudokinase to be Trp564, so there is a very short linker between the JAK1 SH2 and pseudokinase domains. For TYK2 FERM/SH2 and pseudokinase (PDB 4PO6 and 4WOV), the resolved C-term of the SH2 to be Gly566 and resolved N-term of pseudokinase to be Ser580 (~12 residue linker).</p><p>Based on these structures, the linkers found in JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 vary between zero and 20 residues. In the absence of proper structural context in both the published and currently described individual domain structures, we postulate that these linker regions are likely not solvent-exposed, and instead probably form some sort of structural “glue” between the pseudokinase, kinase, and FERM/SH2 domains that aids in maintaining an autoinhibited complex. The length of the linker may also reflect differences in autoinhibition mechanism, i.e. intra- or inter-JAK autoinhibitory interactions between pseudokinase/kinase domains. Regardless, we expect that structural changes induced by the dimerization of JAK2 FERM/SH2 domains would disrupt this autoinhibited state, in particular if the autoinhibited state involves an interaction between the FERM/SH2 and the pseudokinase/kinase near this linker connection site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) This model implies a membrane orientation of the FERM/SH2 domains by which the prominently positively charged C-terminal helical subdomain of FERM will not be in an ideal position to contact the membrane; in the meantime, the extensive regions of the FERM/SH2 domains will be in membrane contact without much sign of positive electrostatic property. This raises question as to whether this dimer represents the stable active state of JAK2.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their astute observation of the JAK surface electrostatics – during our analysis, we noticed as well that the positively charged patch on the FERM F2 subdomain would not be in primary contact with the membrane. However, it is our opinion that the autoinhibited off state is probably the primary state in which JAKs reside, and the positioning of this basic patch may be a reflection of this stable “resting” state for the JAK/receptor complex. One could also argue that if the activated, dimeric JAK molecular surface is optimally electrostatically coupled with the membrane this could increase complex stability, activation kinetics and therefore JAK signal strength, and ultimately have negative consequences for the cell. In summary, we feel that the absence of a highly basic interface doesn’t argue for or against this JAK2 dimer being a snapshot of the active complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There could be other interpretations for the mutagenesis date at the receptor's juxtamembrane region.

We have added a paragraph to the text to further discuss the possibility of TM/juxtamembrane helix formation and receptor dimer formation to the text to address this possibility (Discussion, fifth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
