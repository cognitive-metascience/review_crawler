Here, we provide evidence that ROCK1 and ROCK2 act redundantly to maintain actomyosin contractility and cell proliferation and that their loss leads to cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence. This phenotype arises from down-regulation of the essential cell-cycle proteins CyclinA, CKS1 and CDK1. Accordingly, while the loss of either <italic>Rock1</italic> or <italic>Rock2</italic> had no negative impact on tumorigenesis in mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, loss of both blocked tumor formation, as no tumors arise in which both <italic>Rock1</italic> and <italic>Rock2</italic> have been genetically deleted. Our results reveal an indispensable role for ROCK, yet redundant role for isoforms 1 and 2, in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, possibly through the maintenance of cellular contractility.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12203.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12203.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12203.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal cells contain a structure called the cytoskeleton, which helps give the cells their shape. This structure can rapidly disassemble and reassemble, which enables cells to change their shape, move and divide into two. Many proteins are involved in controlling these processes. In particular, two proteins called ROCK1 and ROCK2 are known to be important for helping cancer cells move. However, investigations into the exact roles of these proteins have so far produced contradictory results.</p><p>Kümper et al. have now developed a more refined method of studying what ROCK1 and ROCK2 do in cells. This involves genetically engineering mice in a way that makes it possible to control whether ROCK1 and ROCK2 are produced in specific cell types and tissues. Studying cells that had been taken from these mice revealed that cells that lacked both proteins could not contract. Moreover, these cells became bigger and flattened out. This change in appearance went hand in hand with the cells becoming unable to divide and form new cells. However, cells that lacked just one type of ROCK protein were still able to divide and proliferate.</p><p>As tumors form as a result of cells dividing and proliferating uncontrollably, Kümper et al. then studied how the ROCK proteins affect tumor development in mice that are susceptible to lung or skin cancer. Although cancerous cells were found that contained just one type of ROCK protein, no tumor cells were found that lacked both ROCK1 and ROCK2, further confirming that having one ROCK protein is essential for tumor formation.</p><p>Overall, it appears that within the systems studied ROCK1 and ROCK2 perform the same roles, and that ROCK proteins are indispensable for cell proliferation and hence tumor development. The next challenge will be to identify the tumor types that are highly dependent on processes driven by the ROCK proteins. Further work could then investigate whether drugs that inhibit the activity of the ROCK proteins block the growth and spread of these tumors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12203.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12203.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>rho kinase</kwd><kwd>ROCK</kwd><kwd>cellular senescence</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>actomyosin contractility</kwd><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C107/A1205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kümper</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Mardakheh</surname><given-names>Faraz K</given-names></name><name><surname>McCarthy</surname><given-names>Afshan</given-names></name><name><surname>Yeo</surname><given-names>Maggie</given-names></name><name><surname>Sadok</surname><given-names>Amine</given-names></name><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C107/A10433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kümper</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Mardakheh</surname><given-names>Faraz K</given-names></name><name><surname>McCarthy</surname><given-names>Afshan</given-names></name><name><surname>Yeo</surname><given-names>Maggie</given-names></name><name><surname>Paul</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name><name><surname>Sadok</surname><given-names>Amine</given-names></name><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C107/A16512</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kümper</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Mardakheh</surname><given-names>Faraz K</given-names></name><name><surname>McCarthy</surname><given-names>Afshan</given-names></name><name><surname>Yeo</surname><given-names>Maggie</given-names></name><name><surname>Paul</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name><name><surname>Sadok</surname><given-names>Amine</given-names></name><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Rho kinases ROCK1 and 2 act redundantly in regulating cell proliferation and their depletion causes cellular senescence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein serine/threonine kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2 are downstream effectors of the Rho subfamily of small GTPases. They are activated by interaction with Rho GTPases and act through a number of pathways to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and thus cell migration, cell-cell adhesion and cancer cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itoh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Olson and Sahai, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thumkeo et al., 2013</xref>). Substrates for ROCKs include the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (MYPT1) and the myosin regulatory light chain (MLC), which regulate actomyosin contractile forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawano et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kureishi et al., 1997</xref>). Actomyosin contractility is generated when myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) is phosphorylated, allowing myosin II interaction with actin filaments to generate mechanical force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aksoy et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kureishi et al., 1997</xref>). ROCKs may either directly phosphorylate MLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 1996</xref>) or indirectly regulate MLC phosphorylation by phosphorylating the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (MYPT1) and inactivating it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>). Myosin phosphatase inactivation results from phosphorylation of two inhibitory sites, Thr696 and Thr850, on MYPT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawano et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muranyi et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, ROCKs phosphorylate and activate LIM kinases 1 and 2 (LIMK1, 2), which inhibit the actin-depolymerizing protein Cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). ROCK1 and 2 exhibit 65% overall identity and 87% within the kinase domain, and some studies suggest differential roles for the isoforms. Using RNA interference, ROCK1 was reported to be important for stress fiber formation in fibroblasts, whereas ROCK2 controls cortical contractility and phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoneda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2007</xref>). Distinct roles for ROCK1 and 2 have also been described in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lock and Hotchin, 2009</xref>) and cell detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mice in which <italic>Rock</italic>1 has been genetically deleted are born, but have defects in eyelid as well as ventral body wall closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shimizu et al., 2005</xref>). Ninety percent of <italic>Rock2</italic> null mice die in utero due to defects in the placental labyrinth layer. This indicates that ROCK1 cannot compensate for a loss of ROCK2. However, the few <italic>Rock2</italic> null mice, that are born, display defects similar to those described in <italic>Rock1</italic> null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thumkeo et al., 2003</xref>). This indicates some level of functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thumkeo et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to their role in cell migration, ROCKs have been reported to modulate apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sebbagh et al., 2005</xref>) and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Croft and Olson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samuel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). The precise role of ROCKs in cell proliferation is not clear: some reports suggest ROCK function is required for G1/S progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Croft and Olson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), but others suggest ROCK is only required for anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sahai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vigil et al., 2012</xref>). One in vivo study reported that over-activation of ROCK, by expressing the kinase domain of ROCK2 in mouse skin, led to hyperproliferation and epidermal thickening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samuel et al., 2011</xref>). In order to investigate the roles of ROCK1 and 2 in tumorigenesis, we have generated conditional <italic>Rock1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> knockout mice and studied these in vivo, using genetically engineered mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and <italic>Braf<sup>V600</sup></italic><sup>E</sup> mutant models of melanoma, as well as in vitro, using cells isolated from these mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Depletion of both ROCK1 and 2 leads to multi-stage cell cycle arrest through defects in actomyosin contractility</title><p>It is well understood that ROCKs control key aspects of the actin cytoskeleton such as actomyosin contractility, but their role in cell proliferation is not known.

Cells treated for 48 hr with the ROCK inhibitor H1152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sasaki et al., 2002</xref>) had reduced proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar results were observed with other ROCK inhibitors, such as GSK269962A, AT13148, GSK429286A and chroman1 (data not shown). However, the much-used ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Narumiya et al., 2000</xref>) had a much weaker effect on cell proliferation than H1152 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies, where we have shown that Y-27632 is a less effective ROCK inhibitor than H1152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sadok et al., 2015</xref>). To determine whether defects in proliferation were due to ROCK-mediated effects on actomyosin contractility, cells were treated with blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin II ATPase, for 48 hr.

One of the most prominent responses to activated ROCK is the generation of actin stress fibers, which regulate cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ridley, 1999</xref>). A previous report using RNA interference suggested that ROCK1, rather than ROCK2, is important for stress fiber formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoneda et al., 2005</xref>). After thorough analysis of ROCK depletion upon infection with Ad-Cre or Ad-GFP, a slight decrease in protein levels was observed after three days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Therefore, the classical senescence pathways did not seem to be affected in <italic>Rock1<sup>∆/∆</sup>;Rock2<sup>∆/∆</sup> </italic>cells or cells treated for prolonged periods with H1152. To identify protein changes associated with senescence, we used immunoblotting and quantitative mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ong et al., 2002</xref>). The protein levels of some cell cycle regulators appeared to change upon treatment with Cre recombinase alone, so for proteomics analysis we focused on long-term H1152 treatment. Annotation enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>) of the proteome-wide changes after long-term ROCK inhibition revealed many cell cycle-related protein categories that were significantly modulated in ROCK-inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), consistent with a prominent cell-cycle phenotype. However, when we analyzed proteins that are known to control G1 cell-cycle arrest and senescence, we did not detect significant changes in the levels of these proteins. These included known regulators, such as p16, p19, p27, p21, CyclinD1, CyclinE, or phosphorylation of Rb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).

Long-term treatment of cells with blebbistatin (blebbistatin +/-), but not the inactive enantiomer (blebbistatin +), also decreased the levels of CDK1, CyclinA and CKS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), suggesting that it is loss of contractility downstream of ROCK loss that results in down-regulation of these proteins. However, it cannot be ruled out that both ROCK inhibition/depletion as well as myosin II inhibition independently lead to a similar phenotype.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12203.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Downregulation of CKS1, CyclinA and CDK1 on abrogation of ROCK function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MEFs were treated with H1152 or vehicle for 3 days and the proteome analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry.

Known targets such as the phosphorylation of cofilin are not affected in single or double knockout cells. However, using quantitative mass spectrometry treatment of cells with the ROCK inhibitor H1152, we show that Cofilin phosphorylation is affected after short-term ROCK inhibition but recovers upon long-term treatment. This indicates that other kinases are able to take over and phosphorylate Cofilin. MLC phosphorylation, however, is not recovered indicating that ROCK is the major kinase regulating MLC phosphorylation.</p><p>We demonstrate that the depletion of ROCK1 and 2 leads to severe defects in cell proliferation, which is not observed in cells lacking either ROCK1 or 2. Defects in cell proliferation are also observed in cells treated long-term with ROCK inhibitors or the MyosinII inhibitor blebbistatin. Previous work with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 has led to contradictory results on the requirement for ROCK in cell proliferation. We believe that this may reflect the relatively low potency of Y-27632 as a ROCK inhibitor, since we found that treatment with several other ROCK inhibitors (H1152, GSK269962A, AT13148, GSK429286A and chroman1), which have been shown to be more potent than Y-27632 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sadok et al., 2015</xref>), could mimic the effects of genetic deletion of <italic>Rock1</italic> and <italic>Rock2</italic>.</p><p>Cell proliferation defects upon deletion of ROCK1 and 2 are due to a G1 arrest and a block in cytokinesis. Interestingly, the cell proliferation defects arising from abrogation of ROCK function result in cellular senescence, both in vitro and in vivo. This cellular senescence does not appear to involve changes in levels of the cell cycle inhibitors p16, p21, p27, but the down-regulation of cell-cycle proteins CDK1, Cyclin A and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CKS1. CKS1 is known to regulate levels of CDK1 and Cyclin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martinsson-Ahlzen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Westbrook et al., 2007</xref>), and can function in G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tang and Reed, 1993</xref>). Interestingly, it has been shown that <italic>Cks1b<sup>-/- </sup></italic>cells are defective in proliferation, have reduced proportions of cells in S- and G1-phase, accumulation of cells with G2/M DNA content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoellein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spruck et al., 2001</xref>) and exhibit senescence. We therefore propose that an essential function of ROCK in cell proliferation is to regulate the expression of CKS1. In addition, this ROCK-driven CKS1 down-regulation is a novel marker of senescence.</p><p>CKS1 does not appear to be regulated at the mRNA level, thus further studies are required to understand how ROCK function could regulate CKS1 protein. Protein degradation was not mediated by the proteasome or APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup> complex (data not shown). APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup> was previously shown to regulate the degradation of CKS1 and Skp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bashir et al., 2004</xref>). CKS1 and Skp2 are the targeting subunits of the SCF<sup>Skp2–Cks1</sup> ubiquitin ligase regulating p21 and p27 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sutterluty et al., 1999</xref>). Even though we were unable to detect Skp2 in our system, we do show that p21 and p27 levels are not affected upon loss of ROCK, suggesting a novel regulation of CKS1 and function in mediating senescence. More work is required to unravel the complete mechanism and determine how downregulation of these proteins is mediated.</p><p>We observed that treatment with blebbistatin a direct inhibitor of myosin II led to cell cycle arrest, senescence and reduced levels of CKS1, CyclinA and CDK1, potentially suggesting that ROCK-dependent regulation of cell proliferation is through the inhibition of actomyosin contractility rather than another target of ROCK signaling.</p><p>Using tumor samples as well as tumor derived cell lines, from two different genetically engineered mouse models of tumorigenesis, we find that tumor formation is incompatible with homozygous deletion of both <italic>Rock1</italic> and <italic>Rock2,</italic> since tumors arising in <italic>Rock1<sup>f/f</sup>;Rock2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice always retained either un-recombined <italic>Rock1<sup>f/f</sup></italic>or <italic>Rock2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> alleles and showed expression of either ROCK1 or ROCK2, respectively. Targeting either <italic>Rock1</italic> or <italic>Rock2</italic> appears to have mild and divergent consequences in the mouse models. Deletion of <italic>Rock1</italic> appears to increase tumor burden in the NSCLC model, whereas deletion of <italic>Rock2</italic> leads to decreased tumor onset and survival in the melanoma model. These putative tumor suppressor functions of <italic>Rock1</italic> and <italic>Rock2</italic> do not appear to be a consequence of differential expression as the absolute concentration of the two isoforms was found to be similar by SRM. These results require further investigation and will be the basis of a separate manuscript.</p><p>The retention of ROCK protein in <italic>Rock1<sup>f/f</sup>;Rock2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, however, demonstrates that ROCK function is essential for tumorigenesis. Incomplete excision of proteins that affect cell proliferation has been reported in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kissil et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peschard et al., 2012</xref>). In the tumor models used in this study, excision of <italic>Rock</italic> alleles and tumor initiation are achieved simultaneously in an inducible fashion; therefore we propose that the activation of Cre recombinase leads to the formation of a mixed population of cells in which either <italic>Rock,</italic> or both <italic>Rock1</italic> and <italic>2,</italic> have been excised. The ROCK1 and 2 double-null cells, however, are unable to form a tumor as they are defective in cell proliferation and senesce. The remaining cells, that is those that have retained either <italic>Rock</italic> allele form tumors but these are the genetic equivalent of a single knockout.</p><p>In summation, our data reveal that ROCK proteins act redundantly to regulate actomyosin contractility, and that this function of ROCK is necessary, by supporting levels of the cell cycle regulators Cyclin A, CDK1 and CKS1, for senescence, cell cycle progression and proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Recent studies have identified a role for ROCK inhibition in combinatorial treatments in BRAF-mutant melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smit et al., 2014</xref>), as well as in Kras-driven lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>). Our data thus provide a molecular basis, and highlight the need, for exploiting the use of effective ROCK inhibitors as anti-cancer agents either alone or in combination. However, incomplete or specific inhibition of only one isoform of ROCK alone may not be an effective treatment, and may even lead to adverse results as our results also highlight isoform specific tumor suppressive functions for ROCK1 in lung and ROCK2 in melanoma models.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Institute of Cancer Research in accordance with National Home Office regulations under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. <italic>Rock1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> gene-targeting vectors were made by inserting arms of homology into the PGKneoF2L2DTA vector (Phillipe Soriano, Addgene plasmid #13445 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoch and Soriano, 2006</xref>]), where loxP sites flank exon 6 of <italic>Rock1 (Rock1<sup>f/f</sup></italic>) and exons 5–6 of <italic>Rock2 (Rock2<sup>f/f</sup></italic>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an important study that describes the effect of Rock-deficiency on proliferation and tumorigenesis. The technical advance described is the use of floxed Rock1/2 mice for these studies, although some studies are performed using Rock inhibitors. The authors conclude that Rock is required for proliferation and that Rock-deficiency causes senescence mediated by a Trp53-independent pathway by down-regulation of Cdk1, CycA, and CKS1. A requirement of Rock for tumor formation was established using mouse models of lung cancer (Ras-driven) and melanoma (B-Raf-driven).</p><p>The data presented are convincing, but there are several areas of ambiguity and revision of the manuscript is required to clarify these issues.</p><p>1) The authors should explicitly document the time course of events following Rock gene ablation. The authors report that a &quot;tail retraction&quot; phenotype followed by a flattened morphology at later times. What is the time course of Rock protein loss and MLC phosphorylation? Is Rock lost first and the senescence phenotype immediately observed or does the senescence phenotype gradually develop at some time after loss of Rock protein? A time course description of these events would be helpful.</p><p>2) In the Introduction, the authors refer to the literature by stating that previous studies on Rock have focused on cell migration. Omission of an analysis of cell migration in this study appears to be a weakness. Clearly, senescent cells will have a migration defect, but can cell migration by examined after Rock protein loss and before the onset of senescence? The manuscript would be improved by addressing this issue.</p><p>3) The Trp53-independence of the senescence is not completely convincing based on the data presented. The key experiment requires 6 floxed alleles to be deleted. It is important that the ablation of Trp53 and Rock genes and loss of protein expression are documented in this study to show that Trp53 is not required for senescence.</p><p>4) The mechanism of Trp53-independent senescence is not well established – it may require Cdk1, CycA, and CKS1, but the mechanism is unclear and the stated hypothesis is not tested. As an initial description, this is acceptable, but these caveats should be stated. It is also unclear why the text invokes Cdk1, CycA, and CKS1 while the Abstract only refers to Cdk1 and CKS1. Moreover, in subheading “Loss of ROCK-dependent actomyosin contractility leads to cellular senescence”, the authors argue that there is a block in G1, while in the Abstract, the authors indicate that it was a multi-stage cell cycle arrest. The wording is confusing and should be clarified in the Abstract and the text of the Results section of the manuscript.</p><p>5) The purpose of the SRM analysis of the tumor cell lines is unclear since the presence of Rock can be detected by western. What is the evidence that the tumor cells are not a mixture of Rock positive and negative cells? It appears that the presence of Rock is interpreted as if all the cells must express Rock – importantly, this interpretation is required for the authors' conclusions. A more rigorous test would be immunostaining of tumor sections with antibodies to Rock and/or phospho Ser-19/Thr-20 MLC if that is technically feasible.</p><p>6) Paragraph two, subheading “Depletion of both ROCK1 and 2 leads to multi-stage cell cycle arrest through defects in actomyosin contractility”. To test whether the effect of Rock depletion is caused by actomyosin contractility, the authors examined the effect of blebbistatin. Similar comments are made throughout the manuscript. This experiment is not a formal test of whether the Rock phenotype is caused by a change in actomyosin contractility – it is only a correlation that the phenotypes caused by blebbistatin and Rock depletion are similar. These statements should be re-worded throughout, including the title of the manuscript.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> does not necessarily show a 'significant slower' growth rate as stated – but rather sluggish growth, perhaps caused by a delay in growth initiation. If these mice had been allowed progress further, the rate of growth might have been restored and the slope indistinguishable. In their mice experiments, was there any evidence for senescence in vivo at the phase of the growth curve where there was a visible difference in growth – perhaps around day 15 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>?</p><p>8) The key blots should be quantified. Due to the different exposures and background, it is a little difficult to assess the degree of protein changes at times.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12203.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The data presented are convincing, but there are several areas of ambiguity and revision of the manuscript is required to clarify these issues.</italic> </p><p>In response to the raised concerns, several new additional supplementary data has been added to the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p><p><italic>1) The authors should explicitly document the time course of events following Rock gene ablation.

Is Rock lost first and the senescence phenotype immediately observed or does the senescence phenotype gradually develop at some time after loss of Rock protein? A time course description of these events would be helpful.</italic> </p><p>We find that ROCK is gradually lost over a time course of 5 days, at which point, it was when it was found to be completely depleted. We have now included a time course showing ROCK depletion after Ad-Cre-GFP and Ad-GFP infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 —figure supplement 1A</xref>). Cells display a tail retraction phenotype 3 days after adenovirus infection when ROCK levels are reduced but not completely depleted. After 5 days levels are depleted to a maximum and cellular senescence is seen. When inhibitors such as H1152 are used to analyze senescence, similar results are observed, starting with an initial tail retraction phenotype and finally cellular senescence after prolonged exposure to the inhibitors. To clarify the course of events upon ROCK depletion, we have extended the description of occurrence of each event after infection with adenovirus and depletion of ROCKs (subheading “ROCK1 and ROCK2 act redundantly to regulate actomyosin contractility and cell shape.”).</p><p><italic>2) In the Introduction, the authors refer to the literature by stating that previous studies on Rock have focused on cell migration. Omission of an analysis of cell migration in this study appears to be a weakness. Clearly, senescent cells will have a migration defect, but can cell migration by examined after Rock protein loss and before the onset of senescence? The manuscript would be improved by addressing this issue.</italic> </p><p>We have included quantification of migration speed and directionality of Rock1<sup>∆/∆</sup>;Rock2∆/∆ cells compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, subheading “ROCK1 and ROCK2 act redundantly to regulate actomyosin contractility and cell shape.”). This analysis was done between Days 3 and 4 after adenovirus infection, before the onset of senescence. An increase in migration speed and directionality is seen in Rock1<sup>∆/∆</sup>;Rock2<sup>∆/∆</sup> cells compared to controls as described previously (Lomakin et al., 2015).</p><p><italic>3) The Trp53-independence of the senescence is not completely convincing based on the data presented. The key experiment requires 6 floxed alleles to be deleted. It is important that the ablation of Trp53 and Rock genes and loss of protein expression are documented in this study to show that Trp53 is not required for senescence.</italic> </p><p>We have included the Western Blot analysis of cells used for SA-βGal analysis showing that p53, together with ROCK1 and ROCK2, have been depleted upon Cre recombination, showing that the infection is efficient enough to cause recombination of all 6 floxed alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>; subheading “ROCK regulates cell cycle proteins CKS1 and CDK1”). We also have data using P53 wild type and null MEFs that have been treated with the Rock inhibitors, H1152 and GSK269962A for 5 days followed by SA-βGal staining to show that the observed senescence phenotype upon loss of Rock is not dependent on p53 status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>; subheading “ROCK regulates cell cycle proteins CKS1 and CDK1”).</p><p><italic>4) The mechanism of Trp53-independent senescence is not well established</italic> – <italic>it may require Cdk1, CycA, and CKS1, but the mechanism is unclear and the stated hypothesis is not tested. As an initial description, this is acceptable, but these caveats should be stated. It is also unclear why the text invokes Cdk1, CycA, and CKS1 while the Abstract only refers to Cdk1 and CKS1.

The wording is confusing and should be clarified in the Abstract and the text of the Results section of the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We have re-worded the manuscript Abstract and Discussion (paragraph four) to clarify that although CKS1, Cyclin A and CDK1 are involved in the development of senescence, more work is required to determine the mechanism of how CKS1, Cyclin A and CDK1 are down-regulated to cause this phenotype. The term multi-stage cell cycle has been changed to cell cycle arrest (Abstract).</p><p><italic>5) The purpose of the SRM analysis of the tumor cell lines is unclear since the presence of Rock can be detected by western. What is the evidence that the tumor cells are not a mixture of Rock positive and negative cells? It appears that the presence of Rock is interpreted as if all the cells must express Rock</italic> – <italic>importantly, this interpretation is required for the authors' conclusions. A more rigorous test would be immunostaining of tumor sections with antibodies to Rock and/or phospho Ser-19/Thr-20 MLC if that is technically feasible.</italic> </p><p>a) The purpose of the SRM analysis was to determine the absolute amount of the two ROCK isoforms to analyze whether one isoform was more expressed than the other which is not possible by Western Blot analysis (paragraph three, subheading “ROCK function is essential for tumorigenesis, but ROCK1 and 2 proteins act redundantly.”). Because we had observed subtle differences when knocking out individual isoforms in the two mouse tumor models, one could have suspected a higher expression of one isoform over the other. By using SRM, we have shown in vivo removal of either ROCK isoform, as well as comparing absolute quantities of ROCK1 vs ROCK2. We have added sentences within the Results section (paragraph three, subheading “ROCK function is essential for tumorigenesis, but ROCK1 and 2 proteins act redundantly”) and Discussion (paragraph six) to clarify the use and potential of SRM.</p><p>b) We spent a great deal of time assessing Rock loss in tumor and tissue sections by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence with antibodies to ROCK but found that these antibodies were not specific to either ROCK hence is was not been possible to monitor each isoform in situ. We also used pMYPT as a surrogate for pMLC but again found that in our hands this was not sensitive enough to quantify loss of ROCK in single cells. The cells derived from these tumors do show that there is incomplete excision of one or other of the ROCK isoforms indicating that the tumors are not a mixture of ROCK positive and negative cells but potentially a mixture of ROCK negative cells with different isoforms excised. The cells in which complete excision has taken place do not proliferate and hence do not form a tumor.</p><p><italic>6) Paragraph two, subheading “Depletion of both ROCK1 and 2 leads to multi-stage cell cycle arrest through defects in actomyosin contractility”. To test whether the effect of Rock depletion is caused by actomyosin contractility, the authors examined the effect of blebbistatin. Similar comments are made throughout the manuscript. This experiment is not a formal test of whether the Rock phenotype is caused by a change in actomyosin contractility – it is only a correlation that the phenotypes caused by blebbistatin and Rock depletion are similar. These statements should be re-worded throughout, including the title of the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We have adjusted the title, text and Discussion to highlight that even though a similar phenotype is seen comparing inhibition/depletion of ROCK, leading to a loss of actomyosin contractility, and inhibition of actomyosin contractility through myosin II using blebbistatin, we cannot be sure that these are within the same pathway. However, correlative evidence suggests that this may be the case. Changes in Abstract, Results section (paragraph one, subheading “ROCK regulates cell cycle proteins CKS1 and CDK1”) and Discussion (paragraph four).</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> does not necessarily show a 'significant slower' growth rate as stated – but rather sluggish growth, perhaps caused by a delay in growth initiation. If these mice had been allowed progress further, the rate of growth might have been restored and the slope indistinguishable. In their mice experiments, was there any evidence for senescence</italic> in vivo <italic>at the phase of the growth curve where there was a visible difference in growth – perhaps around day 15 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>?</italic> </p><p>a) At the time of injection, not all cells have complete excision of the Rocks (approximately 40% of cells have incomplete excision of Rock, which is based on the growth rate and retainers found to be growing out in culture). We know that a single allele of Rock is sufficient for proliferation but complete loss of ROCK will lead to senescence and an inability to proliferate, thereby leading to the ‘sluggish growth’ seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. We would also anticipate that the growth would be restored to wild type levels but at a longer time point because these cells (with incomplete excision) behave like wild type cells and will eventually take over the tumor.</p><p>b) We have carried out the experiment suggested above, regarding senescence in vivo. We terminated the experiment at day 15 and stained the tumors for SA-Β Gal but found that there were very few senescent cells in both the control (Rock1f/f;Rock2f/f (p53 DD; H-RasV12) tumors and tumors arising from Rock1<sup>∆/∆</sup>;Rock2<sup>∆/∆</sup> (p53 DD; H-RasV12) MEFs and found no difference between them.</p><p>We have however carried out SA-βGal analysis in tumors generated by injection of 690cl2 mouse melanoma cells, followed by treatment of the mice with the ROCK inhibitor AT13148. This treatment resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth and increase of SA-βGal positive cells. The data can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-C</xref> and within the Results section (paragraph one, subheading “Loss of ROCK-dependent actomyosin contractility leads to cellular senescence”).</p><p><italic>8) The key blots should be quantified.
