to fuel macromolecule biosynthesis. Metabolic enzymes are presumed regulators of this glycolysis-driven metabolic program, known as the Warburg effect; however, few have been identified. We uncover a previously unappreciated role for Mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) as a metabolic enzyme required to maintain Warburg metabolism in zebrafish embryos and in both primary and malignant mammalian cells. The functional consequences of MPI loss are striking: glycolysis is blocked and cells die. These phenotypes are caused by induction of p53 and accumulation of the glycolytic intermediate fructose 6-phosphate, leading to engagement of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), increased O-GlcNAcylation, and p53 stabilization. Inhibiting the HBP through genetic and chemical methods reverses p53 stabilization and rescues the Mpi-deficient phenotype. This work provides mechanistic evidence by which MPI loss induces p53, and identifies MPI as a novel regulator of p53 and Warburg metabolism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22477.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22477.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>glucose metabolism</kwd><kwd>Warburg effect</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>O-GlcNAc</kwd><kwd>zebrafish embryo</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08 DK101340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Jaime</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Mindich Child Health and Development Institute at Mount Sinai</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Jaime</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK080789</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sadler</surname><given-names>Kirsten C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AA018886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sadler</surname><given-names>Kirsten C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK99551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freeze</surname><given-names>Hudson H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Rocket Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freeze</surname><given-names>Hudson H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DK007792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeRossi</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mannose phosphate isomerase is a metabolic enzyme regulating cell survival in both embryonic and cancer cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The importance of glucose metabolism to cellular proliferation was uncovered by the pioneering work of Otto Warburg who showed that cancer cells undergo an energetic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to increased aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Warburg et al., 1924</xref>). This metabolic reprogramming, termed the Warburg effect, is required for the rapid proliferation of cancer cells. This strategy has also been shown to be utilized by rapidly dividing cells during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Krisher and Prather, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ma et al., 2010</xref>): retinal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>), proliferating lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Palmer et al., 2015</xref>) and thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brand and Hermfisse, 1997</xref>), and embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kondoh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kim et al., 2014</xref>), all of which rely on glycolysis as the primary mechanism of energy generation. Thus, as with many cancer-promoting pathways, the Warburg effect appears to be an embryonic program co-opted by cancer cells. However, the physiological and molecular factors that regulate the Warburg effect in both cancer and embryonic cells remain poorly understood.</p><p>Signaling and tumor suppressor pathways, including the AKT/PI3K and p53 pathways, have been shown in some systems to regulate glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bensaad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Elstrom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kruiswijk et al., 2015</xref>). However, there is only a limited understanding of the metabolic control points and key players involved in the complex relationship between metabolism and cell proliferation. Despite intensive work on the Warburg effect over the past 90 years, the mechanisms that promote this dependency on glycolysis for cell survival are poorly understood. Clarifying the complex regulatory mechanisms of cells that employ the Warburg effect could reveal means to manipulate this fuel-generating mechanism of cancer cells. Metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells occurs by inducing the expression and activity of glycolytic enzymes. The paradigm is shifting with the discovery that metabolic enzymes are not merely secondary bystanders, but function as central oncogenic players. For instance, glycolytic enzymes such as PFK and LDHA have been shown to be essential for driving tumor formation and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fantin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Le et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yalcin et al., 2009</xref>), and tumor suppressor genes such as p53 are emerging as primary regulators of energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bensaad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheung and Vousden, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) catalyzes the interconversion of mannose 6-phosphate (Man6P) and fructose 6-phosphate (Fru6P)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gracy and Noltmann, 1968</xref>), effectively bridging N-glycosylation pathways with energy metabolism pathways, such as glycolysis and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). MPI is highly conserved from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schollen et al., 2000</xref>). No humans with complete absence of activity have been identified, suggesting that total loss of MPI is incompatible with survival. This conclusion is consistent with the findings that knockout of <italic>Mpi</italic> in mice is embryonic lethal by E11.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">DeRossi et al., 2006</xref>), and significant decrease of Mpi activity is embryonic lethal in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chu et al., 2013</xref>). Partial loss of MPI function in humans leads to a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG; MPI-CDG) characterized by hepatic fibrosis, biliary malformations, protein-losing enteropathy, and coagulopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Koning et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jaeken et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Niehues et al., 1998</xref>). However, the clinical presentation of MPI-CDG is inexplicably unique with its absence of neurologic or musculoskeletal disease when compared to every other 40+ types of CDG affecting N-linked glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sparks and Krasnewich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Lonlay et al., 2001</xref>).

Little is known about the function of MPI in cancer, but a recent study showing that MPI depletion in brain cancer cells enhances radiation-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cazet et al., 2014</xref>) supports our findings that Mpi loss in zebrafish embryos promotes cell death, and indicates that MPI provides a strong survival advantage in both embryos and cancer cells.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22477.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of involvement of MPI and Fru6P in metabolic pathways.</title><p>Key points described in the scheme are: MPI interconverts Man6P and Fru6P, and Man6P is a precursor of N-glycosylation.

We report that MPI loss suppresses glycolysis and stabilizes p53 leading to increased apoptosis. We provide mechanistic evidence showing that MPI loss leads to the accumulation of Fru6P and increased O-GlcNAcylation of proteins, notably p53, which results in its stabilization. Inhibition of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) or O-GlcNAcylation destabilizes p53 and rescues the Mpi-deficient phenotype and apoptosis. This demonstrates that MPI promotes the Warburg effect and cell survival, whereby loss of MPI can suppress glycolysis and activate O-GlcNAcylation and p53 through regulation of Fru6P accumulation and HBP activity. These mechanistic insights that may not only account for the clinical divergence of MPI-CDG from other CDG subtypes but also uncovers this novel pathway as a metabolic strategy that is conserved across vertebrates, common to both embryonic development and cancer, and broadens our understanding of the regulation of Warburg metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mpi loss causes cell death in zebrafish embryos via activation of p53</title><p>The stark discrepancy in clinical presentation of MPI-CDG patients with unique absence of debilitating neuromuscular symptoms found with every other type of CDG prompted us to investigate whether MPI plays a role in a cellular process distinct from protein N-glycosylation.

Specifically, we assessed apoptotic cell death, using acridine orange (AO) staining and cleaved Caspase-3 immunofluorescence staining. <italic>mpi</italic> MO embryos stained positive throughout the embryo, having significantly increased positive foci compared to std MO controls, for both acridine orange (AO: N = 4, p=0.002) and cleaved Caspase 3 (Casp3: N = 3, p=0.016) when quantified in the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Furthermore, cell death in <italic>mpi</italic> morphants was dependent on p53 since concurrent knockdown of <italic>tp53</italic> through co-injection of the <italic>p53</italic> MO significantly prevented the induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To test whether this induction of p53-dependent apoptosis was specific to MPI loss or a response to global disruption in N-glycosylation, we used tunicamycin (Tm), a well established and widely used inhibitor of N-glycosylation, which we have used extensively in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vacaru et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Howarth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cinaroglu et al., 2011</xref>), to test whether phenotypes were similar to that of Mpi depletion. Importantly, Tm treatment yielded very different phenotypes compared to <italic>mpi</italic> MO embryos, indicating different pathological function in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The efficacy of Tm in blocking glycosylation was confirmed using a transgenic zebrafish line that express human transferrin (<italic>Tg(fabp10:hTf;cmlc2:EGFP</italic>)), a clinical marker for hypoglycosylation in humans. Tm-treated embryos from this line demonstrated hypoglycosylation of human transferrin, as seen in zebrafish livers at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, Tm elicited gross phenotypes in embryos that were distinct from those observed in <italic>mpi</italic> MO; acridine orange staining in the Tm-treated embryos was notably absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Furthermore, disruption of N-glycosylation did not appear to be dependent on p53 as there was persistence of phenotypes in Tm-treated embryos in a <italic>p53</italic> MT background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that phenotypes following Mpi depletion are not a result of generalized disruption in N-glycosylation, and are specific to Mpi depletion. While this does not rule out that some of the Mpi-associated phenotypes could be caused by a modest defect in N-glycosylation, this instead highlights a new, alternative function of MPI in metabolism and p53 activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of MPI induces p53 in mammalian embryonic and cancer cells</title><p>The novel finding that p53 mediates the response to low Mpi levels in zebrafish embryos prompted us to examine if p53 is similarly induced following MPI depletion in mammalian cells.

Given the suppression of glycolysis we observed with MPI depletion, we hypothesized that the accumulation of Fru6P found after MPI depletion would be metabolized into pathways that also use Fru6P as substrate, other than N-glycosylation and glycolysis.

To address whether O-GlcNAcylated p53 was induced with MPI loss, we adapted a proximity ligation assay (PLA), which has been previously used to detect phosphorylation modifications using two specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jarvius et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we used PLA to visualize the O-GlcNAcylated form of p53 by using an anti-p53 antibody and an anti-O-GlcNAc antibody in SJSA cells. Following MPI knockdown, we found an increase in the level of O-GlcNAcylated p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Additionally, the signal of O-GlcNAcylated p53 was markedly diminished when co-treated with DON to block HBP and O-GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>). Nuclear signal was not detected in control siRNA tranfected cells. Based on this data, we conclude that across vertebrate species, MPI loss stabilizes p53 by increasing Fru6P flux into HBP to promote p53 O-GlcNAcylation revealing an entirely new function for a classic metabolic enzyme.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Embryonic and cancer cells rely on robust glucose metabolism to generate precursors for biosynthesis of lipids, nucleotides and amino acids and sustain rapid cell division. Due to this vital role in cell survival, regulation of glycolysis and Warburg metabolism requires careful orchestration by survival factors, metabolic enzymes, and metabolic intermediates themselves, via rate-limiting enzymatic steps, post-translational modifications and transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bensaad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Elstrom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kruiswijk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ozcan et al., 2010</xref>). The central findings of this study reveal a previously unappreciated role for MPI in HBP and p53 regulation, which is conserved across species, and shared between embryonic and cancer cells. We find that that MPI loss: (1) suppresses glycolysis and (2) induces p53 by increased flux through HBP and increased O-GlcNAcylation. We believe this novel role for MPI in p53 regulation is distinct from, but not necessarily at the expense of, its traditional and well-studied role in N-linked glycosylation. These data demonstrating a novel function of MPI is strongly supported by the fact that the clinical presentation of MPI-CDG is so distinct from every other type of congenital disorder of glycosylation, as well as other MPI studies that cast doubt on the magnitude of impact that MPI has on generalized N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">DeRossi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>), although this may be partially attributable to varied experimental conditions and assay sensitivity. Here, we broaden our understanding of the relationship between this classic metabolic enzyme, MPI, and one of the most well studied tumor suppressor proteins, p53, to maintain glycolysis and sustain cell survival.</p><p>The functional consequences of MPI loss are striking: glycolysis is blocked and cells die. In a range of systems - zebrafish embryos, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, mouse and human cancer cell lines, and primary human liver tumors - loss of MPI induced p53, revealing a new mechanism of p53 regulation. This provides insight into the regulation of the Warburg effect and uncovers a previously unappreciated role for MPI as positive regulator of glycolysis, and surprisingly, as an important and underappreciated mediator of Fru6P, as MPI activity is required to prevent accumulation of Fru6P, a central glycolytic substrate. This accumulation of Fru6P may be due to primary effects of depletion of MPI enzymatic activity, but also may have contributions from regulation by p53, which has also been shown to play a role in the complex metabolic coordination and distribution of Fru6P between glycolysis, HBP, N-glycosylation, and the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheung and Vousden, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gottlieb, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kruiswijk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). As an example, p53 induces TIGAR, and regulates Fru6P metabolism to enhance PPP at the expense of glycolysis, in order to reduce ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wanka et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bensaad et al., 2006</xref>). We found that MPI depletion resulted in Fru6P accumulation, but downregulation of glycolysis as shown by decreased glucose uptake and decreased lactate in zebrafish, mouse, and human samples. Although p53 is a known suppressor of glycolysis, MPI knockdown on a p53-deficient background restored lactate to levels similar to control but did not improve glucose uptake. This is consistent with previous data showing that loss of p53 increases baseline lactate levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gutierrez et al., 2010</xref>), presumably removing suppression of glycolysis by p53. The persistent decrease in glucose uptake was not entirely surprising, as others have reported, both in vitro and in mice-bearing tumor xenografts, no difference in Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose uptake between HCT116 cells with wild–type p53 versus the HCT116 p53 null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that p53 is not solely responsible for suppression of glucose uptake, and that other factors likely contribute. Additionally, N-glycosylation of GLUT1 has been shown to be important for its protein stability and function; treatment of human leukemic cell lines with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, decreased 2-DG uptake by 40–50%, with a 2–2.5-fold decrease in GLUT1 affinity for glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asano et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed and Berridge, 1999</xref>). Our data suggest that MPI loss downregulates glycolytic gene expression and lactate in a p53-dependent manner in zebrafish, mouse, and human cells, but the suppression of glucose uptake was not reversible with p53 loss. Given these findings, we cannot conclude that the suppression of glycolysis with MPI depletion is wholly dependent on p53. The interplay between MPI and p53 with regard to regulation of glycolysis is likely complex and highlights the importance of understanding these complex relationships between pathways responsible for energy metabolism, namely in the setting of rapid cell proliferation in embryogenesis and cancer.</p><p>The HBP is usually a minor metabolic pathway yet it plays an important role in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lefebvre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jones et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jóźwiak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wellen et al., 2010</xref>). It generates UDP-GlcNAc which serves as a metabolic sensor and a precursor for posttranslational modification and nuclear trafficking of oncogenic transcription factors, including PI3K, PFK, and p53, all of which have been shown to be important regulators of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jóźwiak et al., 2014</xref>). p53 has been shown to be stabilized in response to stress via O-GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ozcan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2006</xref>), and this O-GlcNAc modification has been shown to be important to cancer cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">de Queiroz et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we found that loss of MPI leads to accumulation of Fru6P and activation of the HBP pathway, resulting in increased total O-GlcNAcylation, and specifically O-GlcNAcylation of p53. Inhibiting different steps of the HBP pathway (GFPT1 or OGT) either through genetic or chemical perturbation (DON or OSMI-1 inhibition, respectively) prevented p53 stabilization associated with MPI depletion. Interestingly, MPI-CDG patients are treated with oral mannose supplementation, which corrects the majority, but not all, of their symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Lonlay and Seta, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Niehues et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mention et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to mannose bypassing MPI deficiency to supplement Man6P for N-glycosylation, it is possible that clinical improvement following mannose supplements could also be through a HBP-dependent mechanism. Mannose has been reported to reduce cellular levels of UDP-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jokela et al., 2008</xref>), and so mannose supplementation may act to counteract the enhancement of HBP, and lower protein O-GlcNAcylation. Further investigation into the effects of mannose supplementation on MPI loss, O-GlcNAcylation, and p53 activation would be a topic for further study, with potential implications in therapeutic intervention.</p><p>While the complex pathways involved in metabolism and cell proliferation are still unfolding and are likely cell- and context-dependent, there is new focus on metabolic enzymes and their metabolites as central oncogenic players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ward and Thompson, 2012</xref>). Our study places MPI among these important regulators and advances our understanding of metabolic programs that control the Warburg effect and cell survival both during embryonic development and in cancer. In the past decade, anticancer drug discoveries have targeted glucose metabolism through PI3K and PFK inhibitors, suppressors of lactate production, glutamine metabolism, and DNA replication, many of which are currently in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wise and Thompson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Doherty and Cleveland, 2013</xref>). Our data suggest the exciting possibility that MPI could be a potent anticancer drug target, as depletion of MPI results in widespread dampening of glycolysis, halting cell growth and promoting death.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish maintenance and embryo injection</title><p>Adult zebrafish were maintained on a 14:10 hr light:dark cycle at 28°C.

Where indicated in the text, offspring from <italic>mpi<sup>mss7/+</sup></italic> incrosses were were separated based on genotype for analysis, or pooled and compared to offspring from <italic>mpi<sup>+/+</sup></italic> siblings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Glucose uptake assay</title><p>2-Deoxyglucose uptake was estimated in a 96-well plate by an enzymatic NADPH amplifying system assay (ab136955, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Briefly, 1500 MEFs were serum starved overnight. The cells were then incubated with 100 µl KRPH buffer containing 2% BSA for 40 min at 37°C. 10 μM 2-Deoxyglucose was added to the cells for 20 min to simulate glucose uptake in cells. 2-Dexyglucose was metabolized by cells into 2-Deoxyglucose-6-phosphate, which was then oxidized to generate NADPH. Measurements of NADPH levels were made using a recycling amplification reaction method, and glucose uptake was estimated based on 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Samples were measured at OD412 nm using a kinetic plate reader every 2 min. Results were corrected for protein content with a BCA protein assay kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Lactate assay</title><p>For measuring lactate synthesis in cells we used Lactate assay kit (Trinity Biotech, Jamestown, NY) and modified manufacturer protocol. Briefly, we added 10 μl of conditioned media collected from the cells to 200 μl of lactate reagent in 96-well plate and incubated for 15 min at RT. Lactate standard curve (0, 20, 80, and 120 mg/dL) was used for quantification. Light absorbance was measured at 540 nm. The results of the lactate assay were normalized to total protein measured by Bradford assay.</p><p>For measuring lactate synthesis in zebrafish embryos, 4 dpf larvae were homogenized in 100 mM Tris, 4 mM EDTA buffer (20 μl/20 fish), heated at 95°C for 5 min and centrifuged at 12,000 x g at RT. Ten microliters of the supernatants were used for lactate assay as described above. The results of the lactate assay were normalized to embryo number.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>ATP quantification</title><p>ATP was quantified in HCT116 cells using ENLITEN ATP Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer protocol. Cells collected from 1 well in a 6-well plate were lysed in 100 µl of 6% perchloric acid and aqueous fraction was collected by centrifugation. The supernatant was neutralized and clarified by 30 μl of KCO3 and additional centrifugation. Of the supernatant, 50 μl was used for measurement of luminescence and quantified based on the standard curve. The absolute numbers were normalized using MTT assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>MTT cell proliferation assay</title><p>Mitochondrial activity of each cell line using the tetrazolium dye-based micro-titration assay to measure mitochondrial dehydrogenases activity as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boamah et al., 2007</xref>). Briefly, MTT solution (5 mg/mL MTT powder dissolved in balanced salt solution without phenol red) was added to the cells in an amount equal to 10% of the culture medium volume and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 2 hr. The cells were centrifuged at 451xg for 5 min at RT, and pellets were resuspended in 0.04 N hydrochloric acid diluted in isopropanol. Samples were incubated for 5 min at RT and centrifuged at 22,000xg for 2 min. Supernatant absorbance was read at 550 nm (620 nm absorbance was subtracted for background). Data represent percent population of viable cells in each sample relative to the untreated sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway inhibitor treatment</title><p><italic>mpi</italic> morphant zebrafish embryos and standard control morpholino-injected embryos were placed in fish water containing either 20 μM 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or 50 μM OSMI-1 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 2 hpf and cultured at 28°C in fish water. Embryos were collected for gene and protein expression analysis at 24 hpf or 4 dpf and scored for morphological evaluation. SJSA cells were treated with 25 μM DON beginning 2 hr following siMPI transfection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Proximity ligation assay (PLA) and immunofluorescence imaging</title><p>PLA was used for detection of O-GlcNAcylation modification on human p53 protein using SJSA cells, primary antibodies specific for general O-GlcNAc and p53 (SCBT, Santa Cruz, CA) and Duo-link in situ Fluorescence kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Cells were fixed using Paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS), permeabilized using Triton (0.1% in PBS) and incubated with primary antibody in PAXDG (PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.3% deoxycholate, and 5% bovine serum). The consecutive steps were according to the manufacturer protocol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Total O-GlcNAcylation was detected using fluorescent secondary antibody. PLA and IF was visualized using a Zeiss inverted microscope Axiovert 1A.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package built into Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Where multiple comparisons were performed for a single set of experiments, the alpha level for significance was adjusted using the Bonferroni correction; otherwise significance level was set at 0.05. Specific statistical tests that were performed for each set of experiments, as well as which alpha value was used, are indicated in the respective figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Funded by National Institutes of Health [K08DK101340 to JC, 5R01DK080789 and 6R01AA018886 to KCS, R01DK99551 to HHF, T32DK007792 to CD], Gilead Sciences Research Scholars Program in Liver Disease to JC, The Rocket Fund to HHF, and the Mindich Child Health and Development Institute at Mount Sinai to JC.

Strikingly, the developmental defects in zebrafish were completely reversed when both MPI and p53 were silenced together, implicating p53 as the key mediator of developmental aberrations downstream of MPI loss. Although MPI silencing appeared to have little effect on N-linked glycosylation, it led to an accumulation of its substrate, fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), which also supplies hexosamine biosynthesis and O-GlcNAcylation. The authors provide evidence for enhanced O-GlcNAcylation and resulting stabilization of p53 when MPI is silenced.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There needs to be better evidence supporting the claim that the MPI mutant does not alter N-linked glycosylation. The reported evidence is weak; the data from a key western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> are not quantified, and this blot demonstrates appearance of a hypoglycosylated protein upon MPI silencing (this band is partially cropped out). The authors should carefully characterize and quantify several products of N-linked glycosylation.</p><p>2) Regarding rescue of MPI loss by silencing p53, why does the p53 morpholino induce p53 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This is a major concern because it raises the possibility that the phenotypes are related to increased rather than decreased p53 levels. This logic also applies to the genetic mutant, since induction of the mutant isoform would confound the interpretation. A much better experiment would be to generate a true null using p53 CRISPR; this is a rapid and standard approach in zebrafish.</p><p>3) The implications of the mannose rescue data are not clear. If O-GlcNacylation of p53 rather than loss of N-linked glycosylation is responsible for the phenotype of MPI deficiency, then why does mannose (a precursor for N-linked glycosylation) rescue the phenotype? If there is an alternative way of explaining this result, the authors need to point it out. It would also be useful to know whether mannose supplementation prevents the metabolic defects of MPI depletion and induction of p53.</p><p>4) A key point of the paper is that MPI deficiency stabilizes p53 via activation of hexosamine biosynthesis. A western blot is needed to demonstrate that total O-GlcNac levels are higher in MPI mutants, and OGT silencing should be used to ensure specificity of the O-GlcNAc signal.</p><p>5) The authors need to provide more evidence that MPI silencing is not simply inducing p53 expression, as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. The paper also needs a more rigorous assessment of the abundance of O-GlcNAcylated p53. This could include quantitation of the PLA assay as well as an orthogonal approach, such as immunoprecipitating p53 and blotting with an anti-O-GlcNAc antibody. Is p53 O-GlcNAcylation in MPI silenced cells reversed by inhibiting hexosamine biosynthesis?</p><p>6) The authors should test whether the effects of MPI deficiency on glucose metabolism/cell viability in mammalian cells requires p53, as it does in zebrafish.</p><p>7) DON is a glutamine analog that inhibits most enzymes that use glutamine as a substrate. The DON experiments need to be complemented by genetic experiments to reduce GFAT activity more specifically.</p><p>8) Key conclusions involving siRNAs, for example those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, should be validated with two independent siRNAs rather than one.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22477.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) There needs to be better evidence supporting the claim that the MPI mutant does not alter N-linked glycosylation.

MPI has been thus far known only as an enzyme important for N-linked glycosylation, as other cellular roles have not yet been reported. The important finding in our study is that MPI has a function other than that for synthesis of N-glycans, namely in regulation of p53 stability via O-GlcNAcylation, and glycolytic regulation, and that this is not necessarily at the expense of N-glycosylation.</p><p>The aim of this study is not to discredit previous work on MPI, but instead to show a new function for this protein. We believe the phenotypes that we observe are not driven by changes in N-glycosylation, but did not intend to claim that N-glycosylation is normal with MPI depletion. We realize that this is not clear in the present manuscript and have removed the western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>. Instead, we further clarified in the text that MPI deficiency in humans (MPI-CDG) presents differently than the 40+ other CDG types that affect N-glycosylation, and this suggests that loss of MPI may have other consequences than simply deficient N-linked glycosylation.</p><p>To provide full transparency and address the reviewers’ concerns, we include the uncropped western blot image that is presented in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1A</xref>). We believe the bottom band is a non-specific signal as its size is smaller than the expected transferrin size, and is not altered with de-glycosylating PNGase treatment. As additional new data, we have repeated this experiment using a different glycoprotein (Gc), which, similarly, does not show altered mobility when Mpi is depleted as compared to Tunicamycin treatment, a well-established inhibitor of N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1B</xref>). But we agree, these data do not prove that N-glycosylation is unchanged with Mpi depletion, and would not include this at the current time.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22477.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22477.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22477.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22477-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>Instead, we have added new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, to address whether early disruption in N-glycosylation has similar phenotypes to our Mpi-depleted zebrafish embryos, and whether this is dependent on p53. To do this, we used tunicamycin, which we have previously used extensively in zebrafish. Tm treatment yields very different phenotypes when compared to mpi MO embryos: in Tm treated embryos, we confirm reduced glycosylation of human Transferrin using Tg(fabp10:hTF;cmlc2:EGFP) treated with Tm (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In Tm-treated embryos, we do not observe cell death with acridine orange staining as compared to mpi MO, and disruption of N-glycosylation does not appear to be dependent on p53 as we see persistence of phenotypes in Tm-treated embryos in a p53 MT background (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that phenotypes following Mpi depletion are not a result of disrupted N-glycosylation. However, we agree that this does not rule out that modest defects in N-glycosylation that may contribute to the Mpi-associated phenotypes. Instead, this study aims to highlight a novel function of MPI in interrelated metabolic pathways, namely the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and O-GlcNAcylation.</p><p><italic>2) Regarding rescue of MPI loss by silencing p53, why does the p53 morpholino induce p53 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

The p53 antibody used in this study was developed and first reported by MacInnes et al.PNAS, 2008. In that report, they also showed increased p53 protein expression in p53 MO-injected embryos as compared to uninjected controls, shown in MacInnes et al., PNAS 2008, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. In our paper, we use standard control morpholino injection to control for any toxicity from injection, and to account for variability between clutches, we have quantified 5 western blots to show that the levels of p53 can vary from clutch-to-clutch, but we see no significant difference in p53 between standard control MO- and p53 MO-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>). However, there is a consistent and marked increase in p53 levels following Mpi-depletion, and this is reversed when p53 is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22477.022</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22477.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22477.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22477-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>To address the second issue raised, namely that induction of mutant p53 may occur in the p53 M214K MT used and would be better addressed by generating a p53 null CRISPR mutant: While this is a valid goal, we were not be able to complete this in a reasonable time frame for resubmission and feel that it would not change the central point of our study, as we already use four complementary methods to examine loss of p53 – p53 morpholino, a well-established p53 mutant in zebrafish, <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> null MEFs, and <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> null HCT116 cells.</p><p><italic>3) The implications of the mannose rescue data are not clear. If O-GlcNacylation of p53 rather than loss of N-linked glycosylation is responsible for the phenotype of MPI deficiency, then why does mannose (a precursor for N-linked glycosylation) rescue the phenotype? If there is an alternative way of explaining this result, the authors need to point it out. It would also be useful to know whether mannose supplementation prevents the metabolic defects of MPI depletion and induction of p53.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this point. As suggested, the mechanisms of mannose rescue, even in MPI-CDG patients, are not clear, and may occur through multiple pathways. While we believe this to be a very interesting and important investigation that should be addressed in the future, it is not a central point for the present study. As such, we have removed the mannose rescue data (old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) from the revised manuscript. Instead, as suggested, we have further elaborated on this in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Interestingly, MPI-CDG patients are treated with oral mannose supplementation, which corrects the majority, but not all, of their symptoms (de Lonlay and Seta, 2009, Niehues et al., 1998, Mention et al., 2008). […] Further investigation into the effects of mannose supplementation on MPI loss, O-GlcNAcylation, and p53 activation would be a topic for further study, with potential applications in therapeutic intervention.”</p><p><italic>4) A key point of the paper is that MPI deficiency stabilizes p53 via activation of hexosamine biosynthesis. A western blot is needed to demonstrate that total O-GlcNac levels are higher in MPI mutants, and OGT silencing should be used to ensure specificity of the O-GlcNAc signal.</italic> </p><p>Done. Please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>.</p><p>This was an excellent suggestion, and we have spent the majority of our resubmission period focused on points 4, 5, and 7, to strengthen our investigation into the mechanism of how MPI regulates metabolic pathways and p53 through O-GlcNAcylation. We systematically approached this novel pathway of MPI regulation of p53, from HBP and its rate limiting enzyme (GFAT), to total O-GlcNAc, and more specifically to OGT, the key enzyme in O-GlcNAcylation.</p><p>In new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, we have addressed reviewer comment #7, and further strengthened our finding that MPI loss activates HBP, with new data to show that Mpi depletion leads to increased Gfat by western blot, and that inhibition of HBP through either chemical inhibition using DON or genetic knockdown of its rate limiting enzyme, GFAT, can both dampen Mpi-induced p53 activation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>Next, as the reviewers suggested in point #4 and #5, we expanded our analysis on the end product of the HBP, protein O-GlcNAcylation, and also depleted the key enzyme in this step, OGT. To address reviewers’ point #4, in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A and 7B</xref>, we demonstrate that loss of Mpi in zebrafish results in an increase in total O-GlcNAc and OGT levels (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This new data complements our immunofluoresence data to show increased total O-GlcNAcylation in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). As suggested in point #4, we ensured specificity of the O-GlcNAc signal by inhibiting GFAT and Ogt in Mpi knockdown, which both decreased O-GlcNAc levels (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A-C</xref>).</p><p>As suggested in point #5, this revised manuscript presents additional compelling evidence that the mechanism of p53 induction by Mpi loss is through O-GlcNAcylation of p53 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, 7C, 7E</xref>, and 7F). In this revised manuscript, we show 4 different methods of inhibiting the HBP and O-GlcNAcylation, which all block MPI-induced p53. This is shown through 2 genetic approaches (silencing Gfpt1 and Ogt), and 2 chemical approaches with DON and OSMI-1, a small molecule inhibitor of Ogt (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We find that both total O-GlcNAc and p53 levels in Mpi-depleted zebrafish are diminished in all cases. Lastly, new data demonstrates that the O-GlcNAcylated p53 is reversed by inhibiting the HBP using DON, as assessed by PLA (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and quantified in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> as requested.</p><p>Of note, we first approached this by designing and injecting 5 different CRISPRs to ogt in zebrafish, of which only 3 worked partially to induce a mutation in F0s. However, there was variable efficacy across 3 different experiments. Therefore, the ability to use CRISPR to generate a mutation in ogt was not feasible for the short term. We also attempted to further complement our findings with IP of p53 and O-GlcNAc in Mpi-depleted zebrafish, but had technical difficulties and were unable to optimize the assay in time for submission.</p><p>The reviewers’ suggestions were instrumental in our efforts to provide compelling evidence that MPI is a critical metabolic enzyme, not only for N-glycosylation, but in our uncovering of new functions for MPI in the regulation of HBP, O-GlcNAcylation, and specifically as a novel regulator of p53.</p><p><italic>5) The authors need to provide more evidence that MPI silencing is not simply inducing p53 expression, as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. The paper also needs a more rigorous assessment of the abundance of O-GlcNAcylated p53. This could include quantitation of the PLA assay as well as an orthogonal approach, such as immunoprecipitating p53 and blotting with an anti-O-GlcNAc antibody.</italic> </p><p>Done.

We compared RNA-seq results with Mpi depletion in WT versus p53 MT embryos and found that p53 mutation suppressed the transcriptional changes in genes encoding glycolytic enzymes found in mpi morphants (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right column). To determine whether p53 mutation or loss could reverse the functional repression of glycolysis observed with MPI depletion, we examined glucose uptake and lactate levels in zebrafish embryos, MEFs, and HCT116 cells, all with well-established p53 loss of function (LoF) counterparts. p53 LoF suppressed the reduction in lactate levels in all three systems (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D, 5F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>), a result consistent with restoration of glycolytic activity. However, p53 LoF had a negligible effect on preventing decreased glucose uptake following MPI depletion in p53 null MEFs (41% decrease, N=5, p&lt;0.0001) when compared to wt MEFs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>The discrepancy seen with p53-dependent restoration of lactate levels, but not glucose uptake, is not entirely surprising. This is consistent with previous reports showing that loss of p53 increases baseline lactate levels (Gutierrez et al., 2010), presumably removing suppression of glycolysis by p53. The persistent decrease in glucose uptake despite p53 knockdown has been previously published in vitro and in mice bearing xenografted tumors, which showed no difference in Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose uptake between the HCT116 cells with wild‑type p53 versus the HCT116 <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> null cells (Wang et al., 2007), suggesting that p53 is not solely responsible for suppression of the glucose uptake, and that other pathways likely contribute. Additionally, N-glycosylation of GLUT1 has been shown to be important for its protein stability and function; treatment of human leukemic cell lines with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, decreased 2-DG uptake by 40-50%, with a 2-2.5-fold decrease in GLUT1 affinity for glucose (Asano et al., 1993, Asano et al., 1991, Ahmed and Berridge, 1999). Our data suggest that MPI loss downregulates glycolytic gene expression and lactate in a p53-dependent manner in zebrafish, mouse, and human cells, but the suppression of glucose uptake was not reversible with p53 loss. Given these findings, we cannot conclude that the suppression of glycolysis with MPI depletion is wholly dependent on p53. The interplay of MPI and p53 on glycolysis is likely complex, and highlights the importance of understanding these complex relationships between pathways responsible for energy metabolism, namely in the setting of rapid cell proliferation in embryogenesis and cancer. This is an interesting area for future study, and this has been added to the revised Results and Discussion sections.</p><p><italic>7) DON is a glutamine analog that inhibits most enzymes that use glutamine as a substrate.

We have also confirmed these findings using siRNA in human SJSA cells, siRNA in HCT116 cells, and zebrafish mpi MT and mpi MO.
