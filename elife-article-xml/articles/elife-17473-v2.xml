Widespread algae – known as coccolithophores – surround their little plant-like body with a mineral shell made of a material similar to chalk. These microscopic algae form seasonal blooms. Over several weeks in early summer, the algae grow to enormous numbers and cover hundreds of thousands of square kilometers in the ocean. These blooms become so vast that satellites can detect them. However, suddenly the blooms collapse; the algae die and their chalky shells sink to the bottom of the ocean where they have been accumulating for millions of years.</p><p>More and more evidence suggests that these tiny algae interact with bacteria in various ways. However, so far, no one had documented a direct interaction between bacteria and a member of this key group of algae.</p><p>Now, in a controlled laboratory environment, Segev et al. show that marine bacteria from the Roseobacter group physically attach onto a tiny coccolithophore alga called <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic>. While the bacteria are attached to their algal host, they enjoy a supply of nutrients that trickles from the algal cell. Unexpectedly, Segev et al. also discovered that the algae grow better in the presence of the bacteria. It turns out that the bacteria use a molecule that they obtain from their algal hosts to produce a small hormone-like molecule that in turn enhances the growth of the algae. However, after three weeks of growing together, the bacteria produce so much of the growth-enhancing molecule – which is harmful in higher concentrations – that they actually kill their algal host.</p><p>These findings suggest that the bacteria first promote the alga’s growth to boost their supply of nutrients. But as algae grow older, the bacteria harvest the algae to enjoy a last pulse of nutrients and allow their offspring to swim away and attach to younger algae.</p><p>The next challenge will be to link these laboratory observations to the actual microbial interactions in the ocean. It will also be important to explore whether other algae and bacteria interact in similar ways and if bacteria contribute to the sudden collapse of algal blooms by killing the algae.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17473.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17473.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic></kwd><kwd>Roseobacter group</kwd><kwd><italic>Phaeobacter inhibens</italic></kwd><kwd>symbiosis</kwd><kwd>Indole-3-acetic acid</kwd><kwd>programmed cell death</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LTF 649-2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segev</surname><given-names>Einat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000061/2013-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segev</surname><given-names>Einat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Transregio TRR-51 Roseobacter</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>Jörn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barteneva</surname><given-names>Natasha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR023459</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barteneva</surname><given-names>Natasha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM086258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clardy</surname><given-names>Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM58213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kolter</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM82137</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kolter</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Physical and chemical interactions with bacteria influence the life and death of <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic>, a bloom-forming micro-alga important in global biogeochemical cycles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are many microbes that have influenced Earth's biogeochemistry. Prime among these are the coccolithophores, a diverse group of unicellular marine algae of the haptophyte division. Because of their high abundance, these micro-algae are fundamental in the global oxygen, carbon, and sulfur cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balch et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beaufort et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simó, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Field et al., 1998</xref>). As a consequence of their photosynthetic capacity these algae, together with other phytoplankton, are responsible for nearly half of our planet’s primary production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Field et al., 1998</xref>). Coccolithophore cells are usually surrounded by elaborate platelets made of crystalline calcium carbonate (calcite) referred to as coccoliths. During coccolith production, carbon dioxide is released and can escape from the ocean to the atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marsh, 2003</xref>). More importantly, coccoliths serve as a carbon sink as they accumulate on the bottom of the oceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sabine et al., 2004</xref>). Coccolith production by <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> accounts for roughly 1/3 of the total marine calcium carbonate production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iglesias-Rodríguez et al., 2002</xref>). Hence, coccolithophores play a complex role in the global carbon cycle.</p><p><italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic> is the most widespread coccolithophore in modern oceans, forming dense annual blooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paasche, 2001</xref>). The blooms can cover thousands of square kilometers of ocean surfaces and are easily detected by satellites due to the highly reflective nature of the coccoliths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balch et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holligan et al., 1983</xref>). The blooms also exhibit unique dynamics; they form seasonally over several weeks and then suddenly collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behrenfeld and Boss, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lehahn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tyrrell and Merico, 2004</xref>), a process that has been attributed to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bratbak et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lehahn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vardi et al., 2012</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that environmental stresses and viral infection can trigger oxidative stress and a process similar to programmed cell death (PCD) in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bidle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vardi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bidle, 2016</xref>). The induction of PCD, which is an autocatalytic process, has been shown to occur in various widespread species of phytoplankton including <italic>E. huxleyi,</italic> and functional links have been demonstrated between viral infection, PCD, and algal bloom collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bidle, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bidle and Vardi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fulton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vardi et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rohwer and Thurber, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, although <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> blooms harbor a rich community of bacteria, at times dominated by the Roseobacter group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">González et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Green et al., 2015</xref>), bacteria are not generally considered to be a factor influencing coccolithophore physiology and bloom dynamics.</p><p>Various types of phytoplankton were shown to have both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions with bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller and Belas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Durham et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the possible role of algicidal bacteria in the ocean has been examined and discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mayali and Azam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harvey et al., 2016</xref>). It has been previously suggested by our laboratories that bacteria might interact with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2011</xref>). However, coccolithophore-bacteria interactions have not yet been unambiguously demonstrated. This gap is curious because <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>'s important role in the global sulfur cycle is in part a consequence of an algal-bacterial interaction. <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> produces the osmolyte and antioxidant dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sunda et al., 2002</xref>). This molecule, when released into the water by leakage or cell lysis, can be used by some bacteria as a source of sulfur and carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Curson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">González et al., 1999</xref>). During DMSP catabolism, bacteria such as Roseobacters produce the volatile by-product dimethyl sulfide (DMS). <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> is also a producer of DMS, which is a bioactive gas with possible roles in climate regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Charlson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcolombri et al., 2015</xref>).When DMS enters the atmosphere it is oxidized and serves to form cloud condensation nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Curson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">González et al., 1999</xref>). While the DMSP flux from algae to bacteria, and the production of DMS gas by both algae and bacteria have been clearly demonstrated, the role of DMS in climate regulation has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Quinn and Bates, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that there may be widespread interactions between <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> and Roseobacters. <italic>Phaeobacter inhibens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buddruhs et al., 2013</xref>), a well-studied member of the Roseobacter group, was shown to produce molecules that specifically affect <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2011</xref>). This bacterium, when grown in a pure culture in the presence of p-coumaric acid, a product released by aging algae, produced novel compounds able to lyse <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>. The compounds were named roseobacticides and their discovery pointed towards a possible interaction between <italic>P. inhibens</italic> and <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, we recently showed that lipid metabolism in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> is altered in the presence of <italic>P. inhibens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Segev et al., 2016</xref>). However, a direct physical interaction between these algae and bacteria had not been previously described and no other details of their interaction were known. Here we describe the establishment of a co-culture model system between <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> and <italic>P. inhibens</italic> that allows the examination of the spatiotemporal dynamics of their interaction. We provide evidence that <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> and <italic>P. inhibens</italic> associate intimately when co-cultured. We show that bacteria promote algal growth but eventually kill their aging algal hosts. The same bacterial compound, indole-3-acetic acid, mediates stimulation of algal growth as well as algal death. Finally, algal death in the co-culture seems to involve an apoptotic process. Similar <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> - bacteria interactions might occur in the ocean and could thus affect algal physiology, bloom dynamics and biogeochemical cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p><italic>E. huxleyi</italic> and <italic>P. inhibens</italic> are two well-studied marine microbes. To determine if they co-occur in algal blooms we analyzed the bacterial community associated with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> blooms using a culture-independent metagenomic approach. Two independent blooms were sampled in the Gulf of Maine during the summer of 2015. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> indicate that <italic>P. inhibens</italic> was indeed found co-occurring with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> in algal blooms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, the suggested interaction between these microorganisms might be ecologically significant. To study the interactions of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> and <italic>P. inhibens</italic>, it was necessary to establish conditions to co-culture these two species. We started by examining pure cultures of each microorganism. Coccolith-forming (i.e. calcifying) <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (strain CCMP3266) were inoculated into L1-Si, a seawater based medium supplemented with additional sources of phosphorus (0.04 mM PO<sub>4</sub>), nitrogen (0.9 mM NO<sub>3</sub>) and sulfur (0.08 µM SO<sub>4</sub>), along with vitamins and trace metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guillard and Hargraves, 1993</xref>) (see Materials and methods).

Under these conditions <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> produces calcium carbonate coccoliths that surround the algal cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). <italic>P. inhibens</italic> DSM17395 is normally grown in the rich medium 1/2YTSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2011</xref>) (see Materials and methods) where it easily aggregates; it often forms ‘rosette’ structures through a polysaccharide-containing pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Segev et al., 2015</xref>). Of note, alone these bacteria do not grow in the L1-Si medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, grey bars). However, we found that bacteria do grow in co-culture with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>. To grow a co-culture, we inoculated algae into L1-Si medium and, after four days, introduced bacteria into the algal culture. In these co-cultures, bacterial numbers increased nearly five orders of magnitude over a period of 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, green bars). Microscopic examination of the co-culture revealed that some algae were no longer surrounded by coccoliths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Rather, naked algal cells were now covered by bacteria attached via their poles. This attachment was evident in both fixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) and live (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>) samples. Of note, attachment of <italic>P. inhibens</italic> to other micro-algae as well as macro-algae has been previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frank et al., 2015</xref>). Using a specific fluorescent lectin to detect the polar polysaccharide (see Materials and methods), it appeared that bacterial attachment onto the algal cell also involves the polar bacterial polysaccharide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Examination of co-cultures revealed that over time more algae have attached bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) and each algal cell is associated with increasing numbers of bacteria as the co-culture ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,h</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17473.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metagenomic analysis of Roseobacters associated with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> blooms reveals co-occurrence of <italic>P. inhibens.</italic></title><p>Two <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> blooms were sampled in the Gulf of Maine during the summer of 2015 and metagenomic analysis of the bacterial population was performed (see Materials and methods).

What do bacteria receive from algae that allows them to grow? Given that L1-Si does not contain significant amounts of organic carbon to permit robust growth of the heterotrophic bacteria, it stands to reason that the key nutrient that algae provide is fixed carbon. If indeed fixed carbon were to be the sole nutrient needed by the bacteria, addition of a utilizable form of carbon to L1-Si should enable bacterial growth. However, addition of 5.5 mM glucose did not lead to significant bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This was an unexpected result because, as mentioned above, L1-Si in addition to seawater also contains added phosphorus (0.04 mM PO<sub>4</sub>), nitrogen (0.9 mM NO<sub>3</sub>) and sulfur (0.08 μM SO<sub>4</sub>). In fact, even addition of higher nutrient concentrations in forms shown to be utilizable by <italic>P. inhibens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zech et al., 2009</xref>) as individual supplements (nitrogen 5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>, phosphorous 2 mM PO<sub>4</sub>, and sulfur 33 mM SO<sub>4</sub>) or in various combinations of two or three of them did not lead to robust bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Only addition of all four essential nutrients resulted in bacterial growth to a density of 5×10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml, which we normalized to 100% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>. Thus, <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> can provide all four essential nutrients (C, N, P and S) in suitable forms and concentrations to enable growth of the heterotrophic bacterium <italic>P. inhibens</italic>.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17473.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Bacteria require essential nutrients to grow in L1-Si.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Bacterial growth in L1-Si medium supplemented with various essential nutrients (C-glucose, N-nitrogen, P-phosphorus, S-sulfur) was monitored over eight days (see Materials and methods).

Because of its ecological importance, we wanted to investigate whether DMSP plays a role in the interaction between <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> and <italic>P. inhibens</italic>. First, we examined the ability of bacteria to grow with DMSP as a sole source of sulfur or carbon. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, DMSP can serve as a sulfur source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, 'CNP + DMSP 30 μM'). In contrast, DMSP does not supply sufficient carbon to support robust bacterial growth. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> 'NP + DMSP 30 μM'). Even when DMSP was added in higher concentrations to supply carbon in a comparable amount to the carbon supplied by the 5.5 mM glucose in the parallel experiments, bacterial growth was not evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> ‘NP + DMSP 6mM’). Next, we directly monitored DMSP consumption in a growing bacterial culture. Our measurements indicate that all of the added DMSP is rapidly utilized by the growing bacteria whereas in un-inoculated medium the DMSP levels remain relatively stable over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Based on these observations, we then proceeded to determine whether DMSP is produced and exuded by algae in pure culture and in co-cultures. Indeed, over a period of 17 days, DMSP concentration in the medium of a pure algal culture increased, reaching a concentration of nearly 6 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, black bars). In contrast, in a co-culture of algae and bacteria, DMSP levels in the medium were nearly undetectable, presumably due to its rapid metabolism by the bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, grey bars). Since bacteria are directly attached to their algal host it is possible that they experience a considerably higher local concentration of DMSP than the concentration measured in the bulk medium. It has been reported that Roseobacters and other bacteria can chemotax towards DMSP and catabolize it and various metabolic pathways for the bacterial use of the DMSP sulfur have been proposed and tracked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller and Belas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seymour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is possible that DMSP serves as a chemical cue attracting bacteria to colonize the <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> host cell. Additional experiments are clearly needed to determine if indeed DMSP serves as an infochemical promoting bacterial colonization. Yet, it has been previously shown that algal DMSP and exudates serve as a strong cue to attract bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seymour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smriga et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize the algal-bacterial interaction we explored the bacterial effect on algal growth. Flow cytometry is commonly used to monitor algal growth. However, due to bacterial attachment and algal clumping, our co-cultures consist of aggregates of cells of varying sizes. Thus, it is challenging to accurately interpret the results of flow cytometry analyses. Therefore, our analyses included traditional flow cytometry as well as validation of our results using imaging cytometry in order to characterize the different particles (see Materials and methods). We found that during the initial 10 days of culturing, there were greater numbers of algae in the co-cultures compared to pure algal cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In the co-culture, algae reach approximately 25% higher numbers in comparison with the maximum reached in the absence of bacteria. In addition, in an algal pure culture the death phase starts after day seven while in a co-culture a significant decrease in population is evident only at day 17. Interestingly, the death phase in an algal pure culture seems more gradual than the rapid demise observed in a co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Thus, it seems that the algal-bacterial interaction is dynamic. Initially the interaction is mutualistic, however over time bacteria may become harmful for their algal hosts.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17473.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Algal growth in the presence of bacteria.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Algal growth was monitored over 17 days in the presence of bacteria (green bars) and in pure culture (black bars).

As many members of the Roseobacter group have multiple metabolic pathways for IAA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moran et al., 2007</xref>), we posited that IAA might be produced by <italic>P. inhibens</italic> to promote the growth of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> in co-culture. To test this, we examined whether IAA is produced by <italic>P. inhibens</italic>. We were able to detect IAA (0.4 nM) in bacterial pure cultures (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). A standard of IAA was analyzed by high resolution LC-MS and targeted MS/MS (see Materials and methods). The retention time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), exact mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>), and fragmentation pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>) of the standard matched with the IAA that was detected in bacterial cultures. Importantly, no IAA was detected in axenic algal cultures. Next we assessed algal growth upon addition of IAA. Similar to the increase we observed in co-culture, algal growth yield was improved by 20% upon addition of 1 µM and 100 µM IAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>Our attempts to monitor IAA levels in co-cultures revealed that in these conditions IAA was undetectable, suggesting rapid up-take by algae. This observation is in agreement with previous reports of significant binding of IAA and rapid signal transduction in plants, indicative of the high affinity towards this compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</xref>). Interestingly, studies have described microbial signaling pathways taking place in the rhizosphere (the soil immediately surrounding the roots of terrestrial plants) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spaepen et al., 2007</xref>). It is tempting to hypothesize that similar short-circuit processes could take place in the phycosphere (the immediate volume in proximity to the algal cell). Thus, it seems that in our experimental system bacteria inhabiting the algal phycosphere supply their algal host with growth promoting molecules.</p><p>To further characterize bacterial IAA production in the algal phycosphere, we examined whether similarly to other IAA-producing bacteria, <italic>P. inhibens</italic> will alter IAA production in response to exogenous tryptophan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brandl and Lindow, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patten and Glick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prinsen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Theunis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zimmer et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, addition of 0.1 mM tryptophan resulted in the production of 10.8 nM IAA, approximately 25-fold increase in comparison to conditions with no added tryptophan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The increase in IAA production could be the result of two different mechanisms. Added tryptophan could enhance bacterial metabolism, thus resulting in general increase of bacterially-produced metabolites. Alternatively, exogenous tryptophan could be shunted primarily towards IAA production. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we supplemented a bacterial culture with uniformly labeled tryptophan (<sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N). If the labeled tryptophan were taken up and directly shuttled towards IAA production, all IAA should be fully labeled (<italic>m/z</italic> 187) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). However, if the imported tryptophan participates in other cellular processes, and atoms are exchanged with endogenous pools of carbon and nitrogen, then the resulting IAA will not be fully labeled, thus resulting in a lower mass. The lowest possible mass would be of a fully unlabeled IAA molecule (<italic>m/z</italic> 176). The results of our experiments indicate that all produced IAA is fully labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), thus indicating that exogenous tryptophan is directly converted to IAA. Of note, a recent study reported on the production of IAA in the mM range in axenic <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cultures supplemented with tryptophan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Labeeuw et al., 2016</xref>). As all of our experiments and controls indicated no IAA production by algae, currently we do not understand the source of this apparent contradiction.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17473.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Exogenous tryptophan promotes bacterial IAA biosynthesis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Addition of 0.1 mM tryptophan to <italic>P. inhibens</italic> cultures results in approximately 25-fold increase in produced IAA.

If indeed tryptophan is exuded by algal cells, bacteria in the phycosphere could import it and convert it to IAA. Secreted bacterial IAA could be utilized by algae and lead to improved algal yields. Such chemical cross talk will feed into a positive algal-bacterial feedback loop. In line with this idea, in another algal-bacterial interaction it has been shown that tryptophan released by a diatom fuels IAA production by a bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2015</xref>). To monitor bioavailable tryptophan in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> exudates, we used an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain that is a strict tryptophan auxotroph. This bacterial strain relies solely on exogenous tryptophan; in the presence of extracellular tryptophan the strain will grow and in the absence of tryptophan it will not grow. Cultivation of this strain in minimal medium supplemented with filtered algal supernatant resulted in marked bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). This indicates that algal exudates contain bioavailable tryptophan. Interestingly, we detected tryptophan (100 nM) in filtered samples of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> blooms (see Materials and methods), suggesting that this metabolite may be relevant to environmental interactions.</p><p>To better understand the temporal dynamics of the algal-bacterial interaction we examined co-cultures over a period of 17 days and compared them with algal pure cultures of the same age. After 10 days of incubation, no visible difference was apparent between algal pure cultures and co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,b</xref>). However, after 17 days of incubation the color of the co-cultures rapidly changed from green (the color of healthy algae) to white, a process we refer to as ‘bleaching’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). To better understand these algal changes we examined the various cultures under the microscope. This revealed that the algal cells in a bleached co-culture exhibit more coccolith shedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e,f,g,h</xref>, note arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). Furthermore, the typical fluorescent crescent shape that is made of the two chloroplasts in each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i,j,k</xref>) is lost in the bleached co-culture and the fluorescent signal emanating from chlorophyll and accessory pigments fills the entire cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6l</xref>). In addition, using a viability stain (Sytox green, see Materials and methods) it is evident that the aging co-culture contains mostly dead algal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6m,n,o,p</xref>). One possible explanation for the bleaching observed is that the bacteria simply degrade dying algal cells at day 17 while similarly dying algal cells in the pure culture at the same time point remain intact. However, comparison of the death rates in the algal population in pure and co-cultures reveals a significant difference. At this time point, the vast majority of algal cells in the co-culture are dead (94% as indicated by Sytox staining, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3p</xref>) while in the pure culture only 21% are dead by day 17. Thus, the presence of bacteria seems to play a key role in promoting algal death. Taken together, these results suggest that following the mutualistic phase in the algal-bacterial interaction, bacteria become pathogens that cause the bleaching and death of their algal partners.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17473.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Bacteria induce a unique algal death in aging co-cultures.</title><p>(<bold>a–d</bold>) Images of cultures demonstrating the change in the culture color over time.

Out of 50 examined genes representing various functional groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), 15 genes exhibited significant up-regulation in algae over time in co-culture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). To test whether this group of 15 genes exhibits expression levels that are significantly higher than the other 35 genes (in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), we first calculated the variance in the two datasets at day 17 using an F-test. The variance was not found to be statistically different and thus a two-tailed Student’s T-test was performed assuming two samples with equal variance. The resulting probability of the T-test was 2.8×10<sup>−11</sup> indicating that the difference between the two datasets is statistically significant. The highly up-regulated genes encode proteins that are presumed to be involved in various aspects of oxidative stress and programmed cell death (PCD). PCD naturally occurs in an aging algal population and can be triggered by a variety of biotic stresses such as viral infection and abiotic environmental stresses such as nutrient limitation and various light regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bidle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2016</xref>). Our expression data suggest that PCD as well as responses to oxidative stress are more prevalent among algal cells in co-culture. Thus, PCD in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> seems to be triggered by bacteria. Of note, the up-regulation of genes encoding proteins that are directly involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as glutathione (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), was previously shown to be essential in viral infection of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sheyn et al., 2016</xref>). To further investigate if algae in co-culture experience a bacterially-induced process similar to PCD, algal cells from axenic cultures and co-cultures were tested for the presence of degraded DNA, a physiological hallmarks of PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gavrieli et al., 1992</xref>). The fluorescent Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP nick end-labeling assay (TUNEL) was previously established as a reliable method for in situ identification of DNA fragmentation as a PCD indicator in various phytoplankton species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Segovia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berman-Frank et al., 2004</xref>). Using the TUNEL assay (see Materials and methods) we could detect that 90% of algal cells in 20-day old co-cultures contain highly fragmented DNA in comparison to 35% in axenic algal cultures of the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6q–t</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17473.011</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Expression data ratios between algae in co-culture and in axenic culture.

We conducted several experiments to examine whether roseobacticides are the killing agents of algae in aging co-cultures. We successfully reproduced the findings of the previous study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, our results indicate that while roseobacticides from <italic>P. inhibens</italic> indeed kill the non-calcifying algal strain CCMP372 used in the previous study, they do not kill the calcifying algal strain CCMP3266 used in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Importantly, in CCMP3266 cultures no bleaching was seen upon addition of roseobacticides. Moreover, there is no detectable production of roseobacticides in our co-culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Thus, roseobacticides do not appear to play a role in algal death in the co-culture experimental system described here.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17473.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Roseobacticide-mediated algal lysis is strain specific.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Roseobacticides were introduced into 1 ml of algal cultures of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> strains CCMP372 and CCMP3266.

At concentrations between 1 and 100 µM IAA had a positive effect on algal growth, however 1000 µM proved to be harmful to algae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The hormetic effect of IAA has been previously described; IAA promotes plant growth at low concentration while acting as a growth inhibitor at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Persello-Cartieaux et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xie et al., 1996</xref>). Similar effects were observed when increasing concentrations of IAA were added to a culture of diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, there are morphological similarities between algae that were killed by bacteria in co-culture and algae that were killed by high concentrations of IAA in pure culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). These observations drove us to hypothesize that IAA can mediate both mutualistic and pathogenic interactions between bacteria and algae. Initially, bacterially-produced IAA promotes algal growth while later on it might be the driving force underlying algal death.</p><p>In various bacteria, attempts to perturb IAA synthesis were unsuccessful due to multiple redundant biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spaepen et al., 2007</xref>).

It is known that viral infection is key in the blooms’ demise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bratbak et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lehahn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vardi et al., 2012</xref>). In our model system the presence of one species of bacteria resulted in the sharp demise of the algal population. While further studies are required in order to explore <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>-bacterial interactions in the ocean, it is possible that bacterial influences act in concert with viruses to drive the termination of the blooms. Environmental stresses such as nutrient depletion as well as viral infection have been shown to enhance PCD in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bidle, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2016</xref>). Similarly, we have observed bacterially-induced PCD. While attached bacteria seem to be trapped on their dying host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), their offspring get access to the nutrients from lysed algae and can then swim away and colonize a younger algal cell. Recently, Smirga and colleagues demonstrated experimentally how planktonic bacteria crowd around a lysing microalga, feeding off the released cellular content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smriga et al., 2016</xref>). Our discovery of chemical crosstalk in the phycosphere and the bacterially-mediated algal death were made possible due to the co-culture experimental system that enables investigation over time.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17473.017</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Bacteria attached to remains of dead algal cells.</title><p>(<bold>a–c</bold>) SEM images of co-cultures at day 17 of incubation reveal bacteria that are attached to algal debris.

This led us to explore its abundance in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> natural blooms, where it indeed was found. Previously, tryptophan was identified as a key metabolite in the interaction between a diatom and a Roseobacter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2015</xref>). The use of both targeted and untargeted metabolomics in the lab can greatly aid in identifying metabolites with ecological relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Durham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2015</xref>). As revealed in the current study, when microorganisms are in close proximity, molecules can be produced and rapidly consumed and thus remain undetectable. Local and short-lived signals that are significant cues in the phycosphere would be undetectable in the environment but can be deciphered using model systems similar to the one we have described.</p><p>In our study, IAA was identified as a key component of the algal-bacterial chemical crosstalk. The bacterially-produced IAA initially increases algal yields. This growth enhancement is followed by an inevitable death. Clearly IAA exhibits a hormetic effect - it is beneficial in low concentrations and becomes harmful at higher doses. The hormetic nature of IAA has been previously demonstrated in various plant-bacteria interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Persello-Cartieaux et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xie et al., 1996</xref>). In the association of the plant pathogen <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> with its hosts, IAA is central too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spaepen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Subramoni et al., 2014</xref>). It is produced to enhance growth of plant tissue while creating tumors. Several similarities between <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> and <italic>P. inhibens</italic> seem to exist; both attach through their pole to their host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heindl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), both express a polar polysaccharide involved in bacterial attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heindl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2013</xref>) and both utilize IAA to manipulate the growth of their host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Subramoni et al., 2014</xref>). In light of these resemblances, it is possible that additional aspects of the <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> – <italic>P. inhibens</italic> interaction will be similar to the mechanisms employed by <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> and its interactions with host plants.</p><p>We have shown that IAA produced by bacteria enhances algal growth. How is algal growth promoted? One possibility is that algal growth augmentation is the result of changes in light harvesting efficiency. As reported by Falkowski and colleagues, changes in the capability of transducing light energy to chemical energy and eventually to biomass will result in changes in growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Falkowski et al., 1985</xref>). Since all our cultures have been cultivated under the same light regime, changes in light harvesting capabilities would be the result of changes in levels of light harvesting pigments. However, chlorophyll a measurements revealed similar concentrations in algal cells over a period of 17 days, whether in the presence or absence of bacteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).

In various microorganisms, regulatory circuits lead to growth cessation before resources have been completely exhausted. When such controls are bypassed, growth does not stop and higher yields are obtained. Two examples can be discussed in the context of elevated growth as a consequence of loss of growth control; <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants in <italic>rpoS</italic> grow to higher cell numbers than the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vulic and Kolter, 2001</xref>). While the wild type senses the near depletion of essential nutrients and prepares in advance by ceasing growth, the mutant lacks this regulatory ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vulic and Kolter, 2001</xref>). Another example of growth regulation by microorganisms is the ability of cells to sense their critical density, a process referred to as quorum sensing (QS). This process requires the release and sensing of signal molecules that serve as reporters of the population density. The response to increased cell numbers is often a transition to decreased growth, which promotes survival of the cells under conditions of limited resources. In trypanosomes, perturbed ability to sense signal molecules results in failure to undergo growth arrest and leads to uncontrolled proliferatation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mony and Matthews, 2015</xref>). Whether <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> possesses regulatory circuits to control growth cessation, and whether IAA can influence such regulation, is yet to be explored.</p><p>Bacteria in our co-cultures were found attached solely to naked algal cells. We did not detect bacteria attached to calcified algae or shed coccoliths. What underlies the specific bacterial attachment to naked algal cells? Roseobacters posses the ability to chemotax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller and Belas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller et al., 2004</xref>), thus it is likely that <italic>P. inhibens</italic> swims in its planktonic stage specifically towards the naked cells. In turn, this might suggest that naked cells release increased levels of exudates. However, the question still remains whether the algal cells are naked irrespective of bacteria, or whether bacteria encourage coccoliths shedding thus increasing the amount of naked algal cells. In every population of calcified <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>, a sub-population of naked non-calcified cells is seen. It has been previously demonstrated that microzooplankton display higher growth rates when feeding on naked <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cells in comparison to calcified cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harvey et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, bacteria might initially target a pre-existing algal sub-population. Reversible modes of attachment were shown to take place when bacteria such as <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> are assessing whether or not to attach to a substrate in a new environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heindl et al., 2014</xref>). As <italic>P. inhibens</italic> shares several similarities with this bacterium regarding their mode of attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Segev et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that <italic>P. inhibens</italic> evaluates the algal cells through reversible interactions. In this regard, the physical properties of a naked non-calcified algal cell might be more suitable for bacterial attachment. Similar influences might promote the permanent attachment that persists even after the algal cell has died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>In this study we have established a well-defined microbial model system and carried out a detailed characterization of micro-scale interactions over time. The discovery of a dynamic microbial interaction and the mechanisms underlying it was made possible due to the use of a simplified experimental system for coccolithophore-bacteria interactions. Exploration of similar robust model systems could further reveal chemical and molecular details that might be studied in the ocean. Attempts to link laboratory findings and environmental studies will both widen and deepen our understanding of microbial interactions, their ecophysiology and the extent to which these interactions influence the marine environment.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Strains and general growth conditions</title><p>The bacterial strain of <italic>Phaeobacter inhibens</italic> was DSM 17395 purchased from the German collection of microorganisms and cell cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany).

Supernatant was discarded and pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 90% acetone. Pellets were disturbed using vigorous pipettation and vortexing for 2 min. Samples were kept overnight at 4°C. Prior to Chlorophyll a measurements, samples were filtered through a 0.2 μm PVDF membrane (Pall) directly into cuvettes. Filtrate absorbance was measured on a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) at the following wavelengths: 750, 663, 645 and 630 nm. Absorbance at 750 nm was subtracted from all other values to correct for turbidity. Chlorophyll a concentration was calculated using the following equation:</p><p>Chlorophyll a [μg/L] = {[11.64(Abs663) – 2.16(Abs645) + 0.10(Abs630)] <italic>E</italic>} / <italic>V</italic>(<italic>L</italic>)</p><p>Where <italic>E</italic> = the volume of acetone solution used for extraction (ml)</p><p><italic>V</italic> = the volume of sample filtered (L)</p><p><italic>L</italic> = the cuvette path length (cm)</p><p>The obtained values were divided by cell numbers determined using flow cytometry as described above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to all the members of the Kolter lab for valuable discussions and assistance.

The key finding is that the signaling molecule is IAA = which is curious. IAA receptors in the algal cell clearly can enhance growth – but I don't understand why that happens. If the cells actually grew faster at the same irradiance, then the enhancement should alter the quantum yield for growth – which the authors do not report. One key parameter that appears to be missing to make that calculation is the optical absorption cross section normalized to chlorophyll (so-called a*). If the algal cell reduced the production of chlorophyll at a particular irradiance, the a* value would be higher (less self-absorption) and the cell could actually use light more efficiently.

The new findings in the manuscript are the investigations of phenotypes of the phytoplankton and bacteria in response to IAA and tryptophan, but the concentrations needed to see the phenotypes are extremely high. This manuscript can be rewritten and shortened to highlight results that add to existing knowledge. But unfortunately, the study still will not address underlying mechanisms for phenotypic changes and will not constitute an advance sufficient for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The discovery that bacterially-produced indole-3-acetic acid serves as a growth stimulant to marine phytoplankton and that tryptophan release by the phytoplankton fuels IAA release has already been discovered and published (Amin et al., Nature, 2015). This manuscript provides evidence that another bacterium in the same taxonomic group (Roseobacter) has a similar relationship with a phytoplankton in a different group (coccolithophore), and thus adds evidence to an earlier finding. However, it does not represent a new discovery.</p><p>2) Introduction, last paragraph. I am confused by use of the term apoptosis, which is defined as the process in which multicellular organisms destroy cells that are unnecessary or pose a threat. The term cannot be applied to a single-celled organism.</p><p>3) Results, second paragraph and legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The fact that a heterotrophic bacterium cannot survive in a marine minimal medium without sources of C, N, and P is not up for debate. This paragraph seems simply to point this out, which is unnecessary.</p><p>4) Results, third paragraph. It has already been well established that members of this bacterial lineage are specialists on DMSP degradation and that Phaeobacter strains can grow on DMSP.</p><p>5) Results, third paragraph. Similar comments as in #3. Every bacterial strain must be provided with essential nutrients (C, N, P) in order to grow in culture. Since DMSP does not contain either nitrogen or phosphorus, an experiment showing that the organism won't grow solely on DMSP is reinventing the wheel.</p><p>6) Results, third paragraph. The methods say that 5.5 mM glucose was used as the carbon source in these experiments, so that's 33 mM carbon. DMSP was provided at 30 uM, which is 0.09 mM carbon. How could this experimental design be used to compare bacterial growth on glucose versus DMSP? I can't make sense of this.</p><p>7) Results, third paragraph. DMSP release by coccolithophores and its uptake by heterotrophic bacteria has long been established. I don't see how this fact constitutes evidence that DMSP is a chemical signal for colonization.</p><p>8) Results, fourth paragraph. This pattern could also be explained if the phytoplankton cultures crashed at exactly the same time, but the heterotrophic bacteria present in the co-culture degraded the dead/dying cells whereas the phytoplankton pure culture had no degradative activity.</p><p>9) Results, sixth paragraph. This paper provides a nice example of a marine bacterium that produces IAA and stimulates growth of phytoplankton. But make it clear here and elsewhere in the paper that this result has already been shown in other systems.</p><p>10) Results, tenth paragraph. Maybe. But it's also possible that the bacteria in the coculture simply take advantage of weakening phytoplankton cells that have already stopped growing, and that can't happen in the pure culture where degraders are not present. Distinguishing between these two possibilities is critical for determining whether this is indeed pathogenesis.</p><p>11) Results, eleventh paragraph. The gene expression data are misrepresented. The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> show that every gene tested except for one has higher expression in late stage cultures. The upregulated genes in the supplementary file include those indicating increasing phytoplankton growth rates, lipid biosynthesis, and DMS formation, as well as higher activity of carbon concentrating enzymes. This looks like selective reporting of data to fit the programmed cell death hypothesis.</p><p>12) Results, fourteenth paragraph. 0.1 mM tryptophan is a really high concentration, and must be 5 orders of magnitude higher than what can be measured in the ocean. I realize that concentrations will be higher in the zones where bacteria and phytoplankton cells are physically associated, but the requirement for concentrations that high suggest it might be a toxic effect or a metabolic imbalance in the coccolithophore.</p><p>14) Discussion, first paragraph. While this work shows growth promotion by the bacterium, it has not shown that death is initiated.</p><p>15) Discussion, first paragraph. I did not find convincing evidence of programmed cell death.</p><p>16) Discussion, fifth paragraph. I stumbled here and earlier in that paper over presentation of the fact that heterotrophic bacteria require sources of C, N, P and S for growth as a new finding. The important message from these experiments should be that the essential nutrients are all being delivered by a single phytoplankton species. This has also been shown several times before, however. Also, there is millimolar sulfur in seawater in the form of sulfate and almost all bacteria (including Phaeobacter) are able to reduce it. So, organic sulfur addition is not an essential component of the seawater medium.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting and timely study examining the dynamic, small-scale interactions between a specific species of bacterium (Phaeobacter inhibens) and a globally important coccolithophore (<italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic>), which oscillates between a stimulating mutualistic relationship to one what is more antagonistic in nature and results in cell death. The authors elegantly show using a combination of analytical approaches (that include growth physiology, microscopy, diagnostic staining/labeling, stable isotope labeling, mass spec analysis, manipulative experiments, and the use of auxotrophic mutants) that P. inhibits produces a phytohormone compound (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) that serves as a growth enhancer for co-cultured <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cells in this well-defined, cultured model system. IAA, in turn, derives from organic carbon exuded from <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cells, and more specifically from tryptophan (the authors nicely use stable isotope labeling combined with mass spec to show this directly), the production of which is able to support growth for established tryptophan auxotrophs.</p><p>Co-habitating bacterial were also show to utilize DMSP (exogenously added and that derived from <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cells) for enhanced growth and it's implied that the stimulatory impact by enhanced algal growth via IAA by residing bacteria is to stimulate production and access to DMSP as a source of organic sulfur. This has potentially important ecological and climatological impacts, given the role of DMS as a signaling bioactive molecule across orders of magnitude different size scales. Along these lines, the authors try to make this conceptual link by showing that Phaeobacter species are detected in natural <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> blooms (although the relative% of the Rhodobacteriaceae to other bacterial phyla among the ~2 million sequence reads of metagenomic data is not reported and would be useful to know in this context; see below) and that tryptophan is measured among the dissolved metabolites in natural <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> blooms.</p><p>IAA becomes physiologically toxic at high concentrations, which are achieved after ~17 d of co-culture and are density dependent, inducing a variety of cellular features of ROS-induced PCD including TUNEL positive cells, enhanced expression of various ROS and PCD-related genes, and elevated% of dead cells in co-cultures versus algal pure cultures. The activation of PCD is well known in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> is well-documented in response to virus infection and other physiological stresses so this provides another mechanistic avenue for death transition for an important coccolithophore.</p><p>The scientific approach in this study was logical, direct, and very strong. The authors clearly established the phenomenon and systematically characterized the key metabolite players in the association. We are not only left with a quite detailed understanding of the dynamics of this ecophsysioloical interaction, but also are provided with detailed mechanistic landscape on what drives the interaction.</p><p>The mechanisms of action of how IAA stimulates tryptophan production in early-phase co-cultures and the PCD pathway in late-phase co-cultures are not known (or at least isn't reported here). These mechanistic and cell regulation aspects are interesting in terms of how this dynamic interaction has co-evolved with both stimulatory and destructive cell pathways.</p><p>Overall, this is a very strong paper and I recommend it for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> with minor revisions.</p><p>Some comments to address (some of which deal with some methodological details):</p><p>Abstract: the authors state that these interactions are likely to &quot;impact micro-algal populations on a global scale&quot;. They very nicely show this interaction in culture and show some evidence that similar players are found in natural populations. However, extending it to a global scale is premature, given nothing is known of the relative and effective concentrations of these bacteria, IAA, tryptophan or associated dynamics with resident <italic>E.huxleyi</italic> natural populations. I agree that it poses some intriguing aspects as it relates to another potential bloom-termination mechanism (along with viruses &amp; grazers) and the exciting part will be to now interrogate natural blooms for relative importance of this bacteria-mediated process in bloom termination.</p><p>Results, first paragraph: does the interaction with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> preferentially occur with naked cells? This is an interesting observation, as all calcified cultures (or populations) do possess subpopulations of calcified and naked cells (which are easily differentiated with flow cytometry and side-scatter). Anything the authors can share here would provide important context as it relates to how the interaction may be structured in a population.</p><p>Results, last paragraph: I don't see this in the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Can the authors elaborate? I only see a micrograph showing enhanced aggregation of the <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cells.</p><p>Subsection “Monitoring bacterial growth in co-cultures”: I wonder if the authors can provide some rationale for why they used traditional plating techniques and CFU for assessing bacterial growth? I understand that this particular <italic>P. inhibens</italic> is culturable on 1/2YTSS plates. Are 1/2YTSS plates selective for this bacterium? Were other bacteria present in the co-culture experiments that necessitated its use? Did they every measure direct counts via DNA-intercolating stains coupled with microscopy or flow cytometry. I wonder if plating techniques were an accurate estimate of <italic>P. inhibens</italic> abundance given well- documented viable, but non-culturable states in marine microbiology. The use of plating/culturing is not routinely used in marine microbiology, given more direct methods are available.</p><p>Subsection “Fluorescent stains”, last paragraph: Looks like the authors forgot to include the relevant details for qualifying TUNEL positive cells.</p><p>Subsection “Gene expression analysis”; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>: I'd like more details on the relative expression analysis. Looks like they were done on duplicate cultures. Were any statistics done on those expression readings? Some of the columns are color-coded but no descriptive details are given.</p><p>Subsection “Roseobacticides lysis assay”: use of a diagnostic stain (e.g. SYTOX) to quantify lysis would be been useful here, instead of only relying on visual inspection.</p><p>Subsection “Metagenomic analysis”, last paragraph: It would help if the authors could provide a broader perspective on the metagenomic analysis. Were these total genome reads? Targeted 16S reads using tagged primers? What was the overall proportion of major bacterial phyla associated with the natural blooms? They only show things through the Rhodobacteraceae lens. How representative is it from a comparative% ? This helps provide some important ecological context.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dynamic metabolic exchange governs a marine algal-bacterial interaction&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Re. the mechanism of enhancing growth by IAA – the authors should not use the analogy to higher plants for a single celled micro alga. Why not? Because in a micro alga, an increase in growth rate without some increase in light harvesting (or a decrease in cell carbon) implies an increase in quantum efficiency for growth. That doesn't make sense to me. I don't see what IAA would do to increase the quantum efficiency for growth. I don't think the authors really understand what IAA does that leads to the apparent increase in growth rate – and they probably should just state that rather than speculate using a model of a multicellular organism (a higher plant) that has roots and shoots, etc.</p><p>The basic idea of the experiments and their Discussion otherwise seems within bounds of reality – but, as stated above, there is far too much detail and redundancy for an average reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Most of my concerns have been addressed.</p><p>One correction: Results and Discussion, second paragraph: Phaeobacter is unable to use nitrate as a nitrogen source. The bacterium therefore had no available nitrogen until ammonium was added, so this result is not surprising.

To address the request to explore the mechanism underlying IAA-induced growth, we carried out chlorophyll a measurements in pure and co-cultures over a period of 17 days. These results are now included in our manuscript in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. Chlorophyll a measurements did not provide strong insight regarding IAA-induced growth, and thus opened many more directions that could be explored. Therefore, we now discuss in detail the different possible mechanisms that could underlie algal growth enhancement by IAA. This discussion consists of three new paragraphs (Results and Discussion, paragraphs twenty to twenty-two).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>There is some solid research here but it is spun into a story that is not fully supported by the data and, more importantly, much of the story was told a year ago in a paper in Nature.

However, we disagree with this initial statement. Indeed IAA and tryptophan were reported a year ago by Amin et al. as signaling molecules acting between a diatom and a bacterium. Our study however, reveals how these signaling molecules act locally in the phycosphere underlying both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, eventually leading to an apoptotic cascade. Our work reveals bacteria as key drivers of coccolithophore physiology, with DMSP, IAA, tryptophan and PCD demarcating the mechanistic landscape of the algal-bacterial interaction. The novelty of our work does not stem from reporting IAA and tryptophan as signaling molecules. Rather, it significantly builds beyond that important prior observation.</p><p><italic>1) The discovery that bacterially-produced indole-3-acetic acid serves as a growth stimulant to marine phytoplankton and that tryptophan release by the phytoplankton fuels IAA release has already been discovered and published (Amin et al., Nature, 2015).

We found this work inspiring and cited it several times in our manuscript. However, in our work, IAA and tryptophan are reported as the metabolites linking coccolithophore population dynamics, bacterial colonization and the rapid algal demise that is driven by bacterially induced PCD. IAA and tryptophan are reported as the metabolites underlying these significant observations, thus expanding from the prior report.</p><p>In order to insure that the earlier report by Amin et al. 2015 is given appropriate credit in the context of our findings, in addition to existing citations of this work in our manuscript (Introduction, third paragraph; Results and Discussion, thirteenth and seventeenth paragraphs), we now further emphasize the previous discoveries through the following modifications in the Results and Discussion section:</p><p>“Intriguingly, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was previously demonstrated to play key roles in numerous terrestrial plant-bacteria interactions and was recently shown to be key in a marine association between a diatom and a Roseobacter bacterium”</p><p>“In line with this idea, in another algal-bacterial interaction it has been shown that tryptophan released by a diatom fuels IAA production by a bacterium (Amin et al., 2015).”</p><p>“Previously, tryptophan was identified as a key metabolite in the interaction between a diatom and a Roseobacter (Amin et al., 2015).”</p><p>We hope that the multiple citations of the work by Amin and colleagues and the mentioning of their findings in several places in our manuscript addressee the concerns raised by reviewer #2.</p><p><italic>2) Introduction, last paragraph. I am confused by use of the term apoptosis, which is defined as the process in which multicellular organisms destroy cells that are unnecessary or pose a threat. The term cannot be applied to a single-celled organism.</italic> </p><p>In our use of the terms PCD and apoptosis we are really only standing on the shoulders of giants. The groundbreaking work that has revealed apoptosis and PCD in phytoplankton, including <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>, has provided solid evidence that these processes indeed occur in single cells. A very comprehensive review on the subject was recently published by Kay D. Bidle (Programmed Cell Death in Unicellular Phytoplankton, Current Biology, 2016) and is now referred to in our manuscript.</p><p>To assure that all readers are familiar with the concept of PCD in phytoplankton we have modified the text and added several citations for reference:</p><p>“Recent evidence suggests that environmental stresses and viral infection can trigger oxidative stress and a process similar to programmed cell death (PCD) in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (Bidle et al., 2007, Vardi et al., 2009, Bidle, 2016). The induction of PCD, which is an autocatalytic process, has been shown to occur in various widespread species of phytoplankton including <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> and functional links have been demonstrated between viral infection, PCD, and algal bloom collapse (Bidle, 2015, Bidle, 2016, Bidle and Vardi, 2011, Fulton et al., 2014, Vardi et al., 2012, Vardi et al., 2009, Rohwer and Thurber, 2009).”</p><p><italic>3) Results, second paragraph and legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The fact that a heterotrophic bacterium cannot survive in a marine minimal medium without sources of C, N, and P is not up for debate.

Because bacterial growth is later assessed upon addition of C, N, P and S, a negative control must be presented. Further, we feel that it is important to experimentally demonstrate that heterotrophic bacteria cannot utilize C, N, P and S as available in L1-Si and require them to be transformed by a primary producer to utilizable forms and/or concentrations. This paragraph has now been significantly modified to provide a clearer explanation to the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (Results and Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) Results, third paragraph. It has already been well established that members of this bacterial lineage are specialists on DMSP degradation and that Phaeobacter strains can grow on DMSP.</italic> </p><p>We thank reviewer #2 for pointing this out and have now added further citations to reinforce this matter: “It has been reported that Roseobacters and other bacteria can chemotax towards DMSP and catabolize it and various metabolic pathways for the bacterial use of the DMSP sulfur have been proposed and tracked (Miller and Belas, 2004, Miller et al., 2004, Seymour et al., 2010, Brock et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2016).”</p><p>Nevertheless, in order to establish a robust model system that allows examination of microbial DMSP fluxes amongst other infochemicals, we believe that bacterial DMSP consumption had to be demonstrated in our system under our experimental conditions.</p><p><italic>5) Results, third paragraph. Similar comments as in #3. Every bacterial strain must be provided with essential nutrients (C, N, P) in order to grow in culture. Since DMSP does not contain either nitrogen or phosphorus, an experiment showing that the organism won't grow solely on DMSP is reinventing the wheel.</italic> </p><p>We failed to emphasize that the medium we are using (L1-Si) is made of seawater supplemented with N, P and S. Thus, when only DMSP is added in the experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, added sources of N, P and S are already present in the medium. Specifically- 0.9 mM NaNO<sub>3</sub>, 0.04 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>*H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.08 μM of NiSO<sub>4</sub>*6H<sub>2</sub>O, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>*7H<sub>2</sub>0 and CuSO<sub>4</sub>*5H<sub>2</sub>O. We have now included these details in the manuscript (Results and Discussion, first paragraph).</p><p>Our experiment showing that bacteria cannot grow solely on DMSP serves as a control demonstrating that while exuded DMSP can serve as a sulfur and to some extent a carbon source, bacteria still require phytoplankton to convert nitrogen and phosphorus to utilizable forms (even though they have been added to the medium originally). We now explain this matter in the text and discuss the necessity of the algal nutrient supply (Results and Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) Results, third paragraph. The methods say that 5.5 mM glucose was used as the carbon source in these experiments, so that's 33 mM carbon. DMSP was provided at 30 uM, which is 0.09 mM carbon. How could this experimental design be used to compare bacterial growth on glucose versus DMSP? I can't make sense of this.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the difference in carbon concentration between the treatments. Originally, since we detected only 6 μM DMSP accumulating in algal cultures we didn’t conduct the experiment in DMSP concentrations higher than 30 μM. To address the reviewers concern, we now tested bacterial growth in DMSP concentrations that provide comparable amounts of carbon. Indeed as commented by the reviewer, 5.5 mM glucose would supply 33 mM carbon. Since DMSP has 5 carbons, a DMSP concentration of 6 mM would supply 30 mM carbon. We now added experiments testing bacterial growth in 6 mM DMSP along with necessary controls and compare these results to the growth obtained in 5.5 mM glucose in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and its legend. We mention this in the text as well: “Even when DMSP was added in higher concentrations to supply carbon in a comparable amount to the carbon supplied by the 5.5 mM glucose in the parallel experiments, bacterial growth was not evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> “NP + 6mM DMSP”).”</p><p><italic>7) Results, third paragraph. DMSP release by coccolithophores and its uptake by heterotrophic bacteria has long been established. I don't see how this fact constitutes evidence that DMSP is a chemical signal for colonization.</italic> </p><p>Since <italic>P. inhibens</italic> can chemotact towards DMSP, possesses an adhesive organelle, and eventually is seen attached to algae – we suggest that exuded DMSP could serve as a colonization cue. Indeed, to prove this hypothesis further experiments are needed. We now highlighted the speculative nature of our statement in the text: “Thus, it is possible that DMSP serves as a chemical cue attracting bacteria to colonize the <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> host cell. Additional experiments are clearly needed to determine if indeed DMSP serves as an infochemical promoting bacterial colonization. Yet, it has been previously shown that algal DMSP and exudates serve as a strong cue to attract bacteria (Seymour et al., 2010, Smriga et al., 2016)”</p><p><italic>8) Results, fourth paragraph. This pattern could also be explained if the phytoplankton cultures crashed at exactly the same time, but the heterotrophic bacteria present in the co-culture degraded the dead/dying cells whereas the phytoplankton pure culture had no degradative activity.</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting point. However, judging by the results of our Sytox staining and TUNEL assay, when the co-culture is bleaching 90-94% of the algal population is dead. In the parallel pure culture at the same time only 21-35% are dead. So, death rates are very different between the cultures at the same time, indicating that bacteria promote algal death and not simply degrade cells that are already dying. Following the reviewer’s comment we now include this explanation: “One possible explanation for the bleaching observed is that the bacteria simply degrade dying algal cells at day 17 while similarly dying algal cells in the pure culture at the same time point remain intact. However, comparison of the death rates in the algal population in pure and co-cultures reveals a significant difference. At this time point, the vast majority of algal cells in the co-culture are dead (94% as indicated by Sytox staining, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>) while in the pure culture only 21% are dead by day 17. Thus, the presence of bacteria seems to play a key role in promoting algal death.”</p><p><italic>9) Results, sixth paragraph. This paper provides a nice example of a marine bacterium that produces IAA and stimulates growth of phytoplankton. But make it clear here and elsewhere in the paper that this result has already been shown in other systems.</italic> </p><p>This seems to be a recurring concern and we apologize for not making it clear. We do not attempt to report IAA and tryptophan as novel signaling molecules, nor do we think this is the innovation and significance of our work. This section was modified: “Intriguingly, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was previously demonstrated to play key roles in numerous terrestrial plant-bacteria interactions and was recently shown to be key in a marine association between a diatom and a Roseobacter bacterium (Amin et al., 2015, Spaepen et al., 2007)”. To assure that the previous work is fully credited, below are listed all places in the manuscript where the work by Amin et al., 2015 is recognized:</p><p>1) Introduction, third paragraph</p><p>2) Results and Discussion, sixth paragraph</p><p>3) Results and Discussion, ninth paragraph</p><p>4) Results and Discussion, thirteenth paragraph</p><p>5) Results and Discussion, seventeenth paragraph</p><p>6) Results and Discussion, seventeenth paragraph</p><p><italic>10) Results, tenth paragraph. Maybe. But it's also possible that the bacteria in the coculture simply take advantage of weakening phytoplankton cells that have already stopped growing, and that can't happen in the pure culture where degraders are not present. Distinguishing between these two possibilities is critical for determining whether this is indeed pathogenesis.</italic> </p><p>We believe that our data supports pathogenicity; higher mortality rates exemplified by Sytox green stain, transcription profiles indicating oxidative stress and PCD, and DNA fragmentation as the hallmark of PCD- all indicate that algae experience a bacterial-induced death. In order to clarify the collection of evidence supporting pathogenicity and in order to address the interesting point raised by reviewer #2 about weakening naked phytoplankton cells, we have now included an additional part in our Results and Discussion (twenty-third paragraph).</p><p><italic>11) Results, eleventh paragraph. The gene expression data are misrepresented. The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> show that every gene tested except for one has higher expression in late stage cultures. The upregulated genes in the supplementary file include those indicating increasing phytoplankton growth rates, lipid biosynthesis, and DMS formation, as well as higher activity of carbon concentrating enzymes. This looks like selective reporting of data to fit the programmed cell death hypothesis.</italic></p><p>Examining the maximal up-regulation of PCD-related genes (at day 17), shows that these genes were up-regulated between 2.75 to 6.81 fold. Other examined genes (presented in the supplementary file), at the same time point, show expression ratios between 0.5 and 3.48, with only three genes actually up-regulated more than 2.75 fold (the lowest up-regulation value for PCD genes). We have now added statistical analysis to strengthen the presentation of the difference in expression levels between the two gene groups: “To further explore the death process experienced by algae in co-culture, we examined the expression profile of a select group of algal genes. […] The resulting probability of the T-test was 2.8 x 10<sup>-11</sup> indicating that the difference between the two datasets is statistically significant.”</p><p><italic>12) Results, fourteenth paragraph. 0.1 mM tryptophan is a really high concentration, and must be 5 orders of magnitude higher than what can be measured in the ocean. I realize that concentrations will be higher in the zones where bacteria and phytoplankton cells are physically associated, but the requirement for concentrations that high suggest it might be a toxic effect or a metabolic imbalance in the coccolithophore.</italic> </p><p>This is a very important point raised by reviewer #2. This is the reason we conducted a control experiment in which pure algal cultures were supplemented with the same concentration of tryptophan. The pure cultures did not present accelerated death. These results, along with the hyper-colonization phenotype of bacteria indicate that accelerated algal death in the presence of added tryptophan, was mediated by bacteria.</p><p>In light of this comment, we have modified the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>: “(a) Images of co-cultures and algal cultures at day 10. Upon inoculation of bacteria, 0.1 mM tryptophan (trp) was added. Seen is a co-culture that bleached a week earlier (middle). An algal culture treated with the same concentration of tryptophan did not display bleaching (right).”</p><p><italic>13) Discussion, first paragraph. While this work shows growth promotion by the bacterium, it has not shown that death is initiated.</italic> </p><p><italic>14) Discussion, first paragraph. I did not find convincing evidence of programmed cell death.</italic> </p><p>In response to both of these comments we now include and discuss the earlier pioneering work that established PCD in phytoplankton, introducing the TUNEL assay as a tool to assess apoptosis in single cells. In our work, the combination of higher death rates, gene expression data, and DNA fragmentation assessed by the TUNEL assay clearly demonstrate that bacteria induce algal PCD. These results adhere to the rigorous standard previously established by leading groups that revealed PCD in phytoplankton. The text was modified to assure al readers are introduced with the concept of PCD in phytoplankton and the established use of the TUNEL assay: “PCD naturally occurs in an aging algal population and can be triggered by a variety of biotic stresses such as viral infection and abiotic environmental stresses such as nutrient limitation and various light regimes (Bidle, 2015, Bidle, 2016). […] Using the TUNEL assay (see Materials and methods) we could detect that 90% of algal cells in 20-day old co-cultures contain highly fragmented DNA in comparison to 35% in axenic algal cultures of the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q-T</xref>).”</p><p><italic>15) Discussion, fifth paragraph. I stumbled here and earlier in that paper over presentation of the fact that heterotrophic bacteria require sources of C, N, P and S for growth as a new finding. The important message from these experiments should be that the essential nutrients are all being delivered by a single phytoplankton species. This has also been shown several times before, however. Also, there is millimolar sulfur in seawater in the form of sulfate and almost all bacteria (including Phaeobacter) are able to reduce it. So, organic sulfur addition is not an essential component of the seawater medium.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion on how to present these observations with more clarity. We have significantly modified the sections concerning nutrient utilization and hope that these modifications will address the reviewer’s concerns. Sections discussing nutrient utilization include:</p><p>Results and Discussion, first and second paragraphs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Some comments to address (some of which deal with some methodological details):</italic> </p><p><italic>Abstract: the authors state that these interactions are likely to &quot;impact micro-algal populations on a global scale&quot;. They very nicely show this interaction in culture and show some evidence that similar players are found in natural populations. However, extending it to a global scale is premature, given nothing is known of the relative and effective concentrations of these bacteria, IAA, tryptophan or associated dynamics with resident E. huxleyi natural populations. I agree that it poses some intriguing aspects as it relates to another potential bloom-termination mechanism (along with viruses &amp; grazers) and the exciting part will be to now interrogate natural blooms for relative importance of this bacteria-mediated process in bloom termination.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, extending our findings to global scale dynamics is pre-mature. We have revised our statements and rephrased them to make it clear that future interrogation is necessary to determine the importance and magnitude of our findings in the ocean: “Coccolithophore-bacteria interactions should be further studied in the environment to reveal whether they impact micro-algal population dynamics on a global scale.”</p><p><italic>Results, first paragraph: does the interaction with E. huxleyi preferentially occur with naked cells? This is an interesting observation, as all calcified cultures (or populations) do possess subpopulations of calcified and naked cells (which are easily differentiated with flow cytometry and side-scatter). Anything the authors can share here would provide important context as it relates to how the interaction may be structured in a population.</italic> </p><p>This is an intriguing subject that indeed merits further discussion in the manuscript. The interaction we observed occurs solely with naked algal cells. Whether bacteria target cells that are already naked (suggesting sub-populations) or trigger coccoliths shedding is unknown. We now added a new paragraph in our Discussion to address this matter: “Bacteria in our co-cultures were found attached solely to naked algal cells. We did not detect bacteria attached to calcified algae or shed coccoliths. What underlies the specific bacterial attachment to naked algal cells? […] In this regard, the physical properties of a naked non-calcified algal cell might be more suitable for a bacterial attachment. Similar influences might promote the permanent attachment that persists even after the algal cell has died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).”</p><p><italic>Results, last paragraph: I don't see this in the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Can the authors elaborate? I only see a micrograph showing enhanced aggregation of the E. huxleyi cells.</italic> </p><p>To address this comment we have now included an inset of higher magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) and added the following text to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>: “Note that in the tryptophan treated co-culture (+trp) in (c) each algal cell has attached bacteria and the bacterial coverage is so dense that several covered algal cells cannot be seen”.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Monitoring bacterial growth in co-cultures”: I wonder if the authors can provide some rationale for why they used traditional plating techniques and CFU for assessing bacterial growth? I understand that this particular P. inhibens is culturable on 1/2YTSS plates. Are 1/2YTSS plates selective for this bacterium? Were other bacteria present in the co-culture experiments that necessitated its use? Did they every measure direct counts via DNA-intercolating stains coupled with microscopy or flow cytometry. I wonder if plating techniques were an accurate estimate of P. inhibens abundance given well- documented viable, but non-culturable states in marine microbiology. The use of plating/culturing is not routinely used in marine microbiology, given more direct methods are available.</italic> </p><p>1/2YTSS plates are not selective for <italic>P. inhibens</italic>, but certainly support its growth. Since pure cultures of <italic>P. inhibens</italic> were used to inoculate axenic algal cultures, only <italic>P. inhibens</italic> bacteria were expected to grow. Thus, monitoring via CFU was selected as the method of choice. As indicated in the subsection “Monitoring bacterial growth in co-cultures”, while this method is convenient, it might underrepresent bacterial numbers due to the presence of multi-cellular rosettes.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Fluorescent stains”, last paragraph: Looks like the authors forgot to include the relevant details for qualifying TUNEL positive cells.</italic> </p><p>This section was revised and now includes the following details: “Positive controls were generated by pretreating cells with 15 U ml <sup>-1</sup> DNase I (Thermo Fischer Scientific). These controls yielded a very high fluorescent signal and thus were scaled differently to avoid image saturation.”</p><p><italic>Subsection “Gene expression analysis”; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1: I</xref>'d like more details on the relative expression analysis. Looks like they were done on duplicate cultures. Were any statistics done on those expression readings? Some of the columns are color-coded but no descriptive details are given.</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewer’s comments, we now added a detailed explanation in the Materials and methods section regarding the NanoString expression data: “Experiments were conducted in duplicates and gene expression data from all experiments was normalized as one dataset. […] Background expression was determined as mean+(2*standard deviation), and expression data lower than this value were discarded.”</p><p>We also added a table (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) containing the average expression values in each experiment (Average), the standard deviation (StDev), a representation of the standard deviation as percent from the average value (StDev% ), and all ratios presented in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Roseobacticides lysis assay”: use of a diagnostic stain (e.g. SYTOX) to quantify lysis would be been useful here, instead of only relying on visual inspection.</italic> </p><p>In addition to the inspection under the microscope, no bleaching was detected. While the use of Sytox would reveal accurate mortality rates, no obvious phenotype seemed to justify further exploration. The lack of bleaching is now mentioned in the manuscript (Results and Discussion, twelfth paragraph).</p><p><italic>Subsection “Metagenomic analysis”, last paragraph: It would help if the authors could provide a broader perspective on the metagenomic analysis. Were these total genome reads? Targeted 16S reads using tagged primers? What was the overall proportion of major bacterial phyla associated with the natural blooms? They only show things through the Rhodobacteraceae lens. How representative is it from a comparative% ? This helps provide some important ecological context.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the partial presentation of our Metagenomic analysis. Both reviewer #3 and #2 have commented on this matter and we now address their concerns in our analysis description.</p><p>Specifically, relevant sections in Materials and methods have been modified (subsection “Metagenomic analysis”), and the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was modified as well: “Metagenomic analysis of Roseobacters associated with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> blooms reveals co-occurrence of <italic>P. inhibens.</italic> Two <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> blooms were sampled in the Gulf of Maine during the summer of 2015 and metagenomic analysis of the bacterial population was performed (see Materials and methods). Shown is the relative abundance of members of the Rhodobacteraceae family, which accounted for 6% of bacteria. The members of the Rhodobacteraceae family were detected in both blooms and their abundance changed ± 2% between replicates and between the two blooms. <italic>P. inhibens</italic> was present in both blooms and is indicated by an asterisk. Shown are the results for the July 2015 bloom (see Materials and methods).”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>I have read the revised manuscript, and while it is better, it is still too long and redundant in several places. Re. the mechanism of enhancing growth by IAA – the authors should not use the analogy to higher plants for a single celled micro alga. Why not? Because in a micro alga, an increase in growth rate without some increase in light harvesting (or a decrease in cell carbon) implies an increase in quantum efficiency for growth. That doesn't make sense to me. I don't see what IAA would do to increase the quantum efficiency for growth. I don't think the authors really understand what IAA does that leads to the apparent increase in growth rate – and they probably should just state that rather than speculate using a model of a multicellular organism (a higher plant) that has roots and shoots, etc.</italic> </p><p><italic>The basic idea of the experiments and their Discussion otherwise seems within bounds of reality – but, as stated above, there is far too much detail and redundancy for an average reader.</italic> </p><p>Reviewer #1 is indeed correct; we do not understand how IAA stimulates increased algal yields. We now clearly state it in the text. We have removed the entire paragraph discussing IAA signaling in plants to address this comment (Results and Discussion, nineteenth paragraph).</p><p>To address the concern of reviewer #1 regarding length and redundancy we have removed and significantly shortened multiple paragraphs in our manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>Most of my concerns have been addressed.</italic> </p><p><italic>One correction: Results and Discussion, second paragraph: Phaeobacter is unable to use nitrate as a nitrogen source.

The reference cited here (Zech et al., 2009) used ammonia in the medium.</italic> </p><p>We thank reviewer #2 for this comment.
