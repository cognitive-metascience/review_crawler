We present the crystal structure of a C-terminal part of HUWE1, including the catalytic domain, and reveal an asymmetric auto-inhibited dimer. We show that HUWE1 dimerizes in solution and self-associates in cells, and that both occurs through the crystallographic dimer interface. We demonstrate that HUWE1 is inhibited in cells and that it can be activated by disruption of the dimer interface. We identify a conserved segment in HUWE1 that counteracts dimer formation by associating with the dimerization region intramolecularly. Our studies reveal, intriguingly, that the tumor suppressor p14ARF binds to this segment and may thus shift the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 toward the inactive state. We propose a model, in which the activity of HUWE1 underlies conformational control in response to physiological cues—a mechanism that may be exploited for cancer therapy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21036.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21036.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>HUWE1</kwd><kwd>HECT ligase</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>p14ARF</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>enzyme regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LO 2003/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lorenz</surname><given-names>Sonja G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008672</institution-id><institution>Wilhelm Sander-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015.147.1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lorenz</surname><given-names>Sonja G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO-1458/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Popov</surname><given-names>Nikta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ei222/12-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eilers</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cancer-associated human ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 can adopt an auto-inhibited dimeric state, whose occupancy is regulated by competing intra- and intermolecular interactions of the dimerization region and by the tumor suppressor p14ARF.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 (also known as ARF-BP1, MULE, LASU1, or HECTH9) regulates the stability of diverse cellular substrates and, in consequence, numerous physiological processes, including DNA replication and damage repair, cell proliferation and differentiation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scheffner and Kumar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">King et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). HUWE1 is overexpressed in many tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Confalonieri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adhikary et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yoon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Myant et al., 2016</xref>) and has been studied intensively in this context. Surprisingly, both pro-oncogenic and tumor-suppressor functions of HUWE1 have been documented in different tumor models. This is reflected in the range of HUWE1 substrates: HUWE1 can target oncoproteins, such as N-MYC, C-MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Myant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inoue et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>), and MCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Myant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Warr et al., 2005</xref>), but also the tumor suppressor protein p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>) and the co-factor of MYC, MIZ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inoue et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peter et al., 2014</xref>) for degradation. Additionally, the functional role of HUWE1 may be context-dependent, since HUWE1 is capable of activating the transcription of either MYC/MIZ1-induced or -repressed target genes in a cell-type-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adhikary et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Myant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inoue et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peter et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>HUWE1 associates with and is inhibited by the tumor suppressor p14ARF (‘<underline>A</underline>lternative <underline>R</underline>eading <underline>F</underline>rame’ in the CDKN2A gene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>), a key activator of p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ozenne et al., 2010</xref>). p14ARF is best known for its ability to inhibit the HDM2 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sherr, 2001</xref>). However, p19ARF, the mouse orthologue of human p14ARF, inhibits proliferation of <italic>p53</italic>- and <italic>Mdm2</italic>-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts, formally demonstrating that ARF has growth-suppressive functions that are independent of both p53 and MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weber et al., 2000</xref>). The nature of the p53-independent functions of p14ARF has been intensively debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sherr, 2006</xref>). One candidate mechanism is the inhibition of nucleolar function and ribosome assembly, which is mediated by associations of p14ARF with nucleophosmin and the SUMO-protease SENP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertwistle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Itahana et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maggi et al., 2014</xref>). The regulation of HUWE1 activity by p14ARF is implicated in both the p53-dependent and p53-independent functions of p14ARF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). However, the structural underpinnings of how p14ARF inhibits HUWE1 have remained elusive.</p><p>HUWE1 belongs to the HECT (<underline>H</underline>omologous to <underline>E</underline>6AP <underline>C-T</underline>erminus)-family of ubiquitin ligases (E3 enzymes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huibregtse et al., 1995</xref>). These enzymes are characterized by a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain, the ‘HECT domain’, that serves to transfer ubiquitin molecules from ubiquitin-loaded E2 enzymes onto substrate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 1999</xref>). In an intermediate step, a catalytic cysteine residue of the HECT ligase forms a thioester bond with the C-terminus of ubiquitin. The activated carbonyl group of ubiquitin is then nucleophilically attacked by the ε-amino group of a lysine residue of the substrate. This results in the formation of an isopeptide linkage between ubiquitin and the substrate. If ubiquitin, in turn, acts as a substrate, this process leads to the formation of a ubiquitin chain.</p><p>The HECT domain consists of two lobes, a smaller C-terminal ‘C’-lobe and a larger ‘N’-lobe that are connected by a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verdecia et al., 2003</xref>). The N-lobe associates with E2 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 1999</xref>) and, at least in the NEDD4-subfamily, with a ubiquitin molecule of regulatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maspero et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ogunjimi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">French et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the C-lobe harbors the catalytic cysteine and interacts with the ubiquitin molecule that ought to be transferred to the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maspero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kamadurai et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim and Huibregtse, 2009</xref>). Substrate proteins are typically recognized by regions outside of the HECT domain and oriented toward the catalytic center in ways that we are only beginning to understand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamadurai et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>HUWE1 is a large protein of 482 kDa that is mostly uncharacterized structurally, with the exception of the C-terminal HECT domain (defined here as residues 3993–4374; PDB IDs: 3H1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pandya et al., 2010</xref>) and 3G1N), a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (residues 1316–1355, PDB ID: 2EKK), a BH3 domain (residues 1976–1990, PDB ID: 5C6H) that interacts with MCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Warr et al., 2005</xref>), and a UBM1 domain of unknown function (residues 2951–3003, PDB ID: 2MUL). How these domains are arranged to mediate the versatile functions of HUWE1 in the cell has not been studied. It is also unknown whether HUWE1 contains ordered structural elements flanking the HECT domain that affect its catalytic functions, as observed for other members of the HECT E3 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamadurai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muñoz-Escobar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Riling et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallagher et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the surprising discovery that the activity of HUWE1 underlies conformational control through an intricate balance of dimerization and competing intra- and intermolecular interactions.

In molecule A, the C-terminal part of the extension (residues 3979–3990) that directly flanks the HECT domain, folds into an α-helix that we will refer to as the ‘thumb helix’. In contrast, the same region adopts a turn followed by short 3<sub>10</sub>-helical segments in molecule B. The N-terminal part of the extension consists of a long amphipathic α-helix spanning 21 (3951–3971) and 22 (3951–3972) residues in molecules A and B, respectively, that we will term the ‘pointer helix’. Interestingly, the pointer helix of molecule A points away from the HECT domain and contacts molecule B, where its hydrophobic helix face is grasped tightly by the thumb, the pointer helix, and part of the C-lobe of molecule B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>The resulting asymmetric dimer interface buries a solvent-accessible surface area of ~1350 Å<sup>2</sup> of molecule A and ~1340 Å<sup>2</sup> of molecule B.

Additional contacts are subunit-specific, due to the asymmetric nature of the dimer. For instance, the thumb region of molecule B, which is re-organized structurally compared to molecule A, is tilted outwards with respect to the HECT domain, thus allowing it to cradle the C-terminal part of the pointer helix of molecule A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

C-lobe mobility, however, as enabled by a flexible linker between the N- and C-lobes of the HECT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), is required for HECT E3 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verdecia et al., 2003</xref>). We thus predict that the conformation of molecule B in the crystal reflects an auto-inhibited state. This interpretation is underscored by the fact that the dimer interface buries a particular region of the C-lobe, including Leu 4335, Met 4359, and Leu 4362 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The homologous region in NEDD4-type E3 enzymes has been shown to interact with ubiquitin, thereby facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the E3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maspero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kamadurai et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This region contains a phenylalanine four residues from the C-terminus (Phe 4371), known as ‘−4 Phe’, that is conserved across the HECT E3 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salvat et al., 2004</xref>) and has a critical role in the transfer of ubiquitin from its thioester-linked state at the E3 active site to lysine residues, presumably by anchoring the C-lobe at a specific position on the N-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamadurai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salvat et al., 2004</xref>) and/or by interacting with ubiquitin. Consistently, truncation of the C-lobe by four residues or mutation of −4 Phe was found to inhibit the auto-ubiquitination acitivities of various HECT E3 enzymes, including the HECT domain of HUWE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verdecia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maspero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamadurai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pandya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salvat et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mari et al., 2014</xref>).

This tight engagement of −4 Phe at the dimer interface is incompatible with the C-tail reaching out to the N-lobe, as seen in an active conformation of the NEDD4-type E3 RSP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamadurai et al., 2013</xref>).

We find that HUWE1 elutes at smaller volumes with increasing protein concentrations, indicative of an increase in its hydrodynamic radius. At the lowest concentration tested, the MALS-derived molecular weight (MW) of 54 kDa is very close to the MW of a monomer (53 kDa). With increasing protein concentration the conformational equilibrium shifts toward a dimer. At the highest concentration tested, the MALS analysis yields a MW of 93 kDa, in line with a dominant population of the dimeric state.</p><p>We also used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to study the oligomerization state of HUWE1 (3951–4374) in solution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows the scattering profile measured for a sample of ~40 μM concentration, at which the protein is expected to be predominantly dimeric (note that the sample is not diluted during SAXS, in contrast to SEC-MALS experiments). Indeed, simulated scattering profiles based on the crystal structure of the HUWE1 dimer approximate the experimental data well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as reflected by an excellent fit score, χ, of 1.4 for a single model (average fit score for the single best models of three replicate runs: χ = 1.4 ± 0.1). In contrast, simulations based on the structures of either of the monomers seen in the crystal are unable to reproduce the experimental data well, with χ−values worsening to 19.9 and 17.7 for molecules A and B, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; average fit scores for the single best models of three replicate runs: χ = 20.3 ± 0.1 and 17.6 ± 0.2, respectively). Assuming that the dimerization region is unstructured in the context of a monomer results in similarly insufficient fit scores, even when applying multiple ensemble search approaches (data not shown; for details, see Materials and methods). The SAXS data are, therefore, inconsistent with a monomeric state of HUWE1 (3951–4374), but they are in agreement with the structure of the crystallographic dimer.</p><p>In line with these analyses, the SAXS-derived radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>), a measure of the molecular mass distribution, of HUWE1 (3951–4374) is significantly larger than the value expected for a monomer (experimental R<sub>g</sub> = 36 Å; calculated R<sub>g</sub> = 25 Å) and is, instead, consistent with the value calculated for the crystallographic dimer (R<sub>g</sub> = 35 Å). Taken together, these data demonstrate that HUWE1 (3951–4374) dimerizes in solution.</p><p>As noted above, our crystallization construct of HUWE1 contained an N-terminal TEV protease-cleavable expression tag. A small portion of this tag (residues 3947*−3950* of molecule A, residue 3950* of molecule B, and a short, unconnected stretch of residues 3936* to 3941* that can not be assigned to either chain unambiguously, due to missing electron density) is visible in the crystal structure and located near the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Unlike the dimerization region that is well defined in the electron density, the residues of the tag have rather poor electron density and high B-factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, hydrophobic contacts between residues of the tag and HUWE1 are few compared to the extensive interface formed by the dimerization region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, these contacts include one residue, Phe 3947*, in proximity of −4 Phe of molecule B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To ascertain that untagged HUWE1 lacking Phe 3947* still dimerizes, we compared the behavior of HUWE1 (3951–4374) in SEC-MALS experiments before and after cleavage of the tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We find that the MALS-derived MW difference between the untagged and tagged protein variants (7 kDa) is relatively close to the expected MW difference (~5.5 kDa), as calculated from the MW of the expression tag and upon assuming a constant fraction of dimer in both conditions. We can, therefore, conclude that the dimerization of HUWE1 in solution is not induced by the expression tag. Nevertheless, all in vitro functional analyses that are described below were performed with untagged constructs of HUWE1.</p><p>Importantly, we also demonstrate that untagged HUWE1 (3951–4374) dimerizes using analytical ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The corresponding dissociation constant, K<sub>D</sub>, of ~3 μM, indicates that the dimerization of this construct is relatively weak in vitro, consistent with our SEC-MALS analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Key contacts in the crystallographic dimer interface mediate the dimerization of HUWE1 in vitro and its self-association in cells</title><p>To test if the dimerization of HUWE1 in solution occurs through the same key contacts that make up the crystallographic dimer interface, we determined the effects of truncations and site-specific mutations on dimer formation. We generated an N-terminal truncation construct comprising residues 3975 to 4374 of HUWE1, in which the pointer helix is removed. Since the pointer helix is an integral part of the dimer interface, we expected the truncated construct to be monomeric. Indeed, this construct no longer dimerizes in SEC-MALS experiments, even at high concentrations of 380 μM, and its elution volume approaches that of the monomeric HECT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The MALS-derived MWs of 51 and 44 kDa for HUWE1 (3975–4374) and for the HECT domain are close to the calculated MWs of 50 and 47 kDa, respectively.</p><p>In line with these observations, the experimental SAXS profile of HUWE1 (3975–4374) is approximated well by a simulated profile based on the monomeric structure of this fragment, as extracted from our crystal structure (single best fit score: χ = 1.3; average fit score for the single best models of three replicate runs: χ = 1.30 ± 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The corresponding SAXS-derived R<sub>g</sub>-value (27 Å) is also consistent with the calculated value for a monomer (26 Å).</p><p>We next analyzed the effects of structure-based point mutations on the dimerization behavior of the crystallization construct, HUWE1 (3951–4374), in solution. We replaced Ile 3969, located near the C-terminus of the pointer helix, and Phe 3982, located near the N-terminus of the thumb helix, respectively, by alanine. Both residues form key hydrophobic contacts at the dimer interface: Ile 3969 of molecule A is at the core of the dimer interface, where it packs tightly against Leu 3966, Phe 3982, Val 3984, and Leu 3985 of subunit B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, hydrophobic contacts of Ile 3969 in cis are rather peripheral and limited to Leu 3985 and Tyr 3988 of molecule A, due to a stark dislocation of the pointer helix from the body of molecule A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). In molecule B Ile 3969 also points toward the dimer interface, where it contacts Val 3984 and Tyr 3988 of molecule A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In this case, Ile 3969 has an additional role in positioning Phe 3982 in cis, due to the ‘compacted’ arrangement of the pointer helix close to the body of molecule B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>).</p><p>Phe 3982 of molecule B, in turn, makes pivotal hydrophobic contacts with molecule A, involving Ile 3969, Val 3984, Leu 3985, and Tyr 3988 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, Phe 3982 is embedded into a hydrophobic network in cis that includes Leu 3966, Ile 3969, Leu 3970, Leu 3977, and Leu 3985. Phe 3982 of molecule A does not contribute to the dimer interface and instead interacts with the HECT N-lobe in cis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, both mutation sites, Ile 3969 and Phe 3982, are expected to contribute critically to the stability of the dimer interface.</p><p>We subjected the single mutant variants I3969A and F3982A of HUWE1 (3951–4374) to SEC-MALS experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Both proteins elute at larger volumes than the WT. The MALS-derived MWs of 63 and 64 kDa for the I3969A and F3982A variants, respectively, are significantly lower than the MW derived for the WT (79 kDa), indicating that the conformational equilibria of these variants are shifted toward the monomeric state. The calculated monomeric MWs of all three constructs are 50 kDa. The simultaneous mutation of both sites, I3969A/F3982A, results in an additional increase in the SEC-elution volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The corresponding MALS-derived MW of 53 kDa is now close the calculated monomeric weight (50 kDa), which demonstrates that this protein variant does not dimerize significantly any more.</p><p>Notably, one of the mutation sites that we selected for our studies, Ile 3969, is among a subset of residues in the dimerization region that were found to be mutated in human tumors (cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: I3969N and I3969V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pickering et al., 2014</xref>]). Another cancer-associated, non-conservative amino acid substitution occurs at His 3962 (upper aerodigestive tract carcinoma: H3962D [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/</ext-link>]). This residue adopts a central position at the hydrophobic face of the pointer helix and contributes to the dimer interface on both subunits by contacting Val 3965, Leu 3966, Tyr 3988 of molecule A and Phe 3958, Ala 3959, and the aliphatic portion of Arg 3963 of molecule B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Consequently, we expected the H3962D variant of HUWE1 (3951–4374) to be impaired in dimer formation. Indeed, SEC-MALS experiments show that this variant elutes at larger volumes than the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), and the MALS-derived MW of 62 kDa confirms that the dimerization capacity of this variant is reduced significantly.</p><p>We next determined whether HUWE1 oligomerizes in the cellular context. To this end, we employed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments from HeLa cells transiently transfected with FLAG- and HA-tagged versions of an extended HUWE1 construct spanning residues 2474 to 4374, as used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adhikary et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peter et al., 2014</xref>). Strikingly, we find that HUWE1 self-associates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast to WT HUWE1, the F3982A and I3969A variants both show a marked reduction in their abilities to associate with WT HUWE1, analogous to the disruptive effect of these mutations on HUWE1 dimerization that was observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Considering that one subunit of the crystallographic dimer presents an auto-inhibited state, we thus expected the ensemble of molecules to be inhibited in solution and a disruption of the dimer interface to enhance the catalytic activity of HUWE1 overall. We tested this idea by comparing the auto-ubiquitination activities of HUWE1 (3951–4374) WT with the dimerization-deficient variants I3969A, F3982A, I3969A/F3982A, and H3962D in vitro at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 μM, that is, below and above the K<sub>D</sub>-value of dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We find that all of the mutated variants are, indeed, more active than the WT. The stimulatory effect is most pronounced for the double mutant variant, I3969A/F3982A, consistent with the dimer being most destabilized for this variant. The activity of HUWE1 WT decreases slightly with increasing protein concentrations, which can be explained, at least qualitatively, by concentration-dependent changes in the population of the dimeric state.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21036.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Disruption of the dimer interface enhances the activity of HUWE1 in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of the auto-ubiquitination activities of HUWE1 (3951–4374) WT to dimerization-deficient mutated variants at three different concentrations (1, 5, and 10 μM) in vitro, monitored by anti-ubiquitin Western blotting.

In this context, auto-ubiquitination assays are hard to interpret, since the individual constructs display different levels of auto-ubiquitination activities per se, due to their different numbers of ubiquitination sites and their distinct conformations. Therefore, we monitored the ubiquitination activities of these constructs toward a physiological substrate of HUWE1, MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In line with our model, we find that MCL1 is ubiquitinated significantly more strongly by the truncated, dimerization-deficient constructs of HUWE1 than by HUWE1 (3951–4374) that dimerizes.</p><p>We next asked whether the dimerization of HUWE1 also affects its catalytic activity toward substrates in the cell.

It should be noted, however, that the stimulatory effect toward either substrate is significantly more pronounced for the F3982A than for the I3969A variant. As a negative control, we included a catalytically dead variant of HUWE1, in which the active site cysteine is replaced by serine (C4341S). Interestingly, the low background level of ubiquitination observed in this case is similar to the one seen for the WT.

This elongated construct, therefore, also dimerizes. Surprisingly, however, an additional construct extension by a preceding α-helical region (HUWE1 [3843–4374]) results in a marked shift of the SEC elution peak toward larger volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and a MALS-derived MW of 60 kDa that approximates the calculated monomeric MW of this construct (65 kDa). Similarly, the two longest constructs, HUWE1 (3810–4374) and (3759–4374), do not dimerize, as revealed by MALS analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, however, these two constructs elute at smaller volumes than the shorter constructs that dimerize. This elution behavior, as determined by the hydrodynamic radii of the proteins, reflects a rather extended shape of the larger, monomeric constructs compared to the shorter, dimeric ones.</p><p>Taken together, these experiments reveal that the dimerization of HUWE1 through the thumb and pointer helices, as seen for HUWE1 (3951–4374), is unperturbed by the adjacent low complexity region (3896–3950), but that it is diminished in the presence of an additional segment of predicted α-helices, spanning residues 3843 to 3895.</p><p>To corroborate these findings we determined R<sub>g</sub>-values for all HUWE1 constructs at ~40 μM concentration by SAXS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In line with the SEC-MALS analysis, we find that those constructs that contain the dimerization region, but do not encompass residues 3843–3895 are characterized by relatively large R<sub>g</sub>-values, as expected for predominantly dimeric populations. A pronounced reduction in the R<sub>g</sub>-values, however, is observed upon including residues 3843–3895, indicating a shift in the conformational ensemble toward the monomeric state.</p><p>To test if the conformational switch in HUWE1 that is triggered by the presence of residues 3843-3895 coincides with a stimulation of activity, we monitored the ubiquitination activities of different HUWE1 constructs toward MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Indeed, HUWE1 (3843–4374) displays similarly high activity as the isolated HECT domain. In comparison, the N-terminally truncated constructs that do not contain residues 3843–3895 and that dimerize (HUWE1 [3896–4374] and [3951–4374]) are significantly less active. We we will thus refer to the critical monomer-inducing region of HUWE1, residues 3843-3895, as the ‘activation segment’.</p><p>In principle, the activation segment may antagonize the dimerization of HUWE1 either through direct intramolecular interactions with the dimerization region or through allosteric effects. When comparing the amino acid sequences of the activation segment and the dimerization region, we noticed a striking degree of similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). In particular, a hydrophobic motif in the thumb region, ‘FAVLVxxxxV’ (residues 3982–3991) recurs in almost identical form in the activation segment (residues 3874–3883). Remarkably, most of the residues in the dimerization region that are conserved in the activation segment (or that are at least substituted by similar amino acids) coincide with residues that participate in the dimer interface. Those include Ile 3969 and Phe 3982 that we found to be critical for dimer stability. Based on these analyses, we hypothesized that the activation segment may be able to interact with the dimerization region intramolecularly. This scenario is plausible structurally, since the 55-residue linker connecting the two regions is predicted to be disordered.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21036.022</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The activation segment displays sequence homology to the dimerization region and interacts with HUWE1 (3951–4374) specifically.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of the activation segment with the dimerization region of HUWE1, generated by EMBOSS stretcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rice et al., 2000</xref>).

In line with our hypothesis, we find that the activation segment forms a complex with HUWE1 (3951–4374), as indicated by a marked shift of the elution peak toward larger volumes upon mixing the two components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This interaction is specific to the activation segment, since it does not occur with MBP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction requires an intact dimerization region of HUWE1, since the removal of the pointer helix (HUWE1 [3975–4374]) or of the entire dimerization region (HUWE1 [3993–4374]) results in a loss of binding to the activation segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D,E</xref>).</p><p>In a control experiment addressing the rather small SEC-elution volume of the MBP-tagged activation segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,D,E</xref>), we determined the MW of this construct by MALS and confirmed that it is monomeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). The relatively large hydrodynamic radius of this construct, hence, originates from an extended shape of the activation segment (76 residues, including a His<sub>6</sub>-tag and a protease cleavage site) that is fused to MBP.</p><p>Taken together, these experiments provide evidence for a specific interaction between the activation segment and the C-terminal region of HUWE1 that is detectable in trans and dependent on the dimerization region. The conformational state and the catalytic activity of HUWE1 may thus be controlled by a balance of inter- and intramolecular interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The HUWE1-inhibitor p14ARF interacts with the activation segment and promotes oligomerization of HUWE1</title><p>How inter- and intramolecular interactions compete in the structural regulation of HUWE1 will be determined by various factors, such as the local concentrations of HUWE1, the respective affinities of the interacting regions, and their structural accessibilities. All these factors may, in turn, be influenced by macromolecular interactions that stabilize particular conformational states of HUWE1. In this context, p14ARF is an interesting candidate, since it was shown to interact with HUWE1 directly and to inhibit its catalytic activity (through unknown mechanisms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>p14ARF is a 14 kDa, highly basic protein with low overall sequence complexity and no conserved domains. In a series of binding and co-expression studies with truncated p14ARF variants, we identified a minimal region comprising residues 45–64 of p14ARF as a major binding site for HUWE1 (data not shown). To map the corresponding binding site for p14ARF on HUWE1, we monitored the interactions between a p14ARF-derived peptide (comprising residues 45–64) and our panel of HUWE1 constructs by fluorescence polarization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Interestingly, we find that all HUWE1 constructs that contain the activation segment, that is, HUWE1 (3759–4374), HUWE1 (3810–4374), and HUWE1 (3843–4374), bind to the p14ARF-peptide with dissociation constants in the low micromolar range (7.7, 6, and 5.2 μM, respectively). In contrast, shorter constructs of HUWE1 that are lacking the activation segment display significantly weaker affinities for p14ARF, with dissociation constants ranging from 230 to 340 μM. These results indicate that a major binding site for p14ARF resides either in the activation segment itself or in a conformational state of HUWE1, whose population depends on the activation segment. To discriminate between these possibilities, we determined the affinity of the p14ARF-peptide for the isolated activation segment (HUWE1 [3843–3902], tagged with MBP). The resulting dissociation constant, 3.6 μM, is similar to the ones determined for the activation segment in the context of the HECT domain. This implies that a major binding site for p14ARF on HUWE1 resides in the activation segment.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21036.024</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>p14ARF interacts with the activation segment of HUWE1 and stimulates oligomerization of HUWE1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Interactions of a fluorophor-labeled peptide comprising residues 45–64 of p14ARF with HUWE1 constructs of different lengths, monitored by fluorescence polarization.

Surprisingly, we find that the activities of HUWE1 (3843–4374), (3896–4374), and (3951–4374), are all significantly inhibited by the p14ARF-peptide. For the isolated HECT domain, no clear p14ARF-mediated inhibitory effect is observed. As noted above, the absolute ubiquitination levels vary between the different constructs, due to variations in the numbers of ubiquitination sites and the distinct conformations of the constructs that likely impact the accessibilities of these sites.</p><p>Our studies thus show that the p14ARF-derived peptide - while interacting most strongly with the activation segment of HUWE1 - can, in principle, inhibit the auto-ubiquitination activity of HUWE1 in a manner that is independent of the activation segment. This, in turn, implies that the residual binding activity of p14ARF for the HUWE1 HECT domain is sufficient to confer inhibition, at least when studying truncated constructs of HUWE1 that are lacking the activation segment. In the context of longer HUWE1 constructs, however, it is the activation segment that confers tighter binding of p14ARF. This led us to speculate that p14ARF may impose a primary layer of regulation on HUWE1 by modulating its conformational equilibrium: By interacting with the activation segment, p14ARF may release this segment from its intramolecular engagement with the dimerization region and promote HUWE1 dimerization.</p><p>To test this idea, we subjected HUWE1 (3843–4374) that contains the activation segment to SEC experiments in the presence and absence of a four-fold molar excess of a p14ARF-derived peptide (residues 45–75) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). We find that the peptide co-elutes with HUWE1 (3843–4374), as shown by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, insert). Note that the peptide itself cannot be detected reliably by UV absorbance, due to a lack of aromatic amino acids (λ = 280 nm) and due to the analytical scale that these experiments are performed at (λ = 220 nm). Strikingly, the peptide triggers a marked shift in the SEC profile of HUWE1 (3843–4374), indicative of oligomerization. Shorter constructs of HUWE1 that lack the activation segment (HUWE1 [3896–4374], HUWE1 [3951–4374], and HUWE1 [3993–4374]) are not affected by the presence of the peptide, in line with the results of the fluorescence polarization studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these experiments are consistent with the intriguing notion that p14ARF may shift the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 toward the inhibited dimeric state by capturing the activating segment. An additional/alternate mode of p14ARF-mediated inhibition of HUWE1 is independent of the activation segment. The structural underpinnings and relative contributions of these mechanisms in the regulation of HUWE1 remain to be elucidated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we uncover a regulatory switch in the conformational equilibrium of the ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 and present—to our knowledge—the first crystal structure of a HECT E3 enzyme in an auto-inhibited state. How the catalytic activities of HECT E3 enzymes are controlled is relatively poorly understood. A structural framework has so far only been delineated for members of the NEDD4-subfamily. These enzymes contain an N-terminal C2 domain that can serve an auto-inhibitory function by occupying a specific site on the N-lobe of the HECT domain that otherwise associates with ubiquitin and by structurally interfering with the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 enzyme to the E3 active site cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiesner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escobedo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Persaud et al., 2014</xref>). This transfer step can also be antagonized by intramolecular interactions between the HECT domain and the preceding WW domains in NEDD4-type enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Riling et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallagher et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, we have discovered that the catalytic activity of HUWE1 is down-regulated by dimerization, as mediated by a previously uncharacterized region adjacent to the catalytic HECT domain. This surprising structural arrangement locks the C-lobe of one HUWE1 subunit conformationally in a position that is incompatible with catalysis for several reasons. Firstly, the C-lobe of HECT E3 enzymes requires flexibility with respect to the N-lobe for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verdecia et al., 2003</xref>). In the context of the asymmetric HUWE1 dimer, however, the C-lobe of molecule B is tethered to the dimer interface and, therefore, immobilized. Secondly, the dimer interface buries a hydrophobic region on the C-lobe that was shown to interact with ubiquitin in E3 enzymes of the NEDD4-subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maspero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kamadurai et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2013</xref>). Thirdly, the C-tail, including a catalytically critical phenylalanine, −4 Phe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamadurai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salvat et al., 2004</xref>), is occluded by the dimer interface.</p><p>We show that the dimerization of HUWE1 (3951–4374) is mediated by rather weak interactions. This suggests that the conformational ensemble of HUWE1 (3951–4374) is dynamic in solution and, hence, likely auto-inhibited overall through transient interactions between the C-lobes and the dimerization regions. In line with this idea, we observe a significant stimulation of activity upon disruption of the dimer interface, both in vitro and in cells, which indicates that the dimeric form of HUWE1 is auto-inhibited effectively. There is currently no indication that the HUWE1 dimer that has crystallized in an asymmetric form is also functionally asymmetric in solution, as was described for the U-box ligase CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our studies suggest that the dimerization of HUWE1 can be counteracted by an intramolecular engagement of the dimerization region with a segment of strikingly similar sequence, the ‘activation segment’, located some 50 residues upstream. We imagine that the activation segment serves as an intramolecular ‘wedge’ that disrupts the HUWE1 dimer when the ligase ought to be active. In line with the important functions of the dimerization region and the activation segment in controlling the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1, both regions are disproportionately highly conserved across the family of HUWE1 orthologues, including lower eukaryotic ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21036.027</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>The dimerization region and the activation segment are disproportionally highly conserved across HUWE1 orthologues.</title><p>Sequence alignment of 20 selected HUWE1 orthologues, as output by Clustal Omega (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001591">SCR_001591</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/</ext-link>) and sorted by their degree of sequence identity with the HECT domain of the human protein (top row).

Yet, the relative stimulatory effects of the mutations are different. When monitoring the auto-ubiquitination capacity of HUWE1 in vitro, the activity enhancement observed for the I3969A and F3982 variants compared to the WT is relatively similar. In the cell, however, the F3982A variant stimulates the ubiquitination of physiological HUWE1 substrates more strongly than the I3969A variant. Notably, our cell-based assays were performed with large HUWE1 constructs (2474–4374) that include the activation segment, while the in vitro assays were based on the crystallization construct, HUWE1 (3951–4374), that lacks the activation segment. It is possible that the mutated residues, both of which are pivotal for the integrity of the dimer interface, contribute differently to the alternate intramolecular interaction between the dimerization region and the activation segment. To characterize this latter interaction structurally and to delineate the conformational transition of HUWE1 from the dimeric, auto-inhibited to the monomeric, active state of HUWE1 will be an important aim of future studies.</p><p>It will also be essential to illuminate the physiological context, in which this transition occurs. With an in vitro dissociation constant of ~3 μM, the dimerization of the C-terminal region of HUWE1 (residues 3951–4374) may appear relatively weak. However, affinities in the low micromolar range (and even above) are not unusual in the ubiquitin system and have been observed, for instance, for the interactions between E2 and E3 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ye and Rape, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eletr and Kuhlman, 2007</xref>), between ubiquitin and ubiquitin-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Husnjak et al., 2012</xref>), and between ubiquitin and E2 enzymes or E2/E3 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buetow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hofmann and Pickart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wickliffe et al., 2011</xref>). While these affinities, as determined in vitro, are typically altered by avidity and/or allovalency effects in the cellular context, it still emerges that ubiquitination enzymes have evolved to act through the sequential formation of rather weak protein interfaces. This feature may benefit the dynamic handover of reaction products throughout the catalytic cascade, the efficient assembly of ubiquitin chains, and the fine-tuned interplay of ubiquitination and deubiquitination enzymes.</p><p>Moreover, rather high overall cellular concentrations of HUWE1 have been reported, based on quantitative proteomics studies, for instance 120 nM in colon tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wiśniewski et al., 2015a</xref>), 250 nM in colon cancer tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wiśniewski et al., 2015a</xref>), and 400 nM in MCF7 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">(Wiśniewski et al., 2015b</xref>). Importantly, the local concentrations of HUWE1 at its cellular sites of action are expected to be significantly higher, due to the effects of cellular compartimentalization and protein co-localization. Considering the large size of HUWE1 (482 kDa) and, accordingly, the large number of its interaction partners, co-localization effects likely have a particularly pronounced impact on the local concentrations of HUWE1 and, therefore, on its propensity to dimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ispolatov et al., 2005</xref>). Hence, even seemingly weak interactions of HUWE1, as determined in vitro, can be expected to fall into a physiologically meaningful range, that is, a range that can give rise to a functionally relevant population of the dimeric state, yet that allows for this population to be regulated by cellular factors.</p><p>We propose that the conformational equilibrium and, hence, the activity of HUWE1 is modulated by yet uncharacterized domain interactions in the context of full-length HUWE1 and by macromolecular factors that will determine not only the local concentrations of HUWE1 in the cell, but also the accessibility of the dimerization region and the activation segment for their intramolecular engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21036.028</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Model of the conformational regulation of HUWE1 and proposed mechanism of its inhibition by p14ARF.</title><p>Our studies suggest that the catalytic activity of HUWE1 is regulated conformationally by an intricate balance of inter- and intramolecular interactions. The thumb and pointer helices adjacent to the catalytic HECT domain can mediate the dimerization of HUWE1. The dimer locks the position of the C-lobe, buries the C-terminal tail (magenta), and occludes a putative ubiquitin binding site on the C-lobe of one subunit, hence representing an auto-inhibited state. Alternatively, the dimerization region of HUWE1 can associate with the activation segment in cis, which precludes dimer formation. The activation segment and the dimerization region are separated by a 55-residue linker that is presumably flexible, thus allowing for the re-positioning of the activation segment. In the monomeric state of HUWE1, the C-lobe is mobile with respect to the N-lobe (arrow), and the C-terminal tail may anchor the C-lobe on the N-lobe or interact with substrates, as required for catalytic activity.</p><p>The activation segment of HUWE1 presents a major interaction site for a physiological inhibitor of HUWE1, p14ARF. We propose that the binding of p14ARF to the activation segment releases the dimerization region from its intramolecular engagement, thus shifting the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 toward the auto-inhibited, dimeric state. An additional/alternate mode of inhibition of HUWE1 by p14ARF is independent of the activation segment. We speculate that interactions of HUWE1 with its substrates and positive effectors favor the active state of HUWE1 through interactions that remain to be elucidated.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21036.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21036.028</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21036-fig12-v1"/></fig></p><p>The HUWE1-inhibitor and tumor suppressor p14ARF presents such a macromolecular factor. Our studies reveal that p14ARF binds to the activation segment of HUWE1, which may release this segment from its intramolecular engagement with the dimerization region and, thus, promote dimerization. The fact that the interactions between p14ARF and HUWE1 and those mediating the dimerization of HUWE1 are in the same range K<sub>D</sub>-range in vitro, makes it plausible that they can regulate each other dynamically. We also speculate that high levels of p14ARF may contribute to the robust self-association and auto-inhibition of HUWE1 that we observe in HeLa cells. Notably, however, our studies show that an alternate or additional mode of p14ARF-mediated inhibition of HUWE1 also exists and is independent of the activation segment. In order to understand these mechanisms in detail and to clarify their relative contributions to the inhibition of HUWE1 by p14ARF, structural insights into HUWE1/p14ARF complexes are required.</p><p>We predict that the activation segment provides interaction sites for other cellular factors, in addition to p14ARF. Interestingly, a binding site for PCNA (‘PIP-box’) has recently been mapped to residues 3880‐3887 of HUWE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choe et al., 2016</xref>), thus coinciding with the activation segment. Whether PCNA binding impacts the oligomeric state and activity of HUWE1 remains to be determined.</p><p>Taken together, our studies lay out an unprecedented mechanistic framework for the conformational regulation of HUWE1 and its interactions with the tumor suppressor p14ARF. These insights have important ramifications for our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of altered HUWE1 variants and for the design of therapeutic avenues toward targeting HUWE1 function. For instance, several point mutations that were identified in human tumors fall into the dimerization region and result in non-conservative amino acid changes of interfacing residues. We show that two of these sites, His 3962 and Ile 3969, are critical for dimerization and for the auto-inhibition of HUWE1. These observations are in line with the notion that there may be selective pressure, at least in some human tumors, to enhance the activity of HUWE1 and to render it resistant to inhibition by p14ARF.</p><p>We anticipate that the dimerization of HUWE1 may be manipulated by small-molecules or peptide-based agents that influence the interactions of the dimerization region and the activation segment, respectively. Moreover, p14ARF-mimetic peptides may be used to inhibit HUWE1 activity in the cell. Anti-tumor characteristics have recently been reported for a p14ARF-derived peptide in gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saito et al., 2013</xref>). While a connection to HUWE1 has not been established in this context, it is interesting to note that the critical p14ARF region identified in that study comprises residues 38–65 and, thus, includes the region of p14ARF (residues 45-64) that we found to interact with HUWE1 and inhibit its activity. Thus, with the dimerization region and the activation segment of HUWE1 and the HUWE1-binding region of p14ARF we have defined three molecular knobs, by which the conformational equilibrium and, hence, the activity of HUWE1 may be tuned for therapeutic purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gene construct design</title><p>For the in vitro studies, the HUWE1 gene constructs (3759–4374, 3810–4374, 3843–4374, 3896–4374, 3951–4374, 3975–4374, and 3993–4374) were sub-cloned into a pBADM11 vector (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) encoding an N-terminal TEV protease-cleavable His<sub>6</sub>-tag (sequence: MKHHHHHHPMSDYDIPTTENLYFQ).

Cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination, using the Venor GeM mycoplasma PCR detection kit (Minerva Biolabs, Berlin, Germany). Transient transfections with the indicated plasmids were conducted in six-well plates using polyethylenimine, according to standard protocols. Stable HeLa cell lines were generated by lentiviral transduction, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wiese et al., 2015</xref>). For transposon-mediated gene expression HUWE1-expressing transposon vectors were co-transfected with the SB transposase-expressing vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mátés et al., 2009</xref>) into HeLa cells, using polyethylenimine, and stable cell pools were established by selection with puromycin.</p><p>For in vivo ubiquitination assays, cells were lysed by sonication in urea buffer (6 M urea, PBS, 10 mM imidazole), and lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Ubiquitinated proteins were captured on Ni-NTA resin at room temperature over night, washed in PBS buffer containing 35 mM imidazole and analyzed by immunoblotting with the following antibodies: anti-HA C29F4 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10693385">AB_10693385</ext-link>), anti-C-MYC D3N8F (Cell Signaling Technology; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2631168">AB_2631168</ext-link>), and anti-MCL1 S-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2144105">AB_2144105</ext-link>).</p><p>For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in TNT buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100), supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates were briefly sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. Protein complexes were recovered using protein G-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) with anti-HA (C29F4, Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. Precipitated proteins were resolved on 10% SDS Bis-Tris gels and immunoblotted using the anti-HA (6E2, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 5LP8.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Thorsten Stühmer (Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, University Hospital Würzburg) for sharing transposon expression vectors; the staff of ESRF beamlines ID30A and BM29; Julia Haubenreisser for technical assistance; Edward Lowe, Jeremy Thorner, Florian Sauer, Jacek Wisniewski, Hermann Schindelin, Stefanie Peter, Elmar Wolf, and Patrick Weinkam for helpful discussions; and Markus Seeliger for critical reading of the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Sander, et al., describes the partial of structure of the very large HUWE1 HECT E3 enzyme (nearly 500 kD), which includes the catalytic HECT domain and a region immediately upstream of the catalytic domain. While the structure of the HUWE1 catalytic domain, by itself, has been previously reported, the importance of the current structure is that it reveals a unique regulatory mechanism for this enzyme, mediated by the domains upstream of the HECT domain. The protein is shown to form an asymmetric dimer is a manner that is predicted to inhibit the activity of the enzyme, and this is confirmed biochemically. Most interesting, p14ARF, a known HUWE1-interacting protein, is proposed to stabilize the dimeric (inhibited) form of HUWE1.</p><p>The importance of this work is two-fold. First, the newly discovered mechanism of regulation of HUWE1 is so far unique among HECT E3s. This therefore adds to the list of surprisingly diverse mechanisms that regulate HECT E3s. Second, the HUWE1 and p14ARF are cancer-relevant proteins, and while it is not yet clear which substrate(s) of HUWE1 are most critical in cancers, the proposed mechanism of regulation by ARF will be an important contribution and lay the groundwork for further discovery.</p><p>While this manuscript reports interesting findings, several issues should be addressed in a revised version:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I am concerned about the physiological relevance of the dimerization model: The K<sub>D</sub> in the μM range would require high concentrations of HUWE1 in the cells; what is known about HUWE1 levels and are they in the expected range for this model to be relevant? It would be essential that the authors determine the exact K<sub>D</sub> rather than estimate it. In addition, in vivo evidence has only been provided using overexpressed HUWE1 – a problematic issue given the high K<sub>D</sub> of dimer formation (i.e. it is likely that the authors force the enzyme into an inactive dimer-state by overexpressing it) – this would need to be repeated under better controlled conditions, for example in stable cell lines with both partners being expressed for short periods of time. I would assume that the in cis interaction between the activation segment and a dimerization helix would be strongly favored over the in trans interaction between two HECT-domains – this raises doubts about the relevance of the dimer interface.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, critical control experiments with the HECT domain (aa 3993-4374) and the I3969A/F3982A double mutant are missing as well as a concentration step where the DR-HECT construct can be safely assumed to be completely monomeric. Ideally, the construct with the truncated DR (aa 3975-4374, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>) should also be included. As it is, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> is not conclusive since all constructs (also those that should be mostly monomeric) exhibit concentration dependent inhibition and none of them can be assumed to be completely active and monomeric. Moreover, the concentration effect on activity is far too large to be explained by a simple monomer-dimer equilibrium. If the monomeric form were 100% active and the dimeric 50% (as the authors suggest), the two-fold decrease in activity between 16 and 64 μM for the WT should coincide with a complete conversion from monomer to dimer. Given that the dimerization is weak and dynamic (see below), this is hardly possible within this concentration range.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B,C</xref>, the HUWE1 constructs contain the AS and thus should adopt an active conformation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, mutations in the DR should not have an effect on activity. In line with this, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> the WT is virtually as active as the I3969A mutant, but does not provide insight into the importance of dimerization for inhibition. On the other hand, differences in activities are observed in particular for the F3982A mutant contradicting that the AS activates the protein. In any case, these constructs cannot be compared to the in vitro assays due to the presence of the AS.</p><p>3) Along these lines, to determine whether mutations in the dimerization interface activate HUWE1, the authors should use a known substrate (in vitro), rather than autoubiquitylation, and they should perform the reaction at physiologically meaningful concentrations (not in the range of 16 μM!).</p><p>4) The DR-HECT construct crystallizes as an asymmetric dimer where one HECT domain adopts an active and the other an inhibited conformation through interactions with the DR. Importantly, the DR region scores very differently in the structure validation report. Secondly, the position of the C-lobe of molecule A &quot;is determined by crystal contacts&quot; and therefore may be precluded from binding the DR. These crystal contacts should be shown in a supplemental figure and the B-factors of the DR listed separately for molecules A and B in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The fact that the dimer interaction is weak (see below) strongly suggests that the N-terminal extensions interact independently and transiently with the C-lobes in solution and not in a concerted manner that would inhibit one half of the dimer and leave the other half active as the authors suggest. The possibility that the HUWE1 DR-HECT may form a symmetric dimer in solution should be discussed upfront and throughout the paper unless the authors can rule out a symmetric dimer experimentally. If the DR-HECT construct is indeed asymmetric in solution the biological significance of a half-active enzyme should be discussed and compared to the CHIP E3 ligase where the asymmetry links a dimeric enzyme to monomeric Ub transfer (half-of-sites reactivity) (PMID: 16307917).</p><p>Subsection “The crystal structure of a C-terminal region of HUWE1 reveals an asymmetric dimer”, last paragraph: &quot;[…] would thus, in principle, be free to swing […]&quot;. The authors should illustrate this by overlaying the structure of molecule A with the other structures of the HUWE1 HECT domain. The speculation that the C-lobe is free to move should be supported by data. Otherwise the mobility of the C-lobe is possible, but not founded on data.</p><p>The authors speculate that F4371 (-4F) being buried through interactions with the N-terminal end of the DR may form the basis for autoinhibition. Yet, the exact same DR region also contacts C-lobe residues (L4335, M4359, L4362) involved in thioester formation (PDB ID: 4bbn and 4lcd). The authors should clarify this experimentally.</p><p>5) There are some gaps in the p14ARF experiments that may require additional experiments. It is stated as &quot;data not shown&quot; that a region of p14ARF was identified that bound to HUWE1 (residues 43-75). It is further shown that a peptide corresponding to this region stabilized the dimeric form of a dimerization-competent HUWE1 construct, but had no effect on the isolated HUWE1. This implies that p14ARF, as well as the p14ARF peptide, binds to HUWE1 outside of the HECT domain, but this does not appear to have ever been tested, either here or in the literature. Given the reagents that the authors have in-hand, it seems that it would be very straight-forward to determine the binding site on HUWE1 for p14ARF. Finally, as stated in the Discussion, tumor-associated mutations have been identified in HUWE1 that fall within the dimerization domain. The prediction is that these mutations might result in hyper-activation of HUWE1 by inhibiting formation of the dimer. This result would add significantly to the impact of the current paper and it seems that this could be tested with relatively little additional effort.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21036.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) I am concerned about the physiological relevance of the dimerization model: The</italic> K<sub>D</sub><italic>in the μM range would require high concentrations of HUWE1 in the cells; what is known about HUWE1 levels and are they in the expected range for this model to be relevant?

In addition, in vivo evidence has only been provided using overexpressed HUWE1 – a problematic issue given the high</italic> K<sub>D</sub><italic>of dimer formation (i.e. it is likely that the authors force the enzyme into an inactive dimer-state by overexpressing it) – this would need to be repeated under better controlled conditions, for example in stable cell lines with both partners being expressed for short periods of time.</italic> </p><p>In response to this comment, we have now determined the dissociation constant, K<sub>D</sub>, for the dimerization of the C-terminal region of HUWE1 (residues 3951-4374) by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; subsection “The C-terminal region of HUWE1 dimerizes in solution”, last paragraph) and obtained a value of 3 µM. That the dimerization of HUWE1 is physiologically relevant is supported by the following observations:</p><p>i) Quantitative proteomics studies performed in Matthias Mann’s laboratory have yielded relatively high overall concentrations of HUWE1 in human tissues, for instance 120 nM in colon (Wisniewski J R et al., J. Proteome Res. 14(9), 2015). Interestingly, HUWE1 levels are even higher in colon cancer tissue, where they amount to 250 nM (Wisniewski J R et al., J. Proteome Res. 14(9), 2015). Elevated HUWE1 levels have also been detected in human cancer cell lines, such as K562 (170 nM) and MCF7 (400 nM) (Wisniewski J R et al., Proteomics 15(7), 2015). Importantly, the <italic>local</italic> concentrations of HUWE1 at its cellular sites of action are expected to be significantly higher, due to the effects of cellular compartmentalization and protein co-localization (for a rationalization of this concept, see Pawson T &amp; Scott J S, Science 78(5346), 1997 or Kuriyan J &amp; Eisenberg D, Nature 450(7172), 2007). Considering the large size of HUWE1 (482 kDa) and, accordingly, the large number of its interaction partners, co-localization effects likely have a particularly pronounced impact on the local concentrations of HUWE1 and, therefore, on its propensity to dimerize (Ispolatov I et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 33(11), 2005).</p><p>Based on these data and considerations (that we have included in the Discussion), we expect even a low μM K<sub>D</sub>-value for HUWE1 dimerization, as measured in vitro, to fall within a physiologically relevant range, i.e. a range that can give rise to a functionally significant population of the dimeric state, yet that allows for this population to be regulated by cellular factors.</p><p>ii) Importantly, we have performed additional co-IP experiments from two cell lines stably expressing HUWE1, as the reviewers suggested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>; subsection “Key contacts in the crystallographic dimer interface mediate the dimerization of HUWE1 in vitro and its self-association in cells”, eighth paragraph). We show that the HUWE1 levels in one of these cells lines are significantly lower than upon transient expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, HUWE1 self-associates at these concentrations robustly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Hence, our studies provide strong evidence that HUWE1 can dimerize in the cell.</p><p>iii) The low μM K<sub>D</sub>-value that we have determined describes the dimerization capacity of an isolated ~ 50 kDa-fragment of HUWE1 in vitro. It is likely that additional domain interactions of HUWE1, its association with macromolecular interaction partners, or posttranslational modifications contribute to the dimerization of full-length HUWE1 in the cell, thus lowering the effective K<sub>D</sub>. With the tumor suppressor p14ARF, intriguingly, we have identified one such macromolecular factor. We show that p14ARF interacts with the activation segment of HUWE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>; see also Point 5) and propose that this interaction shifts the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 towards the inhibited dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Interestingly, the K<sub>D</sub>-values for the dimerization of HUWE1 and for its interaction with p14ARF are in the same (low μM) range in vitro(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). This makes it plausible that these two interactions may be able to regulate each other dynamically in the cell. These points have been added to the text (subsection “The HUWE1-inhibitor p14ARF interacts with the activation segment and promotes oligomerization of HUWE1”, second paragraph;– Discussion, ninth paragraph).</p><p>iv) It is worth noting that dissociation constants in the μM range (and even weaker), as measured in vitro, are common in the ubiquitin system. This holds, for instance, for the interactions between E2 and E3 enzymes (Ye Y &amp; Rape M, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 10(11), 2009), between ubiquitin and ubiquitin-binding domains (Husnjak K &amp; Dikic I, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 81, 2012), and for the interactions between ubiquitin and E2s or E2/E3 complexes (Buetow L et al., Mol. Cell 58(2), 2015; Hofmann R M &amp; Pickart C M, J. Biol. Chem. 276(30), 2001; Wickliffe K et al., Cell 144(5), 2011). While the affinities determined in vitroare typically altered by avidity and/or allovalency effects in the cellular context, it still emerges that ubiquitination enzymes have evolved to act through the sequential formation of rather weak protein interfaces. This feature may benefit the dynamic handover of reaction products throughout the catalytic cascade, the efficient assembly of ubiquitin chains, and the fine-tuned interplay of ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating reactions. We have included a corresponding comment into the text (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><p>Taken together, we provide strong evidence that the dimerization of HUWE1 that we observe in vitroand that is mirrored by our cell-based experiments represents a physiologically relevant regulatory mechanism, i.e. a mechanism that occurs in an affinity window that is suitable for a modulation by physiological factors.</p><p><italic>I would assume that the in cis interaction between the activation segment and a dimerization helix would be strongly favored over the in trans interaction between two HECT-domains – this raises doubts about the relevance of the dimer interface.</italic> </p><p>How <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> interactions of the dimerization region compete in the dynamic regulation of HUWE1 is a fascinating question and will depend, for one part, on the local concentrations of the respective binding elements (dimerization region and activation segment). Based on this, one would typically expect an intramolecular interaction of the dimerization region with the activation segment to prevail upon dimer formation. Remarkably, however, our cell-based studies demonstrate that long HUWE1 constructs that contain the activation segment self-associate and that this process is mediated by the same key contacts that mediate dimerization of short HUWE1 constructs in vitroand that we had predicted, based on the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 not only depends on the activation segment and the dimerization region, but also on their accessibilities for interacting with each other. If the activation segment is engaged elsewhere, dimer formation can be favored. Indeed, our data provide evidence for such a regulatory mechanism: As suggested by the reviewers (Point 5), we mapped the binding site of p14ARF on HUWE1 by fluorescence polarization studies and reveal that the primary binding site for p14ARF on HUWE1 resides in the activation segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>We, therefore, propose that p14ARF may shield the activation segment from interacting with the dimerization region intramolecularly, thereby promoting dimer formation. We speculate that other macromolecular factors, besides p14ARF, impact the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 by favoring or disfavoring dimer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). This could occur through interactions with the dimerization region, with the activating segment, or with surfaces that are specific to the dimer or monomer. Furthermore, yet uncharacterized domain interactions within HUWE1 may impact its dimerization propensity. To identify such mechanisms and to elucidate structures of full-length HUWE1 will be an important area of future studies. We have included the above data and ideas into the text (subsection “The HUWE1-inhibitor p14ARF interacts with the activation segment and promotes oligomerization of HUWE1”, second paragraph; Discussion, ninth paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, critical control experiments with the HECT domain (aa 3993-4374) and the I3969A/F3982A double mutant are missing as well as a concentration step where the DR-HECT construct can be safely assumed to be completely monomeric. Ideally, the construct with the truncated DR (aa 3975-4374, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>) should also be included. As it is, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> is not conclusive since all constructs (also those that should be mostly monomeric) exhibit concentration dependent inhibition and none of them can be assumed to be completely active and monomeric. Moreover, the concentration effect on activity is far too large to be explained by a simple monomer-dimer equilibrium. If the monomeric form were 100% active and the dimeric 50% (as the authors suggest), the two-fold decrease in activity between 16 and 64 μM for the WT should coincide with a complete conversion from monomer to dimer. Given that the dimerization is weak and dynamic (see below), this is hardly possible within this concentration range.</italic> </p><p>In response to this comment, we have performed additional activity assays, including the HECT domain of HUWE1, the I3969A/F3982A variant, and the truncated variant (3975-4374) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We have also included the tumor-associated variant H3962D of HUWE1 (3951-4374), as suggested in Point 5, and have shifted the protein concentrations to a significantly lower regime of 1, 5, and 10 µM. These values were chosen in consideration of the K<sub>D</sub> of dimerization, 3 µM, as determined by AUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; see Point 1), and of the physiological levels of HUWE1 (120-400 nM <italic>overall</italic> cellular concentration, as reported by quantitative proteomics, see Point 1).</p><p>The comparison of the activities of HUWE1 (3951-4374) WT to the panel of dimerization- deficient variants reveals that the mutated variants are more active than the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The stimulation is most pronounced for the double mutant, in line with the loss of dimerization that we observed for this variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Notably, at these concentrations, only the activity of the WT displays a weak concentration dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Qualitatively, these effects confirm our initial findings and support our model that the dimerization of HUWE1 is auto-inhibitory. We have included a corresponding description in the text (subsection “The disruption of the dimerization interface enhances the activity of HUWE1 in vitro and in cells”, first paragraph). As explained below (Point 4), we have also clarified the text to state that, due to the transient and dynamic nature of dimerization in solution, the ensemble of HUWE1 molecules is most likely auto-inhibited overall (see the aforementioned paragraph).</p><p>“[…] <italic>Ideally, the construct with the truncated DR (aa 3975-4374, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>) should also be included.”</italic></p><p>When comparing the dimerization-dependent activities of HUWE1 constructs of different lengths quantitatively, auto-ubiquitination assays are hard to interpret, since the constructs have different numbers of ubiquitination sites and adopt distinct conformations and, therefore, display different auto-ubiquitination activities per se(subsection “The disruption of the dimerization interface enhances the activity of HUWE1 in vitro and in cells”, second paragraph). In response to this comment, we, therefore, set up a substrate ubiquitination assay and compared the activities of HUWE1 (3951-4374), HUWE1 (3975-4374) and (3993-4374) towards MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This assay shows that the truncated, dimerization-deficient constructs (HUWE1 (3975-4374) and (3993-4374)) are significantly more active than HUWE1 (3951-437) that contains an intact dimerization region, in line with our model. A description has been added to the text (see the aforementioned paragraph).</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and 5BC, the HUWE1 constructs contain the AS and thus should adopt an active conformation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, mutations in the DR should not have an effect on activity. In line with this, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> the WT is virtually as active as the I3969A mutant, but does not provide insight into the importance of dimerization for inhibition. On the other hand, differences in activities are observed in particular for the F3982A mutant contradicting that the AS activates the protein. In any case, these constructs cannot be compared to the in vitro assays due to the presence of the AS.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, which we have addressed in the text as follows: Indeed, the extended HUWE1 constructs employed in our cell-based studies contain the activation segment. Yet, we find that they are auto-inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>) in HeLa cells and that the WT constructs self-associate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>, formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These observations suggest that additional factors regulate HUWE1 activity and stabilize the HUWE1 dimer in the cellular context. As the presence of the activation segment <italic>per se</italic> does not render HUWE1 fully active in HeLa cells, we speculate that the activation segment serves as a recognition site for cellular factors that impact the conformational equilibrium and, hence, the activity of HUWE1 (Discussion, eighth paragraph).</p><p>Interestingly, our studies identify one such factor, the tumor suppressor p14ARF. We have now included fluorescence polarization experiments (see Point 5) and show that the major binding site for p14ARF resides in the activation segment of HUWE1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). We also provide initial evidence that the interaction between p14ARF and the activation segment impacts the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 and promotes oligomerization in vitro(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). We speculate that high levels of p14ARF may contribute to the relatively low activity of HUWE1 that we observe in HeLa cells (Discussion, eighth paragraph). As noted above (Point 1), other intra-and intermolecular interactions of HUWE1 may also have a role in promoting its dimerization in the cell.</p><p><italic>“In line with this, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> the WT is virtually as active as the I3969A mutant, but does not provide insight into the importance of dimerization for inhibition. On the other hand, differences in activities are observed in particular for the F3982A mutant contradicting that the AS activates the protein.”</italic></p><p>We have acknowledged the fact that the F3982A mutation has a stronger stimulating effect on substrate ubiquitination than the I3969A mutation in our cell-based assays, and we provide a possible rationale for this phenomenon (Discussion, fifth paragraph). In brief, we speculate that two residues, Phe 3982 and Ile 3969, both of which are important for HUWE1 dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>) may differ in their contributions to the interaction between the dimerization region and the activation segment. For instance, it is conceivable that the substitution of Ile 3969, while destabilizing the dimer interface, also destabilizes the alternate interaction of the dimerization region with the activation segment. As a result, this substitution may impact activity only moderately in the context of long HUWE1 constructs. To test such possible mechanisms and to characterize the interaction between the dimerization region and the activation segment structurally is an important aim of our future studies.</p><p><italic>3) Along these lines, to determine whether mutations in the dimerization interface activate HUWE1, the authors should use a known substrate (</italic>in vitro<italic>), rather than autoubiquitylation, and they should perform the reaction at physiologically meaningful concentrations (not in the range of 16 μM!).</italic> </p><p>In response to this comment, we have now included substrate ubiquitination assays in our study, monitoring the modification of MCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8C</xref>). The results of these assays demonstrate that HUWE1 constructs that dimerize (HUWE1 (3951-4374) and HUWE1 (3896- 4374)) are significantly less active than those constructs that are deficient in dimerization (either due to the lack of the dimerization region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) or due to the presence of the activation segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>)) These results support our model that the dimerization of HUWE1 presents an auto-inhibitory mechanism. Descriptions have been included in the text (subsection “The disruption of the dimerization interface enhances the activity of HUWE1 in vitro and in cells”, second paragraph; subsection “The dimerization capacity of HUWE1 is modulated by intramolecular interactions”, fourth paragraph).</p><p>In the context of this reconstituted biochemical assay, it is hard to assess what the physiologically most meaningful concentrations of HUWE1 are, since only small portions of the full-length protein are studied, in highly purified form, in a defined posttranslational modification state, in homogeneous distribution, and in the absence of interaction partners (other than E1, E2, ubiquitin, and substrate). In light of these considerations, we have chosen a HUWE1 concentration of 5 μM, i.e. slightly above the K<sub>D</sub> of dimerization (3 μM) that we have determined in vitro(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Encouragingly, the results of our in vitroassays are corroborated by our cell-based analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The DR-HECT construct crystallizes as an asymmetric dimer where one HECT domain adopts an active and the other an inhibited conformation through interactions with the DR. Importantly, the DR region scores very differently in the structure validation report. Secondly, the position of the C-lobe of molecule A &quot;is determined by crystal contacts&quot; and therefore may be precluded from binding the DR. These crystal contacts should be shown in a supplemental figure and the B-factors of the DR listed separately for molecules A and B in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</italic> </p><p>In response to this comment, we now provide detailed illustrations and analyses of the lattice environment of the C-lobe of molecule A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; subsection “The crystal structure of a C-terminal region of HUWE1 reveals an asymmetric dimer”, last paragraph). All of the lattice interfaces that the C-lobe is involved in are small and polar compared to the dimer interface that we have characterized and validated in solution. Importantly, we observe a HUWE1 dimer, but no higher–order oligomers in solution, even at high protein concentrations, and we show that the dimerization in solution can be disrupted by mutations in the crystallographic dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the polar lattice contacts shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> are not relevant in solution.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the difference in the B-factors and address this comment by providing a comprehensive analysis, including a table with B-factors listed per chain, and for the HECT domains and dimerization regions separately (Figure 1—figure supplement A).</p><p>The B-factors for molecule B are generally higher than for chain A, but within an acceptable range of the Wilson B-factor. We rationalize this phenomenon by the fact that molecule B has a significantly different packing environment form molecule A: A significant portion of the HECT domain of chain B faces a large water channel, and this portion displays particularly high B-factors (Figure 1—figure supplement B). In contrast, molecule A is embedded into lattice contacts more tightly.</p><p>The dimerization region of molecule B has lower B-factors, on average, than the HECT domain, consistent with it being distant from the water channel. In molecule A, the dimerization region has higher B-factors than the corresponding HECT domain. Importantly, however, the dimerization regions in both molecules are well defined in the electron density and could be modeled with confidence.</p><p><italic>The fact that the dimer interaction is weak (see below) strongly suggests that the N-terminal extensions interact independently and transiently with the C-lobes in solution and not in a concerted manner that would inhibit one half of the dimer and leave the other half active as the authors suggest. The possibility that the HUWE1 DR-HECT may form a symmetric dimer in solution should be discussed upfront and throughout the paper unless the authors can rule out a symmetric dimer experimentally. If the DR-HECT construct is indeed asymmetric in solution the biological significance of a half-active enzyme should be discussed and compared to the CHIP E3 ligase where the asymmetry links a dimeric enzyme to monomeric Ub transfer (half-of-sites reactivity) (PMID: 16307917).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful comment that we fully agree with and that we have now incorporated in the text explicitly (The disruption of the dimerization interface enhances the activity of HUWE1 in vitro and in cells”, first paragraph; Discussion, third paragraph). We have clarified the text to state that, while the nature of the interface observed crystallographically is asymmetric, we predict that the ensemble of molecules in solution is overall auto-inhibited, due to the transient and dynamic nature of the interface. This interpretation is supported by the results of our activity assays that demonstrate that the dimerization of HUWE1 is associated with auto-inhibition.</p><p>We have also added a comment to acknowledge the intriguing work on the structurally and functionally asymmetric U-box ubiquitin ligase by Laurence Pearl and colleagues and to contrast it with the case of HUWE1 (Discussion, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>The authors speculate that F4371 (-4F) being buried through interactions with the N-terminal end of the DR may form the basis for autoinhibition.

The authors should clarify this experimentally.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the interesting possibility that the engagement of residues L4335, M4359, L4362 at the dimer interface may contribute to the auto-inhibited nature of this state. The hydrophobic character of two of these residues (L4335 and L4362) is conserved in NEDD4-type E3s (corresponding to L861 and M888 of NEDD4 (PDB ID: 4BBN; Maspero E et al., Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 20(6), 2013), L916 and M943 of NEDD4L (PDB ID: 3JVZ; Kamadurai H B et al., Mol. Cell 36(6), 2009), and L771 and L798 of RSP5 (PDB ID: 4LCD; Kamadurai H B et al., e<italic>Life</italic> 2:e00828, 2013)). The third residue (M4359 of HUWE1) is substituted by a lysine residue in NEDD4-type E3s. The two conserved hydrophobic residues were shown to have a role in the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to NEDD4-family E3s (Kamadurai H B et al., Mol. Cell 36(6), 2009; Kamadurai H B et al. e<italic>Life</italic> 2:e00828, 2013), since they provide contacts with donor ubiquitin.</p><p>It is currently unknown if HUWE1 positions the donor ubiquitin on the C-lobe in a similar manner. Unfortunately, it is problematic to test the above hypothesis in functional assays for the following reason: As noted by Hidde Ploegh and colleagues for HUWE1 (Pandya R K et al., J. Biol. Chem. 285(8), 2010), and in line with studies on other HECT E3 enzymes (e.g. Mari S. et al., Structure 22(11), 2014; Maspero E. et al., EMBO Rep. 12(4), 2011), the thioesterification of ubiquitin on the active site of HECT E3s is difficult to visualize, due to rapid isopeptide bond formation. To circumvent this problem, previous studies, including the one on HUWE1, have typically used truncated constructs of the HECT domain, in which the C-tail, including the conserved ‘-4 Phe’, was deleted or mutated. Such HECT constructs show impaired isopeptide bond formation with ubiquitin, while thioester formation is uncompromised, and thus allow for thioester formation to be monitored (Salvat C et al., J. Biol. Chem. 279(18), 2004). However, when studying the inhibitory mode of the HUWE1 dimer, we cannot make use of such an approach, since the C-tail of HUWE1 makes up an integral part of the dimer interface on molecule B in our structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref>). So, unfortunately, we are unable to provide an experimental dissection of the inhibitory contributions of the various possible mechanisms at this point in time. However, we will try to study this interesting question in the future.</p><p>We incorporated the reviewers’ idea into the text (subsection “The crystal structure of a C-terminal region of HUWE1 reveals an asymmetric dimer”, fifth paragraph; Discussion, third paragraph) as a third rationale, for why the HUWE1 dimer is inhibited, in addition to the two mechanisms that we had suggested (lack of C-lobe mobility and burial of the C-tail). It is possible that all three mechanisms apply to inhibit HUWE1 synergistically. We now also provide an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) to illustrate that donor ubiquitin would clash with the HUWE1 dimer interface, if it were positioned in the same way as seen for NEDD4-family enzymes.</p><p><italic>Subsection “The crystal structure of a C-terminal region of HUWE1 reveals an asymmetric dimer”, last paragraph: &quot;[…] would thus, in principle, be free to swing […]&quot;. The authors should illustrate this by overlaying the structure of molecule A with the other structures of the HUWE1 HECT domain. The speculation that the C-lobe is free to move should be supported by data. Otherwise the mobility of the C-lobe is possible, but not founded on data.</italic> </p><p>In response to this comment, we have now included an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), superposing molecule A with catalytically relevant states of NEDD4-subfamily enzymes to show that these conformations would, in principle, not clash with the dimer interface of HUWE1.</p><p>As noted above, however, we have clarified the text to state explicitly that the ensemble of HUWE1 molecules is most likely auto-inhibited in solution overall, due to the transient nature of the dimer (subsection “The disruption of the dimerization interface enhances the activity of HUWE1 in vitro and in cells”, first paragraph; Discussion, third paragraph). We comment on the putative conformational space of the C-lobe of molecule A, independent of the lattice environment, solely as part of a comprehensive description of the crystal structure per se(subsection “The crystal structure of a C-terminal region of HUWE1 reveals an asymmetric dimer”, last paragraph) and state in the following section, when discussing solution-based studies, that the dimer is likely not asymmetric from a functional perspective in solution (subsection “The disruption of the dimerization interface enhances the activity of HUWE1 in vitro and in cells”, first paragraph; Discussion, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>5) There are some gaps in the p14ARF experiments that may require additional experiments. It is stated as &quot;data not shown&quot; that a region of p14ARF was identified that bound to HUWE1 (residues 43-75). It is further shown that a peptide corresponding to this region stabilized the dimeric form of a dimerization-competent HUWE1 construct, but had no effect on the isolated HUWE1. This implies that p14ARF, as well as the p14ARF peptide, binds to HUWE1 outside of the HECT domain, but this does not appear to have ever been tested, either here or in the literature. Given the reagents that the authors have in-hand, it seems that it would be very straight-forward to determine the binding site on HUWE1 for p14ARF.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion that we have followed up on with fluorescence polarization experiments using a fluorophor-labeled p14ARF-derived peptide and a series of HUWE1 constructs of different lengths (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). These experiments show, intriguingly, that the p14ARF-derived peptide interacts most tightly with the activation segment of HUWE1. The corresponding dissociation constants reside in the low μM range (3 to 7 µM). Residual binding is detected for constructs lacking the activation segment (230 – 340 µM) (subsection “The HUWE1-inhibitor p14ARF interacts with the activation segment and promotes oligomerization of HUWE1”, second paragraph).</p><p>Taking into account the results of our SEC studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) and activity assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>), we propose that p14ARF has a dual role in regulating HUWE1: By interacting with the activation segment, p14ARF may release this segment from the intramolecular engagement with the dimerization region, thus promoting dimer formation and shifting the conformational equilibrium towards the inhibited state. Additionally, p14ARF can inhibit the activity of HUWE1 through interactions with the HECT domain, at least in the context of truncated constructs lacking the activation segment. These data and conclusions have been added to the text (Discussion).</p><p><italic>Finally, as stated in the Discussion, tumor-associated mutations have been identified in HUWE1 that fall within the dimerization domain. The prediction is that these mutations might result in hyper-activation of HUWE1 by inhibiting formation of the dimer. This result would add significantly to the impact of the current paper and it seems that this could be tested with relatively little additional effort.</italic> </p><p>In response to this comment and to further interrogate the effects of cancer-associated mutations in HUWE1, we purified the mutated variant, H3962D, of HUWE1 (3951-4374) and subjected it to SEC-MALS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Consistent with the central position of His 3962 at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), we find that the dimerization capacity of the mutated protein variant is impaired. The effect is equally strong as the one seen for the mutated variants, I3969A and F3982A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), that we had selected based on the structure (subsection “Key contacts in the crystallographic dimer interface mediate the dimerization of HUWE1 in vitro and its self-association in cells”, sixth paragraph).</p><p>Since Ile 3969 happens to be a tumor-associated mutation site, as well, our study now provides evidence that two tumor-associated mutation sites in the dimerization region are, indeed, critical for dimer formation. Furthermore, we show that the mutated variants have enhanced activities in ubiquitination assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; subsection “The disruption of the dimerization interface enhances the activity of HUWE1 in 335 vitro and in cells”, first paragraph). We, therefore, speculate that there may be selective pressure, at least in some human tumors, to enhance the activity of HUWE1 (Discussion, eleventh paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
