struggle with a chemotherapeutic insult before succumbing to apoptosis is largely unknown. Here we use an integrated systems-level examination of transcription, translation, and proteolysis to understand these events central to cancer treatment. As a model we study myeloma cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a first-line therapy. Despite robust transcriptional changes, unbiased quantitative proteomics detects production of only a few critical anti-apoptotic proteins against a background of general translation inhibition. Simultaneous ribosome profiling further reveals potential translational regulation of stress response genes. Once the apoptotic machinery is engaged, degradation by caspases is largely independent of upstream bortezomib effects. Moreover, previously uncharacterized non-caspase proteolytic events also participate in cellular deconstruction. Our systems-level data also support co-targeting the anti-apoptotic regulator HSF1 to promote cell death by bortezomib. This integrated approach offers unique, in-depth insight into apoptotic dynamics that may prove important to preclinical evaluation of any anti-cancer compound.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01236.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01236.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01236.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many cancer treatments work by causing cancer cells to enter an advanced stage of a process known as programmed cell death or apoptosis. When a cell begins apoptosis, it takes a series of metabolic steps–such as fragmenting its DNA or reducing its volume–that eventually kills it. The cancer cells in tumours are able to grow because they are able to avoid apoptosis.</p><p>When cancer cells are treated with cytotoxic drugs they do not die immediately but try to stave off the effect of the drug. However, we still know relatively little about what happens at the molecular levels as cancer cells struggle to avoid apoptosis.</p><p>Now Wiita et al. have combined two methods for studying cancer cells–deep sequencing of RNA and quantitative proteomics–to simultaneously observe a variety of processes, including the transcription of genes to produce messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, the translation of these mRNA molecules to produce proteins, and the proteolysis (or breakdown) of these proteins when the cells were subjected to chemotherapy.</p><p>Wiita et al. studied how human myeloma cells responded to bortezomib, a drug that is used to treat various blood cancers, and found that ribosomes–the complex molecular machines that perform the translation step– reacted to the chemotherapy by preferentially translating certain mRNA molecules in order to produce a set of proteins that protect the cell. Developing drugs to inhibit the effects of these stress-response proteins could make the cancer cells more responsive to existing anticancer drugs. When this effort to stay alive is ultimately unsuccessful, the destruction of proteins appears surprisingly unrelated to the previous attempts that were made to protect the cell.</p><p>With further work the “global cellular response” approach developed by Wiita et al. could lead to the discovery of new drug targets, improve our understanding of drug resistance in chemotherapy, and provide new ways to monitor how patients respond to treatment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01236.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01236.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>ribosome profiling</kwd><kwd>caspase</kwd><kwd>myeloma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM081051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Post-Doctoral Fellowship (DRG 111-12)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wiita</surname><given-names>Arun P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The simultaneous monitoring of transcription, translational control, protein production and proteolysis in the same system can improve our understanding of how cancer cells respond to chemotherapy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most cytotoxic chemotherapeutics eliminate tumor cells by activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaufmann and Earnshaw, 2000</xref>). The final stages leading to mitochondrial pore formation and caspase activation have been well-described at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzalvez and Ashkenazi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spencer and Sorger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parrish et al., 2013</xref>). However, prior to these terminal stages of apoptosis, it is becoming clear that cells fight to resist the pharmacological insult in ways that appear unique to the treatment applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2010</xref>). Existing genome-wide studies of cellular response to chemotherapeutic treatment have primarily relied on changes at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lamb et al., 2006</xref>). Elegant single cell studies have tracked a subset of proteins in response to various chemotherapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2010</xref>). Recent work has identified hundreds of caspase cleavage substrates in apoptotic cells treated with chemotherapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimbo et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, each of these approaches only captures a segment of the functional reaction to a chemotherapeutic insult and does not tell the full story of how cancer responds to apoptosis-inducing drug treatment. It is known that cells undergoing apoptosis show strong suppression of protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushell et al., 2004</xref>). While a few specific transcripts are known to escape this translational suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spriggs et al., 2010</xref>), the general link between transcriptional and translational changes during apoptosis is not well understood. Furthermore, different chemotherapeutics produce distinct quantitative signatures of caspase cleavage substrates following apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimbo et al., 2012</xref>), and it is unclear how the cellular response to chemotherapy prior to apoptotic induction may influence the later deconstruction of cellular protein contents.</p><p>Here we examine in depth the response of a multiple myeloma cell culture line (MM1.S) exposed to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a clinically relevant model system. Multiple myeloma, one of the most common blood cancers, is an aggressive malignancy of clonal plasma cells. Proteasome inhibition has become an effective first-line therapy for this disease, though myeloma currently has no known cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lonial et al., 2011</xref>). We use a suite of emerging systems-level approaches to globally examine the dynamic interplay between transcription, translation, and proteolytic degradation during chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Via ribosome profiling, we identify preferential translation and translational regulation of genes expected to reduce unfolded protein stress after bortezomib treatment. Surprisingly, despite these changes in translational control, during rapid apoptosis only a few critical pro-survival proteins are detectably increased in proteomic studies. Furthermore, we find that cleavage patterns by both caspase and non-caspase proteases during apoptosis are largely independent of drug response at the transcriptional and translational level prior to cell death. We also use this integrated data to examine the potential of small molecule therapeutics to work in concert with bortezomib in myeloma. Such a global examination of how cells struggle at all levels with a chemotherapeutic insult provides important insights into mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and novel methods to assess tumor response to chemotherapy.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01236.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and paired mRNA-seq/ribosome profiling data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MM1.S cells were prepared in six separate flasks each containing 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells.

Deep sequencing of mRNA (mRNA-seq) examines the detailed transcriptional response of myeloma cells to bortezomib-induced stress. We pair this data with ribosome profiling, the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments during active translation; this approach offers significant insight into proteome dynamics and translational regulation not available by monitoring transcript expression alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>). To directly measure changes at the protein level after bortezomib perturbation, we use isobaric labeling by iTRAQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mertins et al., 2012</xref>) and tandem mass spectrometry to measure in an unbiased fashion the relative abundance of ∼2600 proteins. Finally, using enzymatically-driven labeling of free protein α-amines (N-terminomics) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahrus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agard et al., 2012</xref>), we develop a quantitative mass spectrometry assay to monitor to the relative kinetics of both caspase and non-caspase cleavage events during apoptotic cellular deconstruction. To begin, we prepared separate flasks of MM1.S cells and harvested cells at five time points after induction of apoptosis with 20 nM bortezomib. Similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimbo et al., 2012</xref>), caspase activity was first detected at 6 hr and the majority of cells were non-viable by 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). mRNA levels were also markedly decreased prior to loss of cell viability, as previously seen across a range of apoptotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Prete et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushell et al., 2004</xref>). Total RNA levels, primarily reflecting ribosomal RNA abundance, and total protein levels were relatively stable.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ribosome occupancy generally tracks with transcript production</title><p>To understand how myeloma cells were struggling after bortezomib exposure, we determined the relative changes in transcription and translation within the remaining mRNA pool at each time point. We normalized mRNA-seq and ribosome profiling sample using reads per kilobase million (RPKM) and focused our analysis on 5680 well-expressed transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We compared log<sub>2</sub> expression vs the untreated sample and organized the data using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. This approach allowed us to center on relative expression changes found in multiple independent samples. We generally found that changes in ribosome footprints tracked with changes in transcript abundance. The transcripts could be sub-divided into five clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Clusters ‘Upreg’ and ‘Downreg’ encompass transcripts that are generally increased or decreased, respectively, at both the level of mRNA and footprint reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Cluster ‘Stable’ includes transcripts that demonstrate very mild changes at both the mRNA and footprint level. We calculated the translational efficiency (TE) from the ratio of ribosome footprint to mRNA-seq read density for each transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>). This enabled us to characterize two other groups that are particularly interesting, Cluster ‘TE Up’ and ‘TE Down’. These groups showed little change in the level of mRNA, but large increases or decreases, respectively, in relative ribosome footprint density. This suggests that genes in these two clusters are regulated at the level of translation.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01236.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Translational efficiency (TE) during bortezomib-induced apoptosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Paired mRNA and ribosome footprint reads for <italic>HSPB1</italic> (Cluster Upreg) and <italic>HMGB1</italic> (Cluster Downreg) showing that protein translation generally tracks with transcript abundance.

The only known function of XBP1 is as a transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">Acosta-Alvear et al., 2007</xref>) without known direct effects on translation. Although we do see a slight increase in the active XBP1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), most downstream XBP1 targets do not respond by increases in mRNA abundance.

Notably, transcripts related to the ER transport machinery (including <italic>SEC61B</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) demonstrate 1.5- to 2-fold increases in translation vs transcription. Therefore, changes in translation of XBP1downstream targets may reflect the activity of a parallel UPR mechanism to favor adaptation to cellular stress.</p><p>Cluster TE Down includes many transcripts involved in the translational machinery itself, particularly ribosomal structural proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) of which the most significant pathway affected involved eIF2 signaling (p=2.35 × 10<sup>−17</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Others have shown that yeast responding to oxidative stress produce large increases in 5′ UTR translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerashchenko et al., 2012</xref>). A general decrease in 5′ UTR translation was also seen in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, we identified no overall trend toward altered 5′ UTR translation relative to CDS translation in our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, these frequency distributions are broad and some individual transcripts do have large changes in the relative translation of the 5′ UTR during apoptosis. We examined transcripts with &gt;twofold change in 5′ UTR translation relative to CDS translation when compared to untreated sample in at least three time points after drug exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). By χ<sup>2</sup> analysis, genes in Cluster Upreg were significantly over-represented among the 274 genes in the increased UTR translation group (p=0.033). Both Clusters Upreg and Downreg were over-represented among the 219 genes in the decreased UTR translation group (p=0.0006 and p=0.014, respectively). No other Clusters showed significant over- or under-representation.

There was significant overlap between the protein abundance range monitored both by ribosome profiling and iTRAQ proteomics, demonstrating that these two techniques are probing a similar portion of the proteome. We concentrated on 2572 of these proteins that also had corresponding mRNA and ribosome footprint data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). We noted a slight positive correlation (<italic>R</italic> = 0.27) between baseline transcript read density and number of peptides identified by iTRAQ proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Strikingly, for the vast majority of proteins there is no distinct change in relative protein abundance while large changes are observed in relative mRNA and footprint reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, we did find a subset of 12 proteins (0.47% of total) with &gt;50% increase in protein abundance across at least two time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The majority of these proteins show strong upregulation at the mRNA and footprint level and have potential functions mediating either the folding (<italic>HSPA1A, DNAJB1, BAG3, HSPB1, SERPINH1, CLU</italic>) or degradation (<italic>SQSTM1</italic>) of unfolded proteins. These proteins are key players in an anti-apoptotic response that reduce cellular stress after proteasome inhibition by bortezomib. Interestingly, we also find ferritin light chain (<italic>FTL</italic>) increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Another group has recently found that depleting ferritin light chain enhances myeloma cell sensitivity to bortezomib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campanella et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting it also plays an anti-apoptotic role here. Of note, we did not observe any distinct changes in relative 5′ UTR translation for the few proteins increased by iTRAQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To further validate the iTRAQ findings, we employed an orthogonal method of label-free, targeted, quantitative mass spectrometry termed Selected reaction monitoring (SRM). This method is analogous to Western blotting without the need for dozens of antibodies and potential improvement in performance characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maiolica et al., 2012</xref>). We prepared an independent biological time course of MM1.S cells treated with 20 nM bortezomib and isolated tryptic peptides from total cellular lysate. We tracked the relative abundance of one to three peptides from 152 proteins. The SRM peak area intensity data was compared to the iTRAQ reporter signal (e.g., in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>, respectively; heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Comparing across all time points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> we found a strong correlation between SRM and iTRAQ data (<italic>R</italic> = 0.80). For the few increased proteins the abundance changes detected by SRM are greater than those found by iTRAQ, which is consistent with the greater suppression of iTRAQ reporter ions often seen in complex samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ow et al., 2009</xref>). The label-free SRM data do not suffer from this same limitation and more likely reflect the true change in protein abundance. This independent MS assay confirms that only a small subset of proteins show measurable increases in abundance during apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Global translational shutdown during apoptosis</title><p>Our quantitative proteomic results are strongly consistent with polysome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) showing a significant decrease in translation well before any loss in cell viability.

During the UPR, it is well-known that phosphorylation of the initiation factor eIF2α by the ER-resident sensor kinase PERK is associated with general translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>).

Recently developed systems-level technologies, as we use here, enable genome-wide quantitative assessment of the efficiency for decoding of mRNA to protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vogel and Marcotte, 2012</xref>). In this apoptotic system, proteins are relatively stable due to several factors: at 20 nM bortezomib in MM1.S cells, proteasomal activity is almost completely inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berkers et al., 2005</xref>). The proteasome is also extensively cut by caspases leading to loss of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, we find that endoproteolysis during apoptosis cuts fewer than 20% of the proteins in the cell and often only once or twice per protein leading to stable domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dix et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahrus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawford et al., 2013</xref>). These domains would be indistinguishable from intact proteins by iTRAQ. Therefore, we expect that detectable protein degradation is extremely limited and changes by iTRAQ largely reflect protein production alone. In contrast, mRNAs with very different stabilities (steady-state half-lives on the order of minutes to hours) are rapidly degraded with similar kinetics under various apoptotic inducers even prior to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Prete et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Mass-action models, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, can describe the dynamic relationship between protein and mRNA but require absolute abundance measurements per cell. As described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</xref>), we used measurements of total mRNA combined with mRNA-seq read density to estimate the absolute abundance of each transcript per cell in untreated MM1.S cells. For absolute protein abundance we used a recently described method of label-free quantitation termed intensity based absolute quantitation (iBAQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</xref>). From untreated MM1.S cells we generated absolute abundance estimates for 3369 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Compared to baseline protein abundance, we found a slightly stronger correlation for footprint read density than mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that increased 5′ UTR translation at baseline may correlate with decreased steady-state protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall distributions of protein and mRNA copies per MM1.S cell, with a median of 11 transcript copies and ∼16,000 protein copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), were similar to those previously found in mouse NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We used these absolute abundance measurements to prepare an approximate quantitative model in our system.

This model describes the change in protein copies per cell as a function of transcript copies per cell, the rate of translation, and the rate of protein degradation. We analyzed a subset of 13 genes with transcriptional increase but non-uniform changes in protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).

During the early stages of apoptosis, the group of transcripts with multi-fold increases in relative abundance do not all lead to measurable protein increases. This is because the absolute number of these transcripts per cell in the sample remains fairly stable as transcription and mRNA degradation offset. This is illustrated by scaling the relative mRNA data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> by a factor reflecting global mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, the few proteins that are increased tend to demonstrate increases in absolute transcript level at later time points. Our model further shows that with the same fold-increase in transcript level, proteins with low baseline abundance will have more dramatic increases in relative protein concentration when compared to proteins with high baseline abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Cellular struggle with chemotherapy does not affect apoptotic proteolysis</title><p>It is unknown how the cellular response to chemotherapeutic treatment influences cellular deconstruction by proteases during apoptosis, including both caspase and non-caspase proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pop and Salvesen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moffitt et al., 2010</xref>).

We included both non-caspase and caspase-cleaved peptides in our SRM assay with a preference for those found in multiple experiments under apoptotic conditions. Interestingly, many of the chaperone and co-chaperone proteins, relatively increased at the transcriptional and translational levels, had only non-caspase proteolytic peptides identified in the DegraBase.

Here, we also monitored the kinetics of appearance of non-caspase proteolytic events during apoptosis. We tracked 163 caspase-cleaved peptides (D at P1) and 89 peptides derived from non-caspase proteolysis. The list includes 52 proteins that were cleaved by both caspase- and non-caspase proteases to examine the relative kinetics of different proteolytic events in the same substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to rank the rates of proteolytic cleavage events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We defined five broad groups ranging from the Fastest cleavages, with robust substrate appearance at 6 hr, to Slowest/No Change, with no increase in cleavage even at late apoptosis. Interestingly, the large majority of non-caspase-cleaved substrates appear in the Slow and Slowest/No Change groups. While this only represents a small portion of the &gt;3,000 non-caspase endoproteolytic cleavages in the DegraBase, this finding suggests that most non-caspase proteolytic events in apoptotic cells are a consequence of and not a driver of apoptosis itself.</p><p>However, we did find 16 non-caspase-cleaved peptides appearing in either the Fastest, Faster, or Mid categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Of the 89 non-caspase peptides monitored, 24 were tryptic-like (K or R at P1). Yet none of the 16 most rapidly cleaved peptides had a tryptic-like cleavage and only one has been previously annotated in MEROPS, the largest current database of proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawlings et al., 2012</xref>). These 16 peptides were cleaved with kinetics similar to caspases, suggesting that they may play roles in driving apoptosis. Among these we noted a relative preponderance of Pro (3 peptides), Gln (4 peptides), and Glu (4 peptides) residues at the P1 site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). While caspases may occasionally cleave at Glu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krippner-Heidenreich et al., 2001</xref>), none of the other classic proteases thought to be active during MM1.S cell apoptosis, including the cathepsins or calpains, have a preference for Pro, Gln, or Glu at the P1 site (as described in MEROPS).

We thus hypothesized that by inhibiting these ‘first responders’ to the chemotherapeutic treatment we may be able to drive the malignant cell toward apoptosis and reduce therapeutic resistance. To this end we identified the most prominent upstream regulators of the genes in Cluster Upreg (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These include NRF2, a transcription factor regulating the hypoxic response; HSF1, a transcription factor regulating the heat shock response; and PERK, the ER-resident kinase.

Our results show how myeloma cells initially struggle to adapt to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. A general inhibition of translation coupled with mRNA degradation leads to surprisingly little change in overall protein levels despite relative transcriptional increases in many genes. Furthermore, global protein levels are maintained due to inhibition of proteasomal activity by bortezomib and extensive cleavage of proteasomal subunits by caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2010</xref>). The cell also modulates translational control of stress responsive proteins related to bortezomib treatment. Co-targeting key regulators of these processes such as HSF1 and PERK can further accelerate apoptosis. Myeloma cells ultimately succumb to the pharmacologic insult, leading to activation of the caspases as well as one or more non-caspase proteases that have yet to be characterized. While pieces of this story have been told by other experiments, the approach we present here, examining the integrated regulation of the transcriptional, translational, and proteolytic machinery, gives a global and in-depth view of the apoptotic process.</p><p>Translational regulation during apoptosis has only been examined in a limited context. Bushell and coworkers examined the relative changes in translational efficiency during early TRAIL-induced apoptosis by polysome profiling (microarray analysis of mRNA associated with translating ribosomes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bushell et al., 2006</xref>). Genes with the greatest degree of decrease in TE included many translation-related proteins, similar to our findings. Those with the largest increase, however, did not overlap with our results, suggesting that positive changes in TE may be specific to the apoptotic inducer or induction of the intrinsic vs extrinsic apoptotic pathways.</p><p>Importantly, after proteasomal inhibition in myeloma cells we found that translational reprogramming favors proteins which help the cell adapt to unfolded protein stress. Possible mechanisms for the alteration of translation efficiency involve preferential translation via internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bushell et al., 2006</xref>), partitioning of transcripts toward ER-bound ribosomes under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reid and Nicchitta, 2012</xref>), or other uncharacterized regulatory programs governing ribosomal-transcript association. We also identified uORF translation in genes related to the ER stress response, <italic>TXNIP</italic>, <italic>PPP1R15B</italic>, and <italic>DDIT3</italic> (REDD1), that had not previously been characterized. The exact interplay of uORF and CDS translation for these genes remains to be investigated, but it is possible there is a regulatory function similar to that already known for ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34. We also found that differential 5′ UTR translation appears common in the cellular response to bortezomib but relates variably to increased CDS translation. It will be interesting to compare the effects on translation regulation in different cell types exposed to chemotherapeutics with different mechanisms of action to find whether these changes are unique to bortezomib. Incorporation of translation initiation inhibitors in ribosome profiling and paired-end reads in mRNA-seq can also provide novel insight into translation regulation through generation of custom proteomic databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menschaert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sheynkman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that eIF2α phosphorylation did not play a major role in translation inhibition in this apoptotic system involving the UPR. Others have also observed decreased eIF2α phosphorylation in MM1.S cells after proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parlati et al., 2009</xref>). However, eIF2α phosphorylation is thought to be necessary for increased ATF4 translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2004</xref>). The mechanism leading to the induction of ATF4 in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) is therefore unclear, but may relate to translation of the additional uORF we identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Our paired transcriptomic and proteomic data stands in stark contrast to studies of heat and osmolar shock in yeast, where increases at the transcript level are well-correlated with increases in protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lackner et al., 2012</xref>). We used a quantitative model incorporating global mRNA degradation to explain this contrast with non-apoptotic systems. While our proteomic analysis is quite extensive, this mass-action model suggests that low abundance proteins not detected by MS, such as CHOP or XBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), are more likely to be increased in relative protein abundance after transcriptional changes. Future advances in proteomic techniques may allow us to detect more biologically relevant protein changes. The mass-action model also suggests the kinetics of protein production from mRNA transcripts largely governs protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</xref>). In a system undergoing less rapid apoptosis, such as those explored at the single cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2010</xref>), there may be greater opportunity for proteins to accumulate and reveal relationships between ribosome footprint occupancy and protein production.</p><p>Previous work showed that caspase substrates were largely conserved at the identification level after different chemotherapeutic treatments, though different quantitative signatures of caspase proteolysis could be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimbo et al., 2012</xref>). Here we find that in the setting of rapid apoptosis, proteins with changes at the transcriptional and translational level do not appear to be targeted more efficiently by proteases during apoptosis. Under conditions of more prolonged apoptosis, however, changes in the proteome may influence the appearance of proteolytic substrates and this remains to be investigated. Furthermore, our identification of non-caspase proteolytic events occurring with similar kinetics to caspase cleavage suggests other proteases are being activated during apoptosis. The biological role of these proteases during apoptosis awaits exploration.</p><p>Based on our systems-level analyses, we identified potential small molecules which may be effective in combination with bortezomib in myeloma therapy. Inhibition of HSF1 and PERK have also recently been proposed by others as promising therapeutic targets in myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heimberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkins et al., 2013</xref>) and represents a proof of principle for our approach. Our deep sequencing and proteomic results suggest in particular that the combination of bortezomib with HSF1 inhibition could be beneficial in myeloma therapy.</p><p>We hypothesize that using a similar systems-based approach with less well-studied therapeutics will reveal novel means by which cells attempt to evade apoptosis, not just at the transcriptional level but also at the translational and post-translational levels. This analysis will likely complement information gained by genome-wide RNA knockdown approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). By targeting these early response pathways identified at multiple systems levels cancer cell death can be maximized and resistance avoided. Furthermore, changes in specific proteins revealed by these analyses may be monitored after treatment to establish novel biomarkers of chemotherapeutic efficacy or drug resistance. We anticipate that integrated, systems-level approaches, such as that presented here, will help to form the future basis of evaluating preclinical chemotherapeutic effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and drug treatment</title><p>MM1.S cells (obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were grown in suspension to 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in RPMI-1640 media with 10% FBS.

Protein copies at 0 hr was varied a maximum of 10% from the measured protein copies per cell by iBAQ. <italic>k</italic><sub>dp</sub> was assumed to be relatively constant for all proteins in the background of proteasomal blockade by bortezomib. We only varied the range between 0.010–0.015 hr<sup>−1</sup>, similar to the corresponding average protein half-life found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwanhausser et al. (2011)</xref>. Therefore, we primarily varied the translation rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>sp</sub> in order to fit this model to the protein data. We performed the fits by manually minimizing the least-squares difference between model fit and protein data in Mathematica. We found that the model could indeed well-describe the protein data; in addition, the fit <italic>k</italic><sub>sp</sub> parameter ranged from 10 to 270 proteins/transcript/hr, consistent with the range in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwanhausser et al. (2011)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>SRM assay for degradomics</title><p>As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimbo et al. (2012)</xref>, cell pellets were lysed by sonication in 4.0% SDS, 400 mM Bicine (pH8.0), and supplemented with protease inhibitors 0.1 mM z-VAD-fmk, 0.1 mM E-64, 1 mM AEBSF, 1 mM PMSF, and 5 mM EDTA. Spike-in internal standards were added to each sample after lysis: 50 µg each of bovine catalase and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma). Proteins were reduced by TCEP, cysteines alklyated by iodoacetamide, and free N-termini biotinylated via the reaction of TEVest4 ester and subtiligase enzyme as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimbo et al., 2012</xref>). Biotinylated peptides were precipitated, resuspended in 5.3 M Guanidine HCl and captured on NeutraAvidin agarose beads (Thermo). The beads were extensively washed in 5 M Guanidine HCl followed by on-bead trypsin digestion overnight at room temperature with agitation. As previously described, captured peptides were released from beads by incubation with TEV protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimbo et al., 2012</xref>). Peptides were desalted using C<sub>18</sub> ZipTips (Millipore), evaporated to dryness, and stored at −80°C for analysis.</p><p>SRM assays were developed in a similar manner as described above, again using SkyLine software. In this case, however, targeted parent/fragment ion transitions were extracted from MS/MS spectra in the DegraBase. This publicly available database lists N-terminally labeled peptides found in human cell culture under both apoptotic and non-apoptotic conditions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wellslab.ucsf.edu/degrabase">wellslab.ucsf.edu/degrabase</ext-link>). <italic>b</italic>-ion fragment <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> was modified as necessary to reflect the Abu- tag at the N-terminus of the peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimbo et al., 2012</xref>). We initially chose 400 peptides for development of targeted SRM assays in SkyLine. We used the same chromatography and instrument settings as described for the earlier SRM assays. We initially examined seven transitions per peptide; we moved forward with peptides with a minimum of five co-eluting transitions and a retention time within 7 min of that predicted based on the peptide retention time prediction algorithm (SSRCalc 3.0) implemented in SkyLine. Ultimately, we included 252 proteolytic peptides in the final SRM assay.</p><p>We corrected samples for labeling efficiency and overall peptide concentration using five proteolytic peptides derived from the spike-in standards. Corrected peptide intensities were averaged across duplicate injections at each time point in the 20 nM bortezomib time course. These mean intensity values were used for analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>APW, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>EZ, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>PJW, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>OJ, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>AU, Conception and design, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>ALB, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>JSW, Conception and design, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>JAW, Conception and design, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec sec-type="datasets"><title>Major dataset</title><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><related-object content-type="generated-dataset" document-id="Dataset ID and/or url" document-id-type="dataset" document-type="data" id="dataro1"><name><surname>Wiita</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ziv</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wiita</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Urisman</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Julien</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Burlingame</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name>, <etal/>, <year>2013</year><x>, </x><source>Global response to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis</source><x>, </x><object-id pub-id-type="art-access-id">GSE48785</object-id><x>; </x><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48785">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48785</ext-link><x>, </x><comment>Publicly available at GEO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>).</comment></related-object></p></sec></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1a"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Acosta-Alvear</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Blais</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsikitis</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lents</surname><given-names>NH</given-names></name><name><surname>Arias</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>2007</year><article-title>XBP1 controls diverse cell type- and condition-specific transcriptional regulatory networks</article-title><source>Mol Cell</source><volume>27</volume><fpage>53</fpage><lpage>66</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.molcel.2007.06.011</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agard</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Mahrus</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Trinidad</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Lynn</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Burlingame</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name></person-group><year>2012</year><article-title>Global kinetic analysis of proteolysis via quantitative targeted proteomics</article-title><source>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA</source><volume>109</volume><fpage>1913</fpage><lpage>1918</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1073/pnas.1117158109</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aronson</surname><given-names>LI</given-names></name><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>FE</given-names></name></person-group><year>2012</year><article-title>DangER: protein ovERload.

Ribosome profiling gives protein production.

For instance, some proteins may be found at a lower level than predicted by the ribosome profiling. Are these proteins that are targeted for degradation</italic>?</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the astute comment. It is absolutely true that the iTRAQ data reflects overall protein levels and, in general, not synthesis alone. In our experimental system, however, treatment with a high dose of bortezomib effectively blocks proteasomal degradation in this system. Bortezomib’s IC<sub>50</sub> for proteasome inhibition in MM1.S cells is known to be ∼5 nM (Chauhan D et al., <italic>Cancer Cell</italic> (2005) 8, 407) and the 20 nM dose has previously been shown to lead to essentially complete proteasomal blockade (Berkers CR et al., <italic>Nat Methods</italic> (2005) 2, 357). Conversely, other endoproteases (such as caspases) appear to cleave protein substrates in a limited number of sites generating large protein fragments (Crawford et al. <italic>Mol Cell Proteomics</italic> (2013) 12, 813; Dix et al <italic>Cell</italic> (2008) 134, 679; Mahrus et al. <italic>Cell</italic> (2008), 134, 866). In the absence of proteasomal activity, these fragments would be expected to remain stable in the cell as large polypeptides (whether retaining any function or not). By iTRAQ mass spectrometry, based on trypsinization of the total protein sample, these proteolytically cleaved fragments would be indistinguishable from intact proteins. As a result iTRAQ provides no information on caspase (or non-caspase) proteolysis which does not degrade proteins below the domain level. Therefore, in this system we believe that degradation as measured by iTRAQ would both be close to zero for all proteins, and relative iTRAQ data across time points largely reflects protein production.</p><p>To clarify this point we have changed the line referred to by the reviewer to “changes in protein levels during bortezomib-induced apoptosis”. We have also modified another statement to state “at 20 nM bortezomib in MM1.S cells, proteasomal activity is almost completely inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berkers et al., 2005</xref>)” and added a statement later in the same paragraph: “These domains would be indistinguishable from intact proteins by iTRAQ. Therefore, we expect that protein degradation detectable by iTRAQ is extremely limited and changes by iTRAQ largely reflect protein production alone.”</p><p>The reviewer further makes an excellent point that ribosome profiling data could be used as a predictor for protein production. One could subsequently examine discrepancies between predicted protein production and that detected by proteomics. For the quantitative model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the ribosome profiling data is implicitly included as none of the genes analyzed had large changes in translational efficiency. Hence, any protein changes predicted by ribosome profiling would be equivalent to changes predicated by mRNA-seq data. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4</xref>, this model well-describes the analyzed genes and does not lead to any notable discrepancies.</p><p>However, a different and interesting question is inferring protein abundance changes directly from ribosome profiling data (i.e., X number of increased ribosome footprints = Y number of new proteins). We previously attempted to incorporate this analysis as another element of our quantitative model, but theoretical studies suggest that the predicted protein output of a transcript is not a straightforward function of measured ribosome footprint read density (Tuller T. et al. <italic>Cell</italic> (2010) 141, 344; Cannarozzi G. et al. <italic>Cell</italic> (2010) 141, 355). In our current study under conditions of rapid apoptosis, we were unable to test or develop any new predictions for converting ribosome occupancy to protein synthesis as so few proteins show detectable changes in iTRAQ data.</p><p><italic>2) The authors devote a section to changes in 5'UTR reads. However, they don’t define what these 5'UTR reads correspond to. I think they correspond to uORFs and unconventional in-frame start sites upstream of the canonical ATG. If these are the only two types of 5'UTRs, it seems that these should be analyzed separately since they might have different forms of regulation</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that footprint reads present in 5’ UTRs could apply to either translated upstream open reading frames (uORFs) generating short polypeptides separate from the coding sequence or N-terminal extensions leading to different isoforms of the canonical protein. Indeed we did not clearly define this in the main text. As we mention in the text, stalling translation initiation complexes with the drugs harringtonine or lactimidomycin is necessary to definitively identify start sites. Using the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide, as we do here, we cannot readily define these different types of 5’ UTR translation across all transcripts and we therefore must analyze them together. However, to the reviewer’s point, we have added a line to the text stating that “Ribosome occupancy in this region may indicate translation of short regulatory polypeptides in upstream open reading frames (uORFs) or alternate production of N-terminal isoforms of canonically translated proteins...” In the few cases we examine in detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig3s1 fig3s2 fig3s3">Figure 3 and supplements</xref>), we characterize these as uORFs because all of the analyzed translation products, whether in-frame or out of frame, have a stop codon prior to the canonical coding sequence; N-terminal extensions would both be in-frame with the canonical coding sequence and have no intervening stop codon.</p><p><italic>3) Along the lines of the 5'UTR reads: It seems to me that the model is that increased 5'UTR reads might lead to lower CDS reads, and thereby contribute to the overall protein translation level seen by ribosome profiling and overall expression level seen by iTRAQ. But, this doesn’t seem to be bioinformatically tested. It seems that the 5'UTR reads are analyzed without seeing how these are influencing overall protein levels</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion to integrate our 5’ UTR analysis with proteomic data. We point out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> that our current analysis compares the ratio of read density in the 5’ UTR to the protein coding sequence (CDS) across the time course. We did not see a strong relationship between changes in UTR translation affecting CDS translation. In support of our result, Geraschenko et al. (<italic>PNAS</italic> (2012) 109, 17394) noted large increases in 5’ UTR translation in yeast after oxidative stress but noted a similarly complex relationship to translation of the protein coding sequence. So from this analysis it does not appear that increased 5’ UTR translation always leads to decreased CDS translation.</p><p>To further explore this idea, we have performed two additional pieces of analysis. We first compared whether relative 5’ UTR translation in untreated cells shows a relationship to steady-state protein abundance by iBAQ. In this analysis, incorporating 2266 genes with 5’ UTR reads and iBAQ data, we visually observe a negative relationship: genes with high levels of relative 5’ UTR to CDS translation appear to show lower levels of protein abundance (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2D</xref>; new source data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5–source data 1</xref>). However, statistical analysis demonstrates a non-significant negative correlation (Pearson <italic>R</italic> = -.02, <italic>p</italic> = 0.35). Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that increased 5’ UTR translation at baseline leads to lower protein abundance. We have now included a statement: “Interestingly, we also found that increased 5’ UTR translation at baseline may correlate with decreased steady-state protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–supplementary figure 2D</xref>).”</p><p>We further examined the changes in relative 5’ UTR read density across the few proteins that are found to be increased by iTRAQ analysis across a time course. We also compared these results to a set of genes with increased read density at the mRNA and ribosome footprint data but no detected change by iTRAQ (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>). The 5’ UTR to CDS read density remained relatively constant for all genes across the time course. We did not, for instance, note consistent decreases in 5’ UTR translation in the genes with increased protein abundance. Instead, this ratio showed little divergence from the value at 0h, consistent with our analysis of all genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. However, as mentioned above, this analysis is necessarily limited by the very few proteins for which we saw abundance changes by iTRAQ. We have added a statement: “Of note, we did not observe any distinct changes in relative 5’ UTR translation for the few proteins increased by iTRAQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>).”</p><p><italic>4) I am not sure if I can tell if the N-terminalomic data gives insights into whether the cleavage events are rare or at a high stoichiometry. Perhaps the authors can comment on this. It seems to me that the authors could extrapolate the important proteolytic cleavage events by looking at the ribosome profiling and iTRAQ datasets (as discussed in point 1 above) to possibly address this issue</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that the N-terminomic data over a time course, while providing useful information on relative substrate cleavage, does not determine the absolute amount of substrate cleavage relative to the total protein present. As mentioned above in the response to point 1, the iTRAQ data unfortunately also does not offer much insight into protein degradation in this system. This is further evidenced by the fact that so few proteins show signatures of decreased abundance by iTRAQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) whereas many appear to be proteolytically cleaved by SRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We gain some insight into stoichiometry based on Western blotting results (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> for PERK and 4E-BP1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1– figure supplement 2</xref> for XIAP and ATF-4), suggesting that peptides which show strong proteolytic cleavage by SRM indicate ∼50 to &gt;90% of total protein cleaved. This extent of cleavage has also been seen by Western blotting in our prior studies incorporating SRM (Agard NJ et al. <italic>PNAS</italic> (2012) 109, 1913; Shimbo K et al <italic>PNAS</italic> (2012) 109, 12432).</p><p>Response to Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>Since this study represents a comprehensive and integrative -omics story, and viewing the fact that RNA-Seq and proteomics data from the same model system was obtained, the creation of a customized database could have been considered for the comprehensive identification/discovery of database non-annotated peptides (i.e., splice-junction peptides, products of uORF translation, translation at near-cognate start codons, ...).

We are aware of the references cited but unfortunately our current data does not lend itself to similar analysis as we cannot definitively identify uORF and alternate start sites in our data, as discussed above. In addition, regarding prediction of splice-junction peptides, these data are greatly informed by the use of long reads and paired-end mRNA-seq to enhance alignment across splice junctions. Our data are currently composed of short reads (50 bp) and single-end sequencing which cannot lead to as comprehensive or accurate splice junction assignment. Therefore, we do not believe that our current data set is appropriate for the creation of such a reference database, though it is clear that such databases are certainly important. We have added a comment to the Discussion relevant to the reviewer’s point: “Incorporation of translation initiation inhibitors in ribosome profiling and paired-end reads in mRNA-seq can also provide novel insight into translation regulation through generation of custom proteomic databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menschaert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sheynkman et al., 2013</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
