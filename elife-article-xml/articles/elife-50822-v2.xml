At the cellular level, this entails each neuron adopting a specific wiring pattern, the combination of specific synaptic inputs and outputs. In invertebrates, stereotypical wiring patterns are genetically encoded in the programs regulating the development of neurons. Much of the specificity of inputs and outputs of neurons in the mammalian CNS is also genetically determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Vast numbers of neurites from a diversity of neurons are intermingled within the developing central nervous system, and they form highly specific synaptic connections with a discrete subset of the neurons they contact. Studies in both vertebrates and invertebrates have led to the identification of cell surface proteins (CSPs) that mediate selective association between neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Wit and Ghosh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zinn and Özkan, 2017</xref>). Gain and loss of function genetic studies have shown that combinations of different CSP families regulate this specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zarin et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, neuronal subtypes express highly diverse repertoires of CSPs during circuit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sarin et al., 2018</xref>). Conserved regulatory strategies involving combinations of transcription factors (TFs) establish unique neuronal identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan and Thor, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Enriquez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hobert, 2016</xref>). However, the programs regulating expression of CSPs for specific neuronal wiring features are still poorly understood.</p><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) provides an unsupervised approach to uncover the genetic programs underlying specific wiring features by exploring subtype-specific transcriptomes during development. As neuronal subtypes exhibit differences in characteristics other than wiring patterns, the relationship between genes and wiring specificity may be obscured by genes contributing to other aspects of neuronal diversity. Therefore, sets of closely related neurons with highly specific differences in wiring patterns are ideally suited to uncover the genetic programs specific to wiring. Here, we explore the genetic logic underlying synaptic specificity in one such set of neurons: T4/T5 neurons of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual motion detection pathway. We envision that our findings in this system will provide insights into the genetic logic of wiring specificity more broadly in both vertebrate and invertebrate systems.</p><p>T4/T5 neurons share a common developmental origin, physiological function, and general morphology, but differ in their precise wiring patterns and preferred stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apitz and Salecker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pinto-Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>). There are eight morphological subtypes of T4/T5 neurons in each column of the lobula plate (LoP) neuropil (see below), comprising the most abundant cell type in the fly visual system. These subtypes can be classified into two quartets of subtypes based on dendritic inputs: the four T4 subtypes share a common set of dendritic inputs in the medulla, and the four T5 subtypes share a different set of dendritic inputs in the lobula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). T4 neurons respond to ON stimuli (i.e. bright edges moving against a dark background) and T5 to OFF stimuli (i.e. dark edges moving across a bright background). T4/T5 neurons can also be classified into four pairs of subtypes (a-d) based on the location of their axon terminals within a given column in layers a-d of the LoP. Each pair responds selectively to visual motion in one of four cardinal directions: posterior, anterior, upwards, and downwards, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Although transcriptional profiling of the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain revealed a common transcriptional signature for all T4/T5 neurons, genetic programs for individual subtypes have not been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Konstantinides et al., 2018</xref>). We hypothesized that identification of gene expression programs for individual T4/T5 subtypes during circuit assembly would provide insight into the genetic programs regulating discrete wiring features.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50822.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single-cell sequencing reveals eight transcriptionally distinct populations of T4/T5 neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Common morphology of a T4/T5 neuron, with axon and dendrite wiring pattern variations in parentheses.

Sequencing was performed at 48 hr after puparium formation (APF). This developmental time point precedes a period of widespread synaptogenesis in the visual system, and coincides with the appearance of four discrete synaptic layers (a, b, c, d) in the LoP neuropil. Neurons were purified from dissected optic lobes by FACS using a transgenic line with nuclear GFP selectively expressed in all T4/T5 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). RNA-Seq libraries were generated using 10X Chromium technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) and sequenced to a mean depth of 92,000 reads per cell. In total, we profiled 3894 cells with a median of 1633 genes and 4389 transcripts captured per cell. After quality control and removal of outlier cells, our final dataset consisted of 3557 cells with 1000–2000 genes per cell.</p><p>We applied independent component analysis (ICA) followed by a graph-based clustering method to separate transcriptionally distinct cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>). Unsupervised analysis revealed eight clusters of approximately equal numbers of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that each cluster corresponded to a single T4/T5 subtype.</p><p>To identify genes preferentially expressed in T4/T5 subtypes, we performed differential gene expression analysis between each of the eight individual clusters and all other cells in the dataset (i.e. ‘one versus all,’ see Materials and methods). This revealed 69 genes which were strongly expressed in some clusters and not in others. Cluster-enriched genes, however, were not specific to single clusters. By contrast, for instance, each of the five subtypes of lamina neurons is defined by at least one subtype-type specific transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, while T4/T5 subtypes separated into eight transcriptionally distinct clusters, they were not defined by unique molecular markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Eight T4/T5 transcriptional clusters are separated by three primary axes of transcriptional diversity</title><p>The absence of unique markers for individual subtypes suggested that they were instead defined by unique combinations of genes.

Intriguingly, three independent components (ICs) each split the eight T4/T5 clusters into two groups of four, each in a different way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

A unique attribute of T4/T5 neurons is that the same dendritic and axonal wiring patterns are reiteratively used among different subtypes; each neuron can be described by a unique combination of one of four types of axonal outputs and one of two types of dendritic inputs.

Together with previous results, our findings suggest that the lamination of T4/T5 axonal outputs occurs via two distinct processes, each controlled by a separate TF. Binary expression of <italic>bi</italic> is required for lamination of the broad a/b from c/d LoP domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apitz and Salecker, 2018</xref>), whereas binary expression of <italic>grn</italic> is required for sublamination of each of these two domains into separate LoP layers.

Remarkably, despite divergent developmental trajectories separated by multiple divisions and distinct progenitor pools, all T4 and all T5 subtypes converge onto the same transcriptional programs associated with two types of dendritic inputs.

They focus upon the T4/T5 neurons of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system, and perform scRNA-seq upon FACS-purified cells. They find that T4/T5 neurons belong to eight major sub-types, and identify TF and CSP signatures for these groups. They functionally address the role of one TF, <italic>grn</italic>, and find that it controls a particular feature of the sub-types expressing this TF. Another TF with sub-type defining expression, bi, was addressed in a previously published study. The authors propose a model whereby TF codes, rather than single TFs, govern CSP codes, to thereby govern neuronal morphology. This general notion has been around for quite some time, but detailed examples of precise players and pathways have been frustratingly slow to emerge. Hence, progress in this area is of great importance to the field of developmental neurobiology.</p><p>Major Concerns:</p><p>1) It would be valuable to separately show what the TF and CSP codes are for each of the eight sub-types. More specifically, it is unclear to this reviewer what the TF codes are for the eight sub-types of T4/T5 neurons. They discuss bi, <italic>grn</italic> and TfAP-2, and briefly mention some others, but what are the complete TFs codes for each sub-type? Most of the data depict a mix of DEG, CSPs and TFs.

We have expanded the description and most importantly included three new figures (Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplements 1 and 2) to emphasize this modularity. We also include expression patterns of TFs that were shown to distinguish T4/T5s from other neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (Davie et al., 2018; Konstantinides et al., 2018), or have been shown to regulate common T4/T5 morphology (Contreras et al., 2018; Schilling et al., 2019). We show that these TFs represent a common regulatory program for all T4/T5 neurons. Modular assembly of feature-specific TF patterns overlying this common T4/T5 program generates each T4/T5 subtype. These TF codes are stable and define each subtype at both 24h and 48h APF (Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><p>CSP patterns expressed by each subtype are more complex and dynamic than the pattern of transcription factors. We now include a supplementary figure with summary of expression patterns of all subtype-enriched CSPs with cell adhesion domains at both 24h and 48h APF (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). As with the TFs, the combinations of CSPs are also largely expressed in modular fashion across subtypes with shared wiring features. While the contents of Figure 7 and its supplementary figures partially overlap with data presented in other figures, we believe this overlap will provide a clearer summary of modular transcriptional program we have uncovered.</p><p>Minor Concerns:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Can the authors also conduct RNAi of TfAP-2 and/or other TFs that they believe may specify T4/T5 sub-types to confirm some aspect of functional significance. This would be a substantive addition to the manuscript, elevating significance and impact, and they authors may likely have some of this data already in place?</p></disp-quote><p>A small number of TFs can define all eight individual T4/T5 subtypes: <italic>bi, grn</italic>, and <italic>TfAP-2</italic>. Here we have shown that <italic>grn</italic> completes a modular TF code that defines and directs axon targeting to all four LoP layers. We have also performed RNAi of the only remaining TF, <italic>TfAP-2</italic>, with multiple lines and did not observe significant knockdown of the protein (or targeting defects). Therefore, the role of <italic>TfAP-2</italic> in T4/T5 neurons currently remains inconclusive, and hence was omitted from our article. We have also found that removing <italic>acj6</italic>, a transcription factor common to all eight T4/T5 neurons, leads to massive disruption in the wiring patterns, including most importantly a complete loss of the four layers of axon terminals in the lobula plate. As subtype specification is the message in this paper, we do not think it is relevant to include these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is difficult to understand if the grn LOF and GOF phenotype, and the previously published bi phenotype, fits with a combinatorial model for T4/T5 sub-type cell fate specification. Could the authors discuss this issue?</p></disp-quote><p>In this study we were able to dissect the combinatorial TF code into modular regulatory programs, and show how separate TFs can independently control distinct features of neural identity. Through unsupervised analysis, we were able to identify and link separate TFs to specific features of T4/T5 morphology (Figure 7). We have now expanded on how our phenotypes reflect modular control of wiring features in the Discussion.</p><p>Our results demonstrate a highly specific role of <italic>grn</italic> in axon targeting, supporting our hypothesis that separable transcriptional modules control discrete wiring features in T4/T5 subtypes, the primary conclusion of our paper. Here <italic>grn</italic> controls the development of “b/c”-subtype targeting, independently from axon targeting to the broad a/b and c/d LoP domains, and from dendrite targeting to M10 and Lo1. Both loss and gain of function <italic>grn</italic> reduce the number of targeting layer specificities from four to two in a predictable way. Together with earlier work on <italic>bi</italic>, which controls targeting to a/b versus c/d LoP domains (Apitz and Salecker, 2018), we have thus defined a complete modular TF code for T4/T5 axon targeting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 6: They use UAS-p35 to suppress the apoptosis triggered by grn overexpression, and could observe a similar phenotype even with apoptosis suppressed. Can they use the same approach to suppress apoptosis in grn RNAi, to see if this phenotype is also independent of apoptosis?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this would be an excellent addition to our experiments. These experiments rely on multiple transgenes. While the location of the transgenes was compatible with the rescue of the death seen in the gain of function phenotype, it is not compatible with the loss of function. In short, three transgenes required for this experiment are inserted into the same chromosomal site in an autosome. While this is compatible for experiments requiring two of these (i.e. as it is for the rescue of the gain of function), it is not for the rescue of the RNAi loss of function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) When describing the T4/T5 neurons maybe they could elaborate more regarding the numbers of these neurons, and previous predictions of sub-types, based upon gene expression and morphology.</p></disp-quote><p>We have elaborated on numbers of T4/T5 neurons and references to previous sequencing efforts. In these studies, separate transcriptional programs for the eight individual morphological subtypes were not identified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) How does the 24h APF and 48h APF time-point used for scRNA-seq relate to when the T4/T5 neurons are born?</p></disp-quote><p>Neurogenesis of T4/T5 neurons occur early in late larval and early pupal stages of development (Pinto-Teixeira et al. 2018). By 24h APF all T4 and T5 neurons have already acquired their general morphologies, with incipient dendrites in medulla layer M10 and Lobula layer 1, respectively, and T4/T5 axon terminals in the LoP neuropil. At this stage, two layers are visible in the lobula. By 48h APF axon terminals sublaminate into four layers in LoP (Figure6-supplement 1) and the dendritic arbors are more complex. It is important to note that early stages of T4/T5 neurogenesis occurs as a wave giving rise to a gradient of neuronal maturation, similar to the generation of photoreceptors. At later stages, at least by 48h APF, development of T4 and T5 neurons appears to become synchronized in development.</p></body></sub-article></article>
