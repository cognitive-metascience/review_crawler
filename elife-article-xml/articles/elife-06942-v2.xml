We used DamID to establish a robust set of target genes for NKX2-5 wild type and disease associated NKX2-5 mutations to model loss-of-function in gene regulatory networks. NKX2-5 mutants, including those with a crippled homeodomain, bound hundreds of targets including NKX2-5 wild type targets and a unique set of &quot;off-targets&quot;, and retained partial functionality. NKXΔHD, which lacks the homeodomain completely, could heterodimerize with NKX2-5 wild type and its cofactors, including E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family members, through a tyrosine-rich homophilic interaction domain (YRD). Off-targets of NKX2-5 mutants, but not those of an NKX2-5 YRD mutant, showed overrepresentation of ETS binding sites and were occupied by ETS proteins, as determined by DamID. Analysis of kernel transcription factor and ETS targets show that ETS proteins are highly embedded within the cardiac gene regulatory network. Our study reveals binding and activities of NKX2-5 mutations on WT target and off-targets, guided by interactions with their normal cardiac and general cofactors, and suggest a novel type of gain-of-function in congenital heart disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06942.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06942.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06942.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many genes working within large gene networks influence the development of heart muscle cells in humans and other animals. The activity of these genes is controlled in part by proteins called transcription factors, which bind to DNA and act as molecular switches. One transcription factor that is particularly important for the development of heart muscle cells is called NKX2-5.</p><p>Mice lacking NKX2-5 have abnormal hearts and many humans who are born with congenital heart disease carry mutations in the gene that encodes this protein. Many of these mutations alter a section of the protein called the homeodomain, and therefore interfere with the ability of NKX2-5 to bind to DNA or associate with other important cardiac proteins called cofactors. However, it is not clear how such mutations alter the behaviour of NKX2-5 across all of its targets.</p><p>Bouveret et al. have now used a technique called ‘DNA adenine methyltransferase identification’ to study how NKX2-5 interacts with other proteins and DNA. The experiments found that, as expected, the mutant NKX2-5 proteins were unable to associate with many of the usual gene and protein targets of normal NKX2-5. However, the mutant proteins were still able to bind to some of their usual targets, plus many other targets that the normal NKX2-5 protein was not able to bind to.</p><p>A particular NKX2-5 mutant protein that the experiments analysed was missing the entire homeodomain, yet it was still able to associate with the normal NKX2-5 protein and bind to cofactors that help NKX2-5 to find its usual targets. This finding led Bouveret et al. to discover the role of a section of the NKX2-5 protein called the tyrosine-rich domain, which in the absence of the homeodomain can direct interactions of NKX2-5 with itself and its cofactors.</p><p>Bouveret et al.'s findings suggest that protein cofactors of NKX2-5 help mutant NKX2-5 proteins retain some of their normal activities, but also direct the mutant proteins to abnormal gene targets, which could contribute to congenital heart disease. The next steps are to carry out experiments in animals to confirm these findings, and to understand the activities of mutant NKX2-5 and other mutant transcription factors across the whole genome. This could lead to new therapeutic approaches to treat congenital heart disease and other conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

The cardiomyocyte GRN is controlled by lineage-restricted transcription factors (TFs), which interact to form a recursively wired sub-network termed the cardiac ‘kernel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson and Erwin, 2006</xref>). Kernel TFs, such as NKX2-5, GATA4, TBX5/20, and serum response factor (SRF), show regionally restricted expression and act as selector proteins that help define developmental and organ-specific territories. A well-studied kernel TF is NKX2-5, a member of the NK-2 homeodomain (HD) factor subclass that plays an early role in development of hearts and heart-like organs of diverse species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elliott et al., 2010</xref>). Loss of <italic>Nkx2-5</italic> in mice leads to arrested heart morphogenesis due to blocked progenitor growth, defective chamber and conduction system development, and a deranged GRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prall et al., 2007</xref>). In humans, NKX2-5 is one of the most commonly mutated single genes in congenital heart disease (CHD), with dominant alleles causing atrial septal defect and atrioventricular conduction block most commonly, and a host of more severe defects at lower penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elliott et al., 2010</xref>). Many CHD-causing NKX2-5 mutations are located within the conserved HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which serves as both a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain and protein-binding interface for interactions with other kernel TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elliott et al., 2010</xref>). It is widely assumed that CHD is caused by haploinsufficiency and an inability of mutant proteins to recognise target genes. However, we know little about disease causation at the genome level, and in fact, most CHD mutations lie outside of the HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), often in conserved domains with largely unknown functions.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06942.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) identifies a robust set of NKX2-5 targets in HL-1 cardiomyocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the human NKX2-5 protein (TN, tinman domain; NK2SD, NK-2 specific domain; YRD, tyrosine-rich domain).

We applied the technique of DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>) to identify target genes of NKX2-5 wild type and NKX2-5 mutant proteins mimicking those found in patients with CHD. While binding of severe NKX2-5 mutants to targets was compromised, they nonetheless associated with hundreds of targets, including many normally bound by NKX2-5 wild type, and could regulate a subset of these in cellular assays. We demonstrate that severe NKX2-5 mutant proteins retained an ability to interact with NKX2-5 wild type and other cardiac TFs via a novel tyrosine-rich protein:protein interface in NKX2-5 that lies outside of the HD. NKX2-5 mutant proteins also bound hundreds of ‘off-targets’ not bound by NKX2-5 wild type, via altered DNA-recognition or via interactions with previously unrecognised cofactors. These cofactors, which include members of the ETS family, are embedded in the cardiac GRN, indicating a broad role for ubiquitous TFs in cardiac network logic and mechanism of CHD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DamID identification of NKX2-5 WT targets</title><p>DamID is a sensitive enzymatic method developed to identify protein:DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Steensel and Henikoff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Steensel et al., 2001</xref>).

DamID involves creation of a fusion between a chromatin-binding protein of interest and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam). When expressed, Dam fusions bind to DNA, whereby Dam locally methylates adenine within its target sites (5′GATC3′). Target DNA can then be released using <italic>Dpn</italic>I, a nuclease specific for the methylated Dam site, and analysed on arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used DamID in HL-1 cells, which resemble atrial cardiomyocytes, to profile NKX2-5 WT and mutants that mimic those found in CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Claycomb et al., 1998</xref>). Mouse <italic>Nkx2-5</italic> cDNAs were cloned into a lentiviral Dam vector carrying heat shock and ponasterone A-inducible promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>). Only N-terminal Dam fusions (Dam-NKX2-5) were analysed because C-terminal fusions were sterically compromised (data not shown). Ponasterone A induction after viral transduction of HEK Ecr-293 cells confirmed nuclear localisation and the correct size of fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Transduction of HL-1 cells was efficient (∼97%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). DamID fusions were expressed from the uninduced <italic>heat shock protein 68</italic> promoter at very low levels (undetectable by western blotting), which was sufficient for Dam enzymatic activity on chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) but avoided skewing of the network. DamID is dependent on the density of <italic>Dpn</italic>I sites (5′GATC3′), which occur on average every 260 bp in the mouse genome, as in the fly genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Steensel and Henikoff, 2000</xref>). After <italic>Dpn</italic>I digestion of virus-transduced HL-1 cell DNA, PCR-amplification lead to fragments of ∼200-2000 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We determined that of all perfect NKX2-5 high-affinity binding sites (NKE; 5′AAGTG3′) in the mouse genome, 90% had a <italic>Dpn</italic>I site within 1 kb upstream and downstream (median of ∼289 bp), suggesting that DamID captures the vast majority of NKX2-5 direct targets.</p><p>Methylated genomic fragments were hybridised to Affymetrix Mouse promoter microarrays in biological triplicate.

After counting of their exact sequences, the NKE was present in 79% of NKX2-5 peaks, with half of these bearing over 2 and up to 12 NKEs. The GATA- and NF1-binding motifs were present in 59% and 36% of peaks, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results suggest that the majority of NKX2-5 WT targets are directly bound via the NKE and also support the combinatorial action of NKX2-5 with GATA factors on many targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Durocher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2011</xref>). NKX2-5 did not bind directly to the NF1-like site in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), suggesting that NKX2-5 could act in combination with NF1 in HL-1 cells. Using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay, we showed that NKX2-5 interacted with NF1-B1 and NF1-B3 but not NF1-A or NF1-X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as for the related family members NKX2-1 and NF1 in lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bachurski et al., 2003</xref>).

NKX2-5 also bound its own promoter, potentially reflecting auto-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prall et al., 2007</xref>).

Even though NKX2-5Y191C cannot bind DNA, the most over-represented motifs were 5′AAGTGT3′ (NKE), 5′GATAA3′ (GATA), and 5′TGCCAA3′ (NF1-like), exactly as for NKX2-5 WT fusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). NKX2-5Y191C peaks also showed over-representation of the motif 5′TAATC3′, which is similar to the binding sites of many non-NK-2 class HD proteins, including HOX proteins, as well as that of NK-2 proteins that lack HD tyrosine 54, such as NKX1-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2008</xref>). NK-2 class proteins which do carry Y54 in their HDs, including NKX2-5, also bind to this HOX-like site, albeit with a 10-fold-reduced affinity compared to that of the NKE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Schwartz, 1995</xref>). For NKX2-5∆HD peaks, there were many over-represented motifs, although none resembled known cardiac TF-binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The ability of NKX2-5Y191C and NKX2-5∆HD to bind a large number of targets was unexpected. Hence we sought to confirm using an independent approach that these mutants could interact with chromatin in vivo. We employed photoactivatable fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (paFCS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kaur et al., 2013</xref>), measuring the diffusion dynamics of NKX2-5 WT and mutants within individual HL-1 nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Expression vectors encoding NKX2-5 proteins fused to photoactivatable GFP (paGFP) were introduced by transfection. As for other TFs, NKX2-5 WT showed a biphasic behaviour, with a freely diffusing fraction similar to paGFP (adjusted for molecular mass) and a slower, chromatin-interacting fraction. NKX2-5 WT displayed slower diffusion (dwell time τD<sub>slow</sub> = 121 ms) than that mutants (NKX2-5Y191C: τD<sub>slow</sub> = 64 ms; NKX2-5ΔHD: τD<sub>slow</sub> = 11 ms), which diffused more slowly than paGFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). This confirmed that NKX2-5Y191C and NKX2-5ΔHD physically interact with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kaur et al., 2013</xref>) and suggests that a gradation in chromatin tethering correlates with the apparent severity of the NKX2-5 mutation (WT&gt;Y191C&gt;ΔHD&gt;paGFP).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NKX2-5 mutant targets overlap partially with NKX2-5 WT targets</title><p>We compared NKX2-5 WT and mutant peaks and adopted a simple nomenclature (A, B, and C) for peak subsets, where A is bound by NKX2-5 WT only, B is bound by both WT and a mutant, and C is bound only by a mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In both comparisons, the A sets predominated (81% and 53% of NKX2-5 WT peaks in the NKX2-5 WT/∆HD and NKX2-5 WT/Y191C comparisons, respectively), and their most enriched motif determined de novo was the NKE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), demonstrating that, as anticipated, NKX2-5 mutants failed to bind to most WT targets, including <italic>Nppa</italic>. Therefore, the HD mutations result in a severe loss of function. However, a high proportion of mutant peaks overlapped with NKX2-5 WT peaks (B sets; 36% of 792 NKX2-5∆HD peaks and 63% of 1149 NKX2-5Y191C peaks).</p><p>To investigate the A- and B-set logic further, we used <italic>Clover</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frith et al., 2004</xref>) to calculate the enrichment of known TF motifs present in <italic>TRANSFAC</italic> (<italic>BIOBASE</italic>) and <italic>JASPAR</italic> databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryne et al., 2008</xref>) in A and B sets separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The NKE was significantly enriched in both A and B sets, showing that A and B sets contain direct NKX2-5 targets. A- and B-sets also exhibited distinct enrichment signatures for many known TF motifs, for example, those for cardiac kernel TFs GATA4, HAND1, and MEF2 were only enriched in the B-set of the NKX2-5 WT/∆HD comparison. Thus, both mutants can bind a subset of direct WT targets despite crippled DNA binding. This likely occurs via dimerisation with endogenous NKX2-5 WT and/or its cofactors (see below and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kasahara et al., 2000</xref>]). Indeed, for NKX2-5∆HD, which completely lacks a DNA-binding domain, our data suggest that a protein:protein interface within NKX2-5 that is distinct from the HD can guide the mutant protein to NKX2-5 WT targets.</p><p>At a GO term level, the A- and B-sets were also distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For the Y191C/∆HD comparison, the A-set showed virtually no enrichment for GO terms and the B-set was primarily enriched in functions related to <italic>heart development</italic>. For the WT/∆HD comparison, the overlap in GO terms between the A-set and B-set was also very small, with the A-set being primarily enriched in terms related to cellular functions, such as <italic>actin filament organisation</italic> and <italic>transcription</italic>, and the B-set being enriched in functions related to <italic>heart</italic> and <italic>blood vessel development</italic>. This suggests that NKX2-5 mutants preferentially associate with genes involved in cardiac related processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Functionality of NKX2-5 mutants</title><p>Based on the DamID and pFCA data above showing an association between NKX2-5 mutants and chromatin, we tested the functionality of NKX2-5 mutants in vivo, selecting <italic>Inhibitor of DNA binding 3</italic> (<italic>Id3</italic>) as a B set gene bound by NKX2-5 WT, Y191C, and ΔHD for detailed analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>Id3</italic> encodes a bHLH factor that represses cardiogenic differentiation in heart progenitor cells and is down-regulated as progenitors differentiate and levels of NKX2-5 increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding et al., 2006</xref>).

Following induction of cardiogenesis, NKX2-5 WT, Y191C, and ∆HD proteins were activated in most or all embryoid body (EB) cells with dox at day 4, 1 day before, endogenous NKX2-5 appears in a minority of cells within cardiogenic clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Comparable levels of NKX2-5 WT and mutant mRNAs and protein were detected 1–2 days post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Induced NKX2-5 WT strongly repressed formation of FLK1+/PDGFRα+ multipotent cardiovascular progenitors at day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and of cardiomyocytes (cTNT+) and endothelial cells (CD31+) at day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-F</xref>). Repression of cardiac lineages by NKX2-5 in ES cells is consistent with its demonstrated early role as a negative feedback regulator of cardiac induction and second heart field gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prall et al., 2007</xref>), and as an inhibitor of reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts to a cardiomyocyte fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ieda et al., 2010</xref>). NKX25∆HD was nuclear in only 15% of cells at day 6 (likely due to deletion of the nuclear localisation signal within the HD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and had no effect on cardiac or endothelial cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-F</xref>) and so was not considered further. NKX2-5Y191C was nuclear and, while showing no effects on myocardial progenitors or endothelial cells in three independent experiments, showed a trend towards inhibition of cardiomyocyte numbers at day 8 (∼44%; p = 0.079), suggesting that it also retained some repressive activity in this assay.</p><p>To gain deeper insights into the underlying effects, we therefore measured alterations in gene expression in the ES cell lines at day 5–6 in three independent experiments, testing a selection of A and B-set genes derived from the NKX2-5WT:Y191C comparison. The majority of both A (8/12) and B (12/13) set genes tested were modulated &gt;1.5 fold by NKX2-5 WT (total 20/25), providing strong evidence that DamID selects NKX2-5 WT developmental targets. Within B-set genes, most were repressed by NKX2-5 WT, consistent with the repression of cardiogenesis by NKX2-5 WT at early stages of cardiac lineage specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prall et al., 2007</xref>). A subset of A and B set genes was also regulated by NKX2-5Y191C (A-set: 3/12; B-set: 4/13; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), despite no change in early myocardial progenitors in the NKX2-5Y191C line, with regulation by Y191C being in the same direction as for NKX2-5 WT.

While dimerisation to NKX2-5 WT has been demonstrated for NKX2-5Y191C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kasahara and Benson, 2004</xref>), it was surprising for NKX2-5ΔHD because the HD has been previously described as being essential for NKX2-5 homodimerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elliott et al., 2010</xref>). Transfected NKX2-5∆HD was largely cytoplasmic in CV-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which lack endogenous NKX2-5. This is likely a consequence of the deletion of the NKX2-5 nuclear localisation signal located in the amino terminus of the HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kasahara and Izumo, 1999</xref>). However, NKX2-5∆HD became nuclear when co-expressed with NKX2-5 WT, which itself was nuclear when transfected alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Cofactors GATA4, TBX5, and TBX20, which have been reported to bind NKX2-5 WT via the HD also induced nuclear translocation of NKX2-5∆HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In HL-1 cells, which express endogenous NKX2-5 and its cardiac cofactors, transfected NKX2-5∆HD was predominantly nuclear although some protein was present in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Full-length NKX2-5 interacted with peptides carrying the NKX2-5 HD (aa137-196) or C-terminal region (aa198-318) but not with the N-terminal region (aa1-135). The C-terminal peptide could also interact with itself. The conserved tyrosine-rich domain (YRD), present within the C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), was essential for the interaction between full-length NKX2-5 and the C-terminus, being blocked by the NKX2-5YRD<sup>Y−A</sup> mutation in which all 9 tyrosines of the YRD are mutated to alanine. We have previously shown that NKX2-5YRD<sup>Y−A</sup> does not affect DNA binding, although it has a strong dominant-negative activity leading to lethal CHD-like phenotypes in high-level heterozygous ES cell chimaeras, and when placed over the null allele creates a phenocopy of NKX2-5 loss-of-function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elliott et al., 2006</xref>). Mutation of other conserved domains within the C-terminus (NK2-specific domain; Nkx2-5 box) had no affect on the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). While the NKX2-5 HD is known to be a homophilic interaction domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elliott et al., 2010</xref>), our Y2H data identify the YRD as a novel dimerisation interface within NKX2-5. This YRD-dependent interaction, demonstrated in both yeast and mammalian cells, provides the mechanism for heterodimerisation of NKX2-5 WT with NKX2-5∆HD, as well as homodimerisation of NKX2-5∆HD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>NKX2-5 mutants bind to off-targets</title><p>When comparing NKX2-5 WT and mutant peaks, the presence of C sets revealed that mutant proteins bound a set of unique targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) that we call ‘off-targets’ potentially reflecting a gain-of-function. Proportionally, off-target sets were much larger for the more severe NKX2-5∆HD than for NKX2-5Y191C (64% of total NKX2-5∆HD targets [504 peaks]; 37% of NKX2-5Y191C targets [427 peaks]).</p><p>Off-target peaks had specific characteristics.

The most over-represented motif for NKX2-5Y191C was 5′TAAT3′ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which is similar to the HOX-like site over-represented in NKX2-5 WT targets mentioned above.

The motifs for E−26 transformation-specific (ETS) TFs occurred most frequently in NKX2-5∆HD C-set peaks (42%) and were significantly enriched compared to random peaks, suggesting that ETS factors could play a role in guiding NKX2-5∆HD to its off-targets.

SRF is a well-described cofactor of both NKX2-5 and ELK1, albeit in different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Treisman, 1994</xref>).

Our results are consistent with previous data showing that a tyrosine-rich region within NK2 class homeo-protein NKX3-1 mediates interaction with prostate-derived ETS factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Bieberich, 2005</xref>).

Co-targets of all 3 factors (NKX2-5, SRF, ELK1/4) or of NKX2-5 and ELK1/4 were most over-represented in GO terms <italic>heart development</italic>, <italic>blood vessel morphogenesis</italic>, and <italic>cytoskeleton organisation</italic>. These data show that, overall, ELK1/4, SRF, and NKX2-5 regulate many generic cellular functions, while NKX2-5 and SRF also have more executive roles in regulating heart development and contraction. Furthermore, ELK1/4 appear to control very specific subsets of the cardiac GRN. By integrating the targets of all WT TFs profiled with those of other cardiac TFs previously published, we found that <italic>Elk1/4</italic> were embedded in the developmental cardiac GRN with many cross and feedback connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that ELK1/4 play a significant role in normal and disease cardiac GRN logic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we used DamID in HL-1 cells to probe the cardiac GRN by identifying target genes for kernel TFs NKX2-5 and SRF, and for the MAP kinase signalling-dependent cardiac transcriptional cofactors ELK1 and ELK4. To begin to understand the mechanism of CHD, we adopted the DamID method and identified targets of NKX2-5 mutants that mimic those found in CHD. These are the first functional genomics studies to probe CHD, providing new insights into the structure and function of NKX2-5, and network regulation in normal heart development and CHD.</p><p>Previous studies comparing DamID and ChIP experiments performed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> reported ‘a high degree of overlap’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moorman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Negre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tolhuis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Bemmel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yin et al., 2011</xref>). We compared our NKX2-5 peak set with NKX2-5 ChIPseq peaks generated previously in HL-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2011</xref>) and adult hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van den Boogaard et al., 2012</xref>), restricting our analyses to genomic regions covered by the promoter microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). We found that the overlap between all three data sets was low—specifically 18% and 6% DamID peak overlap, respectively. This low overlap highlights the problems of comparing data from different platforms and different laboratories, and warrants deeper analysis. We note that only DamID was performed with 3–4 replicates per experiment. Furthermore, de novo motif discovery identified the known high-affinity NKE exclusively within NKX2-5 DamID peaks. Both of the published studies identified a similar but variant NKE using ChIPseq. Cardiac- and muscle-related GO terms were more highly enriched in NKX2-5 target genes determined by DamID compared to published ChIPseq peaks from adult hearts included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van den Boogaard et al., 2012</xref>), and no such GO term were detected in data from HL-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2011</xref>). These results provide strong validation for the DamID method.</p><p>Our study using DamID confirms for the first time at a genome-wide level in vivo, the prevailing view that severe mutations in cardiac kernel TF (such as NKX2-5∆HD, Y191C, and YRD<sup>Y−A</sup>) fail to bind the majority of WT targets (A sets) even in the presence of normal levels of NKX2-5 WT. Loss-of-binding of mutant proteins will be associated with alterations in the level of expression of many genes in the cardiac network through haploinsufficiency, which will be a major contributor to the structural and functional heart defects found in human CHD patients.</p><p>Surprisingly, however, NKX2-5 mutants still recognised a large number of genomic sites and some of these were normally bound by NKX2-5 WT (B-sets). B-sets included direct and indirect NKX2-5 WT target genes and were enriched in heart- and muscle-related GO terms. In the ES cell system, NKX2-5 mutant proteins retained WT-like functionality on some B-set genes. We propose that B-sets are recognised by mutants via dimerisation with cofactors or with NKX2-5 WT. The NKX2-5 HD is a recognised interface for NKX2-5 homo-dimerisation and interactions with cofactors, such as GATA4, HAND1, TBX5/20, and MEF2. NKX2-5∆HD lacks the HD and embedded nuclear localisation domain and represents a severe mutation that has lost the ability to bind to the majority (81%) of normal NKX2-5 WT targets (A-set). However, even this severe mutant retained binding to a subset of direct and indirect NKX2-5 WT targets (B-set). NKX2-5∆HD binding to B-set peaks could <italic>only</italic> occur through heterodimerisation with NKX2-5 WT or cofactors. We have shown using a number of approaches that NKX2-5∆HD retained its ability to interact with NKX2-5 WT, GATA4, and TBX5/20, and we identified the YRD located within the C-terminus of NKX2-5 as a novel interface that collaborates with the HD to support these interactions. Our characterisation of the YRD as a novel homophilic and heterophilic interaction domain provides the molecular mechanism that explains dimerisation of NKX2-5∆HD to NKX2-5 WT or its cofactors in the absence of the HD. We predict that the HD and YRD act supportively and synergistically in the assembly of macromolecular TF complexes. The YRD is an ancient domain that has coevolved with the NK2-class HD and is essential for NKX2-5 function in early mouse embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elliott et al., 2006</xref>). In humans, half of NKX2-5 mutations associated with CHD are outside of the HD, and three frame-shift mutations located within the YRD have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gutierrez-Roelens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ikeda et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Both NKX2-5 mutants studied also recognised a large number of targets uniquely (C-set), which we term off-targets. The relative size of the C-set within the total mutant target set (C-set/B-set ratio) correlates with the location and predicted severity of NKX2-5 mutations (∆HD&gt;Y191C≥ YRD<sup>Y−A</sup>), and thus B-set and C-set size and content may prove to be valuable signatures for understanding the relationship between genotype, phenotype, and clinical outcomes in CHD. NKX2-5∆HD off-targets were associated with GO terms <italic>chromatin organisation</italic> and <italic>cell cycle</italic>, and peaks were enriched in the binding sites for ETS family and many other broadly expressed TFs, attesting to an underlying logic in their selection. A high percentage of NKX2-5 mutant off-targets (14.2% for NKX2-5∆HD and 6.5% for NKX2-5Y191C) were occupied by ELK1/4 in HL-1 cells, compared to &lt;1% when randomly generated peaks were overlapped. Furthermore, only 3% of C-set peaks of the NKX2-5YRD<sup>Y−A</sup> mutant were bound by ELK1/4. Although ETS factors have previously been predicted to be involved in heart development based on motif enrichment in predicted cardiac enhancers in fly and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Narlikar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jin et al., 2013</xref>), this is the first evidence showing a direct interaction with cardiac TFs. Studies of the <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> cardiac GRN demonstrated that ETS family gene <italic>Ets1/2</italic> is activated by FGF/MAP Kinase signalling, which specifies the identity of founder cells of the cardiac lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davidson et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, most overrepresented in candidate Ets1/2 target genesis was the motif 5′ATTA3′, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davidson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woznica et al., 2012</xref>), which is similar to the HOX-like motif overrepresented in NKX2-5Y191C off-target peaks in HL-1 cells, potentially indicating a conserved FGF/MAP Kinase-activated synergy between ETS and HD factors at the earliest stages of cardiac lineage specification.</p><p>ELK1 and ELK4 interacted with NKX2-5 WT and NKX2-5∆HD through the YRD, and this interaction was sufficiently strong for pELK1 to transport NKX2-5∆HD into the nucleus when co-expressed and for unphosphorylated ELK1 to tether NKX2-5 WT in cytoplasmic inclusions. This interaction provides a mechanism for how severe NKX2-5 mutants lacking a functional HD can be directed to a sub-set of off-targets via interaction with broadly expressed TFs. Severe NKX2-5 mutants may be drawn to off-targets due to the breakdown of compelling cardiac specificity on true targets.</p><p>We have also shown that ETS factors ELK1 and ELK4 are normal cofactors of NKX2-5, embedded in the cardiac GRN kernel. The cardiac GRN kernel is traditionally conceptualised as a set of cardiac-restricted TFs that are critical for defining organ territories and imposing organ specificity to GRN logic. However, the cardiac kernel is likely to have evolved in the context of a host of ancient TFs controlling ubiquitous cellular processes such as metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin dynamics, and cytoskeleton. Furthermore, it is well known that TFs are amongst the targets of the complex paracrine signalling pathways that underpin pattern formation, tissue specification, and differentiation in metazoans. Our genome-wide studies suggest that ELK1/4 interact with, regulate, and are regulated by, cardiac TFs, and are therefore recursively wired into the cardiac kernel at a high level. Other studies show that organ-restricted NK-2 class HD TFs collaborate with ETS factors on specific target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Bieberich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lin et al., 2006</xref>) or provide signal gating for decisions affecting lineage fate within developmental fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Halfon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hollenhorst et al., 2011</xref>). ELK1/4 bind and potentially regulate a large number of genes in HL-1 cells involved in ubiquitous cellular processes, most prominently metabolism. However, smaller gene sets, most significantly those encoding heart developmental and cytoskeletal genes, were co-bound by NKX2-5 and ELKs, SRF and ELKs, or ELK1/4, NKX2-5, and SRF. One interpretation is that subsets of ELK1/4 targets, potentially those at critical hubs, have been drawn into the cardiac GRN to exert strategic (signal-gated) and fine network control over its outputs. Considering the implications of this and related studies more broadly, network links between cardiac and canonical signal-gated TFs are likely to be much greater than currently appreciated and generate massive potential for regulatory coding that needs to be tested in future studies.</p><p>Our results may have implications for the mechanism of CHD. While we acknowledge that our findings are derived from studies in a cell culture system, they compellingly suggest that NKX2-5 mutants, even those lacking DNA-binding ability, can bind to a subset of normal targets and off-targets, where they could affect transcription either positively or through dominant-negative action. Importantly, both NKX2-5∆HD and NKX2-5Y191C retained some functionality on select B- and C-set targets in vitro, an activity driven by heterodimerisation with cofactors. Our results confirm the inability of severe mutants to bind most normal targets, and therefore that haploinsufficiency is likely the dominant component of CHD mechanism. However, we predict that allele-specific dominant-negative and gain-of-function effects arising from dysregulation of the hundreds of off-targets will further destabilise the cardiac GRN and could contribute to disease. We have not yet analysed the expression of off-targets in mouse models or human CHD samples. Defining the targets and off-targets of a range of human CHD mutations and analysing their expressions in appropriate animal and human models will be needed to rigorously test the hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and cell culture</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Plasmids/cloning</title><p>Sequences coding for murine TFs used in this study were amplified from HL-1 cell cDNA and cloned into DamID vectors generated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>).

This was repeated 100 times and the average taken to form a static random background expression profile. For any given set of input genes, a tissue/cell type expression profile was formed by the ratio of the randomly generated median expression profiles to the median tissue/cell type expression profile of the input group of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Gene network reconstruction</title><p><italic>BioTapestry</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Longabaugh et al., 2009</xref>) was used to represent the protein-DNA interactions between cardiac TFs identified in this study and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">von Both et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson and Erwin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rojas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Silvestri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boros et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van Bueren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schlesinger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shen et al., 2011</xref>).

Protein-coding sequences were cloned into a pcDNA3 expression vector backbone, which was modified to contain either <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase fragment 1 (Rluc8.1, amino acids 1–110) or <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase fragment 2 (Rluc8.2 amino acids 111–312), each followed by a 2×(GGGS) linker, upstream of a Gateway cloning cassette allowing insertion of the gene of interest. The resulting fusion is under the control of a truncated form of the CMV promoter (CMVd1), allowing for reduced levels of protein expression (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalised by a third vector encoding LacZ, downstream of a CMV promoter (CMV-LacZ). The day before transfection, 20,000 HEK 293T cells were plated in clear-bottomed, white-walled 96-well plates in 100 ml DMEM/10% FCS growth media.

The mix was incubated for 10 min, and equal amounts of mix added to each well of the quadruplicate. After 24 hr, cells were washed in PBS and 100 µl of PBS added to each well. A 10 mM solution of Benzyl Coelenterazine in PBS (Nanolight Technologies, Pinetop, USA) was prepared from a 10 mM stock solution in methanol, and 100 µl was injected into each well by luminometer (FluoStar Optima, BMG Labtech). Readings were taken for 5 s, 2 s after injection, and again for 5 s 15 min after initial injection of substrate. Following readings, cells were washed with PBS and ß-galactosidase detected using the Galacto-Star System (Life Technologies). <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase readings were then normalised to levels of ß-galactosidase and the four replicates averaged.

Complexes were left on cells for 4–5 hr, before the serum-free media was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS and incubated 16–24 hr. Prior to live imaging, media were changed to phenol-red free DMEM, and the coverslip was mounted in a POCmini-2 cultivation system (Zeiss) in DMEMgfp medium (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia) containing 10% FCS on a LSM 7Duo confocal microscope equipped with a 32-channel spectral detector. 12-bit spectral images were acquired using a 63× Plan-Apochromat 1.40 oil objective at a spectral resolution of 10 nm, first with 405 nm laser excitation and then with a 514 nm laser. Donor, raw FRET, and acceptor images were obtained by linear-unmixing spectral data using newly acquired reference spectra in the Zen 2009 software (Zeiss).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>This paper makes an important contribution to the field of cardiogenesis and to understanding NKX2-5 driven mechanisms underlying congenital heart disease. It leads to a shift in the conceptual framework, from the conventional view that mutations in NKX2-5 result in a failure of the transcription factor to correctly activate its downstream targets to the idea that the mutant factor participates in promiscuous interactions that lead to inappropriate activation of genes that are not normally NKX2-5 targets. This is a very data rich study that represents a technical tour de force. The results are complex and the manuscript densely written. In order to make it more accessible, some simplifications and clarifications are required in the text. Further experimentation is not required. However the authors should strengthen the validation of their results by more comparative analyses of data and tone down some of their conclusions. Specific points to be taken into account when modifying the text are as follows:</p><p>1) The results are based on the Dam-ID approach to discover transcription factor binding sites. It is essential to compare the findings with available published ChIP-Seq data. The authors compared their DamID peaks with NKX2-5 ChIP-Seq from HL-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2011</xref>) mentioning 77.8% overlap but commenting that genes associated with ChIP-Seq peaks overwhelmed DamID targets, making comparison difficult. However, since a high quality ChIP-Seq dataset provides genome-wide TF occupancy information with higher resolution, the authors should show the percentage of ChIP-Seq peaks that are overlaid for the DamID data. This will serve as a validation.</p><p>2) The enzymatic function of Dam is supposed to be local. The authors should indicate the average distance from NKE to the nearest (predicted) methylated <italic>Dpn</italic>I sites in the enriched DamID peaks and should discuss whether the requirement for <italic>Dpn</italic> sites introduces bias.</p><p>3) The experiments were performed using overexpression in cell culture and the data should also be compared with results obtained by others on NKX2-5 chromatin interactions using endogenous NKX2-5 (ex. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van den Boogaard et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>4) The authors understandably restrict their analysis of target sites to promoter regions and do not attempt to analyse more distant regulatory regions. It would be useful to discuss what fraction of DamID selected genomic fragments are estimated to fall within these promoter regions. This could be illustrated by comparison of promoter versus known enhancer sequences for one or two genes in their data set. Mention of comparison with the data of He et al. (in the subsection “DamID identification of NKX2-5 WT targets”) is unclear.</p><p>5) Conclusions should be toned down, with inclusion of reference to a number of caveats – overexpression of proteins in cultured cell lines, limited in vivo validation, no evidence provided that expression of off target genes is increased in mouse models or patients with NKX2-5 mutations.</p><p>A specific caveat concerns the presence of wild type NKX2-5 protein in HL-1 cells. The authors should justify their assumption that they are not pulling down mutant protein interacting with endogenous wild type protein which might mean that the binding effects are secondary to the binding of wild type NKX2-5. In the context of the ES cell experiments, it is not clear why complex formation with the endogenous NKX2-5 protein does not permit more nuclear translocation (in the first paragraph of the subsection headed “DamID identification of NKX2-5 WT targets”).</p><p>6) What about the activity of NKX2-5 as a repressor, previously demonstrated by the Harvey lab and also for Tinman in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Immunofluorescence shown for NKX2-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1–figure supplement 8</xref>) only co-localises with active histone marks in HL-1 cells. What about its effect on <italic>Id3</italic> transcription? The comments on activation/repression in the context of the ES cell experiments (in the subsection headed “Functionality of NKX2-5 mutants”) require more explanation. The authors should discuss their thoughts about the potential mechanism in repressive functions of NKX2-5.</p><p>7) Results are mentioned for NF1-B1/3 (in the fourth paragraph of the subsection headed “DamID identification of NKX2-5 WT targets”) but the in vivo significance of this is not clear and the factors are not integrated into the gene regulatory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Is it necessary to include this?</p><p>8) It is not clear that the ELK complex is playing a highly important role. It only came up towards the bottom of the motif enrichment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>. The authors should explain why they chose to concentrate on the association of this complex with NKX2-5. The authors claim that the GO analysis shows that SRF and ELK1/4 regulate many cellular functions. This may be the case, although target genes appear to be expressed at a low level in the heart, suggesting that the major impact of these factors may be in the hijacking phenomenon? In the absence of complete transcriptome studies and functional promoter analysis statements about the importance of the role of the ELK complex should be qualified (see also point 4).</p><p>Concerning the role of ETS factors in cardiogenesis, the highly relevant paper of Woznica et al. (Dev Biol 2012) in the <italic>Ciona</italic> model should be discussed. In addition to showing the importance of ETS factors in the <italic>Ciona</italic> cardiac gene regulatory network, this study found an adjacent ATTA motif similar to the over-represented motif identified by Bouveret et al.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06942.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The results are based on the Dam-ID approach to discover transcription factor binding sites.

However, since a high quality ChIP-Seq dataset provides genome-wide TF occupancy information with higher resolution, the authors should show the percentage of ChIP-Seq peaks that are overlaid for the DamID data. This will serve as a validation</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this is an important issue. In response to the reviewer’s request, we calculated the overlap of NKX2-5 DamID peaks (this study) and ChIP-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2011</xref>), both data sets generated in HL-1 cells. A proportional Venn diagram is now included in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1–figure supplement 9</xref>). We also included in this figure a comparison of NKX2-5 ChIP-seq peaks generated from total adult hearts by van den Boogaard and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van den Boogaard et al., 2012</xref>), as requested below (point 3). Figure legends and the Materials and methods section have been adjusted accordingly. Since our DamID peaks were detected on Affymetrix promoter microarrays (average -6kb to +2.5kb relative to TSS), we limited the comparison to genomic regions covered by the microarray.</p><p>The overlap between our DamID data and the ChIP-seq data of He et al. data, both generated in HL-1 cells, was relatively low (18% of DamID peaks and 6.8% of ChIP-seq peaks). Importantly, the overlap between the He et al. peaks and those of van den Boogaard peaks, both established using ChIP-seq, was similarly low (15.6% of the van en Boogaard et al. peaks and 7.6% of the He et al. peaks).</p><p>We note the following observations that relate to these specific comparisons of NKX2-5 targets:</p><p>A) Previous studies comparing DamID and ChIP-chip experiments performed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> reported “a high degree of overlap” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Negre et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moorman et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tolhuis et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Bemmel et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yin et al., 2011</xref>). Although we did not compare DamID with ChIP-chip directly, 10/11 DamID targets were confirmed using ChIP-PCR.</p><p>B) Contrary to the understanding of one of the reviewers (point 3 and response below), in DamID experiments extremely low, undetectable, levels of NKX2-5 were expressed from the uninduced heat shock protein68 promoter (<italic>hsp68</italic>). The He et al. data was generated from stable HL-1 cell lines over-expressing <italic>bio</italic>-tagged NKX2-5 protein (4-5x based on RNA detection). As highlighted by the editor, overexpression may lead to a larger number of apparent target peaks and we note that in the He et al. study, &gt;20,000 peaks were detected.</p><p>C) We performed DamID using 3-4 biological replicates for each experiment. It is known that ChIP-seq experiments can be noisy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89a">Yang et al., 2014</xref>); therefore replication is an essential design element for ChIP-seq experiments. The ChIP-seq experiments of He et al. and van den Boogaard et al. were performed with no biological or technical replicates.</p><p>D) Within our total DamID peaks, de novo motif discovery identified the perfect known NKE (T/CAAGTG) as the top enriched motif, with at least one perfect NKE detected in 79% of peaks and 2 or more perfect NKEs detected in 40% of peaks. Up to 12 such NKEs were detected in NKX2-5 peaks. NKX2-5 ChIP-seq peaks determined by He et al. and van den Boogaard et al. were most enriched in a variant form of that NKE (GAGT/AG) which was determined from a limited selection of either the top 500 peaks or 600 randomly-selected peaks, respectively. This variant has not been documented previously using techniques such as SELEX or protein-binding microarrays. We note from our calculations that the high affinity NKE (AAGTG) was present in 59% and 43%, respectively, of their ChIPseq peaks included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1–figure supplement 9</xref>, significantly less than in our DamID peak set (79%).</p><p>E) Western blots presented in Figure S1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2011</xref>) show that <italic>bio</italic>-tagged NKX2-5 fusions both before and after enrichment by immunoprecipitation were highly degraded. ChIP-seq data presented in this paper therefore likely represents targets of heterodisperse NKX2-5 processed products.</p><p>F) NKX2-5 target genes identified by DamID were most enriched in cardiac GO terms with very low p-values. When restricted to promoter regions, NKX2-5 ChIP-seq peaks were not enriched in any GO terms containing “cardiac”, “muscle” or “heart” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2011</xref>) or were moderately enriched in cardiac-related terms with higher p-values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van den Boogaard et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We strongly believe that our DamID data should be evaluated on its own merits. There are many findings in our DamID data and in previously published DamID data that suggest that this technique is highly specific. As we have highlighted above, there are potentially simple and well-documented experimental design explanations (e.g. inclusion of replicates) for the differences we have observed. Although we agree that the issues facing the field in this regard are important and warrant further investigation, we prefer to deal with them briefly in our paper and to follow up with a subsequent meta-analysis of comparable experimental designs.</p><p>For the present paper, we present the overlap of DamID peak with those of He et al. and van den Boogaard et al., as requested, and provide a brief commentary in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) The enzymatic function of Dam is supposed to be local. The authors should indicate the average distance from NKE to the nearest (predicted) methylated</italic> Dpn<italic>I sites in the enriched DamID peaks and should discuss whether the requirement for</italic> Dpn <italic>sites introduces bias</italic>.</p><p>It is correct to say that DamID peaks, in particular their length, can be influenced by the density of <italic>Dpn</italic>I sites in proximity of binding sites, which occur on average every 260bp in the mouse genome. In our experiments on HL-1 cells, <italic>Dpn</italic>I digestion and amplification lead to fragments of ∼200-2000bp (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>). We also calculated, that for all perfect NKX2-5 high affinity binding sites (NKE; 5’AAGTG3’) in the mouse genome, 90% had a <italic>Dpn</italic>I site within 1,000bps upstream or downstream of the NKE, suggesting that DamID captures the vast majority of NKX2-5 direct targets.</p><p>We have added a comment about the length of peaks and our calculation of bias as discussed above in the text (in the subsection headed “DamID identification of NKX2-5 WT target”). We have also added a new track in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1–figure supplement 7</xref> showing the <italic>Dpn</italic>I sites.</p><p><italic>3) The experiments were performed using overexpression in cell culture and the data should also be compared with results obtained by others on NKX2-5 chromatin interactions using endogenous NKX2-5 (ex.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78"><italic>Van den Boogaard et al., 2012</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>The statement above about overexpression is incorrect. We expressed DamID fusions in HL-1 cells at extremely low levels (undetectable by western blotting) from an uninduced <italic>hsp68</italic> (heat shock) promoter to avoid skewing of the network. Such low levels of expression are nonetheless sufficient for specific methylation of chromatin. Please note that overexpression shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> in HEK 293 cells was induced upon induction with Ponasterone A only to verify that Dam fusions were stable.</p><p>We have clarified this point in the text (in the subsection headed “DamID identification of NKX2-5 WT targets”).</p><p>In response to the second part of Question 2, we have compared NKX2-5 DamID peaks with peaks determined using ChIP-seq in the adult mouse heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van den Boogaard et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1–figure supplement 9</xref>). See our response to Question 1 above.</p><p><italic>4) The authors understandably restrict their analysis of target sites to promoter regions and do not attempt to analyse more distant regulatory regions. It would be useful to discuss what fraction of DamID selected genomic fragments are estimated to fall within these promoter regions. This could be illustrated by comparison of promoter versus known enhancer sequences for one or two genes in their data set. Mention of comparison with the data of He et al. (in the subsection “DamID identification of NKX2-5 WT targets”) is unclear</italic>.</p><p>The Affymetrix promoter microarray covers an estimated 7.3% of the mouse genome. This microarray would capture 20% to 30% of NKX2-5 peaks previously determined using ChIP-seq by He et al. and van den Boogaard et al., respectively.</p><p>This was noted in the third paragraph of the subsection headed “DamID identification of NKX2-5 WT targets”. We have also clarified the text in the second paragraph of the Discussion with respect to the comparison of DamID peaks and ChIPseq peaks of He et al.</p><p><italic>5) Conclusions should be toned down, with inclusion of reference to a number of caveats – overexpression of proteins in cultured cell lines, limited in vivo validation, no evidence provided that expression of off target genes is increased in mouse models or patients with NKX2-5 mutations</italic>.</p><p>We confirm again for clarity that DamID fusions were expressed in HL-1 cells at extremely low levels (undetectable by western blotting). See our response to Question 3 above.</p><p>We have been generally more cautious about our claims and have included the caveats as suggested above at the end of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>A specific caveat concerns the presence of wild type NKX2-5 protein in HL-1 cells. The authors should justify their assumption that they are not pulling down mutant protein interacting with endogenous wild type protein which might mean that the binding effects are secondary to the binding of wild type NKX2-5</italic>.</p><p>Response: DamID experiments do not involve “pulling down” mutant protein. NKX2-5 WT and mutant Dam fusions are expressed individually at very low levels in HL-1 cells, which express endogenous NKX2-5 protein. We make very clear in the text that expressed NKX2-5 WT and mutant fusions bind to chromatin via protein:protein interaction with endogenous NKX2-5 or with other cofactors. Indeed, the binding of NKX2-5 mutants that have a crippled or missing homeodomain to genuine NKX2-5 targets <italic>must</italic> occur indirectly. We provide evidence and a mechanism for how this occurs.</p><p><italic>In the context of the ES cell experiments, it is not clear why complex formation with the endogenous NKX2-5 protein does not permit more nuclear translocation (in the first paragraph of the subsection headed “DamID identification of NKX2-5 WT targets”)</italic>.</p><p>In the ES cell differentiation experiments, we used the embryoid body (EB) method (see Materials and methods, “Cell lines”). Only a fraction of cells differentiate into cardiomyocytes and express endogenous NKX2-5 at day 6 of differentiation. The vector used for exogenous expression utilised a tet-responsive promoter which is likely ubiquitous in tissue competence. Thus, after application of doxycycline, exogenous NKX2-5 is induced in all cells, the majority of which do not express NKX2-5 or cardiac cofactors and therefore do not localize NKX2-5ΔHD to the nucleus. It was therefore not possible to compare results with NKX2-5ΔHD directly to those using nuclear NKX2-5 proteins (WT or Y191C).</p><p>We have modified the text in the second paragraph of the subsection headed “Functionality of NKX2-5 mutants” to make clear that endogenous NKX2-5 is only activated in a minority of cells at day 6 of differentiation, while exogenous NKX2-5 is activated in most or all cells.</p><p><italic>6) What about the activity of NKX2-5 as a repressor, previously demonstrated by the Harvey lab and also for Tinman in</italic> Drosophila<italic>. Immunofluorescence shown for NKX2-5 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 8</italic></xref><italic>) only co-localises with active histone marks in HL-1 cells. What about its effect on</italic> Id3 <italic>transcription? The comments on activation/repression in the context of the ES cell experiments (in the subsection headed “Functionality of NKX2-5 mutants”) require more explanation. The authors should discuss their thoughts about the potential mechanism in repressive functions of NKX2-5</italic>.</p><p>The role of NKX2-5 as a repressor was discovered in the context of early cardiac specification in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Watanabe et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prall et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>NKX2-5</italic> mutant embryos, the majority of differentially expressed genes were down-regulated (suggesting that these were positively-regulated targets of NKX2-5) although a limited number of progenitor genes were up-regulated in the transition from progenitor state to differentiated cardiomyocytes, suggesting repression of some targets. In Watanabe et al., we show that repression of the <italic>Fgf10</italic> genes is direct. Consistent with an early repressive role for NKX2-5, cardiac reprogramming of fibroblasts is stimulated by expression of MEF2C, GATA4 and TBX5 but inhibited by NKX2-5 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ieda et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>These results are consistent with our observations that the majority of NKX2-5 target genes discovered by DamID are positively regulated and with the apparent co-localisation of (the majority of) NKX2-5 protein with active histone marks. However, our immunofluorescence results do not exclude a repressive role for NKX2-5 and indeed show that some NKX2-5 protein does not localise with active histone marks. Overall, it is clear that there is a repressive role for NKX2-5 on some genes, specifically progenitor genes, including <italic>Id3</italic>.</p><p>We have modified the text in the subsection headed “Probing the mechanisms of CHD using DamID” to make these issues clearer.</p><p><italic>7) Results are mentioned for NF1-B1/3 (in the fourth paragraph of the subsection headed “DamID identification of NKX2-5 WT targets”) but the in vivo significance of this is not clear and the factors are not integrated into the gene regulatory network (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>). Is it necessary to include this?</italic></p><p>The co-enrichment of NKX2-5 and NF1 motifs and the physical interaction between NKX2-5 and NF1-B1/3 suggests that these factors co-operate to regulate NKX2-5 targets. However, we have not yet investigated this relationship further. This will be the subject of further studies. We include these data here because the NF1 motif is the third most overrepresented DNA motif in NKX2-5 peaks, after the known NKX2-5 motif (NKE) and the GATA4 motifs.</p><p><italic>8) It is not clear that the ELK complex is playing a highly important role. It only came up towards the bottom of the motif enrichment shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 2</italic></xref><italic>. The authors should explain why they chose to concentrate on the association of this complex with NKX2-5. The authors claim that the GO analysis shows that SRF and ELK1/4 regulate many cellular functions. This may be the case, although target genes appear to be expressed at a low level in the heart, suggesting that the major impact of these factors may be in the hijacking phenomenon? In the absence of complete transcriptome studies and functional promoter analysis statements about the importance of the role of the ELK complex should be qualified (see also point 4)</italic>.</p><p>We chose to focus on ETS transcription factors because the known ETS motif was significantly enriched in NKX2-5∆HD C-set peaks compared to random peaks and occurred most frequently (in 42% of NKX2-5∆HD C-set peaks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>). We specifically chose ELK factors since they have been indirectly associated with cardiogenesis previously (see point below). Overall, the GO analysis of SRF and ELK1/4 targets showed generic cellular functions such as cytoskeletal organization and RNA processing, with the level of expression of these genes in heart being low. The point is that these ancient TFs are broadly or ubiquitously expressed and are not wholly dedicated to the cardiac-specific functions. However, they have been co-opted to regulate certain cardiac genes. It is our hypothesis that ubiquitous factors of this sort provide vital signalling inputs into the cardiac network. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that ELK1/4 can guide NKX2-5∆HD to off-targets that include the non-cardiac targets of ELK factors.</p><p>We clarify the occurrence and enrichment (relative to random peaks) of the ETS motifs in the second paragraph of the subsection headed “ETS factor binding sites are enriched in NKX2-5∆HD off-targets”.</p><p><italic>Concerning the role of ETS factors in cardiogenesis, the highly relevant paper of Woznica et al.
