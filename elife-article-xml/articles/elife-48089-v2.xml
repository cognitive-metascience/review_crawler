Recent studies characterizing individual enhancers have revealed their potential to direct heterologous gene expression in a highly cell-type-specific manner. However, it has not yet been possible to systematically identify and test the function of enhancers for each of the many cell types in an organism. We have developed PESCA, a scalable and generalizable method that leverages ATAC- and single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols, to characterize cell-type-specific enhancers that should enable genetic access and perturbation of gene function across mammalian cell types. Focusing on the highly heterogeneous mammalian cerebral cortex, we apply PESCA to find enhancers and generate viral reagents capable of accessing and manipulating a subset of somatostatin-expressing cortical interneurons with high specificity. This study demonstrates the utility of this platform for developing new cell-type-specific viral reagents, with significant implications for both basic and translational research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>AAV</kwd><kwd>cell-type-specific</kwd><kwd>somatostatin</kwd><kwd>PESCA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1MH11408101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenberg</surname><given-names>Michael E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32AG000222-23</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hrvatin</surname><given-names>Sinisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagy</surname><given-names>M Aurel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH107620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harvey</surname><given-names>Christopher D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS089521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harvey</surname><given-names>Christopher D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS108410</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harvey</surname><given-names>Christopher D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009559</institution-id><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vertex Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008601</institution-id><institution>Charles A.

Importantly, characterization of individual enhancers has revealed their potential to direct highly cell-type-specific gene expression in both endogenous and heterologous contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Graybuck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">JÃ¼ttner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mich et al., 2019</xref>), making them ideal for developing tools to access, study, and manipulate virtually any mammalian cell type.</p><p>Despite recent success in cataloging the gene expression profiles of distinct cell subpopulations in the nervous system, our limited ability to specifically access these subpopulations hinders the study of their function. For example, the mammalian cerebral cortex is composed of over one hundred cell types, most of which cannot be individually accessed using existing tools. Glutamatergic excitatory neuron cell types propagate electrical signals across neural circuits, whereas GABAergic inhibitory interneuron cell types play an essential role in cortical signal processing by modulating neuronal activity, balancing excitability, and gating information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MarÃ­n, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>). Although relatively lower in abundance than excitatory neurons, interneurons are highly diverse; for example, somatostatin-expressing cortical interneurons comprise several anatomically, electrophysiologically, and molecularly defined cell types whose dysfunction is associated with neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MuÃ±oz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>). Given the vast diversity of cell types in the brain, and the inability of our current tools to access most neuronal cell types, enhancer-driven viral reagents have the potential to become the next generation of cell-type-specific transgenic tools enabling facile, inexpensive, cross-species, and targeted observation and functional study of neuronal cellÂ types and circuits.</p><p>Despite the potential of cell-type-specific enhancers to revolutionize neuroscience research, cell-type-restricted gene regulatory elements (GREs) have not yet been systematically identified. Moreover, functional evaluation of candidate GRE-driven viral vector expression across all cell types in the tissue ofÂ interestÂ is currently laborious, expensive, and low-throughput, typically relying on the production of individual viral vectors and the assessment of expression across a limited number of cell types by in situ hybridization or immunofluorescence. The lack of a generalizable platform for rapid identification and functional testing of cell-type-specific enhancers is therefore a critical bottleneck impeding the generation of new viral reagents required to elucidate the function of each cell type in a complex organism.</p><p>To address these issues, we merged the principles of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hartl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Inoue et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Melnikov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murtha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Patwardhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 2016</xref>) with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hrvatin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stroud et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>), and developed a Paralleled Enhancer Single Cell Assay (PESCA) to identify and functionally assess the <italic>specificity</italic> of hundreds of GREs across the full complement of cell types present in the brain. In the PESCA protocol, the expression of a barcoded pool of AAV vectors harboring GREs is analyzed by single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to evaluate the specificity of each constituent GRE across tens of thousands of individual cells in the target tissue, through the use of an orthogonal cell-indexed system of transcript barcoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48089.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental strategy and GRE selection.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Paralleled Enhancer Single Cell Assay (PESCA).Â Comparative ATAC-Seq is used to identify candidate GREs.

As described below, our findings highlight the utility of PESCA for identifying viral constructs that drive gene expression selectively in a subset of neurons and establish PESCA as a platform of broad interest to the research and gene therapy community, potentially enabling the generation of cell-type-specific AAVs for virtually any cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GRE selection and library construction</title><p>To identify candidate SST interneuron-restricted gene regulatory elements (GREs), we carried out comparative epigenetic profiling of the three largest classes of cortical interneurons: somatostatin (SST)-, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cells. To this end, we employed the recently developed Isolation of Nuclei Tagged in specific Cell Types (INTACT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mo et al., 2015</xref>) method to isolate purified chromatin from of each of these cell types from the cerebral cortex of adult (6â10 week-old) mice. The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-Seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>), which identifies nucleosome-depleted gene regulatory regions, was then used to identify genomic regions with enhanced accessibility (i.e., peaks) in the SST (nÂ =Â 57,932), PV (nÂ =Â 61,108), and VIP (nÂ =Â 79,124) chromatin samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). These datasets can be used as a resource to identify putative gene regulatory elements as candidates for driving cell-type-specific gene expression for the numerous subtypes of SST, PV or VIP-expressing intraneurons across diverse cortical regions.</p><p>To enrich for GREs that could be useful reagents to study and manipulate interneurons across mammalian species, including humans, we started with an expanded list of 323,369 genomic coordinates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) representing a union of cortical neuron ATAC-seq-accessible regions identified across dozens of experiments in our laboratory (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods, Stroud et al., manuscript in preparation). We first filtered this initial set of 323,369 genomic coordinates to exclude GREs with poor mammalian sequence conservation (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The remaining 36,215 genomic regions were ranked by an enrichment of ATAC-seq signal in the SST samples over PV/VIP (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods), and the top 287 most enriched GREs were selected for functional screening to identify enhancers that drive gene expression selectively in SST interneurons of the primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>A PCR-based strategy was used to simultaneously amplify and barcode each GRE from mouse genomic DNA (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). To minimize sequencing bias due to the choice of barcode sequence, each GRE was paired with three unique barcode sequences. The resulting library of 861 GRE-barcode pairs was pooled and cloned into an AAV-based expression vector, with the GRE element inserted 5â to a promoter driving a GFP expression cassette and the GRE-paired barcode sequences inserted into the 3â untranslated region (UTR) of the GRE-driven transcript (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This configuration was chosen to maximize the retrieval of the barcode sequence during single-cell RNA sequencing, which primarily captures the 3â end of transcripts. The human beta-globin promoter was chosen since it has previously been used in conjunction with an enhancer to drive strong and specific expression in cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>), although the modular cloning strategy is compatible with the use of other promoters. The library was packaged into AAV9, which exhibits broad neural tropism and has previously been used to drive payload expression in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cearley and Wolfe, 2006</xref>). The complexity of the resulting rAAV-GRE library was then confirmed by next generation sequencing, detecting 802 of the 861 barcodes (93.1%), corresponding to 285 of the 287 GREs (99.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48089.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PESCA screen identifies GREs highly enriched for SST<sup>+</sup> interneurons.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) PESCA library plasmid map.Â ITR, inverted terminal repeats; GRE, gene regulatory element; pr, HBB minimal promoter; int, intron; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WPRE, Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus post-transcriptional regulatory element; BAR, 10-mer sequence barcode associated with each GRE; pA, polyadenylation signal.

Two adjacent injections (800 nL each) of the pooled AAV library (1Â ÃÂ 10<sup>13</sup> viral genomes/mL) were first administered to the primary visual cortex (V1) of two 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice. Twelve days following injection, the injected cortical regions were dissected and processed to generate a suspension of nuclei for snRNA-Seq using the inDrops platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zilionis et al., 2017</xref>) (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). A total of 32,335 nuclei were subsequently analyzed across the two animals, recovering an average of 866 unique non-viral transcripts per nucleus, representing 610 unique genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2a,b</xref>).</p><p>Since droplet-based high-throughput snRNA-Seq samples the nuclear transcriptome with low sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klein et al., 2015</xref>), viral-derived transcripts were initially detected in only 3.9% of sampled nuclei. We therefore designed a modified PCR-based approach to enrich for barcode-containing viral transcripts, which yielded deep coverage of AAV-derived transcripts with simultaneous shallow coverage of the non-viral transcriptome. PCR enrichment increased the viral transcript recovery 382-fold in the sampled nuclei, to an average of 15.6 unique viral transcripts, 6.0 unique GRE-barcodes, and 5.7 unique GREs per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2c</xref>). Using this modified protocol, viral transcripts were identified across 86% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2d</xref>), with a high correlation (rÂ =Â 0.9, p&lt;2.2Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â16</sup>) observed between the abundance of each barcoded AAV in the library and the number of cells infected by that AAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2f</xref>), suggesting that GRE sequences did not alter viral tropism and that GRE-driven vectors had broadly similar levels of expression. Only 0.3 Â±0.06% (mean, stdev) of viral reads did not correspond to any of the known barcodes or could not be uniquely assigned to a barcode (within two mismatches), suggesting that this amplification strategy did not grossly change the composition of the viral library.</p><p>Nuclei were classified into ten cell types using graph-based clustering and expression of known marker genes (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The average expression of each viral-derived barcoded transcript was analyzed across all ten cell types, and an enrichment score was calculated from the ratio of expression in <italic>Sst<sup>+</sup></italic> nuclei compared to all <italic>Sst <sup>-</sup></italic> nuclei.

To assess how the abundance of each GRE in the library impacts our ability to detect cell-type-specific expression, we analyzed the specificity of each GRE as a function of the number of transcripts retrieved. We observed that highly abundant GRE-driven transcripts were more likely to be significantly enriched in SST<sup>+</sup> cells, suggesting that we may not have had sufficient power to assess the cell-type-specificity of the less abundant GREs in the library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5f</xref>). Consistent with this observation, computationally subsampling the numberÂ of viral transcripts across our most cell-type-specific GREs gradually reduced our ability to statistically detect their enrichment in <italic>Sst<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6</xref>). These observations suggest that the expression of sparsely detected GRE-driven transcripts may not be sufficient to allow evaluation of cell-type-specificity and that by increasing sequencing depth we may be able to screen and evaluate a larger number of GREs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>In situ characterization of rAAV-GRE reporter expression</title><p>We next sought to validate the cell-type-specificity of the resulting hits using methods that do not rely on single-cell sequencing-based approaches. To this end, we selected three of the top five viral drivers (GRE12, GRE22, GRE44), as well as a control viral construct lacking the GRE element (ÎGRE), for injection into V1 of adult transgenic Sst-Cre; Ai14 mice, in which SST<sup>+</sup> cells express the red fluorescent marker tdTomato (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Fluorescence analysis twelve days following injection with rAAV-[GRE12, GRE22 or GRE44]-GFP revealed strong yet sparse GFP labeling centered around cortical layers IV and V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3aâc</xref>). By contrast, the control rAAV-ÎGRE-GFP showed a strikingly different pattern of GFP expression concentrated around the sites of injection, with expression in a larger number of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Many rAAV-GRE12/22/44-GFP virally infected cells were SST-positive, as indicated by the high degree of overlapping GFP and tdTomato expression: 90.7 Â± 2.1% for rAAV-GRE12-GFP (170 cells, four animals); 72.9 Â± 4.2% for rAAV-GRE22-GFP (1164 cells, three animals), and 95.8 Â± 0.6% for rAAV-GRE44-GFP (759 cells, four animals). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, we observed that 27.2 Â± 1.9% of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells also expressed tdTomato following rAAV-ÎGRE-GFP infection (2066 cells, three animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,f</xref>). Although the 27.2% overlap between rAAV-ÎGRE-GFP expression and SST<sup>+</sup> cells suggests that our vector has some baseline preference for SST<sup>+</sup> interneurons, the insertion of GRE12, GRE22 and GRE44 serves to effectively restrict AAV payload expression to SST<sup>+</sup> interneurons. To show that our viral backbone could drive expression in non-SST cell types with the appropriate enhancer, we cloned the mDlx5/6 enhancer whose expression was restricted to a broader population of inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>). We injected the rAAV2/9-mDlx5/6-GFP vector into Sst-Cre; Ai14 mice and observed that 57.1% of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were not positive for tdTomato (1977 cells, three animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>It is notable that the GREs seemingly not only promote expression in SST<sup>+</sup> cells but also greatly reduce background expression in SST<sup>-</sup> cells, indicating both enhancer and repressor functionality. Consistent with this hypothesis, the incorporation of GRE12, GRE22 and GRE44 into the rAAV both increased the number of SST<sup>+</sup> GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (1.7â2-fold) and dramatically (3â32-fold) decreased the number of SST<sup>-</sup> cells that expressed GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

This represents a significant advancement over current approaches to viral vector design, as it enables the rapid in vivo screening of hundreds of GREs for enhanced cell-type-specificity without needing transgenic tools to evaluate their specificity. In this study, we applied PESCA to identify enhancer elements that robustly and specifically drive gene expression in a rare SST<sup>+</sup> population of GABAergic interneurons in the mouse central nervous system, although further work is needed to identify which specific molecular subtypes of SST interneurons are targeted. Since the vectors used in this PESCA screen in the absence of GREs show broad expression in the murine V1, the GREs we identified likely function to both enhance and restrict viral expression by a mechanism that remains to be explored.</p><p>In the future, several factors should be considered to facilitate the further optimization of the PESCA methodology for the development of cell-type-specific vectors. The selection of candidate GREs for screening will benefit from the systematic profiling of additional cell types by traditional or single-cell ATAC-Seq methods. In this regard, consideration of a published ATAC-Seq dataset from excitatory neuronsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mo et al., 2015</xref>) could have served to refine our starting GRE set by excluding approximately half of the screened GREs from our initial pool. This is particularly relevant insofar as the ability to assess the GRE library depends on the number of cells sequenced from the target and non-target populations and the sequencing depth, as the coverage of each GRE will be inversely proportional to the number of GREs screened. In the screen described here, we estimate having sufficient power to assess approximately 2/3 of the 287 GREs at the reported sequencing depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>If a robust method of specifically isolating RNA from the target cell population is available, screening the PESCA library by sequencing pooled RNA from all target versus all non-target cells would provide aÂ less expensive and potentially more scalable approach. However, by averaging across multiple non-target cell types, such an approach could be confounded by the presence of rare, highly expressing non-target cells.</p><p>Finally, once candidate PESCA hits have been identified, we suggest evaluating several follow-up assays at multiple titers to identify which among these hits have the desired intensity and specificity of protein expression. In this regard, the snRNA-seq PESCA screen identified GRE12, GRE22 and GRE44 as 8.3-, 9.1- and 7.2-fold more highly expressed in SST<sup>+</sup> compared to SST<sup>-</sup> cells,Â respectively, whereas these GREs showed distinct specificity for SST<sup>+</sup> cells (91%, 73% and 96% respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) when evaluated at the protein level, a finding which could be attributed to a variety of factors.</p><p>Given current evidence that the mechanisms of gene regulatory element function are conserved across tissues and species, it is likely that PESCA can be readily applied to other neuronal or non-neuronal cell types, diverse model organisms, tissues, and viral types. Moreover, single-cell screening approaches are not limited to GRE screening; PESCAÂ can be easily adapted to assess the cell-type-specificity of viral capsid variants or other mutable aspects of viral design. Indeed, the PESCA library cloning strategy is largely vector- and capsid-independent, allowing for the use of different promoters or serotypes. Our choice of capsid and promoter was driven by previous work using AAV9 and the minimal beta-globin promoter to drive expression in cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>). However, different capsids or promoter may be preferred for targeting other cell types.</p><p>In conclusion, our study addresses the urgent practical need for new tools to access, study, and manipulate specific cell types across complex tissues, organ systems, and animal models by providing a screening platform that can be used to rapidly supply such tools as needed. Moreover, as the promise of gene therapy to treat and cure a broad range of diseases is being realized, PESCA has the potential to pave the way for a new generation of targeted gene therapy vehicles for diseases with cell-type-specific etiologies, such as congenital blindness, deafness, cystic fibrosis, and spinal muscular atrophy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Sst</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">NCBI Gene ID: 20604</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Sst-IRES-Cre</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory <break/>Stock # 013044</td><td valign="top">IMSR Cat# JAX:013044, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:013044">IMSR_JAX:013044</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Vip-IRES-Cre</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory <break/>Stock # 010908</td><td valign="top">IMSR Cat# JAX:010908, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:010908">IMSR_JAX:010908</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Pv-Cre</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory <break/>Stock # 017320</td><td valign="top">IMSR Cat# JAX:017320, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:017320">IMSR_JAX:017320</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SUN1-2xsfGFP-6xMYC</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory <break/>Stock # 021039</td><td valign="top">IMSR Cat# JAX:021039, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:021039">IMSR_JAX:021039</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Ai14</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory <break/>Stock # 007914</td><td valign="top">IMSR Cat# JAX:007914, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007914">IMSR_JAX:007914</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">High Efficiency NEB 5-alpha</td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs</td><td valign="top">C2987H</td><td valign="top">Competent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-GFP (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat# G10362;

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents a method to screen sequences for the ability to drive cell type-specific gene expression in the brain. The authors cleverly bring together three recent genomic technologies (cell type-specific ATAC-Seq, single nucleus RNA-Seq, massively parallel reporter assays) to screen for regulatory elements that can drive cell type-specific gene expression. Improved tools to mark specific cell types across mammalian model organisms have the potential to accelerate research by reducing reliance on transgenic mouse models. The technique presented in this manuscript is a substantial improvement over previous methods, which rely upon laboriously screening individual candidates. The proof of principle, a set of gene regulatory sequences which can drive expression in SST neurons, is itself a useful tool that is likely to be used by a number of neuroscience research groups.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Specificity of the approach: 27% of neurons expressing GFP with the Î´-GRE vector are positive for Td-Tomato in the reporter mice, which is much higher than the% of SST neurons in V1. These data suggest the base vector may have some preference for SST neurons on its own. To justify the method as a general strategy to target multiple cell types, the authors should show whether the same base vector can be used in combination with enhancers from other cell types to drive GFP expression in those cells. Another alternative would be to find another base vector that does not have the SST preference without a GRE added and then show that these GREs still restrict expression to SST cells. Finally if the GREs need to work in combination with regulatory elements from the specific vector used here to direct expression to SST cells the results would still be useful, but the readers would need to know this, as it would suggest that the strategy might not work for other cell types with this vector.</p><p>2) Sensitivity of the approach: The reviewers raised question about whether the method works &quot;somewhat well&quot;, &quot;very well&quot; or is a &quot;broadly useful and scalable platform&quot;. To address these questions, more detail is needed about the level of replication across the injected animals â are the data from each animal very similar or very different? Knowing this will be useful for anyone hoping to use this technique. It would be further helpful if the authors could conduct some analysis to determine the viral concentration required to identify a positive vector in the screen. The ideal experiment (spiking in positive control vectors a different concentrations) might take too much time, but reanalysis of their data could be quite valuable (like showing the concentration of all vectors that were positive vs. negative, or where there was disagreement in the three barcodes did it correspond to the library concentration?). Finally, the authors should discuss in more detail, what are the limitations of the current method and how might it be improved? It seems from the text as if the particular single nuclear sequencing method was one weak point due to the very low sensitivity of the method. Could the authors have done as well or better (and proceeded faster) using a more robust sequencing method with pooled nuclei and then screening more candidates? Especially because this is an article for the tools and resources section, a critical and forward-looking Discussion section would make the paper highly valuable to the readership.</p><p>3) Subpopulations of SST cells: The reviewers all felt that more data was needed for the authors to conclude that they have labeled a specific subpopulation of SST cells. One possibility is that the virally infected and SST reporter neurons are different from one another because of viral infection. The authors could rule out this possibility experimentally, for example using a low titer non cell-type specific AAV to infect the cortex of SST reporter mice and then compare virally infected to uninfected neurons in the same layers recorded here. Another possibility is that the authors could do more detailed molecular characterization to establish what cell types are being labeled by their vector (snRNA-seq or other method). Through scRNA-seq (Tasic et al.), many of the SST subtypes are now known at high resolution. The authors could use other information (e.g. morphology, marker expression) that is already known about subtypes of SST neurons in addition to layer information to further support their argument that this is a specific subtype of SST cells. Finally we discussed the possibility that the authors could simply drop the claim that this is a subset of SST cells if it cannot be further supported. We do not favor this option as we think the readership of <italic>eLife</italic> will be very interested in new data supporting the existence of subtypes and the utility of these enhancers to target them. However if the authors are unable to provide further data to support the claim, simply removing it from the manuscript would not undermine the publishability of the study.</p><p>4) The sequences of the GREs discovered and tested should be reported in the supplementary material of the revised manuscript prior to publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48089.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Specificity of the approach: 27% of neurons expressing GFP with the Î´-GRE vector are positive for Td-Tomato in the reporter mice, which is much higher than the% of SST neurons in V1.

To address whether the same vector can be used to target other cell types, we took the reviewerâs experimental suggestion and cloned the mDlx5/6 enhancer (Dimidschstein et al., 2016) into the PESCA vector, and showed that the resulting vector expression pattern resembles the previously reported one. We reported this experiment as follows: âTo show that not all the enhancers exhibited strong SST-specificity using our viral vector, we cloned the mDlx5/6 enhancer whose expression was restricted to a broader population of inhibitory neurons. We injected the rAAV2/9-mDlx5/6-GFP vector and observed that 42.9% of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were also positive for tdTomato (1977 cells, 3 animals, Figure 3âfigure supplement 2).â</p><p>Since we do not, at this time, have access to other cell-type- or cell-class-specific enhancers, we wanted to highlight a recent bioRxiv preprint (Graybuck et al., 2019) which reports combining enhancers with the minimal Î²-globin promoter to achieve cell-type-specific expression in cortical L5 excitatory neurons. This study appears to use the same promoter as our PESCA construct, suggesting that our PESCA construct could likely be used to target other neuronal cell types.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the AAV tropism and perhaps the choice of the promoter affects the pattern of expression. In an extreme case, if an AAV serotype does not infect the cell type of interest, a PESCA screen will likely fail to identify GREs capable of driving expression in that cell type.</p><p>We added a Discussion section to the paper highlighting these considerations and noting that while our base AAV9 vector appears to have a broad pattern of expression across the V1 cortex, it may not be appropriate for all PESCA screens. While these considerations of viral tropism and choice of promoter are not unique to our approach and apply to all viral tools, the challenges of generating a cell-type-specific viral vector for any cell type in the body, highlights, in our view, the value of an approach such as PESCA, which can be extended to screen through combinations of enhancers, promoters as well as viral serotypes to identify the optimal cell-type-specific vector. To this end, weâve made our PESCA library cloning strategy largely vector-independent and modular such that different promoters can be tested if needed by changing the final cloning step, or different serotypes by repackaging the final library. We have highlighted these considerations in the discussion: âIndeed, the PESCA library cloning strategy is largely vector- and capsid-independent, allowing for the use of different promoters or serotypes. Our choice of capsid and promoter was driven by previous work using AAV9 and the minimal beta-globin promoter to drive expression in cortical interneurons, however, different capsids or promoter may be preferred for targeting other cell types.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Sensitivity of the approach: The reviewers raised question about whether the method works &quot;somewhat well&quot;, &quot;very well&quot; or is a &quot;broadly useful and scalable platform&quot;.

We have now included data regarding the correlation in enrichment scores across animals: âAs expected, a high correlation was observed between GRE-specific enrichment scores across two animals (r = 0.54, p &lt; 2.2Ã10<sup>-16</sup>) (Figure 2âfigure supplement 5B)â.</p><p>We further analyzed our data and now report and discuss the relationship between the number of GRE transcripts detected and the measured specificity: âTo assess how the abundance of each GRE in the library impacts our ability to detect cell-type-specific expression, we analyzed the specificity of each GRE as a function of the number of transcripts that we retrieved. We observed that highly abundant GRE-driven transcripts were more likely to be significantly enriched in SST<sup>+</sup> cells suggesting that we may not have had sufficient power to assess the cell-type-specificity of the less abundant GREs in the library. (Figure 2âfigure supplement 5F).</p><p>We also highlight this point further as a part of our Discussion: ââ¦This is particularly relevant insofar as the ability to assess the GRE library depends on the number of cells sequenced from the target and non-target populations and the sequencing depth. In the screen described here, we estimate having sufficient power to assess approximately 2/3 of the 287 GREs at the reported sequencing depth (Figure 2âfigure supplement 5).â</p><p>We also performed an analysis in which we computationally subsampled the counts from our top 5 viral hits to determine the sequencing depth at which we lose the ability to detect them as significantly enriched in SST+ cells: ââ¦Consistent with this observation, computationally subsampling the number viral transcripts across our most cell-type-specific GREs gradually reduced our ability to statistically detect their enrichment in Sst<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure 2âfigure supplement 6). These observations suggest that the expression of sparsely detected GRE-driven transcripts may not be sufficient to allow evaluation of cell-type-specificity and that by increasing sequencing depth we may be able to screen and evaluate of a larger number of GREs.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors should discuss in more detail, what are the limitations of the current method and how might it be improved?

[â¦] In this regard, the snRNA-seq PESCA screen identified GRE12, GRE22 and GRE44 as, respectively, 8.3-, 9.1- and 7.2-fold more highly expressed in SST<sup>+</sup> compared to SST<sup>-</sup> cells, whereas these GREs showed distinct specificity for SST<sup>+</sup> cells (91%, 73% and 96% respectively, Figure 3F) when evaluated at the protein level, a finding which could be attributed to a variety of factors.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subpopulations of SST cells: The reviewers all felt that more data was needed for the authors to conclude that they have labeled a specific subpopulation of SST cells.

However if the authors are unable to provide further data to support the claim, simply removing it from the manuscript would not undermine the publishability of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Per reviewersâ suggestion we carried out in situ hybridization to identify whether GRE44 expression is enriched in any of the four major molecularly-defined SST<sup>+</sup> subsets (CrH<sup>+</sup>, Nos1<sup>+</sup>, Hpse<sup>+</sup> or Nr2f2<sup>+</sup> cells)(Tasic et al., 2018). To detect the expression of the viral RNA, we used probes against the Gfp and the Wpre sequence. During our analysis, we observed two distinct patters of Wpre staining: A largely cytoplasmic signal which overlapped with many Sst<sup>+</sup> cells and a punctate nuclear signal which appeared in a broader set of cells. The latter signal may be due to the in situ probe binding to the viral genome, the viral RNA, or both. Because this punctate signal appears in a broad set of cells including Sst<sup>-</sup> cells (and therefore does not correspond well to the distribution of GFP protein expression), we are hesitant to further pursue the RNAscope approach to analyze the specificity of GRE44 expression before we fully understand the origin of these signals. Since the reviewersâ discussed these experiments as optional, we have instead removed claims that the GRE44 virus drives cell-type-specific expression in a discrete subpopulation of somatostatin interneurons. For example, we removed: âand raising the possibility that these GREs may restrict expression to a specific subtype(s) of SST<sup>+</sup> interneuronsâ and we clarified: âAlthough we cannot confirm that GRE44 expression is restricted to an individual subtype of SST interneurons, our electrophysiology experiments further emphasize the potential of PESCA to target functionally distinct subgroups of previously defined interneuron types.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The sequences of the GREs discovered and tested should be reported in the supplementary material of the revised manuscript prior to publication.</p></disp-quote><p>The genomic coordinates for all the GREs tested and the full sequences of the GRE12/22/44-GFP vectors are now reported in Supplementary file 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
