unexplored. Here we describe a mechanism by which Mfn2, a mitochondria-ER tether, gates the autophagic turnover of mitochondria by PINK1 and parkin. Mitochondria-ER appositions are destroyed during mitophagy, and reducing mitochondria-ER contacts increases the rate of mitochondrial degradation. Mechanistically, parkin/PINK1 catalyze a rapid burst of Mfn2 phosphoubiquitination to trigger p97-dependent disassembly of Mfn2 complexes from the outer mitochondrial membrane, dissociating mitochondria from the ER. We additionally demonstrate that a major portion of the facilitatory effect of p97 on mitophagy is epistatic to Mfn2 and promotes the availability of other parkin substrates such as VDAC1. Finally, we reconstitute the action of these factors on Mfn2 and VDAC1 ubiquitination in a cell-free assay. We show that mitochondria-ER tethering suppresses mitophagy and describe a parkin-/PINK1-dependent mechanism that regulates the destruction of mitochondria-ER contact sites.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>contact site</kwd><kwd>mitophagy</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Canada Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McLelland</surname><given-names>Gian-Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Foundation Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fon</surname><given-names>Edward A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A crucial step during the mitophagy cascade involves the disassembly of connections between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum via the retrotranslocation of Mfn2 tethering complexes by the Parkinson's disease genes PARKIN and PINK1, as well as the ATPase VCP/p97.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Loss of <italic>PRKN</italic> or <italic>PINK1</italic> results in an early-onset form of hereditary Parkinson’s disease (PD), a neurological disorder that is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kitada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Valente et al., 2004</xref>). Accordingly, parkin and PINK1 promote mitochondrial health through several mitochondrial quality control mechanisms; the turnover of outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) proteins by the proteasome, the generation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles, and whole-organellar degradation by mitophagy, a form of selective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sugiura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamano et al., 2016</xref>). During mitophagy, PINK1, a mitochondrial kinase, builds up on the surface of damaged mitochondria where it activates parkin directly via phosphorylation and allosterically through the generation of phosphoubiquitin (pUb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kazlauskaite et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kondapalli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koyano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2012</xref>). Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, mediates the ubiquitination of resident OMM proteins, recruiting Ub-binding autophagic machinery through a feed-forward mechanism to ultimately degrade the organelle via the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ordureau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ordureau et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Contact sites between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) act as crucial signaling hubs in the context of non-selective, starvation-induced autophagy, where they serve as the site of autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kishi-Itakura et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, autophagosome biogenesis is impaired in cells with defective mitochondria-ER tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>), as lipid transfer between organelles may be important for their formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hailey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klecker et al., 2014</xref>). As steady-state mitophagy in yeast requires mitochondria-ER contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Böckler and Westermann, 2014</xref>), it has been assumed that parkin-dependent mitophagy follows a similar mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoshii and Mizushima, 2015</xref>). However, this model directly conflicts with the observation that mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) – a mitochondria-ER tether required for starvation-induced autophagosome formation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Naon et al., 2016</xref>) – is ubiquitinated by parkin and rapidly turned over by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, how mitophagy is regulated by contacts between mitochondria and the ER (if at all), and the location from which the mitophagic membrane originates, remain open questions in the field.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Parkin and PINK1 destroy mitochondria-ER contact during mitophagy</title><p>We hypothesized that PINK1 and parkin may regulate contact between both organelles during mitophagy, based on studies demonstrating high levels of parkin ubiquitination activity on Mfn2 in both cells and <italic>in organello</italic> ubiquitination assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). To first determine whether parkin destroys the OMM-ER interface of depolarized mitochondria, we analyzed contacts between the two organelles by electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Csordás et al., 2006</xref>). We quantified ER tubules within 100 nm of the OMM, as this distance is enough to capture tubules closely associated with the OMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel and inset). To induce PINK1-/parkin-mediated mitophagy, we treated U2OS cells stably-expressing GFP-parkin (U2OS:GFP-parkin) and control U2OS:GFP cells with CCCP for four hours, and observed by EM a decrease the total length of ER-OMM contact in both cell lines, although this decrease was greater in magnitude in cells expressing GFP-parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, quantified in 1B). However, when CCCP-induced, parkin-independent mitochondrial fragmentation was taken into account (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), parkin had a specific effect on reducing the percentage of the OMM that remained in contact with the ER in depolarized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as well as the percentage of total mitochondria that were still connected to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This effect was robust, as repeating our quantification using a variety of interorganellar tethering lengths – ER-OMM distances of 100, 50 and 25 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) – pointed us to the same conclusion; parkin disrupts mitochondria-ER contact upon activation of mitophagy. Indeed, this effect was indiscriminate in that it was not selective for one subset of ER-OMM distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, the subsets of remaining contacts observed after the ~75% reduction in CCCP-treated, GFP-parkin-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) were biased towards longer interorganellar distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), consistent with parkin driving the OMM and ER apart. Given that the mitochondria observed in our EM analyses were still intact organelles and not yet engulfed by the isolation membrane (IM) of the autophagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel), we concluded that parkin ablates contact between mitochondria and the ER as an early step during depolarization-induced mitophagy in cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32866.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ultrastructural analysis of ER-mitochondria contact during mitophagy in U2OS cells and dopaminergic neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative TEM images of mitochondria (‘M’) in contact with ER (pseudocoloured blue) in untreated and CCCP-treated U2OS:GFP-parkin cells.

Parkin has been reported, through its ability to ubiquitinate OMM proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation, to eventually mediate the rupture of the OMM prior to or during engulfment by the autophagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoshii et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, we observed rare (likely transient) mitochondrial structures where we believed OMM rupture to be occurring at the time of fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, the blue arrowheads indicate the limits of OMM rupture, where the organelle is being wrapped by the IM [indicated by the broken green line]). Concordantly, ER contacts with the still-intact OMM were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, red arrowheads), leading us to postulate that the removal of OMM-ER contacts may precede OMM rupture. To this end, we quantified ER-OMM contacts in CCCP-treated cells that were co-incubated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which stabilizes the unmodified band of OMM parkin substrates, including Mfn2, and prevents rupture of the OMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rakovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoshii et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, GFP-parkin<sup>C431S</sup>, which cannot ligate Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trempe et al., 2013</xref>), is used as a negative control). MG132 co-incubation rescued ER-OMM contact in U2OS:GFP-parkin cells treated with CCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I and J</xref>). As expected, we also prevented OMM-ER disruption in cells depleted of PINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I and J</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we replicated our U2OS cell data in induced pluriopotent stem cell (iPSC) -derived dopaminergic (iDA) neurons isolated from either control individuals or a patient carrying compound heterozygous deletions in the <italic>PRKN</italic> gene (<italic>PRKN</italic><sup>del</sup>; see Materials and methods). iDA neuronal cultures express endogenous parkin at a level comparable to that in the cytosolic fraction from mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), as well as the catecholinergic marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Full-length parkin was undetectable in <italic>PRKN</italic><sup>del</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), as expected given the genetic background of this line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grünewald et al., 2010</xref>). Upon treatment of these neurons with CCCP for only one hour, we observed Mfn2 ubiquitination in both control lines but not in the parkin deletion line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). When we analyzed mitochondria-ER appositions in these cells, we again observed a CCCP-dependent decrease in the amount of &lt;100 nm ER-OMM appositions in both control lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N and O</xref>). However, this decrease was absent in the parkin deletion line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N and O</xref>), supporting our previous overexpression data in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A to E</xref> ). Thus, PINK1 and parkin function to destroy contacts between the ER and mitochondria during mitophagy, likely through parkin-mediated OMM protein ubiquitination and turnover, as this process can be prevented by inhibiting proteasomal degradation. Moreover, this is a relevant biological process in human dopamine neurons, where it is regulated by endogenous parkin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phosphoubiquitination of Mfn2 by the PINK1/parkin system disrupts its antagonistic effect on mitophagy</title><p>Our EM data demonstrated that ER-mitochondria uncoupling occurs as an early step in the mitophagy pathway, prior to autophagosomal engulfment of the organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), and we sought to understand the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon. Mfn2 is both a mitochondria-ER tether and parkin ubiquitination substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sarraf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>), and thus the modulation of interorganellar contact by PINK1/parkin may occur through their effect on Mfn2. We began by examining the ubiquitination (via the disappearance of the unmodified band) of various parkin substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sarraf et al., 2013</xref>) during a CCCP time course in U2OS:GFP-parkin cells, using the A320R mutant – which fails to bind pUb and initiate mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wauer et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamano et al., 2015</xref>) – as a negative control. Turnover of both Mfn1 and Mfn2 occurred early (almost complete disappearance by two hours) compared to other OMM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Upon higher exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) of these immunoblots (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we observed a rapid ‘burst’ of Mfn2 ubiquitination that occurred between 30 and 60 min CCCP. When compared to TOM20, a protein that is not promptly ubiquitinated by parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sarraf et al., 2013</xref>), the rapidity of this Ub burst on Mfn2 was emphasized as TOM20 ubiquitination occurs gradually over a period of hours, rather than rapidly over a period of minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, ubiquitination of the mitofusins is one of the very first steps after the induction of mitophagy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32866.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mfn2 is rapidly phosphoubiquitinated upon induction of mitophagy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of protein turnover in glucose-maintained U2OS:GFP-parkin WT and A320R cells treated with 20 μM CCCP for the indicated time.

To test this, we first immunoprecipitated WT or A320R GFP-parkin from cells treated with CCCP over time. We observed robust coimmunoprecipitation of ubiquitinated Mfn1 and Mfn2 with GFP-parkin<sup>WT</sup> at one hour CCCP (corresponding to the Ub burst observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), with no apparent binding at four hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), likely due to turnover of the Mfns by the proteasome at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>]). When we analyzed other parkin substrates that are ubiquitinated less rapidly than the Mfns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we observed binding to WT parkin only at four hours of CCCP treatment in the case of ubiquitinated Miro1, and binding of mono-ubiquitinated HK1 at one hour CCCP, which was further shifted at four hours, indicative of processivity of HK1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). None of these ubiquitinated species coimmunoprecipitated with GFP-parkin<sup>A320R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To confirm that GFP-parkin was indeed binding ubiquitinated Mfn2, we treated GFP-parkin immunoprecipitates from CCCP-treated cells with Usp2 deubiquitinase (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which is active on both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Ub chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wauer et al., 2015b</xref>), and observed the release of Mfn2 from the parkin-bound bead fraction into the supernatant after separation by centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results strongly suggested that, early on in the mitophagy pathway, parkin was binding ubiquitinated Mfn2, likely through interactions with pUb moieties.</p><p>We next confirmed the phosphoubiquitination of Mfn2 during mitochondrial depolarization. When we immunoprecipitated Mfn2 from U2OS:GFP-parkin<sup>WT</sup> cells that were treated with CCCP for one hour, we detected Ub-modified species by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This was concomitant with a decrease in overall Mfn2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), owing to its proteasomal turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Liquid-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) confirmed that the Mfn2 immunoprecipitation contained pS65 Ub selectively in the CCCP-treated condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), despite lower Mfn2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then confirmed that both pS65 and unphosphorylated Ub were covalently attached to Mfn2 by its precipitation under denaturing conditions and detecting pS65 Ub and total Ub by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Finally, profiting from the nanomolar affinity of the parkin R0RBR module for pS65 Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sauvé et al., 2015</xref>), we used GST-R0RBR to pull down phosphoubiquitinated species from CCCP-treated U2OS:GFP-parkin<sup>WT</sup> cell lysates. We again used the A320R mutant – which abolishes the parkin-pUb interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wauer et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamano et al., 2015</xref>) – as a negative control. In a CCCP-dependent manner, pS65 Ub, Ub and (shifted) Mfn2 could be detected in GST-R0RBR<sup>WT</sup> pulldowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Strikingly, we did not observe any of these factors in pulldowns using GST-R0RBR<sup>A320R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Mfn2 is therefore phosphoubiquitinated and, taken together with our previous data, a burst of phosphoubiquitination – parkin-mediated ubiquitination coupled to PINK1-catalyzed phosphorylation – occurs on Mfn2 at an early time point in the mitophagy pathway.</p><p>Our observations so far demonstrated that mitochondria are separated from the ER during mitophagy, and that the OMM-ER tether Mfn2 is rapidly degraded at the onset of the pathway. We thus hypothesized that Mfn2 may antagonize mitophagy through its ability to tether mitochondria and the ER, necessitating its destruction. To test this, we silenced Mfn2 (siMfn2) in U2OS:GFP-parkin<sup>WT</sup> cells, as well as Mfn1 – which promotes mitochondrial fusion without any apparent role in interorganellar tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>) – to control for phenomena resulting from fusion defects. We confirmed Mfn1 and Mfn2 depletion by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and observed mitochondrial fragmentation in both siMfn1 and siMfn2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) with an ER-OMM apposition defect unique to the siMfn2 condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,C and D</xref>), as expected. Next, we investigated the kinetics of parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria in these cells (in our analyses, a cell is considered to have recruited parkin if the parkin signal covers the mitochondrial reticulum in its entirety). Moreover, we took advantage of delayed pathway kinetics of respiring cells by culturing cells in growth medium containing galactose as a carbon source (rather than glucose). This forces ATP generation through the electron transport chain and mitigates parkin-dependent mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCoy et al., 2014</xref>); mitochondrial translocation of parkin, and the buildup of Ub, p62 and LC3 on mitochondria are all slowed in galactose-grown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Remarkably, we observed faster mitochondrial recruitment in siMfn2 (but not siMfn1) cells, under both bioenergetic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). A significant difference was visible within one hour of CCCP treatment in glucose-cultured cells, and was exacerbated in their galactose-grown counterparts, owing to their slower kinetics in the control siRNA-transfected condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Strikingly, Mfn2 silencing increased recruitment in galactose-grown cells to levels seen in glucose-maintained cells transfected with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Silencing Mfn1 and Mfn2 simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>) did not further enhance the kinetics of parkin recruitment beyond single, Mfn2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>), implying that this phenotype was Mfn2-specific and unrelated to a loss of mitochondrial fusion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32866.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mfn2 antagonizes mitophagy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of whole-cell lysates from cells cultured in glucose or galactose transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting Mfn1 (‘siMfn1’) or Mfn2 (‘siMfn2’).

To test this, we silenced two other genes that have been shown to promote mitochondria-ER association; PACS2 and Stx17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arasaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simmen et al., 2005</xref>). Unlike Mfn2 knockdown, we did not observe mitochondrial fragmentation in either PACS2- or Stx17-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3F</xref>). When we tested parkin recruitment in these cells, we saw that, similarly to Mfn2 knockdown, silencing of either PACS2 (siPACS2) or Stx17 (siStx17) increased the translocation of parkin to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3G and H</xref>). Again, the increase was most pronounced in galactose-cultured cells that were treated with CCCP for one hour, where parkin was recruited to near-glucose levels in Mfn2-, PACS2- and Stx17-silenced cells despite remaining predominantly cytosolic in cells transfected with control siRNA at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3G and I</xref>). Thus, disruption of mitochondrion-ER tethering increases the kinetics of parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria.</p><p>We next directly tested the effect of Mfn2 depletion on mitochondrial turnover using quantitative, ratiometric measurements of mitochondrially-targeted mKeima (mtKeima), a protein that shifts its fluorescence excitation when acidified by the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katayama et al., 2011</xref>). We transfected U2OS cells stably-expressing mtKeima (U2OS:mtKeima), grown on either glucose or galactose, with siRNA targeting Mfn1 or Mfn2, followed by wild-type (WT) GFP-parkin, using the ligase-dead C431S mutant as a negative control. Next, we treated these cells with CCCP (or DMSO) for four hours and then determined the ratio of acidified mtKeima per cell by FACS (see Materials and methods) as a quantitative indicator of mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katayama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, in the glycolytic, CCCP-treated condition, a higher proportion of control siRNA-transfected cells had an increased ratio of acidified mtKeima compared with DMSO-treated counterparts (as these cells were undergoing mitophagy), and this population shift was similarly replicated in siMfn1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). However, in Mfn2-depleted cells, we observed a ~ 2 fold increase in the proportion of cells undergoing mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). In respiring conditions, we did not observe a shift at all in either control siRNA-transfected or Mfn1-depleted cells but observed a level of mitophagy in siMfn2 cells similar to control cells cultured in glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). These data demonstrate that, in Mfn2-depleted cells, depolarization-induced mitophagy is enhanced, in line with our parkin recruitment experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A to E</xref>), and demonstrate that Mfn2 represses mitophagy at the level of pathway initiation.</p><p>To ensure that we were observing on-target effects from depletion of our siRNA targets, we replicated our recruitment data in Mfn2 knock-out (KO) U2OS cells that were generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). Genetic disruption was confirmed by sequencing in two clones (A4 and A5) in which a premature stop codon was introduced via a single base-pair frame shift following the codon corresponding to leucine-29 in the human Mfn2 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We validated these KO cells by immunoblot, along with a clone that underwent the complete procedure and selection but in which Mfn2 knock out failed (B4) as a further negative control; importantly, Mfn1 levels remained similar across all lines, and the core subunits of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter remained unperturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>, compensation in the latter has been reported in MEFs isolated from Mfn2<sup>-/-</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Filadi et al., 2015</xref>]). Accordingly, Mfn2 KO cells had mitochondrial reticula that were similarly polarized but fragmented compared to WT U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C and D</xref>). Corroborating our earlier data in siMfn2 cells, Mfn2 KO cells (grown on glucose) transiently transfected with GFP-parkin displayed increased recruitment kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4E and F</xref>) and increased mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4G and H</xref>). Finally, we ensured that parkin translocation in Mfn2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A–C</xref>) and U2OS:GFP-parkin cells depleted of Mfn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5D</xref>) remained PINK1-dependent. Moreover, cells expressing GFP-parkin<sup>A320R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5E</xref>) failed to translocate under conditions of Mfn2-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5F and G</xref>). This indicates a clear requirement for PINK1 and Ub phosphorylation for parkin translocation in Mfn2-depleted cells, demonstrating that Mfn2 reduction increases on-pathway mitophagy kinetics. Taken together, our data not only show that mitochondria-ER contact is dispensable for mitophagy, but that this type of organellar coupling in fact antagonizes the pathway.</p><p>We next sought to demonstrate that the antagonistic effect of mitochondria-ER tethering on mitophagy was functioning directly through the degradation of Mfn2. Conceivably, we could manipulate the pathway by preventing ER-OMM dissociation through the blockage of Mfn2 turnover, which is mediated by proteasomal degradation coupled to parkin ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ziviani et al., 2010</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by our EM data demonstrating that MG132 blocks mitochondria-ER uncoupling during mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>). To achieve this, we created Mfn2 KO cells stably-expressing YFP-parkin (Mfn2 KO:YFP-parkin) and re-expressed ectopic Mfn2, which was able to rescue mitochondrial morphology from a fragmented reticulum to a collection of tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; CFP is used to identify cells expressing untagged Mfn2). We could additionally rescue morphology by overexpression of Mfn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), a phenomenon that has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). Turning to recruitment assays – in which we observed faster GFP-parkin recruitment in Mfn2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4E and F</xref>) – we observed that ectopic expression of Mfn2, but not Mfn1, was able to suppress the recruitment of YFP-parkin to depolarized mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). This is in line with our previous data showing that the antagonistic effect of Mfn2 on mitophagy occurs through its ability to tether mitochondria to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3H–J</xref>) and not its effect on mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). Immunoblot analysis of Mfn2 KO:YFP-parkin<sup>WT</sup> cells ectopically expressing Mfn2 revealed that it was expressed at near-endogenous levels and degraded rapidly upon CCCP treatment compared to the control Mfn2 KO:YFP-parkin<sup>C431S</sup> cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Mfn2 is ubiquitinated by parkin on at least ten lysine residues, although several sites are clustered in the heptad repeat (HR) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sarraf et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, Mfn2 itself has been reported to be directly phosphorylated by PINK1 on T111 and S442, and that these phosphorylation events are critical for the interaction of parkin with Mfn2 and parkin recruitment in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Dorn, 2013</xref>). Focusing on these putative phosphorylation sites and the clustered ubiquitination sites in the HR1 and HR2 domains, phylogenic analysis of their conservation demonstrated that only T111 in the GTPase domain and K737 in the HR2 domain were completely conserved from human Mfn2 to the sole <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitofusin, MARF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>; both the traditional and single-pass Mfn2 topologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mattie et al., 2018</xref>) are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, in the case of the sites of ubiquitination, at least two HR1 sites and three HR2 sites were conserved as lysines down through <italic>Xenopus</italic> Mfn2, while MARF retained one site each in HR1 and HR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We thus posited that mutation of several lysine residues would likely be required to reduce Mfn2 ubiquitination. While mutation of all major sites of Mfn2 ubiquitination almost completely abolishes its modification by parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heo et al., 2015</xref>), we found that mutation of K406, K416 and K420 in the HR1 domain (Mfn2<sup>HR1</sup>) reduced its CCCP-induced ubiquitination by ~75%, as measured by the disappearance of the unmodified band by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>; here Mfn2 levels are normalized to the untreated condition for each construct). This effect was greater than what we observed with the single mutant, Mfn2<sup>K406R</sup> (K416 and K420 appear dispensable in this assay), and mutation of all four sites in HR2 (Mfn2<sup>HR2</sup>) or the double T111A/S442A phosphomutant (Mfn2<sup>TS/AA</sup>) failed to significantly reduce Mfn2 modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). We thus considered Mfn2<sup>HR1</sup> as a ‘hypomorph’ with respect to parkin ubiquitination compared to WT, HR2 and TS/AA constructs, despite similar expression patterns with the latter two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Introduction of either Mfn2<sup>HR1</sup>, Mfn2<sup>HR2</sup> or Mfn2<sup>T111A/S442A</sup> into Mfn2 KO:YFP-parkin cells rescued morphology in a similar manner to WT Mfn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), demonstrating these mutations did not disrupt mitochondrial fusion. We also monitored the ability of these Mfn2 mutants to form high molecular weight (HMW) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karbowski et al., 2006</xref>) that function in mitochondria-ER tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>). By blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), we observed that all three mutants (HR1, HR2 and T111A/S442A) formed HMW complexes similar to WT in solubilized mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). When we assayed mitophagy in Mfn2 KO:YFP-parkin<sup>WT</sup> cells, we found that only rescue of Mfn2 with Mfn2<sup>HR1</sup> – the ubiquitination of which is compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>) – blocked the turnover of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>). Thus, ubiquitination of the Mfn2 HR1 domain by parkin is required for efficient mitophagy and, taken together with our previous mitophagic data in Mfn2-depleted cells, demonstrates that parkin and PINK1 directly counter Mfn2-mediated mitochondria-ER tethering through Mfn2 turnover to promote mitophagy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32866.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Parkin ubiquitinates Mfn2 in the HR1 domain to derepress mitophagy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mfn2 KO:YFP-parkin WT cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid and CFP in a 3:1 ratio, then fixed and immunostained for TOM20 (red) and counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (blue).

Examining HMW complexes by BN-PAGE in untreated U2OS:GFP-parkin<sup>WT</sup> cells (expressing endogenous Mfn2), we observed a bimodal distribution of Mfn2 into two complexes, weighing approximately ~250 kDa and ~500 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, leftmost lane, similar to what was seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). By contrast, Mfn1 – which, in our assays, appears dispensable for mitochondria-ER tethering as assayed by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and its effect on parkin recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>) – only formed a ~ 250 kDa HMW complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We thus considered the ~500 kDa complex containing solely Mfn2 as a dimer of the ~250 kDa Mfn2-containing subcomplex that potentially bridges the ER and OMM. We then monitored the stability of Mfn2- (and Mfn1-) containing HMW complexes during mitophagy. Upon CCCP treatment, we observed a rapid loss Mfn2- (and Mfn1-) containing complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), concomitant with its phosphoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and dependent upon parkin ligase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). While treatment of mitochondrial lysates with Usp2 deubiquitinase slightly increased levels of the unmodified Mfn1 or Mfn2 band in mitochondria isolated from CCCP-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; the densitometry measurements correspond to the shorter exposures of Mfn1 and Mfn2), this was not to levels seen in mitochondria from untreated cells. This result indicated that the disappearance of HMW Mfn complexes are predominantly due to their extraction from the OMM (and not a high level of modification by Ub). This process is thought to be mediated by the AAA-ATPase p97/VCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>) and, accordingly, when we treated U2OS:GFP-parkin<sup>WT</sup> cells with CCCP in the presence of the non-competitive p97 inhibitor NMS-873 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Magnaghi et al., 2013</xref>), extraction of HMW complexes containing either Mfn1 or Mfn2 was accordingly repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Indeed, both ~250 kDa (containing Mfn1 and/or Mfn2) and ~500 kDa (Mfn2 only) complexes were stabilized in the presence of NMS-873 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), with smearing occurring due to Mfn ubiquitination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that parkin-mediated ubiquitination itself was not sufficient to drive apart the ~500 kDa Mfn2-containing interorganellar bridge. Analysis of OMM-ER appositions in these cells revealed that p97 inhibition prevented the dissociation of mitochondria from the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>).

We confirmed this reduction in ubiquitination by immunoprecipiting Mfn2 from reconstituted cells treated with CCCP and NMS-873 under denaturing conditions and immunoblotting for Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

Moreover, p97 recruitment was similar in cells expressing either Mfn2<sup>WT</sup> or Mfn2<sup>HR1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and I</xref>). p97 recruitment levels in both Mfn2 rescue conditions were lower than in cells transfected with empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and I</xref>) likely owing to the delayed parkin recruitment kinetics in Mfn2-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Thus, ubiquitinated Mfn2 is not the sole p97-binding protein on the OMM. We next tested if pUb moieties conjugated to Mfn2 play a role in p97 binding. As we detected pUb conjugated to immunoprecipitated Mfn2 from cells treated with CCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>), we co-treated cells with CCCP and NMS-873 and observed that the interaction between parkin and ubiquitinated Mfn2 – which is normally transient owing to Mfn2 turnover – was stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J and K</xref>). Finally, we probed for the existence of a pUb-p97 interaction by performing a GST pull-down using either S65-phosphorylated or unphosphorylated 4xUb chains from mouse brain lysate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> for experimental schematic) and identified interactors by LC/MS. Using nearly fully-phosphorylated chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we consistently observed the presence of p97, as well as its cofactors p47 and UBXN1, in 4xUb pull-downs, and these proteins were almost totally absent in parallel 4xpUb pull-downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, while p97 mediates the turnover of ubiquitinated Mfn2, this likely does not involve interactions between the p97 complex and pUb.</p><p>The herein-described role of p97 in separating mitochondria from the ER is critical; parkin-mediated ubiquitination on its own appears to be insufficient to drive the disassembly of Mfn2 HMW complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) or to dissociate the ER from the OMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>) in the absence of p97 activity. To clarify the role of p97 in mitophagy, we investigated the potentially epistatic relationship between p97 and Mfn2. We first measured mitophagy in U2OS:mtKeima cells expressing GFP-parkin<sup>WT</sup>, comparing the effect of p97 inhibition in cells depleted of Mfn2 to control cells. In control siRNA-transfected cells, inhibition of p97 by NMS-873 abolished the CCCP-dependent,~3 fold increase in cells with acidified mtKeima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, red and orange bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). When cells were depleted of Mfn2 (siMfn2), p97 inhibition reduced the rate of mtKeima acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, dark and light blue bars), but mitophagy was still permissive. Indeed, the number of cells with acidified mtKeima in siMfn2 cells treated with NMS-873 was still ~5 fold greater than their DMSO treated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, light blue bar), which was more of an increase that was observed for control cells with active p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, red bar). Thus, in the absence of Mfn2, inhibition of p97 fails to suppress mitophagy, demonstrating that a significant component of the role of p97 in mitophagy functions through Mfn2. As p97 extracts Mfn2-containing interorganellar bridges to uncouple mitochondria from the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we reasoned that Mfn2-mediated mitochondria-ER tethering may restrict the parkin-mediated ubiquitination of specific OMM substrates. Thus, we analyzed a sample of parkin substrates by immunoblot in CCCP-treated cells depleted of Mfn2 compared to control, in the presence or absence of NMS-873 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We observed that the parkin-dependent ubiquitination of VDAC1 – which has been reported to form a complex with pUb and parkin that is stable over a period of hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callegari et al., 2017</xref>) – was sensitive to p97 inhibition in control cells, but not cells depleted of Mfn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>). Indeed, the half-time of VDAC1 modification during mitophagy increased two-fold in the presence of NMS-873 specifically in control cells compared to cells transfected with siMfn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We observed a similar effect pertaining to the difference in CCCP-dependent VDAC1 modification between cells treated with NMS-873 <italic>versus</italic> control across all cells depleted of promoters of mitochondria-ER tethering (Mfn2, PACS2 and Stx17) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>). Notably, cells depleted of Mfn1 were comparable to control siRNA-transfected cells in this regard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>). Thus, p97 relieves Mfn2-dependent inhibition of the ubiquitination of VDAC1 (and likely other OMM substrates).

Based on our data in cells, we reckoned that a dearth of p97 in this <italic>in organello</italic> system may prohibit modification of parkin substrates downstream of Mfn2. We first addressed this by isolating cytosol (‘S200k’) from mouse brain – which was devoid of mitochondrial, ER and endosomal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>) – to use as a source of cytosolic p97 ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Otter-Nilsson et al., 1999</xref>). As parkin itself is cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>), we initially proceeded to co-incubuate <italic>in organello</italic> ubiquitination reactions with cytosol from parkin<sup>+/+</sup> (‘WT cytosol’) and parkin<sup>-/-</sup> (‘KO cytosol’) mouse brain in the absence of recombinant ligase, and observed that cytosolic, mouse parkin was able to catalyze Mfn2 ubiquitination in a depolarization-dependent manner, albeit not to the extent of 100 nM recombinant GST-parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>; here the GST tag was not cleaved in order to visualize the different forms of parkin by immunoblot). Based on this result, we proceeded to co-incubate isolated mitochondria with KO cytosol and recombinant parkin. Under these conditions, we observed robust ubiquitination of both Mfn2 and VDAC1 compared to reactions lacking KO cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). This result indicated a potential role for p97 (which was present in the cytosol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H and I</xref>) in this process and, remarkably, in cytosol-containing reactions, VDAC1 ubiquitination displayed sensitivity to NMS-873 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J and K</xref>). Importantly, NMS-873 had no effect on ubiquitination in the absence of cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the small amount of p97 present in reactions lacking cytosol was either negligible or already engaged with other substrates. To ensure that p97 was truly stimulating VDAC1 ubiquitination, we added recombinant p97 hexamer to our reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>). The addition of recombinant hexamer, in a parkin-dependent manner, stimulated both Mfn2 and VDAC1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>). This was, however, not to the extent seen with cytosol (which is p97-dependent, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J and K</xref>), as other cytosolic factors, notably p97 cofactors and E4 ligases, are also likely involved.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether retrotranslocation of Mfn2 by recombinant p97 was occurring in our <italic>in organello</italic> reactions.

Contacts between both organelles are destroyed during mitophagy, in both heterologous cell cultures and dopaminergic neurons, and we demonstrate a requirement for parkin, PINK1, p97 and proteasomal activity in this process. Complementarily, mitochondria-ER contacts themselves are negative regulators of mitophagy, as their reduction facilitates parkin substrate ubiquitination, its translocation to mitochondria and mitochondrial turnover. We identify the known mitochondria-ER tether Mfn2 as a factor that is rapidly phosphoubiquitinated upon the induction of mitophagy, and show that Mfn2-containing HMW complexes are extracted from the OMM by p97 in a manner requiring parkin-dependent ubiquitination in the Mfn2 HR1 domain. Both reduction of Mfn2 ubiquitination and p97 inhibition repress mitophagy, and we reconstitute the main concepts of this PINK1/parkin/p97 enzymatic system in a cell-free assay. Overall, we identify a regulatory role for Mfn2-mediated mitochondria-ER coupling within the parkin/PINK1 pathway, which is counteracted by the ubiquitination of Mfn2 by parkin and its p97-dependent proteasomal turnover.</p><p>We propose a model in which the PINK1/parkin/p97 axis acts rapidly on Mfn2 HMW complexes to separate mitochondria from the ER in order to facilitate mitophagy, potentially by making more substrates available to the parkin/PINK1 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Emerging from this model is the intriguing possibility that mitochondria-ER contacts are initial sites of PINK1/parkin activity and Ub phosphorylation, and would thus be critical loci of mitophagic regulation by deubiquitinating enzymes and as-yet unidentified ubiquitin phosphatases. A recent cryoelectron tomographical study on the ancestral yeast mitofusin Fzo1p demonstrated the existence of a ring-like structure formed by Fzo1p during the docking stage of mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandt et al., 2016</xref>). Mfn2 bridges between mitochondria and the ER may therefore form a similar type of ring, potentially restricting the availability of non-mitofusin OMM substrates such as VDAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–M</xref>) to parkin and/or PINK1. With respect to the latter case, PINK1 has recently been shown to localize to the mitochondria-associated membrane of the ER (MAM) upon depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gelmetti et al., 2017</xref>), and a physical interaction between VDACs on the OMM and IP<sub>3</sub> receptors on the ER places this parkin substrate at contacts between both organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szabadkai et al., 2006</xref>). The existence of a ~ 500 kDa Mfn2-containing interorganellar bridge is supported by our BN-PAGE data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) demonstrating that Mfn2 uniquely exists in a homotypic dimer of ~250 kDa subunits, as it has been demonstrated that ~500 kDa mitofusin complexes form from subcomplexes on adjacent membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishihara et al., 2004</xref>). Our observation of a steady-state ~500 kDa complex containing Mfn2 but not Mfn1 correlates with the reduced activity of the Mfn2 GTPase domain in comparison to Mfn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishihara et al., 2004</xref>), supports a distinct role for Mfn2 in OMM-ER tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>]), and fits a model in which Mfns tether membranes in the GTP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishihara et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qi et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that the stability of these complexes can be negatively regulated by parkin-mediated Mfn2 ubiquitination crucially coupled to p97-dependent retrotranslocation. Intriguingly, we observed both ubiquitinated and unmodified forms of retrotranslocated Mfn2 upon p97 addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8N</xref>). This may hint that, while the hexamer engages directly with Mfn2 at the high concentrations used in our assay, Ub-binding cofactors may localize the hexamer to ubiquitinated Mfn2 at physiological levels of p97. Indeed, in ER-associated degradation, p97 recognizes both Ub-dependent and intrinsic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ye et al., 2003</xref>). The above findings, taken together with another study demonstrating that MITOL-mediated Mfn2 ubiquitination (on different lysine residues) can positively regulate complex formation and mitochondria-ER tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sugiura et al., 2013</xref>), emphasize Mfn2 ubiquitination as an important regulator of mitochondria-ER contact.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32866.027</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Dismantling of Mfn2 interorganellar bridges by PINK1, parkin and p97 during mitophagy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PINK1-phosphorylated Ub on Mfn2 initially recruits parkin to Mfn2 complexes, where it is phosphorylated and activated by PINK1.

PINK1-phosphorylated Ub serves to both activate and anchor parkin to the OMM, where it can ligate more Ub moieties that are subsequently phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Okatsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ordureau et al., 2014</xref>). Here, our data hint at a hierarchy of parkin substrates. The Mfns undergo a burst of phosphoubiquitination at the onset of mitophagy, driven by localized parkin activation – potentially due to their proximity to PINK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Dorn, 2013</xref>). Indeed, our GFP-parkin immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), OMM substrate turnover kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and reconstitution assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>) clearly show a preference for the Mfns above other parkin substrates such as HK1 and Miro1. The Mfns are then rapidly extracted from the OMM by p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8N</xref>) in a step that coincides temporally with parkin translocation to mitochondria. It is therefore unlikely that Mfn1 or Mfn2 act as a parkin receptor in this paradigm – as others have suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Dorn, 2013</xref>) – for this reason, especially when our recruitment data in Mfn2-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) are taken into account. Indeed, we demonstrate that Mfn2 acts as a stable parkin tether only under conditions where retrotranslocation by p97 is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J and K</xref>). Our data support a role for the involvement of VDAC1 in a stable complex that tethers parkin to the OMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callegari et al., 2017</xref>); as β-barrel channels fully integrated into the membrane, VDACs may not be amenable to p97-dependent retrotranslocation. Mfn2 may act as a parkin receptor in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Dorn, 2013</xref>), where parkin-dependent clearance of mitochondria by autophagy plays a role in metabolic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gong et al., 2015</xref>) rather than quality control, and thus may occur by a distinct mechanism; the phosphomutant Mfn2<sup>T111A/S442A</sup> or Mfn2 deletion blocks parkin-mediated mitophagy in the heart but not in cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>]). Conceivably, phosphorylation of Mfn2 on T111 and S442 by a cardiac-specific S/T kinase (or cardiac PINK1, as has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Dorn, 2013</xref>]) may facilitate mitophagy in the heart by uncoupling mitochondria from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>Our study describes an antagonistic, reciprocal relationship between mitophagy and interorganellar tethering between mitochondria and the ER. This highlights a fundamental difference between mitophagy and the more canonical starvation-induced autophagy pathway, the latter of which requires mitochondria-ER contact sites for autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>). While mitophagy functions as a quality control mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>), starvation-induced autophagy is a metabolic response, and thus its initiation at contact sites between mitochondria and the ER may serve to decode the metabolic needs of the cell. Mechanistically, both mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hailey et al., 2010</xref>) and the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009</xref>) have been reported to function as autophagosomal membrane sources during starvation, and mitochondrial damage may preclude the former from participating in this process during mitophagy. Accordingly, the SNARE Stx17, which governs autophagosome-lysosome fusion during starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itakura et al., 2012b</xref>), is dispensable for mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McLelland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, Stx17 appears to suppress mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3G–I</xref>) through its role in supporting mitochondria-ER contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arasaki et al., 2015</xref>). While mitophagy does indeed share morphological and several mechanistic similarities with canonical macroautophagy – including the recruitment of ULK1 complexes and ATG9A vesicles to depolarized mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Itakura et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>) – molecular dissection of mitophagosome formation and fusion requires further study.</p><p>Finally, our data posit the possibility of steady-state regulation of mitochondria-ER contact by PINK1/parkin, separately from mitophagy. In flies, phenotypes of <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>PRKN</italic> mutants are duplicated by overexpression of the sole <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitofusin MARF, and are suppressed by p97 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, PINK1/parkin/p97 counteract MARF <italic>in vivo</italic> through its ubiquitination and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ziviani et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, a proposed mechanism of cell death due to deletion of <italic>PINK1</italic> is the sensitization of mitochondria to Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akundi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gandhi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kostic et al., 2015</xref>), the root cause of which may be dysregulation of mitochondria-ER contact. Accordingly, deletion of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter protects dopaminergic neurons from cell death in <italic>PINK1</italic>-deficient zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Soman et al., 2017</xref>). While we did not observe any steady-state differences in the extent of mitochondria-ER coupling in either parkin overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>) or loss-of-function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N and O</xref>) systems, others have observed an increased degree of contact and metabolite transfer in both fibroblasts from <italic>PRKN</italic> and <italic>PINK1</italic> patients, as well as brains from <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>PRKN</italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Celardo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gautier et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, we (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gelmetti et al., 2017</xref>) measured a destabilization of mitochondria-ER tethering when PINK1 was transiently depleted. While differences between studies can be attributed to cell type and culture conditions, how mitochondria-ER contact is quantified is certainly a determinant; whereas we quantified ER tubules within 25 to 100 nm of the OMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), Gautier et al. extended this distance to 500 nm, and this may effectively account for observed differences. For this study, our &lt; 100 nm criterion was sufficient to capture ER tubules directly opposite the OMM (see OMM extension outlines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref> and the comparison of ER-OMM distances in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Future work will aim to (a) address when and where PINK1/parkin act to regulate the OMM-ER interface via Mfn2, (b) solve precisely how Mfn2 is recognized and retrotranslocated by p97, and (c) understand how dysregulation of mitochondria-ER contact during mitophagy and in other PINK1/parkin-related paradigms may contribute to disease pathology. The work described here lays the foundation for these future studies, identifying a molecular mechanism for contact site destabilization through the ubiquitination of Mfn2 tethering complexes by the PINK1/parkin system and their extraction and destruction via p97 and the proteasome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The 50 μl sample was then digested with 0.2 μg of trypsin for two hours at 37°C, and then quenched in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 5% acetonitrile. Digests were C18-purified using ZipTips (Millipore), eluted in 0.1% TFA/80% acetonitrile, evaporated and resuspended in 0.1% TFA/4% acetonitrile.

After harvesting, the <italic>E. coli</italic> pellet was lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (TBS: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% Tween-20 and 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>), in the presence of lysozyme, DNase I and EDTA-free protease inhibitors. The suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant was applied to Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). After 1 hr of agitation at 4°C the beads were washed with TBS and eluted with TBS containing 20 mM glutathione and 1% CHAPS. GST-<italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 was further cleaved in solution by incubation with GST-3C protease for 12 hr at 4°C before further purification by gel filtration (Superdex 75, GE Life Sciences) in low salt buffer as a final step. GST-4xUb was purified via buffer exchange to remove extra glutathione. GST-4xUb phosphorylation was performed in phosphorylation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 m M NaCl, 1 mM ATP, and 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) at 30°C for 90 min, at final concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 and 0.25 mg/ml GST-4xUb. After phosphorylation, the entire reaction was purified with glutathione Sepharose 4B and washed with TBS briefly to remove extra <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 and ATP. A portion of the beads was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by Phos-tag gel to monitor the efficiency of phosphorylation. Whole mouse brain was homogenized in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.32 M sucrose supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 g, and the supernatant was collected. After adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%, the lysate was rocked at 4°C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 16,200 g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was used as whole brain lysate for pull-downs. Pull-downs were performed with 50 μg GST-4x(p)Ub bait and 4 mg lysate at 4°C, incubated overnight in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. After washing with TBS for five times, reactions were resuspended in 50 μl of TBS with 2 μg GST-3C protease and incubated at RT for 4 hr. After separating the beads by centrifugation, the supernatant was prepared for MS sample preparation. The sample was evaporated and then resuspended with 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> and 5 mM TCEP, then vortexed at 37°C for 30 min. 110 mM chloroacetamide in 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> was added to a final concentration 55 mM chloroacetamide. Samples were further vortexed for 30 min at 37°C. Trypsin was added to reach an enzyme:protein ratio of 1:50, and digestion was performed overnight. Samples were then dried in a speedvac and reconstituted in 40 μl 0.2% formic acid. Tryptic peptides were loaded on a C18 stem trap from New Objective and separated on a home-made C18 column (15 cm × 150 μm id) at a flow rate of 600 nl/min with a gradient of 5–30% B (A: 0.2% formic acid in water, B: 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile). The analytical column was coupled to a Q-Exactive Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Resolution was set at 70000 for the survey scan and 17500 for the tandem MS acquisition. A maximum of 12 precursors were sequenced for each duty cycle. AGC target values for MS and MS/MS scans were set to 3e6 (max fill time 50 ms) and 2e4 (max fill time 150 ms), respectively. The precursor isolation window was set to m/z 1.6 with a high energy dissociation normalized collision energy of 25. The dynamic exclusion window was set to 30 s. Tandem mass spectra were searched against the Uniprot human database with carbamidomethylation (C) as fixed modifications, deamidation (NQ) and oxidation (M) as variable modifications. Tolerance was set at 10 ppm on precursor mass and 0.01 Da on the fragments. The raw data were searched against the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pir.uniprot.org/">http://www.pir.uniprot.org/</ext-link>) database by using Mascot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com">http://www.matrixscience.com</ext-link>). Scaffold was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability and contained at least two identified peptides. For each group – GST, GST-4xUb<sup>G76V</sup> and GST-4xpUb<sup>G76V</sup> – we performed three biological repeats. P-values against the spectrum counts in GST-4xUb pulled-down samples and GST-4xpUb pulled-down samples for each protein were obtained via Fisher’s Exact Test built in the Scaffold software. For final analysis of quantified proteins, values were transferred and analysed in Microsoft Excel. The following cut-offs were applied: minimum number of two total spectrum counts; ratio of spectrum counts in the GST pulled down control divided by the total spectrum counts in all samples is lower than 30%. For the GST-R0RBR pulldown, U2OS:GFP-parkin<sup>WT</sup> cells were treated with 20 μM CCCP for one hour (or left untreated) prior to lysis in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 substitute, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, and protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails and then incubated overnight with 10 μg/ml GST-R0RBR WT or A320R on beads (or unconjugated beads as an additional control).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mfn2 ubiquitination by PINK1/parkin gates the p97-dependent release of ER from mitochondria to drive mitophagy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Senior/Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The author examined ER-mitochondrial contacts (EMCs) during mitophagy. Using quantitative ultrastructural analysis, the authors found that EMCs are disrupted upon mitophagy induction. Focusing on the ER-mitochondrial tether and parkin substrate Mfn2, the authors show that parkin ubiquitinates the HR1 domain of Mfn2 in a PINK1-dependent manner to inhibit the anti-mitophagic property of Mfn2. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that p97-mediated mitochondrial extraction of ubiquitinated Mfn2 precedes its proteasomal degradation and is required for mitophagy execution. While the authors found that Mfn2 is dispensable for mitochondrial p97 recruitment, McLelland and colleagues revealed that the role of p97 during mitophagy partially depends on Mfn2, possibly through sterically restricting access to other parkin substrates.</p><p>Take home message is of broad interest and can reconcile a large amount of contrasting literature into a unifying, testable model. While this work represents an impressive amount of work with experiments performed in wide range of model systems ranging from iPSC-derived neurons to cell-free reconstitution, there a still a few critical issues which needs to be addressed.</p><p>Main points:</p><p>1) To claim that the CCCP-induced additional Mfn2-positive band on the Mfn2 WB in Figures 1M, 2B, 2C, 6C, 6E and 6F represents an ubiquitinated form of Mfn2, the authors need to show that ubiquitin is covalently attached to Mfn2 by performing IP under denaturing conditions followed by immunoblot for ubiquitin. The same is true for Figure 4E and 4F as well as Figure 8. For assessing which lysine in Mfn2 is required to be ubiquitylated in order to trigger its proteasomal degradation the authors need to monitor Mfn2's ubiquitylation status. Likewise, for the reconstitution of Mfn2 ubiquitination, the authors need to immunoprecipitate Mfn2 from these reactions under denaturing conditions and blot for ubiquitin. Along these lines, the author's lysis buffer used in Figure 2D and 2E does not represent denaturing conditions. Hence, the authors cannot claim that Mfn2 is ubiquitinated/phospho-ubiquitinated. In the current setting, the IP-WB and IP-MS data only shows that ubiquitin and phospho-ubiquitin, are co-purifying with Mfn2. The authors should repeat these experiments in the presence of at least 1% SDS and 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide to support the claim that Mfn2 is covalently modified with ubiquitin or phospho-ubiquitin. The same is true for Figure 6I. Also, it is not clear why the authors do not probe their IP in Figure 2D with the phospho-ubiquitin specific antibody used in Figure 6I. Lastly, the increase of co-purifying phospho-ubiquitin in Figure 6I is not convincing. The author should quantify this phenotype.</p><p>2) Figure 2C: The size of the immunoprecipitated Mfn2-positive band in the GFP-parkin IP does not correspond to the CCCP-induced modified Mfn2 band in Figure 2B. The authors should combine their IP conditions with Usp2cc treatment. This would provide actual support of the idea that parkin binds ubiquitinated Mfn2. Moreover, is the parkin-Mfn2 binding stabilized upon proteasome inhibition?</p><p>3) The ER-mitochondria EM tethering distance measured here is arbitrarily set at 100 nm; however, the physical tethers measured by Csordas et al., 2006 span 16-25 nm. Authors should reanalyze the EM using two different distances (e.g., 25 and 50 or 100 nm). In addition, because of the morphological alteration of ER and mitochondria, the use of a compound proximity index like the one in Naon et al., 2016 is encouraged.</p><p>4) Measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential in cells devoid of Mfns and of ER-mitochondria contacts in the generated Mfn2-/- cell are lacking. They are required to exclude that mitophagy rates are influenced by changes in mitochondrial function (rather than ER-mitochondria proximity) and to confirm that Mfn2 manipulation in their system affects organelle proximity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32866.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Main points:</p><p>1) To claim that the CCCP-induced additional Mfn2-positive band on the Mfn2 WB in Figures 1M, 2B, 2C, 6C, 6E and 6F represents an ubiquitinated form of Mfn2, the authors need to show that ubiquitin is covalently attached to Mfn2 by performing IP under denaturing conditions followed by immunoblot for ubiquitin.

We would first like to simply mention that ubiquitination of the mitofusins by parkin during mitophagy was reported some time ago (Tanaka et al., 2010 and other reports) and Mfn2 di-Gly linkages were detected by the Harper group in depolarized cells in a parkin-dependent manner (Sarraf et al., 2013). Indeed, these di-Glys form the basis of the mutagenic analysis performed in Figure 4 and extended in Figure 6. At this point, the field generally accepts that Mfn2 is ubiquitinated by parkin when cells are treated with CCCP (Yamano et al., eLife, 2018 is a very recent example).</p><p>That being said, we did seek to solidify our findings according to the reviewer’s suggestions, especially concerning the lysis buffer used in old Figure 2D and E, as well as 6I. We have included the following experiments in the revised manuscript further demonstrating that Mfn2 is both phosphoubiquitinated and covalently linked to Ub:</p><p>1) New Figure 2D and E: we have taken GFP-parkin immunoprecipitates from cells treated with CCCP, treated them with the catalytic domain of Usp2, and fractionated the deubiquitination reaction (see new Figure 2D for workflow). We find that Usp2 treatment shifts Mfn2 from the beads (bound to GFP-parkin) to the supernatant. This is consistent with ubiquitinated Mfn2 binding parkin in the IP.</p><p>2) New Figure 2H: we have IPed Mfn2 under denaturing conditions, as the reviewer suggested, and blotted for pS65 Ub using the anti-pUb antibody. We detect pUb (and Ub) only in the Mfn2 IP from cells treated with CCCP, consistent with the ubiquitination of this protein.</p><p>3) New Figure 2I and J: we have performed a pulldown with the R0RBR module of parkin, which binds pUb with a K<sub>D</sub> of ~ 20 nM (Sauve et al., 2015). R0RBR WT, but not the A320R mutant (Wauer et al., 2015), robustly pulls down pUb from cell lysates, and we detect both Ub and Mfn2 in the pulldown.</p><p>4) New Figure 6G: we have IPed Mfn2 WT and HR1 under denaturing conditions from reconstituted Mfn2 KO cells treated with both CCCP and NMS-873, and show more Ub in the WT IP vs. that of HR1. This result is consistent with Mfn2 HR1 being deficient in its ubiquitination and complimentary to the immunoblot shown in new Figure 6F.</p><p>5) We have removed the IP in old Figure 6I. This was complementary to new Figure 6J, which shows that the Mfn2-parkin complex is stabilized by NMS-873. Since this is our focus, we have performed the IP in new Figure 6J three times and now show quantification in new Figure 6K.</p><p>We believe that, taken together, these new experiments, in addition to those included in the initial submission of our manuscript, demonstrated that Mfn2 is ubiquitinated by parkin and are in line with what leading groups in the field have observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2C: The size of the immunoprecipitated Mfn2-positive band in the GFP-parkin IP does not correspond to the CCCP-induced modified Mfn2 band in Figure 2B. The authors should combine their IP conditions with Usp2cc treatment. This would provide actual support of the idea that parkin binds ubiquitinated Mfn2. Moreover, is the parkin-Mfn2 binding stabilized upon proteasome inhibition?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this point to our attention. Although the migration of Mfn2-Ubn species varies slightly from gel to gel, we have indeed treated GFP-parkin immunoprecipitates with the USP2 catalytic domain (new Figure 2E) as the reviewer suggested. We accordingly observe a decrease in Mfn2 ubiquitination on the beads. Additionally, we have used the parkin R0RBR module, which has nanomolar affinity for pUb (Sauve et al., 2015), to purify pUb conjugates from CCCP-treated cells, and detect ubiquitinated Mfn2 among these species (new Figure 2I and J). These new data demonstrate that parkin binds ubiquitinated Mfn2.</p><p>As for the second point: unfortunately, treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors stabilizes unmodified Mfn2 (see new Figure 1G). In fact, it has been shown that this is due to a maintenance of proteasomal DUB activity while its proteolytic subunits are inhibited (Rakovic et al., 2011). We do, however, achieve the intended result (parkin stabilization) with p97 inhibition (new Figure 6J and K), which acts on Mfn2 upstream or at least simultaneously with the proteasome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The ER-mitochondria EM tethering distance measured here is arbitrarily set at 100 nm; however, the physical tethers measured by Csordas et al., 2006 span 16-25 nm.

In addition, because of the morphological alteration of ER and mitochondria, the use of a compound proximity index like the one in Naon et al., 2016 is encouraged.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the quantification in Figure 1 using a variety of intermembrane (ER-OMM) distances (&lt;25 nm, &lt;50 nm and &lt;100 nm), as suggested by the reviewer, and this data is shown in new Figure 1—figure supplement 1. We find that, irrespective of the chosen distance, the effect of parkin on ER-OMM connections during mitophagy is the same.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential in cells devoid of Mfns and of ER-mitochondria contacts in the generated Mfn2-/- cell are lacking. They are required to exclude that mitophagy rates are influenced by changes in mitochondrial function (rather than ER-mitochondria proximity) and to confirm that Mfn2 manipulation in their system affects organelle proximity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have blotted our Mfn2 KO cells for PINK1 – the activator of parkin and the mitophagic cascade – at both the steady-state and during depolarization and show that PINK1 are generally similar under both these conditions in WT and Mfn2 KO cells (new Figure 3—figure supplement 5A). Additionally, we have now provided images showing similar staining in these cell lines with the potentiometric dye TMRM (new Figure 3—figure supplement 4D).</p></body></sub-article></article>
