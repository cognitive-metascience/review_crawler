dephosphorylating activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) ensures robust yet diverse responses to extracellular stimuli. The inevitable tradeoff of this plasticity is spontaneous receptor activation and spurious signaling. We show that a ligand-mediated switch in EGFR trafficking enables suppression of spontaneous activation while maintaining EGFR’s capacity to transduce extracellular signals. Autocatalytic phosphorylation of tyrosine 845 on unliganded EGFR monomers is suppressed by vesicular recycling through perinuclear areas with high PTP1B activity. Ligand-binding results in phosphorylation of the c-Cbl docking tyrosine and ubiquitination of the receptor. This secondary signal relies on EGF-induced EGFR self-association and switches suppressive recycling to directional trafficking. The re-routing regulates EGFR signaling response by the transit-time to late endosomes where it is switched-off by high PTP1B activity. This ubiquitin-mediated switch in EGFR trafficking is a uniquely suited solution to suppress spontaneous activation while maintaining responsiveness to EGF.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12223.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12223.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12223.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In living tissue, the ability of individual cells to grow is influenced by signal molecules in the environment around each cell. For example, after an injury, a molecule called epidermal growth factor can stimulate cells to grow to repair the wound. Epidermal growth factor binds to and activates a receptor protein called EGFR, which faces outwards from the cell surface. However, this signal needs to be switched off again afterwards to prevent the cells from growing too much.</p><p>Epidermal growth factor activates EGFR by triggering a process called “autophosphorylation”, in which EGFR attaches molecules called phosphates to itself. To quench the signal, EGFRs that are bound to growth factors are removed from the cell surface and taken into the cell in small membrane bubbles called vesicles. Enzymes called phosphatases near the cell nucleus remove the phosphate groups and thereby switch the receptors off, before the receptors are ultimately destroyed. However, EGFR autophosphorylation can also happen spontaneously in the absence of growth factor, so it was not clear how the cell is able to distinguish between this spontaneous activation and a genuine signal.</p><p>Baumdick, Brüggemann, Schmick, Xouri et al. used biochemical techniques to address this question. The experiments show that EGFRs that have become spontaneously active are also removed from the cell surface in vesicles. However, unlike the EGFRs that are bound to growth factors, the spontaneously active receptors are recycled back to the membrane. On the way, their activity is also switched off by encountering phosphatases so that they are not active when they reach the cell surface again.</p><p>The experiments also show that EGFRs are targeted for destruction by the presence of a tag called ubiquitin, which is added to the receptor in response to the binding of growth factor. Therefore, Baumdick et al.’s findings show that epidermal growth factor controls a switch that alters the way active EGFRs are processed in cells. This system acts to suppress the spontaneous activation of EGFRs, whilst maintaining the ability of the cell to respond to epidermal growth factor. The next challenge is to understand how the location of the phosphatases inside the cell influences when and how the EGFRs respond to this external signal.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12223.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12223.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>vesicular EGFR trafficking</kwd><kwd>spontaneous phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>autocatalysis</kwd><kwd>recycling endosome</kwd><kwd>partitioned phosphatase activities</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabet</surname><given-names>Ola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xouri</surname><given-names>Georgia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U105181009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Lloyd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UPA0241008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chin</surname><given-names>Jason W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Plasticity arising from autocatalytic receptor activation coexists with robustness in ligand responsiveness only by differential endosomal sorting of spontaneous and ligand-activated EGFR as distinct molecular states.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) converts diverse external stimuli into specific cellular responses. EGFR signaling is implicated in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sibilia et al., 2007</xref>), while EGFR overexpression and hyper-activation through genetic alterations have been linked to malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rowinsky, 2004</xref>). Mutation-induced loss of autoinhibitory interactions or enhanced receptor expression levels, frequently elevate the basal phosphorylation and activation status of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arteaga and Engelman, 2014</xref>). The autoinhibitory interactions include the tethered conformation of the extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferguson et al., 2003</xref>) as well as receptor-membrane interactions and the local intrinsic disorder of the αC helix in the N-lobe of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arkhipov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Endres et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2012</xref>). This creates an energy barrier for EGFR self-association that is surpassed upon ligand stimulation. Ligand binding leads to receptor dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yarden and Schlessinger, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cochet et al., 1988</xref>) and the formation of an asymmetric dimer of the intracellular kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). This triggers phosphorylation <italic>in trans</italic> of regulatory and signaling tyrosine residues in the intracellular part of the receptor, and a subsequent recruitment of adaptor proteins that contain Src homology 2 domains (SH2) or phosphotyrosine-binding domains (PTB) such as c-Cbl (Y1045) or Grb2 (Y1068 and Y1086) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ushiro and Cohen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moran et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levkowitz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waterman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Despite these EGFR structure intrinsic safeguards, the receptor can still attain an active conformation in the absence of ligand due to thermal fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>), necessitating only low protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity to suppress phosphorylation due to this ‘leaky’ kinase activity. However, phosphorylation of the conserved regulatory tyrosine Y845 in the activation loop of the EGFR kinase domain leads to an acceleration of its phosphorylation, potentiating EGFR kinase activity in an autocatalytic fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2012</xref>). Such an autocatalytic activation system that is coupled to PTP activity, by for example a double negative feedback, offers robustness against biological noise and conveys external stimuli into threshold-activated responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grecco et al., 2011</xref>). Autocatalysis can lead to amplified self-activation of the receptor in the absence of a cognate ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verveer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Endres et al., 2013</xref>), requiring high PTP activity at the plasma membrane (PM) to suppress. Such PTPs that act on EGFR with high catalytic efficiency (~2 orders of magnitude higher than EGFR) are PTP1B and TCPTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romsicki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2004</xref>). These PTPs are, however, segregated from the PM by association with the cytoplasmic membrane leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and therefore mostly dephosphorylate endocytosed ligand-bound EGFR.</p><p>After ligand binding, endocytosed receptor-ligand complexes contained in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) enter early endosomes (EEs) by fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vieira et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucci et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goh and Sorkin, 2013</xref>), further maturing in the perinuclear area to late endosomes (LEs) and eventually fusing to lysosomes where receptors are degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ceresa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vanlandingham and Ceresa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levkowitz et al., 1999</xref>). Although EGFR vesicular trafficking was extensively studied after ligand stimulation, little is known about the role of vesicular trafficking in suppressing spontaneous EGFR activation as well as regulating its signaling response. To assess how vesicular membrane dynamics modulates spontaneous and ligand-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, we studied three phosphorylation sites on EGFR with distinct functionality: 1) Y845—a regulatory autocatalytic tyrosine whose phosphorylation increases EGFR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2012</xref>), 2) Y1045—a site that upon phosphorylation affects vesicular trafficking of EGFR by binding the E3 ligase c-Cbl that ubiquitinates the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levkowitz et al., 1998</xref>), and 3) Y1068—a site that upon phosphorylation binds the adapter Grb2 via its SH2 domain to propagate signals in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Okutani et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>We show that spontaneously and ligand-induced EGFR activation gives rise to distinct molecular states that are recognized and processed differently by the endocytic machinery. While unliganded monomeric receptors continuously recycle to the PM to suppress autocatalytic activation, ligand-bound dimeric receptors are ubiquitinated by the E3-ligase c-Cbl that commits them to unidirectional vesicular trafficking toward lysosomes. This route through perinuclear endosomes enables their efficient dephosphorylation by high local PTP activity to produce a finite signaling response to growth factors. We demonstrate by a compartmental model that ligand-responsive EGFR signaling can only occur in conjunction with suppression of spontaneous autocatalytic EGFR activation if a ligand-induced switch in EGFR trafficking changes its cyclic interaction with spatially partitioned PTPs to a sustained one.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The dependence of spontaneous EGFR phosphorylation on its expression level</title><p>To investigate how EGFR auto-phosphorylation depends on its cell surface density, we quantified the relative phosphorylation (pY/EGFR) of three tyrosine residues with distinct regulatory functionality of autocatalysis, signaling, and trafficking in single COS-7 cells as a function of EGFR-mCitrine expression level. The variance in ectopic expression of EGFR-mCitrine was thereby exploited to sample a broad range of receptor expression levels. The EGFR-mCitrine expression level in single cells was determined relative to endogenous EGFR by an independent immunofluorescence experiment where the level of endogenously expressed EGFR was quantified from the abscissa-intercept of a linear fit to an EGFR-mCitrine intensity versus anti-EGFR antibody intensity plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). This analysis showed that most COS-7 cells expressed EGFR-mCitrine at similar level as endogenous EGFR, whereas the expression varied by a factor 6 (from ~0.5–3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, X-axis). The phosphorylation level of the autocatalytic Y845 site as well as the Cbl (Y1045) and Grb2 (Y1068) docking sites was determined for single cells as well as for cell populations by quantifying immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>), respectively. To determine the levels of spontaneous EGFR phosphorylation by Western blot analysis, its expression was controlled by the amount of transfected EGFR-mCitrine encoding cDNA and quantified by the EGFR-mCitrine band intensity relative to the band of the maximally applied cDNA amount (3 μg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Single-cell immunofluorescence analyses showed that a wide range of auto-phosphorylation levels occur for similar EGFR expression in individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Despite this cell-to-cell variance in response, clear trends in the average phosphorylation of the individual sites as function of EGFR-mCitrine expression were observed. The average amount of spontaneously phosphorylated Y845 on EGFR increased ~ sixfold with the density of EGFR in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel). Upon EGF-stimulation, the relative phosphorylation of Y845 increased, exhibiting a clear dependency on the EGFR expression levels as well (elevated by ~ threefold for a ~ sixfold increase in EGFR), corroborating the autocatalytic function of Y845 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2012</xref>). The c-Cbl docking site Y1045 exhibited a very different response profile: spontaneous phosphorylation was weakly increased with EGFR expression (~ twofold increase), whereas EGF stimulation clearly resulted in phosphorylation levels that were independent of EGFR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle panel). On the other hand, the average amount of spontaneously phosphorylated Y1068 strongly increased (by ~ eightfold) with the EGFR density in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel). However, in contrast to Y845, EGF stimulation increased its average phosphorylation independent of EGFR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Endres et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12223.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spontaneous tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGFR expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatter plots show the relative phosphorylation (mean fluorescence intensity of pYN-antibody/EGFR-mCitrine) of three tyrosine residues (N= 845, 1045, or 1068) versus EGFR-mCitrine expression in multiples of mean endogenous EGFR levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

We therefore quantified the average anti-EGFR fluorescence intensity in the image masked with the thresholded ratio-image (0.15 &lt; ratio mCitrine / anti-EGFR &lt; 1.5). This average anti-EGFR fluorescence intensity is plotted against the average whole-cell EGFR-mCitrine intensity (right panel, upper graph) for transfection with 0.5 µg (red) and 3 µg (green) cDNA. To be able to relate mCitrine fluorescence intensity with endogenous EGFR expression levels, this data was fitted with a linear model (straight lines with dashed lines for 95% confidence intervals), yielding a slope of m=1.15 ± 0.13 and an abscissa intercept of b=190 ± 25 (all data). This intercept corresponds to the anti-EGFR fluorescence without ectopic EGFR-mCitrine expression and m/b is the factor that translates mCitrine intensity to n-fold ectopic expression over endogenous levels. This quantification is almost irrespective of the amount of cDNA used for EGFR-mCitrine transfection. Compared to transfection with 0.5 µg cDNA (red), the frequency of a higher average EGFR-mCitrine intensity occurring (right panel, lower graphs) clearly increases when 3 µg (green) of cDNA were used, however, not by a factor of 6 that could be expected. For one, a larger amount of cDNA not only increases the amount of cDNA per cell, but also the number of transfected cells (transfection efficiency). Secondly, selection of cells under the microscope suffers from a bias toward transfected cells. However, we used all cells in a field of view to also incorporate weakly expressing cells in our results. (<bold><bold>B</bold></bold>) For single-cell immunofluorescence experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that were stained with antibodies against EGFR phosphorylation, we matched the cumulative EGFR-mCitrine fluorescence intensity histograms (red curves in upper three plots, for the phosphotyrosine-specific antibody indicated) by normalizing with a scalar to that of anti-EGFR immunostaining (green curve, same as green curve in <bold>A</bold>). Thereby, the median values of the mCitrine intensity distributions (blue vertical lines) coincide (lowest plot) and the n-fold ectopic EGFR expression over mean endogenous level can be calculated for each series of experiments.

This 'ratio of fractions' (pre/EGF) gives a comparative measure of the auto-phosphorylation level of tyrosine residues as determined by immunofluorescence and Western blots. This analysis revealed that the extent of phosphorylation differed for the individual tyrosine residues, with a high correspondence between Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). In both experiments, the c-Cbl docking Y1045 site was significantly less phosphorylated as compared to the autocatalytic (Y845) and the signaling site (Y1068). In order to disentangle the contributions of EGFR kinase from PTP activity in generating this spontaneous phosphorylation profile, phosphorylation of EGFR was induced by pervanadate (PV)-mediated inhibition of PTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huyer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haj, 2002</xref>). In this way, the phosphorylation profile reflects the catalytic efficiency of EGFR kinase for the three tyrosine residues. The autocatalytic Y845 site was approximately 2.5 times more phosphorylated at 5’ PV stimulation as compared to 5’ EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This rapid phosphorylation is consistent with a self-amplifying, autocatalytic phosphorylation. Both the Grb2 (Y1068) and c-Cbl (Y1045) docking sites were phosphorylated to a ~2.5 times lower level than Y845 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The ratio of PV-induced over the spontaneous phosphorylation profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) allowed an estimation of the relative contribution of PTP activity in suppressing phosphorylation of the three tyrosines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This analysis shows that the autocatalytic Y845 site requires higher PTP activity to be maintained in check as compared to the other two tyrosines. Moreover, the similar PTP activity that acts on Y1045 and Y1068 shows that the lower phosphorylation of Y1045 as compared to Y1068 is mostly due to differences in the catalytic efficiency of the EGFR kinase for these sites.</p><p>All three tyrosines exhibited a switch-like spontaneous phosphorylation response as function of EGFR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>), indicating that the autocatalytic activation of EGFR is suppressed by PTP activity only up to a threshold of EGFR kinase activity. The phosphorylation of Y1045 was the least responsive to EGFR expression, which is consistent with a low catalytic efficiency of EGFR kinase for this site in the absence of ligand. Spontaneously phosphorylated EGFR largely remained at the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which could result from the lack of c-Cbl binding to this inefficiently phosphorylated site. This steady state distribution is distinct from the EGF-induced internalized EGFR, which manifests in down-stream signaling where an increase in spontaneously phosphorylated EGFR clearly activates Akt but not Erk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results show that spontaneously and ligand-activated receptors behave as distinct signaling entities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Autonomously and ligand-activated EGFR differ in self-association</title><p>We investigated whether the distinct phosphorylation pattern and signaling behavior of spontaneously activated EGFR arises from a different self-association state as compared to ligand-bound receptors. To this end, fluorescence anisotropy microscopy was used to detect self-association of EGFR by homo-FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Squire et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Varma and Mayor, 1998</xref>). For this purpose, an EGFR construct where mCitrine is inserted via a linker between amino acids Q958 and G959 (EGFR-QG-mCitrine) was generated that displayed a similar phosphorylation response to EGF as C-terminally tagged EGFR (EGFR-mCitrine) in COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). EGFR-QG-mCitrine exhibited homo-FRET upon dimerization as apparent from the EGF-induced decrease in anisotropy for all EGFR expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In order to assess EGFR phosphorylation in the same experiment, mCherry tagged PTB (PTB-mCherry) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batzer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Offterdinger et al., 2004</xref>) that targets the phosphorylated signaling tyrosines 1148/1086 was co-expressed and its co-localization with EGFR-QG-mCitrine was determined at the cell periphery. At high EGFR-QG-mCitrine expression levels, co-localization with PTB-mCherry could not be enhanced by EGF stimulation, demonstrating the auto-phosphorylation of EGFR in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This spontaneously phosphorylated receptor remained mostly monomeric as shown by its high anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), even after PV-treatment that fully phosphorylates the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, spontaneously activated EGFR at high expression levels still dimerizes upon ligand binding as apparent from the drop in anisotropy upon addition of EGF. These data are therefore consistent with mostly monomeric, spontaneously activated EGFR that is distinct from ligand-activated, self-associated EGFR.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12223.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Autonomously and ligand-activated EGFR are different molecular states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EGFR-QG-mCitrine anisotropy in COS-7 cells.

Due to the shift in EGFR steady state distribution by ectopic Rab11a-BFP expression, most of the photo-activated or –bleached EGFR resided on the RE. The fluorescence loss after photoactivation of EGFR fused to photoactivatable GFP (EGFR-paGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patterson, 2002</xref>) on the RE (τ= 273 ± 15 s), and the concomitant gain at the PM (τ= 167 ± 33 s) shows that EGFR is recycled from the RE to the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The difference in τ stems from the difference in surface area of the RE in relation to the PM, which determines the rate of RE-dissociation and PM-association. The residence time of EGFR at the RE was estimated to be ~7.6min (k<sub>off</sub> = 2.22 10<sup>–3</sup> s-<sup>−1</sup>) based on fitting the FLAP data to a two-compartment model (see 'Materials and methods'). From the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching EGFR-mCitrine on the RE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, τ= 540 ± 47 s), it was apparent that EGFR also enters the RE. The FLAP and FRAP data thus show that there is constitutive vesicular trafficking of EGFR to and from the RE. To ascertain that EGFR-mCitrine on the RE originates from the PM, a pulse/chase experiment was performed by conjugating tetrazine-TAMRA in a fast bioorthogonal chemical reaction to EGFR-GFP that contained a trans-cyclo-octene derivative of lysine (TCOK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lang et al., 2012</xref>). This unnatural amino acid was site-specifically and co-translationally incorporated by genetic code expansion in HEK293 cells into the extracellular part of EGFR at position 128 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lang et al., 2012</xref>). TAMRA fluorescence of EGFR-(128TCOK)-GFP that was pulse labeled at the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, t=0 min) appeared 20 min later in Rab11a positive perinuclear endosomes, but not in LAMP1-BFP marked lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). EGF stimulation, however, redirected a fraction of TAMRA-labeled EGFR-(128TCOK)-GFP to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This indicates that vesicular recycling between the PM and the RE maintains a steady state with the majority of EGFR at the PM, whereas EGF stimulation redirects self-associated EGFR towards lysosomes thereby depleting it from the PM.</p><p>We then investigated where this EGF-induced switch in vesicular trafficking occurs. Co-localization of EGFR-mCitrine with Rab5-mCherry in quiescent cells showed that unliganded EGFR is localized in EEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>, 0 min). Upon stimulation with EGF, the co-localized Rab5-mCherry and EGFR-mCitrine signals increased, confirming that liganded receptors transit via EEs to LE/Lysosomes and further increase the size and number of Rab5-mCherry-positive EEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbieri, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>). However, 15’ PV-mediated PTP inhibition only marginally affected the detectable amount and size of Rab5-mCherry positive EEs with phosphorylated EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Photoactivation of EGFR-paGFP at the basal PM by TIRF microscopy, and the concurrent appearance of its fluorescence in Rab5-mCherry fluorescent vesicles confirmed that PM-residing EGFR recycles by transit through EEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These experiments show that recycling of monomeric EGFR via the EE compartment maintains its high steady-state distribution at the PM irrespective of phosphorylation state, whereas the different vesicular trafficking fates of unliganded versus liganded EGFR are decided at the level of the EE.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Vesicular recycling suppresses spontaneous autocatalytic EGFR phosphorylation</title><p>We next investigated the coupling between EGFR auto-phosphorylation and vesicular recycling by decreasing/increasing the biogenesis of the pericentriolar RE.

EGF stimulation induces EGFR ubiquitination by the E3-ligase c-Cbl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levkowitz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waterman et al., 2002</xref>) and we therefore asked whether c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination is the key signal to differentiate trafficking of autonomously from ligand-activated EGFR. Ectopically expressed c-Cbl-mCherry was rapidly recruited to the EGF/EGFR complexes at the PM and subsequently observed on internalized EGFR-positive endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This ectopic expression strongly enhanced the rate of internalization after EGF stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), which was concurrent with a diminished fraction of recycling EGF-EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). EGF-stimulation led to ubiquitination and degradation of liganded receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), whereas PV-mediated spontaneously activated EGFR exhibited much lower ubiquitination, was not degraded and did not alter its cyclic trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). This shows that c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of EGFR causes a switch from recycling to unidirectional receptor trafficking toward the perinuclear cytoplasm. An EGFR mutant that is impaired in direct c-Cbl binding (EGFR-Y1045F-mCitrine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grøvdal et al., 2004</xref>) further corroborated this conclusion by continuing to recycle via the RE after ligand stimulation, thereby preventing its degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). This constitutive recycling also resulted in an equally sustained phosphorylation in response to EGF, as compared to the adaptive phosphorylation response of wild type EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The same stabilizing features were additionally observed for an EGFR mutant (EGFR-Y1045F/Y1068F/Y1086F-mCitrine) that is impaired in both direct and indirect c-Cbl binding via Grb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). This shows that the EGF-mediated ubiquitin-switch in vesicular traffic that imposes a finite EGFR signal duration is mediated by c-Cbl binding to phosphorylated Y1045. However, PV-mediated spontaneous EGFR activation caused a similar or higher phosphorylation of Y1045 without c-Cbl recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), leading to inefficient receptor ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This indicates that phosphorylation of Y1045 alone is not sufficient for EGFR ubiquitination by c-Cbl and that EGF-induced receptor association is an essential requirement. EGF-induced ubiquitination thus is a secondary signal that redirects EGFR toward perinuclear areas with high PTP1B activity to inactivate signaling of the liganded receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) and further commit it for lysosomal degradation to avoid reactivation at the PM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Elucidating the systemic rationale for the switch in vesicular EGFR trafficking</title><p>In order to better understand why vesicular EGFR trafficking switches from recycling to unidirectional trafficking upon EGF stimulation, we incorporated our experimental findings and previous knowledge into a minimal model in which the effect of spatial partitioning of phosphates and EGFR trafficking on its activity could be investigated.

We normalized the phosphatase rate constant to a unit 1 as that phosphatase activity, which allows an autonomous phosphorylation of 50% EGFR in steady state. This phosphatase activity balances the 1% of all EGFR spontaneously attaining an active conformation. Under these conditions, a k<sub>PTP</sub> = 15 units suppresses phosphorylation to a level below 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Introducing autocatalysis results in a massive acceleration of phosphorylation. If phosphatase activity was absent in this system, all EGFR would be phosphorylated 250 times more rapidly than without the autocatalytic feedback (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, dashed curve with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, green curves). In combination with the low phosphatase activity of 15 that maintains autonomous phosphorylation below 10% (black curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), autocatalysis causes a highly phosphorylated fraction. In this case, a phosphatase activity of 200 is required to suppress autocatalytic phosphorylation below 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, this level of phosphatase activity rapidly suppresses phosphorylation of ligand-bound EGF-EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, upper graph).</p><p>We then posed the question, whether steady state EGFR distribution caused by recycling and a partitioning of phosphatase activity between PM and RE can counteract autocatalytic phosphorylation while maintaining responsiveness of EGFR to EGF. We therefore started from a condition where EGFR at the PM is subjected to low phosphatase activity of (k<sub>ptp</sub> = 15) that is sufficient to prevent autonomous phosphorylation without suppressing phosphorylation of liganded EGFR, nor autocatalytic phosphorylation (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Additionally, a PTP activity that is sufficient to counter autocatalytic phosphorylation (k<sub>ptp</sub> = 200) was assigned to intracellular membranes. Upon exchange of EGFR between both compartments by recycling, the relative amount of EGFR at the PM determines its phosphorylation level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). EGFR phosphorylation is high at a 10:1 steady state distribution, while equipartitioning of EGFR leads to a phosphorylation well below 10%. Vesicular recycling thus acts as an additional, effective phosphatase activity that can suppress autocatalytic phosphorylation.</p><p>Why is the system using recycling in order to generate an effective phosphatase activity at the PM? Since autocatalytic activity is a non-linear process that is strongly dependent on the density of EGFR at the PM, we also compared the phosphorylation of EGFR as a function of EGFR expression level in the three cases described above: no autocatalysis, no recycling, recycling, and partitioning of phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>). Without autocatalytic phosphorylation, the second-order rate of autonomous phosphorylation causes a square-root dependence of phosphorylation on EGFR expression. For the moderate phosphatase activity of 15 that suppresses autonomous phosphorylation, this dependence is stretched out and it appears almost linear (black curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, this amount of phosphatase activity combined with autocatalytic phosphorylation gives rise to a low threshold (&lt; 0.1) in EGFR expression, beyond which phosphorylation increases sharply as a function of EGFR levels. This threshold increases with phosphatase activity (expression level of 2 for a phosphatase activity of 200, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In the case of partitioned phosphatase activity, the dependence of EGFR phosphorylation on expression is similar to the scenario without recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). This shows that the system of partitioning phosphatase activity and EGFR trafficking poses a valid alternative to a purely PM-based solution of keeping autocatalytic phosphorylation in check. The essential difference is that a partitioned phosphatase activity achieves this while maintaining a low phosphatase activity at the PM, where ligand-mediated activation of EGFR occurs.</p><p>So far, we exemplary considered a partitioning of phosphatase activities of 15:200 between PM and endomembranes. We find that the autocatalytic threshold (black and white lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>) depends on this phosphatase partitioning, as well as on the EGFR distribution. Even if there is 10 times more EGFR on the PM, strongly asymmetric phosphatase partitioning hardly shifts the threshold. However, for more equal distributions of EGFR (&gt;2:1), a concurrent asymmetric phosphatase partitioning provides a large shift in the threshold. This corresponds to a safeguard against autocatalytic phosphorylation even at high EGFR expression. A low phosphatase activity at the PM suffices in combination with the suppressive recycling to maintain the level of EGFR phosphorylation below the autocatalytic threshold. For liganded EGFR, vesicular recycling leads to efficient dephosphorylation on perinuclear membranes with their high local phosphatase activity. However, the stabilization of the active EGFR conformation by the ligand causes its kinase activity to surpass suppression by low local phosphatase activity once liganded EGFR recycles to the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, lower graph, red curve). This is in stark contrast to unliganded dephosphorylated EGFR returning from the perinuclear area that requires slow autonomous phosphorylation as the trigger to return to the active state. The slow rate of recycling thus proves ineffective to maintain ligand-activated EGFR in a dephosphorylated state, while it can suppress autonomous phosphorylation (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, lower graph). The system is therefore left with one way to shut down signaling after ligand stimulation: reducing the amount of EGF-EGFR complexes in the whole cell by lysosomal degradation to reset the kinase-phosphatase balance to a level below the autocatalytic threshold. The scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref> summarizes this switch from continuous suppressive EGFR recycling to directional trafficking leading to finite signaling</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ligand-induced EGFR signaling is involved in numerous cellular responses in health and disease, with a documented link between aberrant ligand-independent EGFR activation through overexpression or mutations and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arteaga and Engelman, 2014</xref>). It remains unclear how spontaneous auto-activation of EGFR is suppressed, while still maintaining responsiveness to physiological stimuli. Here, we show that a switch from cyclic to unidirectional vesicular traffic of EGFR enables its interaction with spatially organized PTPs to suppress spontaneous auto-activation while allowing for ligand-induced signal propagation. Otherwise, suppression of spontaneous autocatalytic activation at the PM would be incompatible with ligand-induced signaling of EGFR. Partitioning high PTP activity away from the PM allows these opposing requirements, because of two modes of spontaneous EGFR phosphorylation: 1) slow autonomous phosphorylation originating from a low fraction of EGFR that is in the active conformation due to thermal fluctuations; and 2) rapid autocatalytic phosphorylation due to phosphorylation of the autocatalytic site Y845. Low PTP activity at the PM is sufficient to suppress autonomous EGFR phosphorylation and can be overcome by ligand-activated EGFR. In contrast, the extremely fast kinetics of autocatalytic phosphorylation can only be suppressed by PTPs with high catalytic efficiency. This would hinder EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR at the PM and thereby prevent its signaling. This is the reason why shutdown of EGFR signaling occurs after its internalization by vesicular trafficking to the perinuclear area, where high PTP activity dephosphorylates the liganded receptor without interfering with EGF-responsiveness at the PM. This feature of the perinuclear area is also capitalized by monomeric, spontaneously phosphorylated EGFR through continuous vesicular trafficking into the same spatial location. The two different 'species' of phosphorylated EGFR – —spontaneously and ligand-activated – —are distinguished by their ubiquitination that depends on phosphorylation of tyrosine 1045 and self-association of EGFR. EGF-EGFR complexes travel in a unidirectional way to this perinuclear area due to their ubiquitination and will not leave it again, whereas spontaneously phosphorylated EGFR will recycle to the PM after dephosphorylation at the RE. Slow spontaneous autonomous receptor phosphorylation will then start again at the PM. However, before the threshold is reached, where rapid autocatalysis would accelerate phosphorylation of Y845, trafficking to the RE restarts the suppressive cycle. The primary function of EGFR recycling is therefore to suppress spontaneous phosphorylation of Y845 that leads to autocatalysis. This notion is consistent with our finding that – —out of the three investigated tyrosines – —phosphorylation of the autocatalytic Y845 site was the most efficiently suppressed by vesicular recycling of EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This has implications for spontaneously versus EGF-activated EGFR- signaling. Since auto-activated EGFR is maintained at the PM, it can activate Akt via PIP3 production by PI3K at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cantley, 2002</xref>), resulting in survival signaling. In contrast, we observed unresponsiveness of Erk to spontaneous auto-activation of EGFR. Possible reasons for this could be that negative feedback in the Erk circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsche-Guenther et al., 2011</xref>) results in an adaptive response to sustained EGFR activity at the PM or that efficient activation of Erk only occurs upon endocytosis of the receptor. In general, our data show that interference with vesicular trafficking by knock down of Rab proteins can have substantial pleiotropic effects on growth factor receptor signaling activity.</p><p>We have shown here that the ER-associated PTP1B efficiently dephosphorylates the autocatalytic Y845. The highest intrinsic activity of PTP1B has been demonstrated to be on perinuclear membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yudushkin et al., 2007</xref>), whereas only a small fraction of its activity can reach the PM at points of cell–cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haj, 2002</xref>). In addition to PTP1B, TCPTP is also spatially segregated from PM-localized EGFR by its association with the ER and has been shown to dephosphorylate Y845 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mattila et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the localization of these ER-anchored PTPs with a high catalytic efficiency toward phosphorylated Y845 in the perinuclear area is compatible with the presented model of maintaining unliganded EGFR phosphorylation at the PM below the autocatalytic threshold. In this way, even a marginal PTP activity at the PM suffices to silence the signaling tyrosines. In this regard, several RPTPs (i.e. RPTPJ, G, A) that dephosphorylate EGFR at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rotin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tarcic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leung Cheung et al., 2015</xref>) exhibit a high preference for the signaling tyrosines Y1068 and Y1086 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leung Cheung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tarcic et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the catalytic efficiency of RPTPA for phosphorylated peptide substrates is three orders of magnitude lower than that of PTP1B or TC-PTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Selner et al., 2014</xref>). This agrees with our model where low PTP activity at the PM can only suppress slow autonomous phosphorylation in case that high perinuclear PTP activity suppresses autocatalytic activation. This is substantiated by the fact that inhibiting internalization of EGFR results in its prolonged activity at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Offterdinger and Bastiaens, 2008</xref>), whereas inhibition of EGFR kinase activity with an ATP-binding site competitor results in rapid dephosphorylation of signaling tyrosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Offterdinger et al., 2004</xref>). In the latter case, there is no autocatalytic maintenance of the kinase activity and the PM-resident PTP activity suffices to dephosphorylate EGFR on signaling tyrosines.</p><p>We argue that the unidirectional vesicular trafficking of liganded receptors to the perinuclear area determines the duration of EGFR signaling in response to EGF. During vesicular transit of EGF-EGFR complexes to perinuclear areas with the highest PTP1B activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yudushkin et al., 2007</xref>), growth factor signals are propagated in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lai, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Guglielmo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wouters and Bastiaens, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sorkina et al., 1999</xref>), indicating a link between vesicular trafficking and duration of EGFR signaling response. Such a response typically occurs on the tens-of-minutes time-scale, corresponding to characteristic vesicular trafficking rates. This time-scale of EGFR response cannot be achieved by cytosolic, regulated PTPs (i.e. SHP1/2) that couple to EGFR phosphorylation in a negative feedback manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grecco et al., 2011</xref>). The recruitment of these diffusible PTPs to the receptor on the time scale of seconds would dephosphorylate EGFR too rapidly to signal on a time scale of minutes. By the same argument, suppression of spontaneous autocatalytic activation at the PM by regulated PTPs is incompatible with prolonged EGFR signaling.</p><p>Both, EGF-EGFR complexes as well as recycling receptors transit via Rab5 positive EEs, into the LE and RE, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). This suggests that sorting of monomeric EGFR to the RE and self-associated, ubiquitinated EGFR to the LE happens at the early endosomal compartment. Why is it necessary to re-route ligand-activated receptors by endosomal sorting away from the unliganded EGFR that keeps recycling? The answer to this question lies in the stability of the ligand-receptor complexes. Liganded EGFR maintains an active conformation even after dephosphorylation in the perinuclear area, and therefore will be rapidly re-phosphorylated in the environment of low PTP activity at the PM. This would sustain signaling as it has been observed for the c-Cbl-binding-impaired mutants, which continued recycling upon EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). Importantly, this reactivation does not occur for spontaneously activated EGFR because dephosphorylation of Y845 inactivates the conformation that results in rapid autocatalytic phosphorylation. The protective recycling can be exploited by oncogenic versions of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2009</xref>) that show impaired c-Cbl association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shtiegman et al., 2007</xref>), or c-Cbl mutations that abolish interaction with EGFR, or within cells with altered c-Cbl activity, all leading to insufficient EGFR ubiquitination, subsequent recycling and sustained downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thien and Langdon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peschard and Park, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ravid et al., 2004</xref>). Recycling also occurs at low doses of EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sigismund et al., 2005</xref>), where some receptors might autocatalytically activate but fail to be ubiquitinated due to lack of stable EGF-induced self-association. However, as shown in this study, c-Cbl is a limiting factor in rerouting EGF-EGFR complexes to lysosomes under saturating doses of EGF. Therefore, the level of c-Cbl expression in different cells might dictate the fraction of EGF-EGFR complexes that keep recycling.</p><p>Even though re-routing of liganded EGFR occurs on EEs, EGF stimulation leads to an apparent transient translocation of EGFR to the PM, followed by its depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). This shows that EGF-induced receptor clustering or ubiquitination results in a delayed internalization, where continued trafficking from the RE results in this perceived net translocation. The delayed internalization might point at a different internalization and trafficking route to EEs of monomeric receptors as compared to ubiquitinated EGF-EGFR complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sigismund et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>One of the decisive factors for this differential sorting of spontaneously and ligand-activated receptors is phosphorylation of the c-Cbl binding site Y1045. We could show that - —out of the three investigated tyrosine residues - —it was the least efficiently phosphorylated by spontaneous EGFR kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). This is in accordance with data showing that Y1045 is inefficiently auto-phosphorylated under oxidative stress, in contrast to Y845 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ravid et al., 2002</xref>). The fact that monomeric EGFR was inefficiently ubiquitinated upon PTP inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), but displayed a similar phosphorylation on Y1045 as compared to EGF stimulation, suggests that rather than Y1045 phosphorylation alone, the formation of EGFR oligomers is a decisive factor for c-Cbl binding and efficient ubiquitination.</p><p>The distinct molecular states of spontaneous activated versus ligand-activated EGFR that are recognized and processed differently by the endocytic machinery, most likely evolved to provide robustness in ligand responsiveness against the gain in plasticity from its autocatalytic activation mechanism.

In order to be able to compare the level of ligand-independent phosphorylation for the three sites, the measured fraction of auto-phosphorylated EGFR (mean pY<sub>n</sub> intensity divided by mean EGFR intensity, where n=845,1045,1068) was normalized to the corresponding fraction after EGF stimulation (pY<sub>n</sub>/EGFR-EGF upon 2’ or 5’ EGF stimulation: the maximally attainable phosphorylation at a given EGFR expression level).

The extent of PTB recruitment (R) to EGFR was calculated by the following equation:</p><p><disp-formula id="equ5"><label>(5)</label><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>From this, a 2D-histogram of R versus EGFR fluorescence intensity per pixel was constructed with a bin size of 50 fluorescence units.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>FLIM and data analysis</title><p>FLIM measurements were made on an Olympus FluoView FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a time-correlated single-photon counting module (LSM Upgrade Kit, Picoquant, Berlin, Germany), using 60x/1.35 NA oil objective (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). All pulsed lasers were controlled with the Sepia II software (PicoQuant GmbH, Berlin, Germany) at pulse repetition frequency of 40 MHz.

Nevertheless, the images reveal some patterns, thus it can be presumed that each snapshot is a random realization of an underlying smooth density function.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within a few days as the comments are very minor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very high quality study that compares the consequences of auto-or EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR at 3 specific tyrosines in relation to EGFR trafficking, and combines this with recycling endosome and plasma membrane encounters with the tyrosine phosphatase PT1B to gain insight into how cells are able to maintain EGF responsiveness while retaining capacity to downregulate EGF-activated receptors. The authors have used great care to monitor these processes in relation to EGFR levels and the work will be of broad interest to scientists studying this medically important protein.</p><p>We recommend publication of the work in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Minor issues:</p><p>Figure 1A has only minimum and maximum values on X-axes, making it hard to understand.</p><p>The sentence &quot;anti-tubulin was used as a loading control.&quot; starts with a lower-case letter a in Figure 1—figure Supplement 3, Figure 1—figure Supplement 4 and Figure 2—figure Supplement 1.</p><p>Is there a color symbol error in Figure 4D?</p><p>Results, subheading ‘Vesicular recycling suppresses spontaneous autocatalytic EGFR phosphorylation’: Rab11 depletion, please state if there was any change in total EGFR level in this condition. That Rab11 depletion influenced EGFR phosphorylation state is really important and should be highlighted in the discussion, as many workers fail to note such potentially pleiotropic consequences of Rab depletion.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;EGF binding switches vesicular trafficking of EGFR from a suppressive cycle to a directional signaling mode&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been carefully evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, Marino Zerial and one other reviewer. Unfortunately, because of the numerous issues raised during the review process, we are not able to consider this version of the manuscript further. However, if you are able to address all of the issues raised by the reviewers, we would be willing to consider a resubmission of the story. In particular, it would be very important to explain more clearly, what is new for the field, at every stage of your story, and to include plasma membrane phosphatases in your presentation and conclusions.</p><p>I hope that you will find the comments useful in planning your next steps.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>There is a lot of work in this potentially interesting paper that highlights the following conclusions. 1. Autophosphorylation of EGFR favors Y845 rather than Y1045 and Y1068 docking sites; autophosphorylated EGFR appears to be monomeric by anisotropy; non-liganded EGFR cycles via Rab11 endosomes unless it engages Cbl and then is sent to lysosomes due to ubiquitylation; perinuclear protein tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylated recycling endosome-localized EGFR. Expression of BFP-Rab11A may have decreased phospho-EGFR levels but it is not clear how significant these data are (is the difference driven by outliers?). To this non-EGFR expert, the data don't seem to bring forth a totally novel story except perhaps the different status of auto- and ligand-activated EGFRs. Without live cell microscopy, the authors can't make any conclusions about one EGFR class going directly to REs versus sorting in a common EE to ship cbl-engaged EGFRs to late endosomes and non-cbl engaged EGFRs to REs. The authors really need to highlight what is absolutely new in their analysis – the methods employed are sophisticated and provide interesting substance – even if they may not be totally ground breaking and may simply confirm previous conclusions obtained with less precise methods.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The work by Baumdick et al. is devoted to study the differential trafficking behaviour of ligand-dependent vs. autonomously phosphorylated EGFR. Ligand-free phosphorylated EGFR is targeted to perinuclear recycling endosomes RE where high concentration of ER-bound phosphatase PTP1B ensures inactivation of the autonomously phosphorylated EGFR (spontaneous EGFR signalling). In contrast, the ligand-receptor complexes are targeted to degradation. It was previously demonstrated that targeting to degradation is triggered by ubiquitination of EGFR by c-Cbl. The authors demonstrate that c-Cbl is not recruited on activated Y1045 monomeric EGFR and, as such, activation on Y1045 is not sufficient to reroute EGFR to degradation. The spatial (non-homogeneous) distribution of PTP1B provides the explanation for the necessity of trafficking as a means to regulated EGFR phosphorylation. The study is very interesting. It shows that EGFR and ligand-occupied EGFR have very different trafficking fates, thus providing new insight into the regulation of EGFR trafficking in the cell that combines high sensitivity with robustness against &quot;spurious&quot; signaling.</p><p>As the manuscript is written, it gives the impression of a clear cut distribution of phosphatases between the plasma membrane and RE. We know that dephosphorylation occurs also at the PM (and the ER is located throughout the cell) and thus the authors need to take into account earlier findings and clarify the text throughout.</p><p>In the subsection “Ubiquitin-mediated switch in vesicular trafficking of ligand-activated EGFR”: The authors state &quot;The translocation of EGFR to the PM after EGF addition coincided with a loss of EGFR fluorescence at the RE (Figure 4A, C). This shift in the steady-state distribution of EGFR occurs because recycling from the RE to the PM continues after EGF stimulation whereas vesicular trafficking to the RE is shut down.&quot; The authors imply that EGF stimulation transiently suppresses the &quot;basal uptake&quot; of EGFR. What is the evidence for this? The rerouting of this fraction of EGFR to degradation should lead to depletion of EGFR from RE, but I do not see how it should lead to a significant redistribution of EGFR toward the PM. Figure 4C, F provide quantitative evidence for depletion of EGFR from RE. However, the redistribution to PM is supported by one low-resolution image (see Figure 4A, 1 min vs. 0 min) of one cell without quantifications. The authors need to provide proper quantifications and statistics.</p><p>In the Discussion: &quot;While EGF-bound receptor clusters await internalization, EGFR continues trafficking from the RE to the PM resulting in a perceived transient translocation of the receptor to the PM immediately after ligand stimulation (Figure 4A). This post-stimulus effect enhances the concentration of EGFR at the PM, further driving receptor dimerization and commitment to activation.&quot; Viera, Lamaze and Shmid, 1996, which the authors refer to showed that block of clathrin-dependent endocytosis does not change the basal uptake rate. This is opposite to what is claimed here. The authors should clarify or amend this statement. See comment above.</p><p>In the Discussion: &quot;These EGF/EGFR complexes were rapidly internalized into Rab5 positive vesicles, whereas autonomously activated receptors did not co-localize with early endosomes (EE) (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This suggests that autonomously activated EGFR directly traffics in clathrin coated vesicles from the PM to the RE (Vieira, Lamaze, and Schmid 1996).&quot; This is an interesting and strong statement that needs to be well supported. I cannot judge the level of colocalization of EGFR to Rab5 from the images of Figure 4—figure supplement 1. The authors state that there is no colocalization of EGFR to Rab5 in the absence of EGF stimulation. However from Figure 4—figure supplement 1 one cannot draw this conclusion simply by qualitative observations. The magnification is too low, split colors presented as negatives, etc. The statement that internalized unoccupied EGFR is directly targeted to RE and bypass Rab5-positive EE has to be much better supported. I did not find the statement on direct traffic of clathrin coated vesicles to perinuclear RE in the referenced paper of Vieira, Lamaze, and Schmid 1996. Do the authors really mean that PM-derived vesicles (clathrin-dependent or clathrin-independent?) fuse directly with RE? This is not an established mechanism and the authors need to provide more convincing evidence or drop this statement.</p><p>Quantifications on Figure 4 and supplements are based on 3 to 10 cells (see legend). Given that error bar is SEM, what is the significance of reported differences? It has to be provided.</p><p>Figure 4—figure supplement 2 is not useful without quantifications. A and B are very similar to the naked eye.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In the present manuscript the authors carry out the analysis of the regulation of EGFR signaling by endocytosis and receptor dephosphorylation using state-of-the-art methods of the quantitative fluorescence microscopy. The model proposed by the authors is in agreement with the current model of EGFR endocytic trafficking whereby in the absence of the ligand EGFR is constitutively internalized and recycled, whereas ligand activation of the receptor leads to ubiquitination and increased targeting of EGFR to the lysosomal degradation pathway. The authors further advance this model by proposing that constitutive endocytosis of ligand-free EGFR to Rab11 recycling compartment serves to counteract to the autocatalytic phosphorylation of EGFR in order to maintain low levels of the receptor activity. In essence, it is suggested that the tyrosine kinase of free, monomeric EGFR can be autonomously activated leading to receptor phosphorylation; however, endocytosis delivers free EGFR to the perinuclear area of the cell where an ER-associated phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTB-1B dephosphorylates the receptor prior to its recycling back to the cell surface. This new aspect of the EGFR endocytosis system is interesting but the supporting evidence is not sufficiently convincing.</p><p>1) The equilibrium between constitutive recycling and internalization results in a significantly larger pool of EGFR at the cell surface than in endosomes, at least when distribution of an endogenous EGFR is analyzed. If the assumptions in the present study are correct and endocytosis serves to maintain the endosomal pool of unoccupied EGFR in dephosphorylated state, the bulk of the receptor (located at the cell surface) would be capable of autonomous activation. Once recycled, there would be no mechanism in place to prevent re-activation of the receptors at the cell surface.</p><p>2) The key assumption supporting the proposed model that EGFR dephosphorylation takes place predominantly in the perinuclear area has been demonstrated in the previous study by this group. However, since the publication of the finding, it has been shown that transmembrane PTPs are essential for dephosphorylation of EGFR, and that these PTPs are located at the plasma membrane.</p><p>3) It has been shown in several publications that removal of EGF from the EGFR at the cell surface results in a rapid dephosphorylation of the receptor. If the authors believe that unoccupied EGFR is not dephosphorylated in the plasma membrane, this should be directly demonstrated.</p><p>4) Furthermore, the assumption that ER-associated PTP-1B exhibits a gradient of increasing activity from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear area is somewhat counterintuitive. ER spans the entire cell. The spatial proximities of the ER to the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes are similar. Likewise, ER forms numerous contacts with both the plasma membranes and endosomes.</p><p>It is rather disappointing that the key conclusions in the manuscript are reached in experiments performed under conditions of transient overexpression of EGFR, Rab11 and other constructs in cells that express endogenous EGFR or Rab11. It is established in the literature that the internalization rates of transiently overexpressed EGFR are low, and the regulatory mechanisms do not resemble what is observed in cells expressing endogenous or stably expressed EGFR, because of the saturation of the internalization and degradation pathways and other reasons. Similarly, overexpression of Rab11 dramatically changes the morphology of endosomal compartments and likely the trafficking itinerary of various cargo.</p><p>There are concerns with regards to the specific data and their interpretations, discussion of experiments and citing the literature as listed below.</p><p>1) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Autonomously and ligand-activated EGFR are different molecular states” with the reference to Figure 1B it is stated that Y1068 is less autonomously phosphorylated than Y845. This does not seem consistent with Figure 1B.</p><p>2) Figure 1E. It is unclear why after comparative analysis of pY1045 and pY1068, the experiments were switched to the use of the PTB domain that binds pY1148. The authors could easily use the SH2 domain of Grb2 that binds to pY1068. Further, PTB domain is accumulated in the perinuclear area suggesting that phosphorylated EGFR is accumulated in the same area. This data seems contradict the assumption that the receptor is predominantly dephosphorylated in the perinuclear area.</p><p>3) Figure 2A. It is impossible to resolve newly-synthesized EGFR from endocytosed EGFR the Golgi area by confocal microscopy. Overexpressed Rab11 is located in compartments with a strikingly morphology as compared to endogenous Rab11, which lessens confidence in the utility of the experiments with overexpressed Rab11.</p><p>4) Figure 2B. It is not apparent that photoactivated EGFR is delivered to the plasma membrane.</p><p>5) Figure 2C. These images clearly demonstrate that internalization of EGFR in the absence of the ligand is very slow (by 40 min, only a very small fraction is seen in punctate structures. These images also show that internalized free EGFR does not reach the recycling compartment marked by overexpressed Rab11. The signal corresponding to internalized EGFR surrounds this compartment.</p><p>6) Figure 3A. It is impossible to evaluate the extent of co-localization without the merge image and high resolution single-channel images.</p><p>7) Figure 3D. The image acquisition or image presentation parameters are set to emphasize intracellular compartments, and it is unclear whether these settings allow detection of the diffuse labeling of the surface EGFR. The co-localization of EGFR with Rab11 in these images is claimed to be 63%. This is not apparent from the visual comparison of quite different patterns of localization; here again, an overlap image is needed.</p><p>8) Figure 1—figure supplement 4. PTB-1B is highly overexpressed which makes it difficult to evaluate the extent of actual co-localization in this experiment.</p><p>9) Figure 2—figure supplement 1B. LAMP1 localization is highly unusual. This could be the effect of mistargeting due to the tag or overexpression.</p><p>10) Figure 3—figure supplement 1. These images are a clear example of an unusual localization likely due to accumulation of overexpressed proteins in the ER and/or other perturbed organelles.</p><p>11) Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 4. These figures demonstrate that PV does not cause any significant endocytosis of ligand-free EGFR.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>1) In the subsection “Ubiquitin-mediated switch in vesicular trafficking of ligand-activated EGFR”. The authors refer to one study that Cbl overexpression accelerates internalization. Multiple other studies clearly demonstrated that Cbl overexpression does not change the internalization rate but in increase the degradation rate of EGFR (in some cells).</p><p>2) The model in Figure 5 does not seem take into consideration recycling of EGF-EGFR complexes demonstrated by several groups.</p><p>3) The assumption that in the absence of the ligand, monomeric receptors are autonomously activated is questionable. There is still a debate in the literature about the existence of less stable unoccupied EGFR dimers. The FRET based assay used in the present study may not be sufficiently sensitive to formally disprove the existence of these dimers. In fact, the strong dependence of the receptor phosphorylation on its expression levels (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) suggests that it this autonomous phosphorylation correlates with the increased probability of monomer-monomer interaction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12223.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Figure 1A has only minimum and maximum values on X-axes, making it hard to understand.</italic></p><p>We have added the values on the X-axes of Figure 1A.</p><p><italic>The sentence &quot;anti-tubulin was used as a loading control.&quot; starts with a lower-case letter a in Figure 1—figure Supplement 3, Figure 1—figure Supplement 4 and Figure 2—figure Supplement 1.</italic></p><p>This mistake was corrected.</p><p><italic>Is there a color symbol error in Figure 4D?</italic></p><p>Yes, indeed.

We have also introduced the reason for investigating the phosphorylation of three tyrosine residues with the distinct functionalities of autocatalysis, signaling and trafficking. The data has now been presented in a more coherent way and new experiments further support our initial hypothesis that a switch in vesicular trafficking enables suppression of spontaneous activation while maintaining EGFRs signaling capacity. We have extended our life cell microscopy experiments to show that the different vesicular trafficking fates of recycling unliganded versus unidirectional trafficking of liganded EGFR are decided at the level of the EE (Figure 3). Importantly, we have now included a mathematical model (Figure 6) that explains how this switch in EGFR trafficking is a unique solution to suppress spontaneous autocatalysis while maintaining its signaling capacity.</p><p>Reviewer #2:<italic>The work by Baumdick et al. is devoted to study the differential trafficking behaviour of ligand-dependent vs. autonomously phosphorylated EGFR.

However, it has been demonstrated that RPTPs have a low catalytic efficiency and dephosphorylate signaling tyrosines. We have now incorporated our experimental findings into a mathematical model (Figure 6) that clearly defines the role of partitioning PTP activities in regulating EGFR autocatalytic phosphorylation. In short, low RPTP activity at the PM suffices to suppress autonomous phosphorylation of signaling tyrosines only because high PTP1B activity in the perinuclear area counters spontaneous autocatalysis by dephosphorylating tyrosine 845. We have now added a part in the Discussion to describe the different roles of plasma membrane localized RPTPs versus ER-associated PTPs that is fully consistent with our findings. In addition, we also discuss how suppression of spontaneous autocatalytic activation at the PM by regulated PTPs like Shp1/2 is incompatible with prolonged EGFR signaling.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Ubiquitin-mediated switch in vesicular trafficking of ligand-activated EGFR”: The authors state &quot;The translocation of EGFR to the PM after EGF addition coincided with a loss of EGFR fluorescence at the RE (Figure 4A, C).

Upon EGF-stimulation we observe a net translocation to the PM that is explained by a delay in the anterograde internalization of EGFR while retrograde traffic from the RE remains unchanged. Ectopic c-Cbl expression enhances the rate of internalization, which reduces this net PM translocation, showing that ubiquitination might be a rate-limiting step in the ligand-mediated internalization of EGFR. We have now better described that this was concluded from the observed translocation of EGFR to the PM. We have also better visualized this translocation by mapping the differential of EGFR concentration as function of time (Figure 5B) and quantified the average PM translocation with and without ectopic c-Cbl expression (Figure 5C).</p><p><italic>In the Discussion: &quot;While EGF-bound receptor clusters await internalization, EGFR continues trafficking from the RE to the PM resulting in a perceived transient translocation of the receptor to the PM immediately after ligand stimulation (Figure 4A).

This new aspect of the EGFR endocytosis system is interesting but the supporting evidence is not sufficiently convincing.</italic> </p><p>We thank the referee for his/her constructive comments and have addressed the relevant issues of overexpression. For this we have added two major experiments that convincingly support our model: Rab11 knock-down and quantification of ectopic in relation to endogenous EGFR levels. The former clearly shows that autocatalysis is suppressed by recycling and the latter that EGFR- mCitrine is expressed at about equal levels to endogenous EGFR.</p><p><italic>1) The equilibrium between constitutive recycling and internalization results in a significantly larger pool of EGFR at the cell surface than in endosomes, at least when distribution of an endogenous EGFR is analyzed. If the assumptions in the present study are correct and endocytosis serves to maintain the endosomal pool of unoccupied EGFR in dephosphorylated state, the bulk of the receptor (located at the cell surface) would be capable of autonomous activation. Once recycled, there would be no mechanism in place to prevent re-activation of the receptors at the cell surface.</italic> </p><p>This non-intuitive concept of an effective PTP activity at the PM as a result of recycling has now been clarified by a theoretical model (Figure 6). Another non-intuitive aspect is that the spontaneous phosphorylation is a two-step process with slow kinetics determined by the thermal fluctuations in kinase conformation (“leaky kinase”) and rapid self-amplifying phosphorylation. If the amount of autonomously phosphorylated EGFR is high enough, autocatalytic phosphorylation takes over and greatly enhances phosphorylation kinetics. While the leaky kinase activity can be suppressed by PM-localized low PTP activity, the high PTP activity required to shut-down autocatalytic phosphorylation would also suppresses phosphorylation of EGF-stimulated EGFR at the PM. The solution of the system is to recycle EGFR to the perinuclear region with high PTP activity that also causes signal shut-down of internalized EGF-EGFR complexes. We now better describe that once the autocatalytic tyrosine is dephosphorylated, only slow kinase activity will rephosphorylate the receptor, which can be countered by low local RPTP activity. When the threshold for autocatalytic activation is passed, the system will rapidly phosphorylate and needs to be reset by dephosphorylation of Y845 by the high activity of perinuclear PTP1B.</p><p><italic>2) The key assumption supporting the proposed model that EGFR dephosphorylation takes place predominantly in the perinuclear area has been demonstrated in the previous study by this group. However, since the publication of the finding, it has been shown that transmembrane PTPs are essential for dephosphorylation of EGFR, and that these PTPs are located at the plasma membrane.</italic> </p><p>We now stress in the manuscript the impact of EGFR-phosphorylation on different tyrosine (Figure 1), and that the autocatalytic site 845 is most sensitive to regulation by dephosphorylation at the perinuclear RE (Figure 4). Only by keeping phosphorylation of Y845 in check via recycling and preventing autocatalytic activation of EGFR, PM-associated PTPs like RPTPs can overcome the autonomous phosphorylation of signaling Y1068 and c-Cbl- binding Y1045. We have also added a discussion of the role of RPTPs versus ER-associated PTPs (see answer to the first comment of referee # 2).</p><p><italic>3) It has been shown in several publications that removal of EGF from the EGFR at the cell surface results in a rapid dephosphorylation of the receptor. If the authors believe that unoccupied EGFR is not dephosphorylated in the plasma membrane, this should be directly demonstrated.</italic> </p><p>We have now clarified in the text that PTP activity at the PM can counter autonomous EGFR phosphorylation, but not autocatalytic phosphorylation. We demonstrate that in order to balance the autocatalytic activity of EGFR, the only solution is recycling through the perinuclear area. Indeed, inhibition of EGFR kinase activity by for example an ATP-binding site competitor results in dephosphorylation of signaling tyrosines (Offterdinger et al. 2004). In this case, there is no autocatalytic maintenance of the kinase activity and the PM-resident low PTP activity suffices to dephosphorylate EGFR on signaling tyrosines. We have better described that there is PTP activity at the PM that does not hinder an EGF response, while the high PTP activity necessary to suppress autocatalysis is in the perinuclear area in order to be compatible with EGFR signaling.</p><p><italic>4) Furthermore, the assumption that ER-associated PTP-1B exhibits a gradient of increasing activity from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear area is somewhat counterintuitive. ER spans the entire cell. The spatial proximities of the ER to the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes are similar. Likewise, ER forms numerous contacts with both the plasma membranes and endosomes.</italic></p><p>In previous work from this laboratory we have clearly demonstrated the gradient of increasing PTP1B activity towards the perinuclear area (Yudushkin et al., Science 2007). Moreover, based on the mass-action law, the strongest interaction between PTP1B and phosphorylated EGFR as its substrate should occur in the perinuclear area. This was substantiated here by showing that the interaction of EGFR with the trapping variant PTP1B-D181A mostly occurs in the perinuclear area within which the RE is contained (new Figure 5E). An important point is that EGFR on its way to the RE is exposed to the dephosphorylating PTP activity: only few of the PTP1B molecules happen to be in close proximity to the PM as compared to the bulk of PTP1B distributed over the ER. This low effective PTP1B activity at the PM can only dephosphorylate a small fraction of PM-localized EGFR.</p><p><italic>It is rather disappointing that the key conclusions in the manuscript are reached in experiments performed under conditions of transient overexpression of EGFR, Rab11 and other constructs in cells that express endogenous EGFR or Rab11.

We have also performed two independent Rab11 knock-down experiments with the exciting and consistent result that it strongly augments the autocatalytic Y845 phosphorylation (~300%). The complementary perturbation by Rab11a-BFP ectopic expression enhances the partitioning of EGFR towards the RE and shows the opposite result of further suppressing Y845 phosphorylation. This clearly demonstrates that the function of recycling is suppression of spontaneous autocatalytic activation.</p><p><italic>There are concerns with regards to the specific data and their interpretations, discussion of experiments and citing the literature as listed below.</italic></p><p><italic>1) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Autonomously and ligand-activated EGFR are different molecular states” with the reference to Figure 1B it is stated that Y1068 is less autonomously phosphorylated than Y845.

However, pervanadate-mediated PTP-inhibition shows that spontaneous autacatalytic phosphorylation by the EGFR kinase activity indeed occurs most efficiently on Y845 as compared to Y1045 or Y1068 (new Figure 1C).</p><p><italic>2) Figure 1E.

In this experiment, binding of the PTB domain only serves as an indicator of EGFR phosphorylation on signaling tyrosines. To avoid confusion, we arranged this into the new Figure 2. The visible accumulation of PTB domain in the nuclear and perinuclear region is a result of widefield microscopy that integrates fluorescence in the z-direction of freely diffusible PTB domain. Figure 4—figure supplement 2 actually shows the interacting fraction of EGFR with the PTB domain and a substantial loss of interaction is clearly visible in the perinuclear area that includes the RE. The most important result of our anisotropy experiments is that upon PV treatment resulting in fully phosphorylated EGFR (new Figure 1C) no change in anisotropy could be observed in contrast to EGF stimulation (compare new Figure 2A with 2C).</p><p><italic>3) Figure 2A. It is impossible to resolve newly-synthesized EGFR from endocytosed EGFR the Golgi area by confocal microscopy. Overexpressed Rab11 is located in compartments with a strikingly morphology as compared to endogenous Rab11, which lessens confidence in the utility of the experiments with overexpressed Rab11.</italic> </p><p>We performed colocalization experiments with Rab11a-BFP and EGFR-mCitrine after treatment with Cyclohexamide to block protein synthesis that showed no change in their colocalization (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).</p><p><italic>4) Figure 2B. It is not apparent that photoactivated EGFR is delivered to the plasma membrane.</italic> </p><p>Ectopic Rab11a-BFP expression leads to a steady-state distribution of EGFR that is shifted toward the RE. This is clearly visible in the EGFR-mCherry fluorescence micrograph that shows a low basal PM staining (Figure 3B). EGFR steady state distribution dictates the low but significant signal of photoactivated EGFR that appears at the PM. We have now added a clearer example of this photoactivated EGFR-paGFP evolution towards the EGFR-mCherry steady state distribution.</p><p><italic>5) Figure 2C. These images clearly demonstrate that internalization of EGFR in the absence of the ligand is very slow (by 40 min, only a very small fraction is seen in punctate structures. These images also show that internalized free EGFR does not reach the recycling compartment marked by overexpressed Rab11. The signal corresponding to internalized EGFR surrounds this compartment.</italic> </p><p>In order to incorporate a clickable unnatural amino acid into the extracellular part of EGFR at position 128, genetic code expansion was optimized in HEK293 cells. These cells exhibit slower recycling than COS-7 cells but the experiment clearly corroborates the anterograde traffic of EGFR from the PM to the RE. We included a fluorescence intensity profile across the RE in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 to show that the accumulated ring of TAMRA- fluorescence overlaps with the Rab11a-BFP signal.</p><p><italic>6) Figure 3A. It is impossible to evaluate the extent of co-localization without the merge image and high resolution single-channel images.</italic> </p><p>For the sake of consistency and simplicity, we have replaced the FRET experiment with a ratiometric immunofluorescence experiment that clearly shows dephosphorylation of Y845 in the perinuclear area that encompasses the RE (new Figure 4C). The previous FRET experiment in life cells that corroborates this result has been removed.</p><p><italic>7) Figure 3D. The image acquisition or image presentation parameters are set to emphasize intracellular compartments, and it is unclear whether these settings allow detection of the diffuse labeling of the surface EGFR. The co-localization of EGFR with Rab11 in these images is claimed to be 63%. This is not apparent from the visual comparison of quite different patterns of localization; here again, an overlap image is needed.</italic> </p><p>We actually computed the overlap between Rab11 and where EGFR interacts with PTP1B D/A. This is distinct from the overlap between EGFR and PTP1B. We have now included a quantification of average α in regions of high EGFR-mCitrine intensity as a function of mean fluorescence that shows that increasing the RE-biogenesis by ectopic Rab11a-BFP expression increases the interaction of EGFR with the PTP1B trapping mutant. This indicates a more efficient EGFR dephosphorylation upon shifting its steady state distribution towards the RE.</p><p><italic>8) Figure 1—figure supplement 4. PTB-1B is highly overexpressed which makes it difficult to evaluate the extent of actual co-localization in this experiment.</italic> </p><p>This experiment shows the interaction of EGFR with PTB domain instead of PTP1B. Ratiometric quantification of PTB recruitment to EGFR was performed at the periphery of the cell, where there is no interference with the freely diffusible PTB domain in the nucleus. See also the answer to point 2).</p><p><italic>9) Figure 2—figure supplement 1B. LAMP1 localization is highly unusual. This could be the effect of mistargeting due to the tag or overexpression.</italic> </p><p>We are not clear, what is unusual about a perinuclear staining of lysosomes by Lamp1-BFP in these small HEK293 cells. This experiment only shows that EGF-stimulated EGFR enters lysosomes within 2 hours.</p><p><italic>10) Figure 3—figure supplement 1. These images are a clear example of an unusual localization likely due to accumulation of overexpressed proteins in the ER and/or other perturbed organelles.</italic> </p><p>This unusual localization is not due to accumulation of overexpressed proteins in the ER. Instead, the reversible trapping of EGFR on PTP1B-D181A causes an accumulation of both proteins in areas of their strongest interaction. This confirms that EGFR interacts most strongly with PTP1B on perinuclear membranes in the vicinity of the RE.</p><p><italic>11) Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 4. These figures demonstrate that PV does not cause any significant endocytosis of ligand-free EGFR.</italic> </p><p>Indeed we show that the steady state distribution caused by recycling does not substantially change by PV treatment, which is consistent with our model that spontaneously phosphorylated EGFR keeps recycling. However, we now also show that recycling receptors transit via Rab5 positive endosomes to the RE (new Figure 3D, E and Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p><italic>Discussion: 1) In the subsection “Ubiquitin-mediated switch in vesicular trafficking of ligand-activated EGFR”. The authors refer to one study that Cbl overexpression accelerates internalization. Multiple other studies clearly demonstrated that Cbl overexpression does not change the internalization rate but in increase the degradation rate of EGFR (in some cells).</italic> </p><p>We now show that in Cos-7 cells, Cbl expression clearly accelerates internalization (Figure 5C).</p><p><italic>2) The model in Figure 5 does not seem take into consideration recycling of EGF-EGFR complexes demonstrated by several groups.</italic></p><p>Recycling occurs mainly at low doses of EGF stimulation (Sigismund et al. 2005, PNAS 102(8), 2760–5), where some receptors might autocatalytically activate but fail to be ubiquitinated due to lack of stable EGF-induced self-association. In our study, where saturating doses of EGF were used, most receptors permanently internalized when we ectopically express c-Cbl. This shows that c-Cbl is a limiting factor in rerouting EGF-EGFR complexes to lysosomes. Therefore, the level of c-Cbl expression in different cells might dictate the fraction of EGF-EGFR complexes that keep recycling.</p><p><italic>3) The assumption that in the absence of the ligand, monomeric receptors are autonomously activated is questionable. There is still a debate in the literature about the existence of less stable unoccupied EGFR dimers. The FRET based assay used in the present study may not be sufficiently sensitive to formally disprove the existence of these dimers. In fact, the strong dependence of the receptor phosphorylation on its expression levels (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) suggests that it this autonomous phosphorylation correlates with the increased probability of monomer-monomer interaction.</italic> </p><p>We embrace the idea of transient dimers that autonomously phosphorylate EGFR in trans based on second order rate reactions. This means that the fraction of interacting EGFR is very low at steady state. We are certain that our homo-FRET assay is sufficiently sensitive, because we measure a distinct drop in anisotropy upon EGF-stimulation (Figure 2A), in contrast to PV- mediated, autocatalytically fully phosphorylated EGFR (Figure 2C). This clearly shows that the autocatalytically phosphorylated EGFR is mostly monomeric.</p></body></sub-article></article>
