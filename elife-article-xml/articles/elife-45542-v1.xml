To explore the role of the Discs large/membrane-associated guanylate kinase (Dlg/MAGUK) family of scaffolding proteins in beta-catenin signaling, we studied vascular endothelial cell (EC)-specific knockout of Dlg1/SAP97. EC-specific loss of Dlg1 produces a retinal vascular phenotype that closely matches the phenotype associated with reduced beta-catenin signaling, synergizes with genetically-directed reductions in beta-catenin signaling components, and can be rescued by stabilizing beta-catenin in ECs. In reporter cells with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation of Dlg1, transfection of Dlg1 enhances beta-catenin signaling ~4 fold. Surprisingly, Frizzled4, which contains a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif that can bind to Dlg1 PDZ domains, appears to function independently of Dlg1 in vivo. These data expand the repertoire of Dlg/MAGUK family functions to include a role in beta-catenin signaling, and they suggest that proteins other than Frizzled receptors interact with Dlg1 to enhance beta-catenin signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vascular endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>canonical Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>mouse genetics</kwd><kwd>retinal angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>blood-retina barrier</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY018637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000997</institution-id><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Discs large homologue 1 (Dlg1) activates beta-catenin (i.e., canonical Wnt) signaling in CNS endothelial cells to regulate retinal angiogenesis and the development and maintenance of the blood-brain and blood-retina barriers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian retina depends on two distinct vascular networks: the choroidal and intra-retinal circulations, which supply the outer third and inner two-thirds of the retina, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun and Smith, 2018</xref>). The intra-retinal vessels originate from the optic nerve and, in the first stage of their development, proliferate radially to cover the vitreal surface of the retina. Vessels from this superficial plexus then grow into the inner retina and form two additional tiers of capillary beds â the deep and intermediate plexuses.</p><p>Mature vascular endothelial cells (ECs) of the central nervous system (CNS), including the retina, form a specialized diffusion barrier between blood and tissue known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and its retinal analog, the blood-retina barrier (BRB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daneman and Prat, 2015</xref>). The specialized features of CNS ECs that account for the barrier include: (i) the presence of tight junctions; (ii) the absence of fenestrations; (iii) suppression of transcytosis; and (iv) expression of small molecule transporters and extrusion pumps. The BBB and BRB allow for the selective transport of small molecules across the endothelium, thereby protecting the surrounding neurons and glia from toxins and other bioactive molecules.</p><p>The growth and differentiation programs of CNS ECs are controlled by multiple signaling systems, including beta-catenin (canonical Wnt) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stenman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liebner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daneman et al., 2009</xref>). In the embryonic brain and spinal cord, neuroepithelium-derived Wnt7a and Wnt7b are the principal beta-catenin signaling ligands required for angiogenesis and BBB development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stenman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daneman et al., 2009</xref>). In the adult brain, Wnt7a and Wnt7b are produced predominantly by glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>). These ligands act on ECs through a Frizzled (Fz) receptor, Lrp5/6 co-receptor, and two Wnt7a/b-specific cell-surface co-activators, Reck and Gpr124 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou and Nathans, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Posokhova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vanhollebeke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eubelen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vallon et al., 2018</xref>). In the retina, MÃ¼ller glia-derived Norrin is the predominant beta-catenin signaling ligand responsible for angiogenesis and BRB development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>). Norrin stimulates beta-catenin signaling in retinal ECs by acting on Fz4, Lrp5, and the Norrin-specific cell-surface co-activator Tspan12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Junge et al., 2009</xref>). In humans, loss-of-function mutations in each of these Norrin signaling components causes retinal hypovascularization, a phenotype that is also observed in the corresponding gene knockout mouse lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>On the cytosolic side of the membrane, beta-catenin signaling involves ligand-dependent receptor/co-receptor regulation of the beta-catenin destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>). The dynamic association, dissociation, internalization, and recycling of receptors, co-receptors, and associated proteins during beta-catenin signaling suggest a potential role for scaffolding proteins in orchestrating this process. Earlier studies showed that Discs large homologue 1 [Dlg1; also called Dlgh1 or synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97)], an intracellular scaffolding protein with PDZ and guanylate kinase domains, can bind to a PDZ-binding motif present at the C-terminus of several Frizzleds, including Fz4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hering and Sheng, 2002</xref>). These data suggest that Dlg1 or other Dlg family members could play a role in beta-catenin signaling, presumably via an effect on trafficking or localization of Frizzled receptors.</p><p>While Dlg family members have been widely studied in the context of cell polarity, synaptic organization, and protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamanaka and Ohno, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Won et al., 2017</xref>), their potential connection to beta-catenin signaling is largely unexplored, and, to our knowledge, is limited to only two reports, one in Drosophila that implies a stimulatory role for Dlg via stabilization of Disheveled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) and the second in mammalian cell culture that implies an inhibitory role for Dlg1 via enhanced GSK3Î² phosphorylation of beta-catenin followed by ubiquitination and proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boccitto et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanism of stimulation described for Drosophila Dlg involves a Disheveled-binding motif that is conserved in mammalian Dlg2 but is absent from the four other mammalian Dlg family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). In P7 mouse brain ECs, RNAseq shows that <italic>Dlg1</italic> transcripts (18 FPKM) areÂ ~7 fold more abundant than transcripts coding for the next most abundant family member, <italic>Dlg5</italic> (2.5 FPKM); transcripts for other <italic>Dlg</italic> family members are present at even lower levels [<italic>Dlg2</italic> (0 FPKM), <italic>Dlg3</italic> (1.5 FPKM), and <italic>Dlg4</italic> (1.5 FPKM)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have identified a role for endothelial Dlg1 in retinal angiogenesis and BBB/BRB development as determined by the phenotype of mice with EC-specific knockout of <italic>Dlg1</italic>.

This idea is supported by the finding that Dlg1 enhances beta-catenin signaling in cultured cells and by rescue of the <italic>Dlg1</italic> EC-specific knockout phenotype upon constitutive beta-catenin stabilization in vivo. Intriguingly, although the first two PDZ domains of Dlg1 bind in vitro to a consensus PDZ-binding motif at the Fz4 C-terminus, genetic epistasis analyses of the EC-specific <italic>Dlg1</italic> knockout and a CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutation of the Fz4 PDZ-binding motif argues that these two proteins function independently in the context of beta-catenin signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Vascular endothelial depletion of Dlg1 impairs retinal angiogenesis</title><p>Ubiquitous loss of <italic>Dlg1</italic> leads to neonatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caruana and Bernstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mahoney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rivera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iizuka-Kogo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iizuka-Kogo et al., 2015</xref>).

Although the site of Dlg1 function has not been defined by the genetic interaction experiments described above, by analogy with Dlg1 function in other contexts, it is a reasonable guess that Dlg1 organizes membrane-associated proteins in ECs. In the context of beta-catenin signaling, Dlg1 could interact directly or indirectly with receptors, co-receptors, the beta-catenin destruction complex, and/or regulators of the destruction complex. With this model in mind, we have asked whether the <italic>Dlg1</italic> null phenotype can be rescued by EC-specific expression of a stabilized derivative of beta-catenin that leads to constitutive signaling independent of ligand/receptor and destruction complex function. More specifically, this experiment involves Cre-mediated excision of <italic>loxP</italic>âflanked exon three from one copy of the beta-catenin gene (<italic>Ctnnb1</italic>; this conditional allele is referred to as <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>flex3</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harada et al., 1999</xref>) using an EC-specific <italic>Pdgfb-CreER</italic> transgene.

For this experiment, recombination was induced with CreER and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) treatment in the immediate postnatal period because constitutive EC-specific activation of beta-catenin signaling, as produced by <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>flex3/+</sup>;Tie2-Cre</italic>, is lethal during embryonic development.</p><p>We analyzed retinas at P7, an age when constitutive loss of endothelial <italic>Dlg1</italic> (<italic>Dlg1<sup>fl/Î</sup>;Tie2Cre</italic>) produces a substantially reduced vascular density compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

We observed a 3- to 4-fold increase in luciferase activity for the majority of Wnt ligands upon co-transfection with Myc-Dlg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, co-expressed Myc-Dlg1 had little effect on signaling by Wnt7a and Wnt7b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In vivo, Gpr124 and Reck function as specific co-factors for Wnt7a and Wnt7b signaling. Although the C-terminus of Gpr124 contains a conserved PDZ-binding domain that has been reported to directly interact with Dlg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Posokhova et al., 2015</xref>), Myc-Dlg1 co-transfection of <italic>Dlg1</italic> KO STF cells transfected with Wnt7a, Gpr124, and Reck increased beta-catenin signaling by onlyÂ ~1.5 fold at the optimal Myc-Dlg1 plasmid concentration of 2.5 ng/well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, in the context of transfected STF cells, Dlg1 plays only a modest role in Wnt7a/Fz/Gpr124/Reck signaling.</p><p>We next explored whether other mammalian Dlg family members could activate beta-catenin signaling in STF cells. Dlg constructs with an N-terminal Myc tag (Dlg1-Dlg4) or V5 tag (Dlg5) showed protein accumulation at the expected molecular weights in transfected HEK/293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In <italic>Dlg1</italic> KO STF cells transfected with Norrin, Fz4, and the individual Dlg family members, robust stimulation of beta-catenin signaling was produced by Myc-Dlg1, Myc-Dlg2, and Myc-Dlg4, with a bell-shaped (Dlg1) or monotonic (Dlg2 and Dlg4) plasmid concentration dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). In contrast, Myc-Dlg3 and V5-Dlg5 produced minimal stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). These data imply that Dlg2 and Dlg4 are the Dlg family members most capable of substituting for Dlg1. We speculate that the difference in the shapes of the dose-response curves may be due to: (i) a requirement for higher concentrations of Myc-Dlg2 and Myc-Dlg4 to elicit a dominant-negative effect on beta-catenin signaling; or (ii) the presence of one or more essential proteins that is/are sequestered by Myc-Dlg1 but not Myc-Dlg2 and Myc-Dlg4. Thus, in both CNS ECs and STF cells, where Dlg2 and Dlg4 transcripts are relatively rare, Dlg1 is likely to be the most important family member for beta-catenin signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Biochemical properties and cell culture activity of the Fz4 C-terminal PDZ-binding motif</title><p>As noted in the Introduction, the simplest and most attractive model for Dlg1 stimulation of beta-catenin signaling posits a direct interaction between one or more of the Dlg1 PDZ domains and the canonical PDZ-binding motif at the C-terminus of many Frizzled receptors, including Fz4. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a previous study reported that a C-terminal peptide from Fz4, which ends with the consensus PDZ-binding motif ETVV [conforming to the type I C-terminal PDZ-binding motif consensus S/T-X-V/L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bezprozvanny and Maximov, 2001</xref>), can interact directly with a fragment of Dlg1 comprising PDZ domains 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hering and Sheng, 2002</xref>).

A comparison of the luciferase response of <italic>Dlg1</italic> KO STF cells to transfection with Norrin and WT Fz4 vs. Fz4(4A), together with variable amounts of Myc-Dlg1 plasmid, showed that Fz4(4A) elicited aÂ ~5 fold lower response than WT Fz4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), roughly consistent with the several-fold lower level of Fz4(4A) accumulation, as determined by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Importantly, the combination of Norrin and Fz4(4A) exhibited a similar Myc-Dlg1 dose dependence â especially at low Myc-Dlg1 plasmid concentrations â as did the combination of Norrin and WT Fz4, suggesting that Dlg1 stimulates beta-catenin signaling in the same manner in these two contexts. In conclusion, the Dlg1-dependent stimulation of beta-catenin signaling activity by a Fz4 mutant that abrogates Dlg1-Fz4 binding argues that this interaction is dispensable for beta-catenin signaling, at least in STF reporter cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45542.014</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Mutation of the Fz4 C-terminal PDZ-binding domain enhances the severity of retinal vascular defects in a <italic>Dlg1</italic> mutant background.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the <italic>Fz4</italic> allele produced by CRISPR/Cas9 editing (<italic>Fz4<sup>MGK</sup></italic>).

This conclusion is based on: (i) the similarity in the retinal vascular phenotypes associated with EC-specific loss of <italic>Dlg1</italic> and EC-specific reductions in beta-catenin signaling, (ii) the phenotypic synergy produced by the combination of EC-specific loss of <italic>Dlg1</italic> and loss-of-function mutations in Fz4 or Tspan12 (in the retina) and Ndp or Tspan12 (in the brain), (iii) the nearly complete rescue of EC-specific loss of <italic>Dlg1</italic> by EC-specific stabilization of beta-catenin, and (iv) the 3â4 fold enhancement of beta-catenin signaling stimulated by multiple Wnts or Norrin in <italic>Dlg1</italic> knockout cell lines in response to Dlg1 transfection.

This possibility was initially suggested by the observation that mutation of the Fz4 C-terminal PDZ-binding motif in vivo (Fz4<italic><sup>MGK</sup></italic>) has no apparent retinal vascular phenotype â thatÂ is, it does not recapitulate the phenotype associated with EC-specific loss of <italic>Dlg1</italic>.

While these observations do not preclude the possibility of an in vivo interaction between Dlg1 and the Fz4 C-terminus, they imply that an interaction between the Fz4 C-terminus and a different partner is of greater functional significance. The most parsimonious explanations for the genetic data are that (i) loss of the Fz4 C-terminal motif reduces beta-catenin signaling in vivo (as it does in transfected cells) but not so much as to produce a retinal vascular phenotype, (ii) loss of Dlg1, which interacts with proteins other than Fz4, reduces beta-catenin signaling in vivo to produce a mild retinal vascular phenotype, and (iii) simultaneous loss of both the Fz4 C-terminal motif and Dlg1 reduces beta-catenin signaling further than with either mutation alone, producing a more severe vascular phenotype.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Roles of the Dlg family in epithelia and neurons</title><p>The first Dlg family member was identified in Drosophila where its loss-of-function phenotype causes neoplastic transformation of imaginal disc cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woods and Bryant, 1991</xref>).

APC is a large (~300 kDa) protein that plays an important role in assembling the beta-catenin destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Munemitsu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rubinfeld et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stamos and Weis, 2013</xref>). Other APC functions include modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cytoskeletal signaling. In addition to binding to Dlg1, APC binding partners include the kinesin KAP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jimbo et al., 2002</xref>), the GTPase activating protein IQGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watanabe et al., 2004</xref>), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ASEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>), and the plus ends of polymerizing microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahmanyar et al., 2009</xref>). We speculate that Dlg1-mediated changes in the subcellular localization of APC or in the interaction of APC with its protein partners could reduce APC-dependent beta-catenin destruction, thereby enhancing beta-catenin signaling. We note, however, that this interaction depends on the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of Dlg1, deletion of which reduces but does not eliminate beta-catenin stimulation in STF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>A second candidate for interacting with Dlg1 in the context of beta-catenin signaling in CNS ECs is Gpr124, a seven transmembrane protein in the adhesion GPCR family that functions in concert with the GPI-anchored protein Reck to enhance Wnt7a/b-specific signaling through Frizzled receptors and Lrp5/6 co-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou and Nathans, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Posokhova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vanhollebeke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eubelen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vallon et al., 2018</xref>). Gpr124 plays a major role in angiogenesis and vascular barrier development in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuhnert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cullen et al., 2011</xref>) and a minor role in angiogenesis and vascular barrier development in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>). As noted in the Results section, Gpr124 has a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif that has been shown to bind to Dlg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Posokhova et al., 2015</xref>). However, deletion of the Gpr124 PDZ binding motif or most of the Gpr124 intracellular domain impairs beta-catenin signaling by onlyÂ ~20â40% in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Posokhova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vallon et al., 2018</xref>), and Dlg1 co-transfection produces only aÂ ~1.5x stimulation of Wnt7a/Fz/Gpr124/Reck signaling in STF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Whether there is a larger synergy among these components in vivo remains to be determined.</p><p>By analogy with the <italic>Dlg1</italic> and <italic>Fz4</italic> genetic interaction experiments described here, it would be of interest to examine genetic interactions between <italic>Dlg1</italic> and other <italic>Frizzled</italic> genes. Late gestation <italic>Dlg1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fetuses exhibit (i) mis-orientation of the stereociliary bundles in inner ear sensory hair cells, (ii) defects in the closure of the palate, neural tube, and eyelids, and (iii) multiple cardiac defects, including ventricular septal defect, persistent truncus arteriosus, and double outlet right ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rivera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iizuka-Kogo et al., 2015</xref>). In various combinations, these defects are precisely the ones present in the following double mutant fetuses: <italic>Fz3<sup>-/-</sup>;Fz6<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Fz1<sup>-/-</sup>;Fz2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Fz2<sup>-/-</sup>;Fz7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). The similarities between <italic>Dlg1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and these Frizzled double mutant phenotypes suggest that they result from disruptions in the same signaling pathway. More specifically, the <italic>Dlg1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> phenotypes have been interpreted as reflecting a defect in planar cell polarity signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rivera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iizuka-Kogo et al., 2015</xref>). This interpretation could account for those phenotypes referable to reduced signaling by Fz3 and Fz6, two Frizzleds that appear to be devoted exclusively to planar cell polarity signaling, as judged by their asymmetric subcellular localization and their failure to activate beta-catenin (i.e. canonical Wnt) signaling in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). However, this interpretation may be incomplete for those phenotypes referable to reduced signaling by Fz1, Fz2, and Fz7, as current evidence suggests that this Frizzled subfamily can transduce both planar polarity and beta-catenin signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lhomond et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Dlg1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fetuses exhibit defects in renal and urogenetial development that are partially overlapping with defects caused by knockout of <italic>Wnt4</italic>, further suggestive of a link to beta-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vainio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iizuka-Kogo et al., 2007</xref>). In light of the evidence presented here that Dlg1 enhances beta-catenin signaling in CNS ECs, it seems reasonable to suggest that Dlg1 enhances beta-catenin signaling in other biological contexts and that part of the <italic>Dlg1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> phenotype reflects this activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joseph Gleeson as the Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.

The work provides support for a role of Dlg1 in promoting both Norrin/Fz4/Tspan12 signaling and Wnt7/Fz/Gpr124/Reck signaling, and the rescue by beta-catenin stabilization indicates that this is beta catenin-dependent. The authors provide direct evidence for this interaction in vitro and identify the domains involved. However, based on in vivo evidence obtained generating a new FZD4 mutant line, they conclude that the binding between the Fzd4 C-terminus and the PDZ domains of Dlg1 plays no role in the Dlg1-dependent enhancement of beta-catenin signaling in CNS ECs. Reviewer 2 and 3 found that the work is novel and exciting, experimental design is sound, results and conclusions are convincing and commented that the paper fits very well with the Journal's scope and wide readership. Reviewer 3 commented that the evidence from the Fz4(MGK/MGK) cross is not sufficient to conclude that the Dlg1-Fzd4 interaction plays no role in regulating beta-catenin. Reviewer 1 found that the link between Dlg1 and canonical Wnt pathway unconvincing, and while convinced by the Fz4(MGK/MGK) results, Reviewer 1 encouraged new experiments to directly link Dlg1 with the components of the Wnt pathway.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The cell culture experiments are confounding, seem to yield insignificant or minor fold change levels, and directly contradict the better experiment of testing Fz4 C terminal modification in vivo, which shows no direct connection between Dlg1 and Fz4. Can the authors reconcile these observations?</p><p>2) The last experiment is a good negative result, but besides this specific non-interaction we do not learn anything concrete about Dlg1 in retinal angiogenesis or its connection to signaling pathways. Reviewer 3 encourages the authors to try new experiments to directly link Dlg1 with components of the Wnt pathway and so offer something more than speculation.</p><p>3) Without a detailed characterisation of the expression profile of the EC from the mutant mice (which is clearly beyond the scope of this study), it is not possible to confidently conclude that the Dlg4-Fzd4 interaction does not play a role in these phenotypes. We recommend revising the interpretation of the findings to include this possibility in the interpretation of the results. Given the extensive section on possible alternatives to Fzd4 in the Discussion, it would be tempting to ask for some evidence for a role for APC or Gpr124 in this study; however, this is likely to be the focus of following papers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45542.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The cell culture experiments are confounding, seem to yield insignificant or minor fold change levels, and directly contradict the better experiment of testing Fz4 C terminal modification in vivo, which shows no direct connection between Dlg1 and Fz4.

However, we disagree with the above comment in regard to the more important cell culture analyses of the activity of Dlg1 and the other Dlg family members in combination with Norrin and Wnts (Figure 6). In Figure 6, we observed that Dlg1 transfection of the Dlg1 KO reporter cell line produced a dose-dependent enhancement of beta-catenin signal strength that was maximally ~4-fold over baseline in the presence of Norrin and various Wnts. A 4-fold change may sound modest, but we note that (i) the reporter cell line also expresses other Dlg family members, which could contribute to the non-zero signal in the absence of Dlg1 transfection (hence lowering the fold induction), (ii) the well-established Norrin/Fz4 signaling co-activator Tspan12 gives only a several-fold induction in this and other reporter assays, and (iii) signaling in transiently transfected reporter cells (where receptors and/or ligands are over-expressed) is an imperfect proxy for signaling in the living animal where all of the signaling proteins are present at low abundance. We specifically disagree with the implication that the changes shown in Figure 6 are: (i) âinsignificantâ (on the contrary, they are of high statistical significance, and the mouse Dlg1 KO phenotype implies that they are also of biological significance), or (ii) âminorâ (see the preceding sentence regarding the 4-fold increase in signal amplitude).</p><p>Regarding the comment that the results in cell culture âcontradict the better experiment of testing Fz4 C terminal modification in vivoâ, our view is that both sets of experiments are technically âcorrectâ and it is only their interpretations that potentially contradict each other. More specifically, these experiments teach the lesson that âall that glitters (in cell culture and in vitro) is not necessarily gold (in vivo)â, a lesson that is sometimes ignored in the world of biomedical research. There are many binding interactions (like the Fz4 C-terminus and Dlg1 PDZ interaction) that are biochemically ârealâ but still need to be tested for their biological significance, and here is one system where that has been done. This aspect of the present body of work may recommend this paper as a good one for students to read.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The last experiment is a good negative result, but besides this specific non-interaction we do not learn anything concrete about Dlg1 in retinal angiogenesis or its connection to signaling pathways. Reviewer 3 encourages the authors to try new experiments to directly link Dlg1 with components of the Wnt pathway and so offer something more than speculation.</p></disp-quote><p>That is a valid criticism. The current study has tested the most favored model â that the PDZ-binding motif in Fz4 interacts directly with the PDZ domain of Dlg1 in vascular endothelial cells â and ruled it out as a significant mechanism for Dlg1 action in beta-catenin signaling in vivo. Now we are left with a large number of possible targets for Dlg1 action, i.e., any other intracellular or trans-membrane protein involved in beta-catenin signaling. Taking the next step to identify and validate those target(s) is going to be a major undertaking and we think that it is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Without a detailed characterisation of the expression profile of the EC from the mutant mice (which is clearly beyond the scope of this study), it is not possible to confidently conclude that the Dlg4-Fzd4 interaction does not play a role in these phenotypes.

We agree that a Dlg1-Fz4 interaction could exist in vivo in ECs and that eliminating that interaction could produce a phenotype that is so subtle that we have missed it based on our histologic analyses. A transcriptome analysis could reveal such a phenotype, if it exists. As suggested, we have modified the Discussion to include this possibility. We agree that genetic analyses with Dlg1 and APC or with Dlg1 and Gpr124 are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
