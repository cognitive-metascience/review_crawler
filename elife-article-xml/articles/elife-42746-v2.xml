ganglia circuits under conditions of low dopamine. Despite well-established physiological criteria to define basal ganglia dysfunction, correlations between individual parameters and motor symptoms are often weak, challenging their predictive validity and causal contributions to behavior. One limitation is that basal ganglia pathophysiology is studied only at end-stages of depletion, leaving an impoverished understanding of when deficits emerge and how they evolve over the course of depletion. In this study, we use toxin- and neurodegeneration-induced mouse models of dopamine depletion to establish the physiological trajectory by which the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) transitions from the healthy to the diseased state. We find that physiological progression in the SNr proceeds in discrete state transitions that are highly stereotyped across models and correlate well with the prodromal and symptomatic stages of behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SNr</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>6-OHDA</kwd><kwd>synuclein</kwd><kwd>physiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS095103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gittis</surname><given-names>Aryn H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS101016-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gittis</surname><given-names>Aryn H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS093944</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Willard</surname><given-names>Amanda M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS090745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mastro</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS101821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whalen</surname><given-names>Timothy C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01AG056841-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Xiaobo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006309</institution-id><institution>American Parkinson Disease Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Xiaobo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transition in basal ganglia output from the healthy to the diseased state is biphasic, stereotyped across models, and suggests key time points for delivering therapeutic interventions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a movement disorder caused by the progressive degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The main projection targets of SNc dopamine neurons are motor territories of the basal ganglia, especially the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Björklund and Dunnett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lavoie et al., 1989</xref>). As a result, the classical symptoms of PD are motor, including resting tremor, postural abnormalities, gait disturbances, and decreased/slowed movement. Physiological indicators of basal ganglia dysfunction in the parkinsonian state include changes in both neuronal firing rates and patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bevan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hammond et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Obeso et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichmann and Dostrovsky, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The ‘rate model’ posits that motor symptoms are the result of elevated firing rates of basal ganglia output neurons under dopamine depleted conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">DeLong, 1990</xref>). However, changes in both the magnitude and sign of firing rates vary widely across studies, suggesting that rates alone do not account entirely for motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Leblois et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Seeger-Armbruster and von Ameln-Mayerhofer, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wichmann et al., 1999</xref>). An alternative model is that motor deficits are more closely related to changes in neuronal firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guridi and Alegre, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hammond et al., 2007a</xref>). Under dopamine depleted conditions, basal ganglia output neurons fire more irregularly and synchronously than under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Filion and Tremblay, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Galvan and Wichmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heimer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hutchison et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wichmann et al., 2002</xref>), but the relationship between firing patterns and the manifestation of motor symptoms is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Muralidharan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wichmann and Soares, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wichmann et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Despite a vast literature describing basal ganglia pathophysiology at end-stages of dopamine loss, the question of <italic>when</italic> deficits emerge over the course of progressive depletion is poorly understood. PD is a gradual, neurodegenerative disorder and motor symptoms rarely present until late stages of dopamine loss (~20–30% striatal dopamine remaining) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernheimer et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fahn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Riederer and Wuketich, 1976</xref>). At this stage, treatments are limited to those that minimize symptoms rather than disease-modifying therapies. Diagnosing and treating patients during the presymptomatic, or ‘prodromal’ phase of the disease – when dopamine levels have started to decline but motor symptoms are not yet present – would increase options for treatment and result in better patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Olanow and Obeso, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schapira and Tolosa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tolosa et al., 2009</xref>). However, little is known about the physiological trajectory of basal ganglia circuits as they transition from the healthy to the diseased state. Do physiological changes emerge all at once, or is there a hierarchical progression? Does their severity worsen monotonically, or are there discrete inflection points that predict the transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic stages of the disease? Answering these questions is critical to develop therapeutic strategies for early intervention.</p><p>To study the onset and progression of basal ganglia pathophysiology during progressive dopamine loss, we recorded from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) of mice at different severities of dopamine depletion, induced at rates ranging from 3 days – 6 months, using both toxin and neurodegenerative models. We found that across models, SNr pathophysiology progressed as transitions through discrete physiological states that were highly stereotyped across models and independent of the rate or mechanism of depletion. Our results suggest that basal ganglia output is initially very sensitive to dopamine loss and small decreases in dopamine are sufficient to transition the SNr from its normal physiological state into a ‘moderate’ pathophysiological state. In the moderate pathophysiological state, the SNr is robust to continued decreases in dopamine levels, possibly reflecting compensatory plasticity, until undergoing a final state transition into the ‘severe’ pathophysiological state when dopamine levels drop below 25–35% remaining. These results reveal key inflection points in the progression of basal ganglia pathophysiology that correlate with symptomatic manifestation over the course of progressive dopamine loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SNr pathophysiology at End-Stages of dopamine depletion in awake mice</title><p>To establish the electrophysiological parameters that define SNr pathophysiology at end-stages of dopamine loss, we performed in vivo recordings from the SNr of awake, bilaterally depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Recordings targeted to the SNr were confirmed by the presence of fast, tonically active units (~30–40% were modulated by movement), and by visualizing the recording track postmortem with immunostaining against the microglial marker, Iba-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Depletions were induced by infusing 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the bilateral medial forebrain bundle (MFB), either in a single, high-dose infusion (‘acute’;~3 days), or through a series of repeated, low-dose infusions, spaced 5 days apart (‘gradual’; 38 ± 15 days). In all mice, depletion severity was quantified using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the striatum, a metric that is well correlated with tissue dopamine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Willard et al., 2015</xref>). On average, striatal TH levels were 4.1 ± 2.6% (relative to control) in acutely depleted mice and 3.7 ± 4.4% in gradually depleted mice. Because mice at advanced stages of depletion rarely initiated movements on the wheel (&lt;2% of time spent moving), SNr physiology across conditions was compared during periods of rest (see: Materials and methods).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42746.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SNr pathophysiology at late stages of dopamine depletion is similar between acutely and gradually depleted mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of in vivo recording setup depicting head-restrained mouse on top of a freely moving wheel with a sensor to record wheel movement and a linear silicone probe to record SNr units.

Increased spectral power in the beta frequency range (13–30 Hz, ‘β−oscillations’) has been observed in human PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hammond et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jenkinson and Brown, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kühn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Quinn et al., 2015</xref>) and some animal models of dopamine depletion. To quantify fractional β power, we divided the power in the β range by total power in 1–100 Hz of the local field potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We observed no difference in fractional β between Ctl, Acute and Grad mice (1-way ANOVA, p = 0.076), consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lobb et al., 2013</xref>). These results suggest that elevated β-oscillations are not a robust feature of SNr pathophysiology in 6-OHDA depleted mice.</p><p>To examine more directly whether spiking synchrony is affected by dopamine depletion, we calculated the cross-correlation of pairs of spike trains over short time windows and normalized each window to account for nonstationarities in firing rates over a recording session. We then calculated a 99% confidence interval for each pair. A pair was termed ‘synchronous’ if its correlation at zero lag exceeded this confidence interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, see Materials and methods). We found that the average percentage of synchronous pairs was 8.6 ± 7.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 7 animals) in control mice but increased to 30.6 ± 11.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 7 animals) and 28.0 ± 22.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 9 animals) in acutely and gradually depleted mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) (Dunnett, Ctl vs. Acute, Grad, p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Taken together, our results confirm the presence of multiple physiological changes in SNr neurons under dopamine depleted conditions. Although no single parameter appeared to reliably distinguish gradually from acutely depleted mice, it is possible that simultaneous changes in multiple parameters distinguish these two conditions. To test this possibility, we trained a classifier to discriminate acutely from gradually depleted mice using the pathophysiological metrics described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, and see Materials and methods). The classifier was unable to discriminate these conditions above chance levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) (60.2 ± 24% CI<sub>95</sub>, right-tail t-test vs. chance, 50%, p = 0.3842, n = 16 mice). By contrast, retraining the same model to discriminate end-stage mice (Grad +Acute) from control mice resulted in classification well above chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>) (84.9 ± 12% CI<sub>95</sub>, right-tail t-test vs. chance, 50%, p = 7.87×10<sup>−6</sup>, n = 23 mice). Importantly, the majority of mice from both depletion models were correctly classified (G5% = 7/9 mice, A5% = 6/7 mice). Examination of the model coefficients showed that successful discrimination largely depended on the pathophysiological changes described above, as well as interactions between FR and spike patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). These results suggest that stereotyped changes in SNr physiology occur at end-stages of dopamine loss, regardless of whether dopamine is depleted slowly over a month, or acutely, over days.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SNr pathophysiology proceeds in two phases during gradual dopamine depletion</title><p>To determine how SNr pathophysiology develops over the course of gradual dopamine loss, we performed in vivo recordings from mice at different stages of depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).

We observed that the physiological transition from control to fully depleted mice followed a biphasic decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).

At end-stage, the model fit to gradually depleted mouse physiology PC1 scores overlapped almost identically with the mean physiology PC1 score calculated from acutely depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, ‘Acute’).

To train the model, we segregated mice into three groups based on depletion severity ('early', intermediate', 'late'). The ‘intermediate’ group included mice whose dopamine levels fell within a symmetric window centered around the local minimum of PC1 (55 ± 20 %TH; n = 14 mice). The ‘early’ group included all mice above this window (100–75%, n = 15 mice), and the ‘late’ group included all mice below (35–0%, n = 41 mice). We then tested the classification accuracy of each mouse (jack-knife, 500 permutations), and whether it was predicted as ‘early’, ‘intermediate’ or ‘late’ depletion groups. The multinomial classifier successfully separated mice into each of these groups 52.9% of the time, significantly more often than expected by chance (33%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) (multi-class Matthew's Correlation Coefficient = 0.25, p = 0.004, permutation test). Next, we trained a multinomial classifier to separate mice into four dopamine groups, however this classifier made errors consistent with there being only three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), further supporting three distinct physiological states. Finally, to test whether physiological states were stereotyped across depletion models, we reassessed ‘early,’ ‘intermediate,’ and ‘late’ mouse classification accuracy by instead grouping mice by depletion model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We found that mice from all depletion models (Ctl, Acute, Gradual, α-Syn, and Ipsi), were classified into ‘early,’ ‘intermediate,’ and ‘late’ depletion groups above chance (p = 0.0237, Chi<sup>2</sup> = 11.3, Pearson’s chi-square test). Taken together, these results suggest that over the course of dopamine loss, deterioration of SNr physiology occurs as a series of state transitions: from ‘normal’ to ‘moderate’, and from ‘moderate’ to ‘severe’.</p><p>To determine which physiological changes were most responsible for each state transition, we plotted the multinomial coefficients used by the classifier to separate ‘early,’ ‘intermediate,’ and ‘late’ depletion groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results suggest that transitions from the normal to moderate state were driven by increased irregularity, and firing rate interactions with spike patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Transitions from the moderate to severe state were driven by increased synchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). To better visualize how changes in firing rates and patterns progress over the course of dopamine loss, and whether these changes promote or oppose dysfunction, we created a continuous measure of similarity between each parameter and its value at end-stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, see: Materials and methods). During early dopamine loss, decreases in firing rate and increases in synchrony pushed the SNr towards pathology, transitioning from a ‘normal’ to ‘moderate’ pathophysiological state. As dopamine loss progressed, increases in irregularity and bursting promoted further dysfunction, but were offset by a decrease in synchrony and partial recovery of firing rate. These changes opposed dysfunction and possibly kept the SNr buffered in a ‘moderate’ pathophysiological state. At late stages of dopamine loss, however, this buffering broke down and dysfunction aligned across all physiological parameters, transitioning the SNr into a final, ‘severe’ pathophysiological state.</p><p>Finally, to capture the relationship between physiology and behavior across all bilateral depletion models, we fit a 2D polynomial to behavior PC1, physiological PC1, and dopamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

Taken together, these results expose the hierarchical progression of physiological changes in the SNr over the course of progressive dopamine loss and a stereotyped relationship between pathophysiological states and motor symptoms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study reveals that over the course of progressive dopamine loss, SNr dysfunction progresses through a series of discrete state transitions. Small reductions in dopamine are sufficient to transition the SNr out of its ‘normal’ physiological state and into a ‘moderate’ pathophysiological state. The SNr remains buffered in this moderate pathophysiological state over a range of dopamine levels until finally transitioning into a ‘severe’ pathophysiological state at end-stages of depletion. These physiological transitions were well correlated with behavioral transitions into the prodromal and symptomatic states, respectively. The finding that SNr pathophysiology progresses in discrete stages, rather than smoothly as a function of dopamine loss, suggests different windows of opportunity for delivering specific therapies. Our results predict that interventions that preferentially affect firing rate (i.e. L-DOPA) are more likely to be effective at earlier stages of depletion rather than late, whereas interventions that preferentially affect regularity and synchrony (i.e. DBS) are more likely to be effective at late stages of depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E</xref>). These results establish a conceptual framework for understanding the dynamic nature by which individual physiological parameters contribute to basal ganglia dysfunction over time and establishes a predictive model for therapeutic outcomes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Physiological states in the SNr predict behavioral states</title><p>Changes in firing rate, irregularity, bursts, and synchrony are well-established indicators of basal ganglia dysfunction under conditions of low dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Galvan and Wichmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Obeso et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichmann and Dostrovsky, 2011</xref>), but their validity as biomarkers for different stages of PD has been underexplored. This is because most physiological studies are done at end-stages of depletion, or in symptomatic animals, precluding analysis of <italic>when</italic> physiological changes emerge, and whether they are accurate predictors of behavioral state.

For example, changes in firing rates are sufficient to transition animals between mobile and immobile states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lemos et al., 2016</xref>), but during progressive dopamine loss, firing rate changes emerge before the onset of motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bezard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bezard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bezard et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, the therapeutic efficacy of DBS is well correlated with its ability to reduce synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hammond et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kühn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ray et al., 2008</xref>), but the degree of synchrony does not necessarily predict motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Connolly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Leblois et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mallet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Muralidharan et al., 2016</xref>). These and other observations have sparked controversy over whether changes in basal ganglia physiology underlie motor deficits in PD, or whether motor deficits are better predicted by physiological changes at areas outside the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bezard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dirkx et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gradinaru et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu and Hallett, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our results help to reconcile these seemingly contradictory results, by establishing the chronology of physiological changes in the SNr. Metrics of single-unit activity (rate, irregularity, bursts) were altered at early or intermediate stages of dopamine loss, but because these changes occurred out-of-phase with one another, they buffered the SNr in a 'moderate' pathophysiological state, during which motor function remained relatively intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>). Firing rates were the first parameter to change, followed by an increase in irregularity and bursting. Intriguingly, during the moderate pathophysiological state, modest hyperactivity was seen at the behavioral level in both 6-OHDA and PFF α-syn mice, perhaps reflecting the engagement of compensatory plasticity.</p><p>At late stages of dopamine depletion (&lt;35% remaining), all physiological parameters began to change in unison, transitioning the SNr into a severe pathophysiological state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>). This transition appeared to be driven by increased synchrony and correlated strongly with the onset of motor symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>). This result suggests a mechanism to account for a long-standing paradox of parkinsonian motor symptoms: alleviation of motor symptoms can be correlated with individual physiological parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hammond et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kravitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kühn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mastro et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhuang et al., 2018</xref>), but rarely do single parameters predict the onset of motor symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Muralidharan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>). Our model reconciles this apparent paradox by predicting that motor symptoms emerge when the SNr is in the severe pathological state, which requires alignment of pathophysiology across many different parameters. Conversely, our data predict that changes in any individual parameter would be sufficient to transition the SNr out of the severe pathological state and into the moderate pathophysiological state, where few if any motor deficits are observed. This prediction is supported by findings that Levodopa (L-DOPA) restores movement predominantly through effects on firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aristieta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hernandez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>) whereas DBS restores movement predominantly through effects on firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birdno and Grill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McCairn and Turner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McCairn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhuang et al., 2018</xref>).

However, because most studies of compensatory plasticity have been performed at end-stages of dopamine loss, the extent to which these mechanisms offset or delay disease progression is poorly understood.</p><p>Our results suggest a role for compensatory plasticity in maintaining the intermediate physiological state in the SNr. At early stages of dopamine loss, SNr firing rates were initially decreased, but moved towards higher values as burst firing and irregularity became more severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Although we do not know the cellular mechanisms driving these physiological changes, they are consistent with hypotheses that bursting/irregularity emerge as a result of compensatory mechanisms engaged to counteract aberrant firing rates. In the striatum, firing rate changes in spiny projection neurons (SPNs) drive plasticity of inhibitory microcircuits that promote synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gittis et al., 2011</xref>). Synchronized output of the striatum can in turn promote irregular, burst/pause firing in the GPe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kita and Kita, 2011</xref>), which further amplifies pathological synchrony throughout the circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corbit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sharott et al., 2017</xref>). Firing rate changes have also been shown to drive plasticity of connections between the GPe and STN, promoting oscillatory entrainment between these structures and contributing to pathological synchrony observed at later stages of depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fan et al., 2012b</xref>).</p><p>With continued dopamine depletion, the physiological buffering observed during the intermediate state breaks down and the SNr transitions into a severe physiological state, coincident with the onset of motor symptoms. This severe physiological state was stereotyped across models, regardless of the time course or symmetry of depletions, suggesting that end-stage physiological deficits are not influenced by previous compensation. These results suggest that the transition from the asymptomatic to the symptomatic stage represents the tipping point at which the compensatory capabilities of the system become overwhelmed by the severity of dopamine depletion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)(M and F)</td><td>C57BL/6J mouse</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>stock_number:000664; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td>Note: now bred in-house</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide, 6-OHDA</td><td>Sigma Aldrich</td><td>stock_number:H116-5MG</td><td>(0.75 μg/ hemisphere gradual; 5 μg/hemisphere - acute, unilateral)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide, 6-OHDA</td><td>Tocris</td><td>stock_number:2547 CAS 636-00-0</td><td>(5 μg/hemisphere - acute, unilateral)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Tyrosine Hydroxylase, anti-TH rabbit</td><td>Pel-Freez Biologicals</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2617184">AB_2617184</ext-link>; catalog_number:P40101-150;</td><td>(1:1000 diluted with glycerol)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2536183">AB_2536183</ext-link>; catalog_number:A-31573;</td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Iba-1 rabbit</td><td>Wako</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_839504">AB_839504</ext-link>; catalog_number:019–19741; lot_number: WDJ3047</td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit Anti-Human alpha Synuclein, phospho (Ser129) Monoclonal; Unconjugated, Clone EP1536Y</td><td>AbCam</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_869973">AB_869973</ext-link>; stock_number:ab51253</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit</td><td>Life technologies</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2535792">AB_2535792</ext-link>; catalog_number:A-21206;</td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SPSS Statistics</td><td>IBM</td><td>version:24</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MATLAB</td><td>Mathworks</td><td>version:2018a</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>recombinant a-syn</td><td>DOI:10.1126/science. <break/>aah3374</td><td/><td>(6 μg/hemisphere)</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>EthoVision XT 9.0 software</td><td>Noldus</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000441">SCR_000441</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Additional information and requests for reagents and resources will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Aryn Gittis (agittis@cmu.edu).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data availability</title><p>Processed data and code used to generate figure panels can be found online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/KidElectric/willard2018a.git">https://github.com/KidElectric/willard2018a.git</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Isett et al., 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/willard2018a">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/willard2018a</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and with approval from Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

The minimum interval between two consecutive procedures was 30 min. Mice were habituated to the testing room for 20 min before testing.</p><p><italic>Open Field:</italic> To determine overall spontaneous mobility, mice were placed in the center of a 1,600 cm<sup>2</sup> clear square open field chamber with video monitoring from above. Mice were in the arena for a total of 20 m, with 10 m for acclimation to the arena, and 10 m for data acquisition. Positions of nose, tail, and center of mass of each mouse were tracked using EthoVision XT software (Noldus). Distance traveled and average velocities for the 10 m data acquisition period were calculated using EthoVision. The arena was cleaned with 50% ethanol in between animals.</p><p><italic>Rearing:</italic> To assess spontaneous vertical activity, mice were placed in a standard 1000 mL glass beaker with video monitoring from the side for a total of 10 min. The number of full extension rears was manually scored post-hoc by observers blind to treatment. The beaker was cleaned with 50% ethanol between each animal.</p><p><italic>Pole Task:</italic> To evaluate coordination and bradykinesia, mice were placed head-upward at the top of a vertical gauze-wrapped circular wooden pole (diameter = 1 cm; height = 55 cm) placed inside a clean home cage with video monitoring from the side. To encourage descent, a 60-watt lamp was aimed at the top of the pole. Mice were given a total of 6 trials, the first three for training, the last three for testing. The latency to turn downward (turn down latency = TDL), time from orientation downward until all four paws reached the ground (traverse), and the total time spent on the pole (total) was recorded with a maximum duration of 120 s each for TDL and traverse time. All measurements were manually scored offline by observers blind to treatment. Even if the mouse fell part way into its descent, the behavior was scored until it reached the ground. When the mouse was unable to turn downward and/or instead dropped from the pole, TDL and traverse latencies were recorded as 120 s (default value) because of the severity of motor dysfunction.</p><p><italic>Wire Hang:</italic> Mice were placed on the top of a standard wire cage lid. The lid was slightly shaken to cause animals to grip the wires and then the lid was turned upside down and suspended ~50 cm above a standard animal cage with fresh bedding. The latency of mice to fall off the wire hang was measured up to 15 min, and average values were computed from two trials (15 min apart). Trials were stopped if the mouse remained on the lid after 15 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo SNr recordings</title><p>Head-bar implants to secure mice for in vivo recordings were performed under anesthesia as described above. Bilateral craniotomies (for probe insertion) were created over the SNr (−2.4 to −3.6 mm anterior, 0.9 to 2.1 mm lateral to Bregma) and a copper head-bar was fixed to the anterior portion of the skull (approximately at Bregma) using a combination of superglue and dental cement. Dental cement was extended from the head-bar to surround the extent of both craniotomies to form a well. This well was then filled with silicone elastomer (Kwik-sil, WPI) that prevented infection and damage to the exposed brain tissue. During the recording, this well was filled with 0.9% NaCl and used as a ground reference. On the day of recording, animals were fixed to the top of the wheel and allowed 15 min to acclimate to the head-fixed position. The silicone elastomer was removed and the craniotomies were cleaned. A linear 16-channel silicon probe with sites spaced 50 μm apart (Neuronexus) was attached to the micromanipulator and centered on lambda. The probe was slowly advanced (5–7 μm/s) until the top of the SNr (~4.2 μm from the top of the brain) was found. SNr activity was distinguished based on a combination of physiological features: presence of putative dopamine neurons, presence of putative GABAergic neurons, and lack of spindle-like activity (thalamic). Post-mortem tissue analysis of Iba-1 (Wako) immunoreactivity induced by probe penetrations were further evidence of proper targeting. Once a population of SNr units was identified, 5–10 min of activity was recorded following a 5 min waiting period to ensure stability of the identified units.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Electrophysiology analysis</title><p>Data was filtered at 150–8000 Hz for spiking activity and 0.7–300 Hz for local field potentials (LFP).

Following spike-sorting, data was processed with NeuroExplorer software in addition to custom scripts in MATLAB.</p><p><italic>Rest period analysis</italic>: We measured rodent movement using an optical mouse with 10 Hz sampling and 0.03 mm spatial resolution. We identified movement onset when the average velocity in a 1.5 s window exceeded 0.2 mm/s, and expanded this window until the average within the expanded window fell below 0.1 mm/s. Any leading and lagging non-movement samples (samples where &lt; 0.1 mm movement occurred) were excluded, and the resulting period was labeled as a ‘movement bout.’ Any period of time &gt;0.5 s from a movement bout was labelled a ‘rest bout.’ Only rest bouts were used for firing rate, coefficient of variation, synchrony, burst and LFP analyses. Quantities calculated in each rest bout were combined into single values through an average weighted by the duration of each rest bout.</p><p><italic>LFP analysis:</italic> Power spectral densities for each recording were calculated using the Lomb periodogram with values outside of bouts of rest removed. Beta power was defined as the total spectral power from 13 to 30 Hz. Fractional beta power was defined as the total spectral power from 13 to 30 Hz divided by the total power between 1–100 Hz.</p><p><italic>Burst analysis:</italic> Using the Poisson Surprise method (surprise = 5), bursts were identified in single-unit SNr activity. ‘Bursty units’ were defined as units with &gt;1% of total spikes occurring within a burst but less than one median absolute deviation above the median (i.e. 1–3.92% of spikes were in a burst), while ‘highly bursty’ units were defined as units with &gt;1 median absolute deviation above the median of all recorded units (&gt;3.92% of spikes were in a burst).</p><p><italic>Synchrony analysis:</italic> We modified traditional cross-correlation analysis to correct for nonstationarities within a unit’s firing pattern and to allow for direct comparisons across pairs of units regardless of their firing rates. We performed cross-correlation with a bin size of 10 milliseconds over 12-second-long windows with 4 s of overlap, excluding any window in which we detected movement on the running wheel. In each window, we zeroed the first and last 4 s of the 2<sup>nd</sup> train and only calculated out to a maximum lag of 4 s, thereby ensuring that each window would have a constant level of zero-padding across all calculated lags. This ensured a consistent level of baseline synchrony at long lags, which we used to normalize the cross-correlogram - specifically, we divided each window’s cross-correlogram by the mean correlation value from 0.5 to 4 s on both sides. These normalized windows were each averaged together to achieve the final, normalized cross-correlation, whose values represent the proportion of synchronous spikes relative to the local chance level of synchrony (chance = 1). We calculated a 99% confidence interval from 0.5 to 4 s on both sides of the normalized cross-correlation and called a pair ‘synchronous’ if its normalized cross-correlation at zero lag exceeded this confidence interval. To calculate the fraction of synchronous pairs, we required that at least two units be recorded simultaneously, and the minimum number of simultaneously recorded pairs from an animal had to exceed 4. In addition, a single unit synchrony index was calculated by taking the mean pair-wise normalized cross-correlation at zero lag for all simultaneously recorded units (used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data sets were tested for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test and equal variance with Levene’s test prior to any statistical analysis.

For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D,a</xref> mean unit synchrony index was also included. We used a jackknife procedure for cross-validation: in each iteration, one mouse was held out and the model was fit with the single unit data from all remaining mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref> ‘Train’). During this procedure, we created a balanced sample by resampling the number of single units to n = 50 and resampling the training mice to maintain an equal proportion of class examples (n = 500 permuted training sets and fits per held-out mouse). This allowed us to measure true performance against a chance performance of 100 * 1/n classes. To predict the held-out mouse's depletion state, we used the held-out single units as inputs to the fitted model, yielding a P(Depletion State | Physiology) for each neuron. We then summed these probabilities to determine the depletion state with the largest probability (Winner-Take-All threshold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref> ‘Test’).

Each cross-correlation was normalized so that data spanned from −1 to 1, representing least to most similar to end-stage.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Jennifer Thomas (Seton Hill University) for her assistance with behavioral scoring and data analysis, and Ted M. and Valina L.

Your article has been reviewed by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) results from loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc. While previous studies of PD have identified alterations in key physiological parameters in the basal ganglia output nuclei (SNr), analyses have been largely limited to the end stage of the disease. Here, Willard et al. use different dopamine depletion mouse models, in which striatal dopamine is depleted acutely or gradually by 6-OHDA lesions (unilaterally or bilaterally) or by α-synuclein fibril injection; they characterize physiology and motor behavior as a function of the severity of dopamine depletion across models and apply a host of computational approaches to analyze data. Based on the observations, it is concluded that there are discrete state transitions in physiology that track the progression of dopamine depletion, such as the modest changes in both the rate and pattern (irregularity and synchrony) of SNr firing that accompany the initial dopamine loss. Notably, the state transitions associated with the degree of dopamine loss seem largely independent of the type of model used or the rate of progression. The experiments are elegant, and although the findings are largely descriptive, the main results are likely to be valuable in the PD research field. Furthermore, the use of computational approaches is an enticing direction. Altogether the reviewers find the study to be impactful and are enthusiastic about the manuscript. However, the following concerns regarding analyses and interpretations require careful consideration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is of concern that the authors over-rely on fitting the PCA trajectory to a polynomial line and using this fit to claim a biphasic progression. Fitting polynomials to these kinds of data seems rather risky because a few &quot;outliers&quot; could dramatically affect the shape of the curve. While the concept of applying PCA on various physiological parameters is attractive, it is not clear if these polynomial fits are sufficiently strong evidence of biphasic progression or distinct states. Relatedly, subsection “Physiological Changes Reveal State Transitions in the SNr that are Stereotyped Across Models” states &quot;three distinct physiological states…&quot; Figure 7 would be much more supportive of this claim if it used the multinomial classifier the authors developed to try to classify the% TH remaining from the physiology. Figure 7E and 7G partly go in that direction but it's not enough, because they only show that all animals with end-stage TH depletion have similar physiology. To prove that there are at least three distinct states, the authors should split the classifier into at least three TH groups (such as high, medium, low). Another suggestion is to plot PC1 vs. PC2 for the high, medium, and low TH groups on the same graph, and hopefully show that each group tends to be clustered in PC space. This may provide a clearer proof of physiological state transitions than the polynomial fits.</p><p>2) Figure 7 is quite confusing in a few ways. For example, it's unclear what's being plotted in 7B. The caption reads &quot;normalized bilateral physiology PC1 and behavior PC1.&quot; But the figure only appears to show physiology PC1. Assuming the &quot;behavior PC1&quot; is a misprint, it is not obvious how the PC1 curves for Ipsi and Contra end up as perfect lines with zero slope. Again, the revision should not use polynomial fits as the main supporting evidence for state transitions.</p><p>3) Subsection “Gradual Dopamine Depletion With 6-OHDA Results in Late Onset of Behavioral Deficits”: Figure 2E doesn't do a very good job of showing whether SNr physiology is correlated with behavior. A better (and probably simpler) approach would be to plot the physiology PC1 vs. the behavior PC1, or physiology PC2 vs. behavior PC1, and check for statistically significant correlations, or other interesting trends.

Fitting polynomials to these kinds of data seems rather risky because a few &quot;outliers&quot; could dramatically affect the shape of the curve. While the concept of applying PCA on various physiological parameters is attractive, it is not clear if these polynomial fits are sufficiently strong evidence of biphasic progression or distinct states. Relatedly, subsection “Physiological Changes Reveal State Transitions in the SNr that are Stereotyped Across Models” states &quot;three distinct physiological states…&quot; Figure 7 would be much more supportive of this claim if it used the multinomial classifier the authors developed to try to classify the% TH remaining from the physiology. Figure 7E and 7G partly go in that direction but it's not enough, because they only show that all animals with end-stage TH depletion have similar physiology. To prove that there are at least three distinct states, the authors should split the classifier into at least three TH groups (such as high, medium, low). Another suggestion is to plot PC1 vs. PC2 for the high, medium, and low TH groups on the same graph, and hopefully show that each group tends to be clustered in PC space. This may provide a clearer proof of physiological state transitions than the polynomial fits.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that evidence of three physiological states would be made more compelling if supported by a second, independent approach. As suggested by reviewers, we trained a multinomial classifier to separate mice into Early (100-75%), Intermediate (75-35%) and Late (35-0%) DA groups based on SNr physiology (Figure 7B-D). This approach successfully classified mice into each group. We then trained a multinomial classifier to separate mice into four DA groups, however this classifier made errors consistent with there being only 3 groups (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-C). We interpret these results to support the hypothesis that there are three distinct physiological states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 7 is quite confusing in a few ways. For example, it's unclear what's being plotted in 7B. The caption reads &quot;normalized bilateral physiology PC1 and behavior PC1.&quot; But the figure only appears to show physiology PC1. Assuming the &quot;behavior PC1&quot; is a misprint, it is not obvious how the PC1 curves for Ipsi and Contra end up as perfect lines with zero slope. Again, the revision should not use polynomial fits as the main supporting evidence for state transitions.</p></disp-quote><p>This figure has been removed. Data to support the conclusion that unilaterally depleted mice exhibit the same physiological states as bilaterally depleted mice are provided: (1) in Figure 6M-O we show that a multinomial classifier does not discriminate the depletion method used to reach end-stage dopamine levels, and (2) in Figure 7A we show that the PC1 scores of unilaterally depleted mice follow the same trend as bilaterally depleted mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Gradual Dopamine Depletion With 6-OHDA Results in Late Onset of Behavioral Deficits”: Figure 2E doesn't do a very good job of showing whether SNr physiology is correlated with behavior. A better (and probably simpler) approach would be to plot the physiology PC1 vs. the behavior PC1, or physiology PC2 vs. behavior PC1, and check for statistically significant correlations, or other interesting trends. Similar comment for Figure 5I, 5J.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the criticism here and worked to improve the analysis. First, we attempted the reviewers’ suggestion, but realized that plotting physiology vs. behavior was contaminated by covariation with dopamine, making the relationship difficult to interpret. Thus, we decided to show how dopamine and physiology predict mouse behavior when all three are fit in a 2D model. We now show the resulting fit of this model as a contour plot in Figure 3H, and again for all mice in Figure 7F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “SNr Pathophysiology Progresses Similarly Across PFF α-Syn and 6-OHDA Models” and conclusion in general.

We now rephrase this statement as: “The progression of SNr pathophysiology depends more on the magnitude of dopamine depletion than the depletion model.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
