We find that cholesterol is not just necessary but also sufficient to activate signaling by the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, a prominent cell-cell communication system in development. Cholesterol influences Hh signaling by directly activating Smoothened (SMO), an orphan GPCR that transmits the Hh signal across the membrane in all animals. Unlike many GPCRs, which are regulated by cholesterol through their heptahelical transmembrane domains, SMO is activated by cholesterol through its extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Residues shown to mediate cholesterol binding to the CRD in a recent structural analysis also dictate SMO activation, both in response to cholesterol and to native Hh ligands. Our results show that cholesterol can initiate signaling from the cell surface by engaging the extracellular domain of a GPCR and suggest that SMO activity may be regulated by local changes in cholesterol abundance or accessibility.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20304.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20304.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20304.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells must communicate with each other to coordinate the development of most tissues and organs. Damage to these communication systems is often seen in degenerative disorders and in cancer. The Hedgehog signaling pathway is one of a handful of these critical systems. Reduced Hedgehog signals can lead to birth defects, while excessive Hedgehog signals can lead to skin and brain cancers. Cells transmit the Hedgehog signal by releasing a protein into their surroundings, where it can influence neighboring cells. Despite years of study, it is not understood how the Hedgehog signal is transmitted from the outside to the inside of a receiving cell.</p><p>Studies first done in flies and subsequently confirmed in humans have shown that a protein called Smoothened is needed to transmit the Hedgehog signal across the membrane of receiving cells. But it was not known how Smoothened carries out this critical signaling step to influence gene activation inside the cell and consequently to change cell behavior.</p><p>Now, Luchetti, Sircar et al. find that cholesterol, an important component of the cell membrane, directly binds to Smoothened and changes its shape so that it can activate Hedgehog signaling components inside cells. The experiments made use of mouse cells, and the discovery shows that cholesterol may play a previously underappreciated role in cell-to-cell communication.</p><p>This newly discovered role for cholesterol has implications for diseases, including a unique set of developmental disorders caused by abnormalities in pathways that produce cholesterol in human cells. Furthermore, this unexpected insight into Smoothened’s activity may be clinically important, because Smoothened can cause cancer when mutated and is the target of anti-cancer drugs that are being used in the clinic. Following on from these findings, a major step will be to uncover if and how Hedgehog signals regulate cholesterol to allow Smoothened to transmit these signals across the cell membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20304.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20304.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>G-protein coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>hedgehog signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000010</institution-id><institution>Ford Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luchetti</surname><given-names>Giovanni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nachtergaele</surname><given-names>Sigrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LTF -

It plays an important role in modulating the function of cell-surface receptors, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest class of receptors that transduce signals across the plasma membrane, and antigen receptors on immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pucadyil and Chattopadhyay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Swamy et al., 2016</xref>). The structures of several GPCRs reveal cholesterol molecules tightly associated with the heptahelical transmembrane domain (7TMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cherezov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ruprecht et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Cholesterol can influence GPCR stability, oligomerization and ligand affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fahrenholz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gimpl et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prasanna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pucadyil and Chattopadhyay, 2004</xref>). Cholesterol also organizes membrane microdomains, or ‘rafts,’ containing proteins and lipids that function as platforms for the detection and propagation of extracellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>). In all of these cases cholesterol plays a permissive role; however, it is not sufficient to trigger signaling on its own. Could cholesterol play a more instructive role— is it sufficient, not just necessary, to initiate signaling from the plasma membrane?</p><p>We find that cholesterol can indeed play an instructive signaling role in the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, an iconic signaling system that plays roles in development, regeneration, and cancer. Multiple seemingly unrelated links have been described between cholesterol and Hh signaling (summarized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eaton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Incardona and Eaton, 2000</xref>]). While the best-defined role for cholesterol is in the biogenesis of Hh ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Porter et al., 1996</xref>), it also plays an independent role in the reception of Hh signals. Pharmacological or genetic depletion of cholesterol reduces cellular responses to Hh ligands, which has led to the view that cholesterol is <italic>permissive</italic> for Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blassberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Incardona et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Incardona and Roelink, 2000</xref>). Distinct from these previous observations, we find that an acute increase in plasma membrane cholesterol is <italic>sufficient</italic> to activate Hh signaling. Thus, cholesterol can initiate signals from the cell surface by acting as an activating ligand for a GPCR family protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cholesterol is sufficient to activate the Hedgehog signaling pathway</title><p>While testing the effect of a panel of sterol lipids on Hh signaling in cultured fibroblasts, we made the serendipitous observation that cholesterol could induce the transcription of Hh target genes. Since cholesterol is very poorly soluble in aqueous media, we delivered it to cultured cells as an inclusion complex (hereafter called MβCD:cholesterol) with the cyclic oligosaccharide Methyl-β–cyclodextrin (MβCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zidovetzki and Levitan, 2007</xref>). Throughout this paper, we state the concentration of MβCD in the MβCD:cholesterol complexes, since this concentration is known exactly; for saturated complexes, the molar concentration of cholesterol is predicted to be ~8–10-fold lower than that of MβCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christian et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klein et al., 1995</xref>).

MβCD:cholesterol induced a concentration-dependent, bell-shaped Hh signaling response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Low doses of MβCD:cholesterol, which have only a minor effect on signaling, also increased the potency of the native ligand SHH, as seen by a leftward shift in the SHH dose-response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20304.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cholesterol is sufficient to activate Hh target genes in NIH/3T3 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Gli1</italic> mRNA, encoded by a direct Hh target gene, was measured by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and normalized to mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene <italic>GAPDH</italic> after treatment (12 hr) with various doses of naked MβCD or a saturated MβCD:cholesterol (8.8:1 molar ratio) complex.

This experimental approach was inspired by previous studies of the cholesterol sensor SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2002</xref>). The Hh signaling activity of cholesterol was exquisitely stereoselective— neither its enantiomer (<italic>ent</italic>-cholesterol) nor an epimer with an inverted configuration only at the 3-hydroxy position (<italic>epi</italic>-cholesterol) could activate Hh target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Enantioselectivity was consistent with cholesterol acting through a chiral binding pocket on a protein target, rather than by altering membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Covey, 2009</xref>). Hh signaling activity was also lost when either the number or the position of double bonds in the tetracyclic sterol nucleus were altered in 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) and lathosterol, two endogenous biosynthetic precursors of cholesterol. Interestingly, desmosterol, another immediate biosynthetic precursor of cholesterol that contains an additional double-bond in the iso-octyl chain, retained signaling activity. This structure-activity relationship points to the tetracyclic ring, conserved between cholesterol and desmosterol, as the critical structural element required for activity. We cannot exclude the possibility that desmosterol activated signaling because it was rapidly converted to cholesterol in cells. These strict structural requirements suggest a specific, protein-mediated effect of cholesterol on the Hh signaling pathway and further exclude the possibility that signaling activity is due to extraction of an inhibitor from cells by MβCD (present at the same concentration in all the sterol complexes tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>MβCD:sterol inclusion complexes have been suggested to potentiate Hh signaling by depleting an inhibitory molecule through an exchange reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sever et al., 2016</xref>).

By analogy with other GPCRs, these permissive effects are likely to be mediated by the SMO 7TMD.</p><p>We now find that cholesterol is also sufficient to activate Hh signalling in a dose-dependent manner. This instructive effect is mediated by the Class F GPCR SMO and maps to its extracellular CRD. Cholesterol engages a hydrophobic groove on the surface of the CRD, a groove that was previously shown to mediate the activating influence of oxysterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Myers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nachtergaele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nedelcu et al., 2013</xref>) and represents an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for detecting hydrophobic small-molecule ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazan and de Sauvage, 2009</xref>). An analogous mechanism is present in the Frizzled family of Wnt receptors, where the Frizzled CRD binds to the palmitoleyl group of Wnt ligands, an interaction that is required for Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Janda et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the instructive effects of cholesterol revealed in our present study and the permissive effects of cholesterol reported previously map to distinct, separable SMO domains. Our observation that MβCD:cholesterol is sufficient to activate SMO through its CRD is in agreement with a report published recently during the review process of our manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>There are many reasons why this activating effect of cholesterol on Hh signalling may not have been appreciated previously despite the fact that the activating effects of side-chain oxysterols have been known for a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corcoran and Scott, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dwyer et al., 2007</xref>). First, the method of delivery, as an inclusion complex with MβCD, is critical to presenting cholesterol, a profoundly hydrophobic and insoluble lipid, in a bioavailable form capable of activating Smo. Even clear solutions of cholesterol in the absence of carriers like MβCD contain microcrystalline deposits or stable micelles that sequester cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haberland and Reynolds, 1973</xref>). In contrast, side-chain oxysterols, which harbor an additional hydroxyl group, are significantly more hydrophilic and soluble in aqueous solutions, shown by their ~ 50 fold faster transfer rates between membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Theunissen et al., 1986</xref>). Second, cholesterol levels in the cell are difficult to manipulate because they are tightly controlled by elaborate homeostatic signalling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Goldstein, 2009</xref>). MβCD:cholesterol inclusion complexes have been shown to be unique in their ability to increase the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane rapidly at timescales (~1–4 hr) at which cytoplasmic signaling pathways operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christian et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yancey et al., 1996</xref>). Other methods of delivery using low density lipoprotein particles and lipid dispersions, or mutations in genes regulating cholesterol homeostasis, function on a much slower time scale and are thus more likely to be confounded by indirect effects given the myriad cellular processes affected by cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christian et al., 1997</xref>). Finally, the bell-shaped Hh signal-response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) implies that MβCD:cholesterol must be delivered in a relatively narrow, intermediate concentration range (1–2 mM) to observe optimal activity, with higher (&gt;5 mM) concentrations commonly used to load cells with cholesterol producing markedly lower levels of signaling activity.</p><p>Our results are particularly informative in light of the recently solved crystal structure of a SMO protein containing the CRD, linker domain and entire 7TMD but lacking the cytoplasmic tail (hereafter called SMO△C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>). SMO△C was unexpectedly found to contain a cholesterol ligand in its CRD groove. Cholesterol also made key contacts with the linker domain and third extracellular loop of the 7TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and molecular dynamics simulations showed that cholesterol can stabilize these extracellular regions of SMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>). However, the function of this bound cholesterol, whether it is an agonist, antagonist or co-factor, remains an important unresolved question in SMO regulation. Structure-guided point mutations in CRD residues that form hydrogen-bonding interactions with the 3β-hydroxyl of cholesterol, reduced signaling by cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), making it likely that cholesterol activates SMO by binding to the CRD in the pose revealed in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, the cholesterol-bound SMO structure recently reported by our groups may very well represent an active-state conformation of the CRD. A comparison of this cholesterol-bound structure with a structure of inactive SMO bound to the potent 7TMD antagonist vismodegib (which lacks cholesterol in the CRD groove) revealed a conformational change that may drive SMO activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>). Cholesterol binding is predicted to induce a clockwise rotation of the CRD on the 7TMD pedestal, perhaps driving SMO activation by a rearrangement of contacts between the CRD and the 7TMD. A caveat to this model is that it depends on a structural comparison with SMO△C bound to a synthetic antagonist and not with un-liganded SMO△C, which has thus far eluded crystallization.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20304.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Conformational changes in Smoothened induced by cholesterol binding.</title><p>A comparison of the structures of SMO△C bound to vismodegib (PDB ID 5L7I, left), representing an inactive state, and cholesterol (PDB ID 5L7D, right), highlights a rotation of the CRD and the helical extracellular loop 3 relative to the 7TMD.

We disagree with this model for several reasons. First, these structures do not contain the linker domain and the entire 7TMD, both of which make critical contacts with cholesterol and the CRD, and hence cannot reveal changes in orientation between the CRD and the 7TMD that are essential to understanding how CRD ligands communicate with the 7TMD. Second, all structures of the SMO CRD (with the exception of the <italic>Xenopus apo</italic>-CRD) are conformationally identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), regardless of whether they contain a bound ligand (cholesterol-bound SMO△C, cyclopamine-bound CRD or 20(S)-OHC-bound CRD) or not (<italic>Danio rerio apo</italic>-CRD or vismodegib-bound SMO△C) and regardless of whether they were crystallized by standard vapor diffusion (the CRD structures) or lipidic cubic phase methods (the SMO△C structures). Hence this conserved conformation, seen in both the isolated CRD and the more physiological SMO△C molecule, is unlikely to be an artefact of crystal packing as suggested by these authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, a careful inspection of the crystal lattice contacts in the <italic>Xenopus apo</italic>-SMO structure (PDB ID 5KZZ) revealed that the region of the proposed conformational change is partially disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and involved in the coordination of a zinc ion together with a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal, a very tight, near-covalent interaction that was likely driving crystal formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Since the crystallization solution for the <italic>Xenopus apo</italic>-SMO, but not the solutions used to crystallize the sterol-bound CRDs, contained 200 mM zinc acetate, the altered conformation observed may have been induced by a non-physiological, zinc-promoted crystal contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A surprising feature of the structure is that CRD-bound cholesterol is located at a considerable distance (~12 Å) away from the membrane, which would require a cholesterol molecule to desolvate from the membrane and become exposed to water in order to access its CRD binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The kinetic barrier, or the activation energy (Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>‡</sup>) for this transfer reaction is predicted to be high (~20 kcal/mole), based on the Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>‡</sup> for cholesterol transfer between two acceptors through an aqueous environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yancey et al., 1996</xref>). The unique ability of MβCD to shield cholesterol from water while allowing its rapid transfer to acceptors would allow it to bypass this kinetically unfavorable step by delivering it to the CRD binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These considerations present a regulatory puzzle for future research: how does cholesterol gain access to the CRD-binding pocket without MβCD and is this process regulated by native Hh ligands? Indeed, the kinetic barrier for cholesterol transfer to the CRD pocket makes it an ideal candidate for a rate-limiting, regulated step controlling SMO activity in cells.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20304.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Models for how cholesterol may gain access to its binding-site in the SMO cysteine-rich domain.</title><p>The structure of SMO bound to cholesterol (PDB 5L7D) is shown embedded in a lipid bilayer composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and cholesterol in a ratio of 3:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>). The SMO CRD is colored orange; the linker domain and 7TMD are colored blue. Two molecules of MβCD (PDB QKH, shown as green sticks) form an inclusion complex with each molecule of cholesterol (PDB CLR, colored yellow in stick representation with the 3-hydroxyl shown red). MβCD could deliver cholesterol directly to the CRD binding pocket (left) or to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (right), which would subsequently require a second transfer step from the membrane to the CRD. The activation energy for the direct delivery mechanism on the left (&lt;10 kcal/mole) is much lower than for the mechanism on the right (~20 kcal/mole), where cholesterol has to desolvate from the membrane without a carrier to access the CRD site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lopez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yancey et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20304.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20304.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-20304-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><p>MβCD:cholesterol was consistently less active than the native ligand SHH in our assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C and D</xref>). Comparing the doses of MβCD:cholesterol to the doses of SHH delivered to cells is difficult. SHH was used at saturating concentrations; however, we could not assess the effects of MβCD:cholesterol at saturating doses, because the downward phase of the bell-shaped dose-response curve (in cultured fibroblasts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and cell toxicity (in neural progenitors) proved to be dose-limiting. Aside from these technical considerations related to delivery, other possibilities for lower activity include the observation that MβCD:cholesterol did not induce the high-level accumulation of SMO in primary cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the possibility that a different ligand regulates high-level signaling by SMO. Mutations in the 7TMD binding-site do not alter the constitutive or SHH-induced signaling activity of SMO, which has led to view that this site does not regulate physiological signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Myers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yauch et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, mutations in the cholesterol-binding site impaired responses to SHH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, a putative alternate ligand would have to engage a third, undefined site. Lastly, the presence of active PTCH1 is a major difference between SHH- and MβCD:cholesterol-induced signaling. The biochemical activity of PTCH1 (which is inactivated by SHH) may oppose the effects of MβCD:cholesterol, limiting signaling responses. Interestingly, MβCD:cholesterol was able to restore maximal Hh responses in the absence of PTCH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Our results may have implications for understanding how PTCH1 inhibits SMO, a longstanding mystery in Hh signaling. The necessity and sufficiency of cholesterol for SMO activation, mediated through two different regions of the molecule, means that SMO activity is likely to be highly sensitive to both the abundance and the accessibility of cholesterol in its membrane environment. Furthermore, PTCH1 has homology to a lysosomal cholesterol transporter, the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carstea et al., 1997</xref>), and PTCH1 has been purported to have cholesterol binding and transport activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bidet et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, our work supports a model where PTCH1 may inhibit SMO by reducing cholesterol content or cholesterol accessibility (or chemical activity) in a membrane compartment that also contains SMO, leading to alterations in SMO conformation or trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bidet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Incardona et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khaliullina et al., 2009</xref>). Since cholesterol is a ubiquitous component of cellular membranes that affects many cellular processes, PTCH1-induced changes in cholesterol are likely to be confined to a specific membrane compartment. The base of the cilium is a good candidate for such a compartment because PTCH1 is localized most prominently at the ciliary base in Hh-responsive tissues in the mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rohatgi et al., 2007</xref>) and because most Hh pathway components, from PTCH1 to the GLI transcription factors, are found in and around primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>). Two key questions must be answered before endogenous cellular cholesterol can be considered the elusive second messenger that communicates the Hh signal from PTCH1 to SMO: Do Hh ligands alter cholesterol abundance or activity? and Is cholesterol a substrate for the predicted transporter activity of PTCH1? Answering these questions will require developing or adapting tools to measure and perturb cholesterol in specific cellular compartments and an assessment of the biochemical activities of purified SMO and PTCH1 reconstituted into cholesterol-containing membranes.</p><p>While cholesterol is an abundant lipid, clearly critical for maintaining membrane biophysical properties and for stabilizing membrane proteins, our work suggests that it may be also used as a second messenger to instruct signaling events at the cell surface through GPCRs and perhaps other cell-surface receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and reagents</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Reagents and cell lines</title><p>NIH/3T3 and 293 T cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, Virginia), <italic>Smo</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fibroblasts have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Varjosalo et al., 2006</xref>) and were originally obtained from Drs.

For SMO localization studies, cells were blocked and permeabilized in 1% donkey serum, 10 mg / mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% triton X-100, and PBS. Primary antibodies were administered in block buffer for 2 hr at room temperature. Cover-slips were washed three times with wash buffer containing PBS and 0.1% triton X-100. Secondary antibodies were administered in block buffer for 1 hr. Cover-slips were washed three more times in wash buffer and mounted on glass slides using Pro-Long Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For PFO staining, cells were fixed in 4% PFA, washed three times with PBS and stained with PFO in PBS without detergent. Cover-slips were washed three times with PBS and mounted on glass slides using Pro-Long Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were acquired on an inverted Leica SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 63X oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) using a HyD hybrid detector. Z-stacks were acquired with identical acquisition settings (gain, offset, laser power, frame format) within a given experiment. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Smo (1:500) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rohatgi et al., 2007</xref>), guinea pig anti-Arl13b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pusapati et al., 2014</xref>), goat anti-GFP (1:2000) (Rockland; Limerick, PA), mouse anti-Nkx2.2 (1:100) (74.5A5, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), mouse anti-Nkx6.1 (1:100) (F55A10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), guinea pig anti-Olig2 (1:20,000) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Novitch et al., 2001</xref>), rabbit anti-Pax6 (1:1000) (AB2237, Millipore). The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 594, and Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Image processing for ciliary SMO levels was carried out using maximum projection images of the acquired Z-stacks using ImageJ. For quantification of ciliary Smo, first a mask was constructed using the Arl13b image (primary cilia marker), and then the mask was applied to the corresponding Smo image where the integrated fluorescence was measured. An identical region outside the cilia was measured to determine background fluorescence. Background correction was applied on a per cilia basis by subtracting the background fluorescence from the cilia fluorescence.</p><p>For neural differentiation experiments, fluorescent images were collected on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal imaging system equipped with a 40x oil immersion objective using the Leica Application Suite X (LASX) software. For each experiment, coverslips from each condition were grown, collected, and processed together to ensure that the cells were fixed and stained for the same duration of time. To ensure uniformity in imaging, the gain, offset, and laser power settings on the microscope were held constant for each antibody. At least 15 images were taken per condition. To ensure all cells were represented, z-stacks were acquired and counts were performed on the compressed images. Cell counts were conducted using the NIH ImageJ software suite with cell counter plugin. In total, 5000–6000 cells were analyzed per condition. The experiment was conducted independently a total of three times. Representative images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> were processed equally using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe illustrator, and CorelDraw software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cholesterol quantification</title><p>Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Optima Grade, Atlanta Biologicals) in 6-well plates at an initial density of 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells / well. Confluent cells were switched into 0.5% FBS DMEM to induce ciliogenesis for 24 hr. Cells were treated with indicated drugs dissolved in 0.5% FBS DMEM in duplicate. One sample was used to measure total protein by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA), and the second for total lipid extraction and subsequent cholesterol quantification. Cells were washed once with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), and harvested using a Corning cell lifter in PBS. The cell suspension was transferred to a 1.5 mL ependorf tube, centrifuged at 1000 x g and the PBS aspirated. Total lipids were extracted from the cell pellet by the addition of 200 μL of chloroform-methanol (2:1 vol/vol). To induce phase separation, 100 μL of PBS was added to the lipid extract and the sample was centrifuged at 5000 x g for 5 min. The organic layer was transferred to a fresh 1.5 mL eppendorf tube and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. Relative total free cholesterol was measured using the <italic>Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit</italic> (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. Lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mM dithithreitol, and Sigma Fast protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to disrupt the cell pellet. A ratio of total free cholesterol to total protein was used as a normalization method.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Andres Lebensohn, Ganesh Pusapati, James Briscoe, Robert Blassberg and George Hedger for discussions and comments on the manuscript.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, Rohatgi and colleagues identify cholesterol as a bona fide activator of Smoothened (Smo) that works through its extracellular cysteine rich domain (CRD) to induce low-level signaling. The hunt for a natural ligand for Smo has been long and largely unsuccessful, making this discovery an impactful advance for the field. Although cholesterol is not likely the sole molecule required for Smo activation (it is insufficient to induce Smo ciliary translocation or high-level signaling), it is an important player in physiological regulation of this GPCR.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers find the study to be well-controlled, well-executed and appropriately interpreted. They suggest the following major points for consideration in preparing a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) The reviewers noted that a paper from Salic lab with similar conclusions was just published (Huang et al. 2016). Although this detracts from the novelty of this manuscript, the work was clearly performed independently and actually greatly increases the confidence in this important breakthrough. The Salic paper should be cited in the revision. The authors are encouraged to expand the Discussion of the manuscript to highlight differences between the two studies and the important points unique to this manuscript. For example, concerning the mechanism by which cholesterol enhances Smo signaling (i.e. does it induce a CRD conformational shift?), some discussion of the differing structural effects of cholesterol on the CRD of the full-length structure (this group's nature paper) and the soluble CRD (Salic structure) might be informative.

In response to this recommendation, we have expanded the Discussion section to include a comparison of (1) the SMO CRD structures published in the Salic paper, (2) the SMO CRD structure published by us in <italic>eLife</italic> in 2013 (PMID: 24171105) and (3) structures of a complete SMO molecule including the CRD and the entire heptahelical transmembrane bundle (7TMD) published very recently by our groups in <italic>Nature</italic> (PMID: 27437577). It is important to note that the only available structure of cholesterol bound to Smoothened is presented in our <italic>Nature</italic> paper; the Salic study does not show a structure of cholesterol bound to any domain of Smoothened.</p><p>Our analysis, depicted in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, leads us to propose that the relevant conformational change upon cholesterol binding involves a rotation of the CRD on the 7TMD pedestal (shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We disagree with the structural conclusions of the Salic paper, derived entirely from structures of the isolated CRD, that SMO activation is driven by a cholesterol-induced conformational change in the CRD itself because (1) this conformational change was not seen in the context of near full-length SMO containing both the CRD and 7TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and (2) this conformational change seems to be stabilized by a non-physiological, zinc-induced crystal contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we have also emphasized some the major limitations of both our studies. Neither our manuscript nor the Salic paper has shown that (1) native Hh ligands modulate cellular cholesterol locally or globally in cells or that (2) Patched 1 regulates cellular/endogenous cholesterol to influence SMO signaling.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> appears to be n=1.
