Through systematic proteomic analysis of human MICOS, we identified QIL1 (C19orf70) as a novel conserved MICOS subunit. QIL1 depletion disrupted CJ structure in cultured human cells and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle and neuronal cells in vivo. In human cells, mitochondrial disruption correlated with impaired respiration. Moreover, increased mitochondrial fragmentation was observed upon QIL1 depletion in flies. Using quantitative proteomics, we show that loss of QIL1 resulted in MICOS disassembly with the accumulation of a MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex and degradation of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27. Additionally, we demonstrated that in QIL1-depleted cells, overexpressed MIC10 fails to significantly restore its interaction with other MICOS subunits and SAMM50. Collectively, our work uncovers a previously unrecognized subunit of the MICOS complex, necessary for CJ integrity, cristae morphology, and mitochondrial function and provides a resource for further analysis of MICOS architecture.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06265.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06265.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06265.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mitochondria are the cell's power plants, and churn out molecules that provide a portable energy source throughout the cell. To do this efficiently, the mitochondria have a double membrane. The inner membrane is ruffled, which provides a large surface area for energy-producing reactions to occur on. Structures called cristae junctions and contact sites hold the folds of the inner membrane in place.</p><p>As mitochondria are found in every cell in the body, mitochondrial diseases can produce a wide range of symptoms, but they commonly affect the muscles. In some forms of these diseases, the inner membrane of a mitochondrion is no longer folded; instead, the membrane may form concentric rings like the layers of an onion. Knowing how the folding of the inner membrane is regulated may therefore help scientists to better understand mitochondrial diseases.</p><p>Scientists already know that several proteins join together to form a complex that anchors the mitochondrion's inner membrane to its outer membrane at cristae junctions. To learn more about the proteins involved in these complexes, Guarani et al. systematically screened for proteins that associate with cristae junctions and found a previously unknown protein called QIL1.</p><p>Next, Guarani et al. conducted a series of experiments to determine what role QIL1 plays at the cristae junctions. The experiments showed that QIL1 is needed to bind a protein called MIC10 into the protein complex that anchors the cristae junctions to the outer membrane. In human and fruit fly cells without QIL1, this protein complex falls apart and is not repaired if extra MIC10 is added into the cells. Furthermore, in human cells lacking QIL1, the inner mitochondrial membrane forms the same onion-like rings seen in the cells of humans with mitochondrial diseases. Future studies are necessary to understand how the structure of the QIL1 complex is organized and to work out how the complex is capable of causing the mitochondrial inner membrane to curve.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06265.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06265.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>protein complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM095567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>J Wade</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS083524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>J Wade</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS069695</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van Vactor</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK098285</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulo</surname><given-names>Joao A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive analysis of the human MICOS complex has identified a novel subunit called QIL1 that is required for cristae junction formation in human cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, through its role in the assembly of the MICOS complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria exhibit a complex topology encompassing two membranes that create distinct internal compartments. The inner membrane (IM) runs parallel to the outer membrane (OM) at regions called inner boundary membranes (IBM) and invaginates into the mitochondrial matrix forming the cristae structures which connect to the inter membrane space (IMS) through narrow openings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Freya and Mannellab, 2000</xref>). This intricate architecture is maintained by structures called cristae junctions (CJs) and contact sites (CSs) and has been shown to be essential for numerous mitochondrial pathways such as protein import, oxidative phosphorylation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Freya and Mannellab, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cogliati et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that changes in physiological energetic states and oxygen availability affect the morphology of cristae and CJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lorente et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walker and Benzer, 2004</xref>), suggesting that the formation of CJs is a dynamic process that promotes cristae remodeling as an adaptive mechanism to the different needs and metabolic states of the cell. Moreover, several mitochondrial disorders in humans are often accompanied by alterations of mitochondrial ultrastructure including MERRF syndrome (Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers), BTHS (Barth syndrome), fatal neonatal lactic acidosis, mtDNA defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and loss of CJs with the formation of concentric stacks of cristae membrane are some of the hallmarks observed in mitochondria from such patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Silva-Oropeza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acehan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roels et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Götz et al., 2012</xref>). As such, deciphering how CJs and CSs are formed and regulated is crucial for the understanding of cristae dynamics and maintenance in health and disease.</p><p>Despite its critical importance, only recently have components of a protein complex that localizes at CJs and CSs and are responsible for mitochondrial cristae architecture been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Laan et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies in both yeast and human cells led to the identification of various subunits of a highly conserved heterooligomeric protein complex of approximately ∼700 kDa, referred to as the mitochondrial contact site and cristae junction organizing system (MICOS), which controls the formation of CJs and CSs and IM morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gieffers et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">John et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rabl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkhaja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohnert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pfanner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weber, 2013</xref>).

To date, 7 bona fide subunits have been described in yeast (Mic10, Mic12, Mic19, Mic25, Mic26, Mic27, Mic60), 6 of which have obvious human orthologs (MIC10/MINOS1, MIC19/CHCHD3, MIC25/CHCHD6, MIC27/APOOL, MIC26/APOO and MIC60/Mitofilin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Icho et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Odgren et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gieffers et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">John et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rabl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Head et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkhaja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohnert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Itoh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weber, 2013</xref>). The MIC10-MIC19-MIC25-MIC26-MIC27-MIC60 complex is thought to reside in the IM at the site of CJs. Genetic removal of several MICOS subunits causes mitochondrial fragmentation, reduced respiration, CJs loss, and the formation of concentric stacks of IM disconnected from the IBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">John et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rabl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkhaja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Laan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weber, 2013</xref>). These phenotypes strikingly resemble cristae abnormalities observed in patients with the aforementioned mitochondrial disorders. Moreover, alterations of several MICOS subunit protein levels, mutations and protein modifications have been linked to a variety of human diseases, including diabetic cardiomyopathy, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zerbes et al., 2012</xref>). One study has employed proteomic analysis of MIC10/MINOS1 protein interactors in human cells to identify further components of the complex, and in addition to the IM core subunits, this work also identified the OM proteins SAMM50, MTX1, MTX2, and the chaperone DNAJC11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkhaja et al., 2012</xref>). A role for these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xie et al., 2007</xref>) and in particular the sorting and assembly machinery protein SAMM50 in CJ assembly was also found independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ott et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting a role for β-barrel insertion into the OM in CJ formation or maintenance. Interestingly, mutations in DNAJC11 in the mouse result in mitochondrial disruption, cristae abnormalities, and motor neuron pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ioakeimidis et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Given the crucial role that the MICOS complex plays in CJ architecture and mitochondrial homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zerbes et al., 2012</xref>), a further understanding of its constituents and regulatory mechanisms is needed. To develop a comprehensive understanding of MICOS composition and regulation, we performed proteomic IP-MS analysis of the MICOS complex. In addition to core MICOS subunits, we identified several new candidate MICOS-associated proteins. One of these—QIL1—is a previously unstudied IM protein conserved from human to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Using quantitative proteomics coupled with native gel analysis, we show that QIL1 is a component of a ∼700 KDa MICOS complex and its depletion from cells results in loss of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 from the complex and a reduction in the abundance of these proteins in mitochondria. Thus, QIL1 appears to be required for incorporation of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 into the MICOS complex. Depletion of QIL1 in human cells results in several mitochondrial phenotypes including loss of CJs, cristae rearrangement into stacks of concentric membranes, and reduced respiration. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle and neuronal cells, QIL1 depletion leads to analogous morphological phenotypes. This study provides the most comprehensive protein interaction network map of the MICOS complex to date and will serve as a resource for further elucidation of MICOS assembly and regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Systematic proteomic analysis of the MICOS complex</title><p>In order to examine the composition of the MICOS complex using interaction proteomics, open reading frames for MIC27, MIC19, MIC25, MIC60, MTX2, and DNAJC11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> shows a schematic representation of the MICOS complex where the MICOS subunits and interactors used for our IP-MS approach are depicted in red) were C-terminally tagged with an HA-FLAG epitope in a lentiviral vector and expressed stably in 293T and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Confocal microscopy after immunostaining with α-HA and α-TOMM20 verified that each protein was targeted to mitochondria in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To identify high confidence interacting proteins (HCIPs), we employed a modified version of the <italic>ComPASS</italic> platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>). This method uses a large collection of parallel AP-MS experiments to generate a database populated with peptide spectral matches, allowing the frequency, abundance, and reproducibility of interacting proteins to be determined. To enhance detection of membrane-associated proteins, we employed 1% digitonin, and proteins were purified using α-FLAG beads. After extensive washing, complexes were trypsinized prior to proteomic analysis. As a validation approach, three of the baits (MIC60, MTX2, and MIC19) were also expressed in HCT116 cells and immunopurified with a different antibody (α-HA). Interaction data are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> contains the entire data set). Overall, the interaction network contained 26 proteins and 97 interactions (edges) after filtering as described in the ‘Materials and methods’. The six baits analyzed showed extensive reciprocal connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Confirming previously reported data, several core subunits of the MICOS complex (MIC19, MIC25, MIC60, MIC26, MIC27) also associated with known interactors at the OM (SAMM50, MTX1 and MTX2), indicating that our method is able to retrieve nearly all known subunits and interactors of the MICOS complex, located at the IM, IMS, and OM with high confidence. In addition to known interactors, our map also revealed potential novel interacting partners, associated with one or more MICOS subunits. These include two OM proteins, the MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and the RHOT2 GTPase involved in mitochondrial trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). RHOT2 has been shown to co-fractionate with SAMM50 in correlation profiling proteomic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Havugimana et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, we identified TMEM11 as a protein associated with multiple MICOS subunits and capable of associating with MIC60 endogenously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,F</xref>). A TMEM11 ortholog in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been shown genetically to be required for cristae organization and biogenesis, but the mechanisms involved are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37a">Rival et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26a">Macchi et al., 2013</xref>).

As an initial approach for validating the interactions, C-terminally tagged QIL1 was subjected to IP-MS analysis. The result elicited the generation of an interaction map containing 13 nodes and 20 edges (interactions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), wherein we identified 5 core MICOS subunits (MIC60, MIC19, MIC25, MIC26 and MIC27), 3 OM known interactors (SAMM50, MTX1 and MTX2) as well as the chaperone DNAJC11 and TMEM11 in association with QIL1. In a further attempt to validate these interactions, we first employed antibodies directed at endogenous QIL1 for immunoprecipitation (IP) and detected endogenous MIC60, but not the abundant mitochondrial IM protein AFG3L2 protein, after western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Reciprocally, endogenous QIL1 co-precipitated with immunopurified endogenous MIC60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>The transmembrane protein MIC10 was the only known MICOS subunit that was not detected by our proteomics approach, possibly due to its small size (78 residues) and predominantly hydrophobic peptides. To address if QIL1 also interacted with MIC10, we immunopurified endogenous MIC10 in isolated mitochondria from 293T cells and assessed binding to QIL1 by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition to detecting MIC60 in MIC10 immune complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkhaja et al., 2012</xref>), we also detected QIL1. Thus, QIL1 endogenously associates with components of the MICOS complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>QIL1 is an inner membrane-associated protein</title><p>We then examined the sub-cellular localization of QIL1. First, QIL1-HA-FLAG was found to co-localize with endogenous TOMM20 in HeLa cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Second, endogenous QIL1 was detected in purified mitochondria from 293T cells by western blotting, with a level of enrichment similar to that found with other mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), confirming that QIL1 is a mitochondrial protein. Our bioinformatics analysis identified QIL1 orthologs across metazoans, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Additionally, primary sequence analysis using the TMpred algorithm revealed that QIL1 contains one possible conserved transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). To investigate whether QIL1 is a transmembrane protein, we performed carbonate extraction on mitochondria isolated from 293T cells. As expected, the transmembrane proteins TOMM70A and TIMM23 were resistant to alkaline extraction regardless of the increase in pH, whereas DLD was efficiently released into the soluble fraction at higher pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). Most bona fide MICOS subunits described so far are transmembrane proteins, with the exception of MIC19 and MIC25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pfanner et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, MIC19 has been shown to be myristoylated at the N-terminus allowing its docking onto SAMM50, which is embedded in the OM, and possesses a CHCH domain at its C-terminus that binds to MIC60, present in the IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darshi et al., 2012</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). MIC19 was only partially extracted from the membrane fraction with increasing pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Similarly, while entirely present in the membrane fraction at lower pH, QIL1 was partially extracted from the membrane fraction at higher pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). We did not identify a predicted myristoylation site or a CHCH domain in QIL1. These results suggest that QIL1 may indeed possess membrane anchoring activity, being possibly anchored by a single conserved membrane spanning helix as predicted by the TMPred algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofmann and Stoffel, 1993</xref>).</p><p>To examine further the topology of QIL1 in the IM, we employed digitonin permeabilization of isolated mitochondria combined with proteinase K digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sancak et al., 2013</xref>). Mitochondria were isolated from HCT116 cells and incubated with increasing concentrations of digitonin in the presence of proteinase K (PK). Subsequently, samples were analyzed by immunoblotting for the OM protein TOMM70A, IM proteins TIMM23 and MIC60, and matrix protein CLPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). These experiments showed that the topology of QIL1 is similar to the topology of the IM proteins TIMM23 and MIC60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). To confirm the topology of QIL1, we performed Proteinase K digestion with and without osmotic shock in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harner et al., 2014</xref>). QIL1 displayed resistance to Proteinase K treatment in isolated mitochondria, but became accessible to protease digestion when the OM was disrupted by osmotic shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>), as also found with the IM proteins TIMM23 and MIC60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Importantly, the matrix protein CLPP was only accessible to Proteinase K digestion when mitochondria were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, demonstrating the integrity of the IM.

Thus, we asked whether QIL1 is present in the ∼700 kDa MICOS complex found in mitochondria from human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ott et al., 2012</xref>). To address this question, mitochondria isolated from 293T cells stably expressing C-terminally tagged QIL1, MIC60, MIC19, or MIC25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) were lysed in 1% digitonin and subjected to BN-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). QIL1 was found to be predominantly localized at ∼700 kDa (asterisks). Similarly, MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 were found in a ∼700 kDa complex as expected. Additionally, MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 were also present in a smaller complex of ∼500 kDa (two asterisks) suggesting the existence of an assembly intermediate or sub-complex containing these three proteins. Using 2-dimensional BN-PAGE electrophoresis, we found that endogenous QIL1 was present within the mature MICOS complex migrating at ∼700 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Confirming our findings in one-dimensional BN-PAGE immunoblotting, MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 were found in the ∼700 kDa complex (asterisk) and in the smaller sub-complex (two asterisks), while MIC10 and QIL1 were primarily found in the ∼700 kDa complex. To address whether QIL1 transiently associates with the dissociated MICOS subunits, we solubilized mitochondria with 1% Triton X-100, which leads to the dissociation of the MICOS complex into smaller complexes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harner et al., 2014</xref>). While C-terminally tagged QIL1 efficiently co-purified with endogenous MIC60, MIC19, MIC27, and MIC10 when mitochondria were solubilized with 1% digitonin, no specific binding was detected when mitochondria were solubilized with Triton X-100, consistent with an association of QIL1 with the mature MICOS complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Moreover, we observed a concomitant accumulation of MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 in a smaller sub-complex of ∼500 kDa. These data agree with the presence of both overexpressed and endogenous MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 in this sub-complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). We hypothesized that QIL1 promotes the maturation of the MICOS complex by acting as a scaffold at the IM, bridging a sub-complex containing MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 to other subunits including MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27. We hypothesized that when QIL1 is depleted, MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 fail to integrate into the complex and are degraded. To test this, we asked whether overexpressed MIC10 could physically interact with other MICOS subunits and be incorporated into the mature MICOS complex in cells where QIL1 had been silenced. Thus, we transiently expressed C-terminally tagged MIC10 in cells expressing FF2 shRNA or a shRNA-targeting QIL1 and assessed the presence of the overexpressed protein in the mature MICOS complex at ∼700 kDa by BN-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). C-terminally tagged MIC10 was more efficiently assembled into the MICOS complex in control cells compared to those lacking QIL1 even though MIC10 was expressed at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>) and was properly imported into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>) in both, control and QIL1-depleted cell lines.

QIL1 associates with the core IM MICOS complex, the cardiolipin binding subunits (MIC26 and MIC27), as well as the SAMM50-MTX1-MTX2 OM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, QIL1 is enriched at CJs to an extent similar to that of the MICOS subunit MIC25 and is present in a ∼700 kDa complex, as observed by BN-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, QIL1 may be a central component of CJs and the machinery that connects inner and outer membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Indeed, depletion of QIL1 leads to MICOS-like defects in cristae morphology, with loss of CJs and formation of swirls of cristae membranes inside mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–H</xref>). QIL1 is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> where its depletion also causes mitochondrial phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, QIL1 knockdown resulted in MICOS disassembly, accumulation of a MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex and loss of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 from the MICOS complex, as determined by quantitative proteomics and immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06265.013</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>QIL1 is a novel MICOS subunit required for MICOS assembly.</title><p>Model for QIL1 incorporation into the MICOS complex and the effect of loss of QIL1 on the composition of MICOS subunits.

The molecular mechanism through which these subunits regulate CJs stability is yet to be determined, but it is possible that the phenotype observed in cells after QIL1 depletion is a result of changes in MIC10, MIC26, or MIC27 protein levels.</p><p>The physical properties of cardiolipins are particularly important at areas of the IM with high membrane curvature, such as CJs and at the tip of the cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ortiz et al., 1999</xref>). In fact, cardiolipins have been shown to be enriched at those regions. In Barth syndrome patients, the levels of the enzyme Tafazzin, required for the remodeling of acyl chains within cardiolipins, are decreased, resulting in reduced cardiolipin levels. This leads to major alterations of mitochondrial membranes morphology and curvature, with the appearance of collapsed cristae packaged in multiple concentric layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acehan et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, Tafazzin mutations in flies generated a Barth syndrome-related phenotype characterized by decreased cardiolipin levels, mitochondria showing cristae membrane swirls and motor defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Tafazzin has been shown to be regulated by the MICOS interactor Aim24 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harner et al., 2014</xref>) and MIC27 in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weber, 2013</xref>) has been shown to bind cardiolipin. Due to its ability to bind cardiolipin, the presence of MIC27 at CJs is particularly important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weber, 2013</xref>). Thus, alterations in mitochondrial cardiolipin levels after QIL1 depletion could potentially offer an alternative, indirect explanation for the observed phenotypes. To test the possibility that QIL1 regulates mitochondrial cardiolipin levels, we measured cardiolipin content and species distribution in QIL1-depleted cells compared to control cells expressing FF2 shRNA. We observed that the cardiolipin profiles of cells expressing FF2 or three different QIL1 shRNAs were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), excluding an indirect effect of QIL1 through regulation of cardiolipin levels. This observation is in agreement with data published previously, showing that cardiolipin composition was not substantially changed by the lack of the central MICOS subunits MIC60 or MIC10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohnert et al., 2012</xref>). These data support a more direct structural role for QIL1 in MICOS stability.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that MIC60 forms a stable MICOS sub-complex with MIC19 and MIC25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure2D–E</xref>) and retains the ability to interact with the OM component SAMM50, independently of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). These data suggest that MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 could perform other functions in association with the OM, independently of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27. This is not surprising given that it has been shown previously that a fraction of MIC60 molecules, but not MIC10, functions in biogenesis of β-barrel proteins of the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohnert et al., 2012</xref>) independently of other subunits. Restoration of MIC10 levels by overexpression in cells depleted for QIL1 failed to significantly rescue its interaction with other MICOS subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E</xref>) and incorporation into the ∼700 kDa complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) as compared to wild-type cells even though MIC10 was efficiently imported into mitochondria and expressed at similar levels in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). This indicates that QIL1 is required for the binding of MIC10 to the MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex. Thus, we propose a stratified model of MICOS assembly, where the stable MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex at the IM binds to MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 to generate a mature MICOS complex in a step facilitated by QIL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Further studies are required to fully understand the regulation of CJ assembly and maintenance. Interestingly, in flies exposed to hyperoxia to induce oxygen stress, the cristae lose their orderly structure, generating a swirl within the muscle mitochondrion and the IM forms concentric stacks inside the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walker and Benzer, 2004</xref>), reminiscent of the phenotype observed after MICOS depletion. Intriguingly, the number of mitochondria containing swirls increases slowly with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walker and Benzer, 2004</xref>). In contrast, giant mitochondria with honeycomb-like cristae were observed in animals exposed to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lorente et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perkins and Hsiao, 2012</xref>). These findings demonstrate the importance of cristae remodeling as a mechanism of adaptation to different metabolic and pathological states in vivo. It still remains to be addressed whether regulation of the MICOS complex takes place in these scenarios.</p><p>The MICOS protein interaction network described here provides a resource for additional studies into the regulation of CJ assembly. Indeed, TMEM11 appears to be a novel interactor of the MICOS complex. We identified TMEM11 in association with MIC19, MIC27, MIC60, and MTX2, and endogenous MIC60 associated with endogenous TMEM11 by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,F</xref>).

Dried lipid extract from cholroform/methanol extractions was dissolved in choloroform/methanol (2:1) and injected into the HPLC for analysis. Lipid extracts were separated on an Accucore C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 2.6 µm; Thermo) connected to an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo). A binary solvent system was used (mobile phase A: 50:50 ACN/H<sub>2</sub>0, 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% HCO<sub>2</sub>H; mobile phase B: 10:88:2 AcN/IPA/H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>2</sub>, 0.02% HCO<sub>2</sub>H) in a 28 min gradient at a flow rate of 400 μl/min with the column temperature kept constant at 35°C. The HPLC was connected on-line to a Q-exactive mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source (ESI; Thermo). Mass spectra were acquired in a data-dependent mode to automatically switch between full scan MS and up to 15 data-dependent MS/MS scans. The maximum injection time for full scans was 75 ms, with a target value of 1,000,000 at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200 and a mass range of 150–1800 m/z in negative mode. The 15 most intense ions from the survey scan were selected and fragmented with HCD with stepped normalized collision energies of 30, 60, and 100. Target values for MS/MS were set at 100,000 with a maximum injection time of 120 ms at a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 200. To avoid repetitive sequencing, the dynamic exclusion of sequenced peptides was set at 10 s. Peaks were analyzed using the Lipid Search algorithm (MKI, Tokyo, Japan). Peaks were defined through raw files, product ion and precursor ion accurate masses. Candidate molecular species were identified by database (&gt;1,000,000 entries) search of negative ion adducts. Mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm for the precursor mass. Samples were aligned within a time window and results combined in a single report. An internal standard for cardiolipin (CL 14:1/14:1/14:1/15:1) spiked in prior to extraction was used for normalization and calculation of the amounts of lipids in pmol/mg protein.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH grants GM095567 and NS083524 to JWH and NS069695 to DVV NIH DK098285 to JAP.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Jared Rutter, peer reviewer #3, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>From the comments below and the discussion of the reviewers, the consensus is that the manuscript has the potential to represent a significant advance of our understanding of the mechanism of MICOS complex assembly, which would be of great interest to the cell biology community. In addition, the reviewers agree that data convincingly demonstrate that QIL1 is a MICOS subunit, albeit reviewer 2 requests a negative control for the proteomic analysis that should be performed. However, at present the observations do not allow for a clear conclusion regarding the molecular role of this newly identified MICOS subunit. Additional experiments directed at more fully elucidating the function of QIL1 are needed. In particular, the authors need to determine whether QIL1 plays a direct role in MICOS assembly and/or a more indirect role, for example, in cardiolipin synthesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors report the identification of QIL as a new constituent of MICOS using a thorough proteomic analysis, which will be of great interest to the field. Analysis of cells depleted of QIL and in bodywall muscle cells in an RNAi QIL <italic>Drosophila</italic> model provides good evidence that QIL shares functions reported for other MICOS subunits in the maintenance of inner membrane structure. In addition, proteomic analysis and data from native gels indicate that QIL is required for the stability of the MICOS complex, specifically of MIC10, MIC26 and MIC27. Data presented also indicate the presence of a MIC60, MIC19 and MIC25 subcomplex in QIL depleted cells. Overexpression of MIC10 in cells depleted for QIL failed to significantly restore its interaction with other MICOS subunits as compared to wild type cells expressing similar levels of MIC10. The authors interpret this negative observation to suggest that QIL is required for MIC10 to be incorporated into MICOS holocomplex. In general, the experiments are well controlled and the data quality is very high.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>The authors should at a minimum examine the localization of overexpressed MIC10 in control and QIL depleted cells. The finding that MIC10 overexpression does not restore its interaction in QIL depleted cells is essentially a negative result that should be interpreted with caution. The authors’ conclusion from this observation in the Abstract and manuscript is that “QIL1 is required for binding of MIC10 to other subunits of the MICOS complex and for its incorporation into the complex”. Other possibilities are possible and thus this should be softened accordingly. What QIL depletion demonstrates convincingly is that there is a stable MICOS subcomplex composed of MIC60, MIC19 and MIC25. The authors should also determine the status of the putative MICOS MIC60, MIC19 and MIC25 subcomplex in cells depleted for QIL1 to strengthen their conclusions regarding MICOS complex assembly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript “QIL1 is a novel mitochondrial protein required for MICOS complex stability and cristae morphology” by Guarani et al. reports on a proteomic analysis of the human MICOS complex. With this approach they confirm known components of MICOS and identify two potential novel constituents, QIL1 and TMEM11. The authors characterize QIL1 as mitochondrial protein localized at cristae junctions and support association with MICOS subunits, apolipoproteins, and the outer membrane interactors of MICOS. Depletion of QIL1 leads to a MICOS-like phenotype in human and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. Absence of QIL1 leads to drastically reduced amounts of the MICOS proteins MIC10, MIC26 and MIC27 and destabilize a 700kDa MICOS subcomplex.</p><p>The data presented support an association of QIL1 with MICOS. However, it remains unclear if the defect on cristae morphology is caused through loss of QIL1 or the concomitant loss of MIC10, MIC26 and MIC27. Moreover, mechanistic conclusions on the function of QIL1 cannot easily be drawn. It remains to be shown if QIL1 is involved in assembly or stability of MICOS or if it has a role in cardiolipin synthesis.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>: the amount of QIL1 is drastically increased in all tagged strains this could lead to non-physiological organization of MICOS components or QIL1/MICOS association through changes in the equilibrium. This is critical for interpreting the immunoisolation analyses.</p><p>2) All immunoisolation analyses lack a negative control. The authors did not monitor for the purity of these analyses by probing for an abundant inner membrane protein.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>: the amount of MIC60 in lanes 2 and 3 does not match to the input.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D/E</xref>: MIC60 show higher complexes (&gt;700kDa) in 2D-PAGE. These complexes are not seen on BN-PAGE with the tagged strain. They are also not visible by BN-PAGE for endogenous MIC60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This questions the interpretation of the first dimension. Moreover, the 700kDa complex is not the mature MICOS but rather a relatively stable subcomplex, as MICOS has been detected in the MDa range (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harner et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>5) Since MIC60, MIC19 and MIC25 are not affected by QIL1 depletion, the authors should assess if these MICOS subunits still interact with the MISOC outer membrane interactors in the absence of QIL1. This would allow the authors to define if this complex can act independent of the other subunits and provide some more mechanistic insight into MICOS.</p><p>6) The authors should use MICOS nomenclature for QIL1.</p><p>7) The scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> could lead to a misunderstanding on the MICOS organization since the central subunit MIC10 is not included. The authors should include MIC10 in the network overview (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and extend the validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) with western blot data. Since MIC10 is not detectable by mass spec, this makes me wonder as to how many other proteins are missing.</p><p>8) The authors discuss in length about the role of cardiolipin. However, they did not assess cardiolipin levels upon QIL1 knock down. This should be done.</p><p>9) The analyses on TMEM11 are rudimentary. This should be extended or taken out.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Using a systematic proteomics approach, the authors report the identification of a previously uncharacterized subunit of the MICOS complex, QIL1. In addition to extensive proteomics, the authors utilize co-immunopreciptitation and BN-PAGE to convincingly demonstrate that QIL1 is a member of the MICOS complex. Importantly, they do not simply suggest that QIL1 is a MICOS subunit but demonstrate that QIL1 is essential for mediating the interaction of a ∼500kDa subcomplex with additional MICOS subunits to form the mature ∼700kDa complex. Furthermore, the authors utilize EM to investigate the morphological consequences of genetic depletion of QIL1 (or its orthologs) in two model systems and nicely demonstrate that loss of this subunit results in mitochondria with abnormal morphology, highlighted by a lack of cristae.</p><p>Overall, the paper provides a thorough characterization of QIL1 and its essential role in mediating MICOS complex assembly. It highlights a novel member of the complex and demonstrates that loss of this subunit results in a phenotype consistent with loss of other MICOS subunits. The result is that I am totally convinced that the authors are correct in their conclusions and the only substantial weakness is that they don't go a little farther in the interrogation of the MICOS complex or the QIL1 protein. For instance, QIL1 might play a regulatory role in assembling the mature complex. In fact, based on the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> (compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), it looks like MIC10 might be playing a dose-limited regulatory role and QIL1 is required for this activity. This could lead to a greatly enhanced understanding of the regulation and role of the MICOS complex in mitochondrial biology.</p><p>In summary, the major highlight of this manuscript is the discovery of a novel subunit of the MICOS complex. Furthermore, the authors provide convincing evidence that QIL1 is required for late-stage maturation of MICOS. Indeed, loss of QIL1 leads to a stalled intermediate complex that is unable to bind additional subunits. In the end, the authors show that QIL1 is required to form the mature MICOS complex. In addition to the wealth of interaction data, the authors also demonstrate that loss of QIL1 has catastrophic consequences on mitochondrial morphology and cristae structure, consistent with loss of other MICOS proteins. This is strengthened by the use of two distinct model systems thereby demonstrating the conserved role of this protein. Overall, the data is convincing and the story is interesting, however, potentially extending the investigation a bit further could substantially raise the impact. In the end, this is a strong paper and should be accepted.</p><p>Specific points to consider:</p><p>1) The western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> is difficult to interpret due to the gel distortion. It's hard to even tell which lane is which for MIC10 and QIL1 blots.</p><p>2) It would be better to carry out the studies in fly either using a genetic knockout or rescuing the RNAi lines. With that said, these experiments would require significant time and effort and since all finding are consistent with the mammalian data, are probably not necessary.</p><p>3) It would be nice to see MIC26 westerns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> if the antibody is available.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06265.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>From the comments below and the discussion of the reviewers, the consensus is that the manuscript has the potential to represent a significant advance of our understanding of the mechanism of MICOS complex assembly, which would be of great interest to the cell biology community.

To address this question, we collaborated with Florian Fröhlich (an expert in lipidomics in Tobias Walther’s lab) to measure cardiolipin levels in mitochondria in a direct manner by mass spectrometry. Our analysis revealed that cardiolipin levels and species distribution were unchanged upon QIL1 stable knockdown using 3 different shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>). This data supports a more direct structural role for QIL1 in MICOS stability, suggesting a scenario that would be more consistent with QIL1 being a component of the MICOS complex rather than being indirectly involved, for example, in promoting cardiolipin production. These observations are in agreement with data published previously showing that cardiolipin profiles were unaffected upon depletion of the MICOS subunits MIC10 and MIC60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohnert et al., 2012</xref>). The idea that QIL1 is an actual component of the MICOS is further supported by additional data showing that:</p><p>1) QIL1 is a component of the major ∼700 KDa complex seen in native gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-E</xref>).</p><p>2) It interacts with 5 known subunits of MICOS and known MICOS binding proteins at the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>3) It is enriched at cristae junctions to a similar extent as a bona-fide MICOS subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>).</p><p>4) QIL1 knockdown impaired MICOS assembly, resulting in the formation of a stable MICOS sub-complex that contains MIC60, MIC19 and MIC25 and lacks MIC10, MIC26 and MIC27 as demonstrated by native gels and quantitative proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>).</p><p>To further strengthen these observations, we have immunopurified the endogenous MICOS complex with an antibody targeting MIC60 and investigated the status of the complex by probing for the presence of other MICOS subunits by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G-H</xref>). These results have confirmed the existence of sub-complexes containing MIC60, MIC19 and MIC25 when QIL1 levels are silenced. Moreover, as requested by one reviewer, we have shown that MIC60 maintains its ability to interact with the outer membrane protein SAMM50 when QIL1 expression is silenced. This finding is in line with previous work showing that MIC60 performs additional functions, independently of other MICOS subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohnert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction between MIC60 and three additional components—MIC10, MIC26 and MIC27—is significantly reduced upon QIL1 knockdown, reinforcing the idea that these subunits require QIL1 for their efficient assembly into the MICOS complex and for MICOS maturation.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The authors should at a minimum examine the localization of overexpressed MIC10 in control and QIL depleted cells.

Based on the fraction of MIC10 immunoreactive protein seen in SDS-PAGE, the ectopically expressed protein is present at about 50% of the endogenous protein. Under these conditions (i.e. higher MIC10 levels), the abundance of the mature ∼700 KDa MICOS complex in native gels wasn’t rescued. We conclude that while MIC10 is present in mitochondria, it is unable to assemble into MICOS when QIL1 is reduced by RNAi. We thank the reviewer for suggesting that we improve this experiment.</p><p>We have rephrased our conclusion that now reads: “In QIL1-depleted cells, overexpressed MIC10 fails to significantly restore its interaction with other MICOS subunits and with SAMM50”.</p><p><italic>What QIL depletion demonstrates convincingly is that there is a stable MICOS subcomplex composed of MIC60, MIC19 and MIC25.

To do so, we have immunopurified endogenous MIC60 from cells stably expressing FF2 or QIL1 shRNAs and analyzed its interactions with all other MICOS subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Our results demonstrated that MIC60 binding to MIC19 and MIC25 remained unchanged upon QIL1 knockdown, confirming the existence of a stable MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex. However, MIC10, MIC26 and MIC27 levels were strongly reduced in MICOS complexes from QIL1 depleted mitochondria, even though the levels of immunoprecipitated MIC60 were similar in both conditions. This experiment was performed in biological triplicates and densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ. In each experiment, the amounts of each MICOS subunit was normalized to MIC60 levels in the immune complexes and the statistical analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The data presented support an association of QIL1 with MICOS.

This represents a misunderstanding of the data caused by the fact that we did not include a control cell extract in the western blot. We apologize. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> contained QIL1 western blots for cells expressing either QIL1-HA-FLAG or one of several other MICOS subunits. The reviewer commented that the levels of QIL1 were much higher in the cells expressing MICOS but the comparison being made was with the QIL1-HA-FLAG cell line, not control 293T cells. It turns out that when compared to control cell lines, the levels of endogenous QIL1 in the MICOS subunit expressing cells are identical to 293T cells expressing the empty vector with the HA-Flag tag (as shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref>). In cells expressing QIL1-HA-FLAG, there is a reduction in the abundance of the endogenous QIL1, likely reflecting the fact that there is a homeostatic mechanism to maintain total QIL1 levels within a particular range. The band for the HA-FLAG tagged QIL1 is approximately equal to the levels of endogenous QIL1 and together, they are similar to the levels of endogenous QIL1 in the control cell line.

This questions the interpretation of the first dimension. Moreover, the 700kDa complex is not the mature MICOS but rather a relatively stable subcomplex, as MICOS has been detected in the MDa range (e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"><italic>Harner et al. 2011</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>We do not discount the possibility that there could be larger complexes at lower abundance. We do see evidence for larger complexes as smeared in the 1 MDa range (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and this was also validated by our quantitative proteomics experiments examining native gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In our hands, the ∼700 KDa complex is the most obvious MICOS complex in human cells, and is routinely identified with several MICOS subunit antibodies in native gels. Our ability to detect these smears (possibly a form of a “super complex”) may vary depending on the detergent used or the sensitivity of the antibody being used to identify MICOS complex subunits in first dimension native gels. SDS-PAGE analysis also allows for better detection of epitopes otherwise hidden in the native conformation inside certain supramolecular complexes. Moreover, the identity of the proteins present in these larger complexes remains unknown and it is possible that they include additional components not in the classical MICOS complexes. Results from Ott et al. in mammalian cells have shown that, MIC60 and MIC19 were mainly observed at ∼700KDa, together with a smear towards the high molecular weight region of the gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ott et al. 2012</xref>), which resemble our observations. While it is more difficult to establish a direct comparison between mammalian and the yeast MICOS complex, Harner et al. have also observed that all MICOS proteins they analyzed were present in two large complexes of &gt;1 MDa and ∼700 KDa in first dimension BN-PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harner et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) Since MIC60, MIC19 and MIC25 are not affected by QIL1 depletion, the authors should assess if these MICOS subunits still interact with the MISOC outer membrane interactors in the absence of QIL1. This would allow the authors to define if this complex can act independent of the other subunits and provide some more mechanistic insight into MICOS</italic>.</p><p>This is a very interesting point raised by the reviewer. We have addressed this question in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>. We have immunopurified endogenous MIC60 from mitochondria obtained from cells stably expressing FF2 or QIL1 shRNAs. When we analyzed binding to endogenous SAMM50, we observed no significant change upon QIL1 knockdown, indicating that the MIC60 sub-complex could act in association with the outer membrane components, independently of MIC10, MIC26 and MIC27. We included this comment in the Discussion section of the paper.</p><p><italic>6) The authors should use MICOS nomenclature for QIL1</italic>.</p><p>We had considered giving QIL1 a new name that would be consistent with the MICOS nomenclature but had decided against it given that there is no obvious ortholog in yeast but there is a yeast gene of very similar size (12 KDa, Mic12). QIL1 displays ∼10% sequence identity with yeast Mic12, and we cannot rule out the possibility that QIL1 is the functional ortholog of the yeast Mic12. At the Editor’s discretion, we would be happy to name it MIC13, for example, with the hope that people don’t confuse this with Mic12 in yeast, but in the current version, we have maintained the official gene symbol.</p><p><italic>7) The scheme in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B and C</italic></xref> <italic>could lead to a misunderstanding on the MICOS organization since the central subunit MIC10 is not included. The authors should include MIC10 in the network overview (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>) and extend the validation (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref><italic>) with western blot data. Since MIC10 is not detectable by mass spec, this makes me wonder as to how many other proteins are missing</italic>.</p><p>MIC10 was not in the original set of constructs that we had available when we set up the IP-MS experiment. We have now attempted to perform IP-MS analysis on a stable cell line expressing C-terminally tagged MIC10. Even though we can detect MIC10-HA by western blot analysis and confirm its mitochondrial localization by immunofluorescence, we weren’t able to detect peptides for MIC10 by mass spectrometry. Also, we were unable to directly observe MIC10 via IP-MS targeting other known MICOS complex members. This mostly reflects idiosyncrasies of this protein's primary structure that make it uniquely challenging for identification via bottom-up proteomics methods. These techniques rely upon digestion of proteins with trypsin to produce peptides whose chemical and physical properties are amenable for isolation, LC separation, and fragmentation. Although intact human proteins vary in their structural and chemical characteristics, upon digestion the vast majority produces at least several peptides that are suitable for LC-MS detection; the exceptions are small and often hydrophobic proteins. Not only is MIC10 small (78 amino acids), but nearly a quarter of its sequence consists of a transmembrane domain and the C-terminal half that extends into the intermembrane space is quite hydrophobic as well. Furthermore, its eight basic residues (K/R) are unevenly distributed across its length and often cluster together in series, reducing digestion efficiency and resulting in tryptic peptides that are either long or too short to be specific to a single protein. Of the four tryptic peptides whose expected lengths would exceed four amino acids, two are long and excessively hydrophobic: one encompasses essentially the entire transmembrane domain; the other, spanning nearly the entire inter-membrane portion of the protein, contains two tyrosines, one tryptophan, and two phenylalanines along with several aliphatic side chains. The second of these peptides also contains several Met residues whose side chains are prone to oxidation during sample handling, potentially dividing its signal across multiple oxidation states. The remaining peptides are the N-terminal peptide (MSESELGR) and another nearby sequence (CLADAVVK), neither of which are ideal targets for LC-MS detection. Because MIC10 poses so many challenges, it is not surprising that it was not observed directly in our AP-MS experiments. Fortunately, it is not a typical example: more than 98% of human proteins listed in SwissProt are longer than MIC10 and will more likely produce tryptic peptides suitable for LC-MS detection. Thus, we expect that very few other bona fide interactors would evade AP-MS detection in this way.</p><p>With respect to our primary data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (interaction map), we prefer to not add MIC10 to it since it only contains proteomic data but to address the reviewers comment concerning the subunits of the known MICOS complex, we have added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref> that shows the known subunits and MICOS interactors C-terminally tagged for IP-MS analysis when we began our work.</p><p><italic>8) The authors discuss in length about the role of cardiolipin.

Furthermore, the authors provide convincing evidence that QIL1 is required for late-stage maturation of MICOS. Indeed, loss of QIL1 leads to a stalled intermediate complex that is unable to bind additional subunits. In the end, the authors show that QIL1 is required to form the mature MICOS complex. In addition to the wealth of interaction data, the authors also demonstrate that loss of QIL1 has catastrophic consequences on mitochondrial morphology and cristae structure, consistent with loss of other MICOS proteins. This is strengthened by the use of two distinct model systems thereby demonstrating the conserved role of this protein. Overall, the data is convincing and the story is interesting, however, potentially extending the investigation a bit further could substantially raise the impact. In the end, this is a strong paper and should be accepted</italic>.</p><p>We hope that the reviewer will appreciate that we have extended our investigation further.
