of food-seeking behavior. We investigated how nutritional states modulated starvation-induced hyperactivity in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The receptor of the adipokinetic hormone (AKHR), the insect analog of glucagon, was required for starvation-induced hyperactivity. AKHR was expressed in a small group of octopaminergic neurons in the brain. Silencing AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons and blocking octopamine signaling in these neurons eliminated starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activation of these neurons accelerated the onset of hyperactivity upon starvation. Neither AKHR nor AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons were involved in increased food consumption upon starvation, suggesting that starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are independently regulated. Single cell analysis of AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons identified the co-expression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like receptor (dInR), which imposed suppressive effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity. Therefore, insulin and glucagon signaling exert opposite effects on starvation-induced hyperactivity via a common neural target in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15693.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15693.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15693.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals can be thought of as tightly controlled eating machines. An animal’s brain senses if it is hungry via signals from the nervous system or hormones, and then alters the animal’s behavior to obtain a supply of food. These behaviors include looking for food and eating it; and regulating both food seeking and food consumption behaviors is crucial for the animal’s chances of survival and reproduction.</p><p>Studies that used fruit flies as a model have previously shown that flies walk more when they are hungry. This activity helped the flies to locate and occupy food sources, but it was not clear how this food seeking behavior was regulated.</p><p>Now, Yu, Huang et al. find that a small group of neurons in the fly brain controls food seeking in starving flies. The neurons achieve this by sensing two groups of hormones with opposing activity. These hormones are the fly’s equivalents of glucagon and insulin, which are found in humans and other mammals. In humans, glucagon is released when blood sugar levels are low and stimulates hunger, while insulin is released when blood sugar is high and acts to suppress feelings of hunger. Therefore, food seeking in the flies is under the precise control of signals of hunger and satiety.</p><p>Further experiments show that these fly neurons use a chemical messenger called octopamine to convey the hormone-based signals to other circuits of neurons. Notably, these downstream neurons are not involved in regulating the consumption of food. Therefore, food seeking and eating appear to be independently regulated in fruit flies.</p><p>Further studies are now needed to dissect the downstream circuits of neurons that actually control the food seeking behavior. It will also be important to explore how this behavior is suppressed when a food source is detected.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15693.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15693.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>food seeking</kwd><kwd>AKHR</kwd><kwd>dInR</kwd><kwd>octopamine</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Zhejiang Natural Science Funds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LR15C060001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Junling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Thousand Young Talents Plan of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31522026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016QN81010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two functionally antagonizing groups of hormones directly regulate starvation-induced increase in locomotion via a common neural target in fruit flies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Energy homeostasis is vital for survival, growth, and reproduction of animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gautron et al., 2015</xref>). Energy deprivation drives a complex behavioral program to ensure adequate food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sternson et al., 2013</xref>). As an adaptive response to starvation, food intake is modulated by nutrient and hormonal cues. In mammals, the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, especially the neurons expressing agouti-related protein (AgRP)/neuropeptide Y (NPY), and those expressing pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), sense and integrate numerous nutritional cues such as circulating glucose, insulin, leptin, and ghrelin and modulate food intake in response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belgardt et al., 2009</xref>). In fruit flies, several hormonal signals modulate different aspects of food intake, these including <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptides (DILPs), the two homologs of mammalian NPY, neuropeptide F (NPF) and short neuropeptide F (sNPF), and a handful of other neuropeptides such as allatostatin A (AstA), leucokinin, and hugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pool and Scott, 2014</xref>). It is generally accepted that these hormonal cues represent the nutritional status of animals and translate them into physiological and behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pool and Scott, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sternson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The search of appropriate food sources (i.e. food seeking) is often the first step of food intake, followed by the actual ingestion of food (i.e. food consumption) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stephens et al., 2007</xref>). Starvation enhances food-seeking behavior in two parallel ways. On the one hand, starvation modulates the perception of food associated sensory cues, increasing the likelihood to target desirable food sources. In fruit flies, starvation increases the sensitivity of Or42b<sup>+</sup> olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that mediate odor attraction, and decreases the sensitivity of aversive Or85a<sup>+</sup> ORNs, resulting in enhanced behavioral attraction to food odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Root et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, starvation also influences the sensitivity of sweet-sensing Gr5a<sup>+</sup> gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) and bitter-sensing Gr66a<sup>+</sup> GRNs in opposite directions, resulting in enhanced attractiveness to food taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marella et al., 2012</xref>). A number of neurohormonal cues, including DILPs, NPF, sNPF, dopamine, and tachykinin (DTK), are involved in the sensory modulation by starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Root et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, starvation also promotes locomotor activity in both rodents and fruit flies, which may facilitate the exploration of the environment and increase the possibility to locate potential food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dietrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Isabel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Park, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In fruit flies, starvation-induced hyperactivity requires the neuroendocrine cells producing AKH, the insect analog of glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Isabel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Park, 2004</xref>). However, AKH has a role in modulating lipid storage as well as starvation resistance and whether it imposes a direct effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bharucha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grönke et al., 2007</xref>). We have also shown that octopamine, the insect analog of norepinephrine, is required for starvation induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). But given the diverse anatomical distribution and physiological function of octopaminergic neurons in the fly brain, the underlying neural circuitry of starvation-induced hyperactivity and how it is modulated by hormonal cues remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El-Kholy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are reciprocally inhibitory and the transition of these two behaviors relies on the detection of food cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). It is of great interest to understand how these two behaviors are dynamically regulated by the nutritional states and the availability of food sources. In rodents, acute activation of hypothalamic AgRP/NPY neurons induces both hyperactivity and food consumption, suggesting that these two behaviors are regulated by a same group of neurons and hormonal cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atasoy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dietrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>). However, the detection of food sources rapidly suppresses starvation-induced hyperactivity along with the activity of AgRP/NPY neurons before actual food consumption, suggesting that these neurons may only be involved in the locomotor response upon starvation but not food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it remains elusive whether starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are modulated by the same set of hormones via a common neural target, or they are independently regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seeley and Berridge, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this present study, we aimed to better understand how starvation-induced hyperactivity is regulated by hormonal signals, and whether starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are interdependently or independently regulated. Through a neuronal-specific RNAi screen, we find that a small group of octopaminergic neurons located in the subesophageal zone (SEZ) of the fly brain are both necessary and sufficient for starvation-induced hyperactivity. These neurons co-express AKHR and dInR, the receptor of hunger hormone AKH and the receptor of satiety hormone DILPs, respectively, which modulate starvation-induced hyperactivity in opposite directions. Thus, these AKHR<sup>+</sup>dInR<sup>+</sup> octopaminergic neurons represent a common neural target for two sets of functionally antagonizing hormones to modulate starvation-induced hyperactivity. Notably, manipulating starvation-induced hyperactivity does not interfere with starvation-induced food consumption, suggesting that starvation-induced changes in different food intake behaviors are independently regulated by different hormonal cues and neural circuitry in fruit flies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A neuron-specific RNAi screen identified AKHR required for starvation-induced hyperactivity</title><p>We have previously shown that starvation induces sustained increase in locomotor activity of adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).

Notably, neuronal knock-down of AKHR did not affect lipid storage of flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and fat body knock-down of AKHR did not eliminate starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), disassociating the behavioral and metabolic effects of AKHR signaling. These results confirm that only neuronal AKHR, but not fat body-expressed AKHR, is required for starvation-induced hyperactivity in flies.</p><p>To further evaluate the function of neuronal AKHR in starvation-induced hyperactivity, we used a behavioral assay that directly quantified the walking velocity as well as the position of individual flies in the presence or absence of food cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a</xref>). By using this behavioral assay, we confirmed that flies with neuronal knock-down of AKHR exhibited comparable walking velocity under fed vs. starved conditions, whereas the two control genotypes exhibited significantly increased walking velocity upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3e</xref>). Besides increased locomotion, starved flies also exhibited increased interest to food and could rapidly locate and occupy food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Root et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, starved flies from all three genotypes could locate and occupy food sources in the center of the behavioral chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b–d</xref>). Taken together, these data confirm that neuronal AKHR is required for starvation-induced hyperactivity without interfering their ability to locate and occupy food sources.</p><p>Starvation promotes both locomotor activity and food consumption. But it remained unclear whether these two behaviors are regulated by the same set of hormonal cues or not. We thus asked whether neuronal AKHR was also required for starvation-induced increase in food consumption. We first examined food consumption during the course of a single meal, by using a capillary-based feeding assay named the MAFE (<underline>MA</underline>nual <underline>FE</underline>eding) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qi et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).

Using the combinational nSyb:AD/AKHR:BD-GAL4 driver that induces gene expression only in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons, we found that AKHR was expressed in a small group of neurons located in the SEZ (2–4 neurons per hemisphere) but not in the ventral nerve cord (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref>).

The co-localization of dInR and AKHR was also confirmed by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, 'dInR') and antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>dInR is the receptor of DILPs, the insect analogs of mammalian insulin. Similar to insulin, DILPs function as satiety signals. Dietary sugars and proteins induce the release of DILPs into the hemolymph, which in turn promotes growth and nutrient storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rulifson et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, the expression of dInR in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons suggests that insulin signaling may counteract the effect of AKH-AKHR signaling and suppress the activity of AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons hence starvation-induced hyperactivity. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down the expression of dInR in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons and examined its effect on flies’ locomotion. We found that similar to the effect of activating AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–d</xref>), eliminating dInR expression in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons accelerated the onset of hyperactivity upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–g</xref>). Conversely, over-expression of dInR in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons delayed the onset of starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that insulin signaling in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons suppress the activity of these neurons and hence starvation-induced hyperactivity. To confirm this finding, we over-expressed <italic>Drosophila</italic> PTEN (dPTEN), a negative regulator of insulin signaling pathway, in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2000</xref>). Over-expression of dPTEN led to an earlier onset of starvation-induced hyperactivity, phenocopying the effect of dInR knock-down in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h–k</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that the activity of AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons is modulated by two sets of functionally antagonizing hormones, AKH and DILPs. The hunger hormone AKH activates these neurons via AKHR and promotes locomotor activity upon starvation, whereas the satiety hormones DILPs exert a suppressive effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity via dInR signaling. The interplay between these two sets of hormonal cues therefore modulates locomotor activity upon changes in flies’ internal nutritional states. Besides dInR, Myosuppressin receptor 2 (DMS-R2) was also moderately enriched in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, Line 4). Knocking down DMS-R2 in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons, however, did not affect starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Octopamine signaling mediates the effect of AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons on starvation-induced hyperactivity</title><p>We next asked how AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons connected the upstream hormonal signals to downstream neural circuitry.

Starvation promotes both food seeking and food consumption. Food seeking has two components: food targeting (i.e. perception of food cues) and environmental exploration (i.e. hyperactivity). In this present study (highlighted in red), we have shown that a small group of octopaminergic neurons located in the fly brain are both necessary and sufficient for starvation-induced hyperactivity, an important aspect of food seeking. These neurons express AKHR and dInR, the receptors of AKH and DILPs, respectively. These neurons are octopaminergic (OA), and likely exert their behavioral effect via downstream neurons expressing certain octopamine receptor(s) (OA-R). It is worth noting that the regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity is independent from that of food consumption, and vice versa.

Octopamine is involved in the regulation of various behaviors, including sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker and Sehgal, 2008</xref>), learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke et al., 2012</xref>), and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoyer et al., 2008</xref>). We have also shown previously that octopamine signaling was also required for starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).

We first showed that similar to the phenotype of <italic>TβH<sup>M18</sup></italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), pan-neuronal knock-down of TβH expression eliminated starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, knocking down the expression of TβH specificallyin AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons eliminated starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d–f</xref>). Consistently, knocking down the expression of AKHR in octopaminergic neurons also blocked the increase in locomotion by starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>).

We thus examined the potential role of DDC in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons. Nevertheless, eliminating DDC expression in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons exerted no effect on the increased locomotion by starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Food seeking and food consumption are essential for the acquisition of food sources, and hence survival, growth, and reproduction of animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao and Horvath, 2007</xref>). Starvation influences food-seeking behavior via both modulating the perception of food cues as well as enhancing flies’ locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref>). Accumulated evidence has suggested that starvation modulates the activity of ORNs via multiple neural and hormonal cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beshel and Zhong, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ko et al., 2015</xref>), which in turn facilitates odor-driven food search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Root et al., 2011</xref>) and food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farhadian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, starvation also modulates the perception of food taste via the relative sensitivity of appetitive sweet-sensing and aversive bitter-sensing GRNs, which may in turn increase the attractiveness of food taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marella et al., 2012</xref>). However, how starvation increases the locomotor activity of flies remains largely uncharacterized.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Isabel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Park, 2004</xref>), we have shown that starved fruit flies exhibit sustained increase in their locomotor activity, which can be suppressed by food consumption induced by both nutritive and non-nutritive food cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, we have shown that a small group of neurons located in the SEZ region of the fly brain are both necessary and sufficient for starvation-induced hyperactivity. These neurons sense the changes in flies’ internal nutritional states by directly responding to two sets of hormones, AKH and DILPs, and modulate locomotor activity in response. Single cell analysis has identified that these AKHR<sup>+</sup>dInR<sup>+</sup> neurons are octopaminergic, which offers an entry point to trace the downstream neural circuitry that regulates starvation-induced hyperactivity. For example, there are 7 candidate octopamine receptors in fruit flies and it would be of interest to investigate whether any of these receptors and the receptor-expressing neurons are involved in locomotor regulation upon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El-Kholy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>AKH and DILPs are two sets of functionally counteracting hormones in fruit flies. As its mammalian analog glucagon, the reduction in circulating sugars induces the release of AKH, which in turn mobilizes fat storage and provides energy supply for flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bharucha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Rulifson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Park, 2004</xref>). In contrast, DILPs, the insect analog of mammalian insulin, function as satiety hormones. Dietary nutrient induces the release of DILPs into the hemolymph, which in turn promotes protein synthesis, body growth, and other anabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rulifson et al., 2002</xref>). We have shown that these two hormonal signaling systems exert opposite effects on starvation-induced hyperactivity via a small group of AKHR<sup>+</sup>InR<sup>+</sup> octopaminergic neurons. These results suggest that these AKHR<sup>+</sup>dInR<sup>+</sup> neurons can integrate the inputs from the two hormonal signaling systems representing hunger and satiety at the same time, and modulate flies’ locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref>). This elegant yet concise design allows these neurons to be responsive to rapid changes in the internal nutritional states as well as food availability. Furthermore, it is possible that besides hunger and satiety, other physiological states such as wakefulness, stress, and emotions also influence flies’ locomotor activity. Notably, our single cell analysis has shown that these AKHR<sup>+</sup>dInR<sup>+</sup> neurons also sparsely express other neuropeptide receptors, suggesting that at least small portions of these neurons may also receive input from other neuropeptidergic systems.</p><p>Starved animals exhibited increased locomotion and food consumption, the transition of which relies on the detection of food cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). But whether these two behaviors are interdependently or independently regulated remains unclear. In this present study, we have shown that these two behaviors are dissociable from each other in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref>). On the one hand, although AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons exert a robust modulatory effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity, these neurons are neither necessary nor sufficient for starvation-induced food consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). On the other hand, the regulation of food consumption is independent of starvation-induced hyperactivity as well. We have previously shown that a small subset of GABAergic neurons in the fly brain regulates food consumption but exerts no effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pool et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, several neuropeptides are known to regulate food consumption, such as Hugin, NPF, sNPF, Leucokinin, and AstA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Anzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hergarden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Melcher and Pankratz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). However, we found in our RNAi screen that the receptors of these neuropeptides were not involved in the regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Taken together, it is likely that starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are independently regulated by different sets of hormonal cues, and that AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons are only involved in the former but not the latter. Our results may shed light on the regulation of food intake in mammals, especially whether starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are also independently regulated by different sets of hormones and distinct neural circuitry in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Flies</title><p>Flies were kept on a standard fly medium made of yeast, corn, and agar at 25°C and 60% humidity on a 12 hr light: 12 hr dark cycle.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Mani Ramaswami (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use simple assays for starvation-induced food seeking and food consumption in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to understand how these behaviors are regulated. They use a quasi-unbiased transgenic RNAi screen to test which of some 31 neuropeptide receptors are required in the nervous system for starvation-induced hyperactivity. Of these they identify one AKHR that has the strongest effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity (though others appear to have significant effects as well). This is significant because AKHR is the receptor for insect glucagon, which is released under starvation conditions. The AKH receptor is expressed in a small number of identified central neurons as well as in sugar sensing labellar neurons: however, it does not appear to be required for starvation induced locomotion in peripheral receptors.</p><p>The authors show that:</p><p>A) Loss of AKHR or reduced activity of the AKHR positive neurons has the same effect on &quot;food-seeking,&quot; without affect food consumption.</p><p>B) That the same neurons express Insulin receptors, which have an opposing role on food-seeking. Thus, knocking down insulin signaling in these cells enhances starvation induced food seeking.</p><p>C) The same neurons also express octopamine and that octopamine biosynthetic machinery is required in these cells for starvation-induced hyperactivity.</p><p>Although some elements of the story were already published (Yang et al., 2015), the current study is a comprehensive synthesis linking hormone modulation to octopamine release. Together, they identify key central sensors of starvation and satiety that control food seeking behaviors and show that these are different from those that control food consumption. It is notable that they engage deeply with mammalian literature, making parallels as appropriate across biological systems.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The manuscript should be more judicious in its use of the term &quot;food-seeking.&quot; In previous publications, the behaviour is called starvation triggered hyperactivity or locomotion, which is appropriate. Hyperactivity could increase the chance of finding food, without being &quot;food-seeking.&quot; The authors could certainly speculate, propose and discuss that this implies increased food-seeking, but without further evidence, the terminology used should not imply that the purpose of the behavior is known or that this is targeted in any way.</p><p>2) The authors should verify using either existing genetic mutants or antibody reagents that the central brain neurons identified are indeed AKHR+ as they claim. The RNAi experiments could and should be augmented by use of a genetic mutant and the RT PCR by use of an antibody. Two groups have generated AKHR mutants (Zipursky lab and Kuhnlein lab), UAS-AKHR transgenes, and AKHR antibodies. So there are a number of available reagents that can be used.</p><p>3) The work should be complemented by experimental activation (by Chrimson or TRPA1) of the AKHR neurons to determine a direct effect of these neurons on motor activity +/- starvation conditions. Time allowing the authors should also ask whether AKHR+ neurons activation in neurons depleted of octopamine (TBH RNAi or mutants) also causes the flies to increase their motility? The prediction would be that they would not, that the final read-out is octopamine release.</p><p>4) The work shows that AKHR is involved not AKH as stated in the last paragraph of the subsection “A neuron-specific RNAi screen identified AKHR required for starvation-induced hyperactivity”. What is the chance that there is a second ligand? However, a previous study by Lee and Park (2004) showed that starvation increases locomotion activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and this hyperactivity is absent in flies lacking AKH releasing cells. It should be acknowledged that the AKHR result is consistent with the previous AKH result.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity by insulin and glucagon signaling in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by one peer reviewer, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mani Ramaswami as Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The results from this study show that AKH and its receptor AKHR are required for starvation-induced hyperactivity. Thus, experimentally, the data are interesting and valuable. However, the main concern from the previous review, that the experimental results need to be interpreted more carefully and critically, has not yet been addressed satisfactorily.</p><p>Crucially, the authors overstate the findings as indication that AKH signaling is required for &quot;food-seeking&quot; in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The language needs to be toned back consistently to better integrate the authors findings with previously published work, and to distinguish between what is actually &quot;shown&quot; by the work and what the authors speculate this may be informing us about Biology.</p><p>The authors should include a model summarized below, which all the reviewers agree to be the most parsimonious and probable interpretation of available data.</p><p>Upon starvation animals may exhibit two physiological/ behavioral changes, both of which contribute to food-seeking (or foraging or food finding) behavior. One is a change in sensory responses (for example, the change in gustatory neurons as shown by David Anderson and Kristin Scott, and the increased in the sensitivity of Or42b ORNs and the decrease in the sensitivity of Or85a ORNs shown by Jing Wang). Another of which is an increase in locomotion activity as shown in this study and the previous publications. Starvation-induced hyperactivity may simply facilitate food finding (by allowing a wider area to be scanned by the fly) while the targeting aspects are provided by a change in the chemosensory system.</p><p>There is no evidence from this study that AKH or its receptor is required for anything beyond the hyperactivity. The fact that starved flies tend to accumulate around food and display a reduced walking speed (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) merely supports the notion that food (sugar in this experiment) consumption reduces the hyperactivity through the metabolic hormone insulin as shown in the current study that the AKHR-positive neurons also express InR. The findings of the current study are interesting, but they must be presented and discussed more conservatively and in context of what is already known in the field.</p><p>Before the paper can be accepted, the authors must do a better job of addressing the following non-exhaustive list of issues focused on this major concern, which was also &quot;major comment #1&quot; in the previous decision letter.</p><p>1) Abstract. First sentence &quot;Starvation induces sustained increase in locomotion, which resembles food-seeking behavior and facilitates food localization and acquisition&quot;. This should be changed to &quot;Starvation induces a sustained increase in locomotion, which acts to facilitate food localization and acquisition&quot;.</p><p>2) Introduction. &quot;We have also shown that starvation induced hyperactivity facilitates food localization and acquisition, partly resembling food-seeking behavior in flies&quot;. This needs to be revised accordingly (the &quot;partly resembling food-seeking behavior in flies&quot; phrase should be removed).</p><p>3) In general, the Introduction should be revised to be more precise and scholarly. It should be framed around the concept that, food seeking behavior has sensory and locomotion aspects. For the sensory aspect, both olfactory and gustatory contributions must be included. The authors should also discuss the previous papers on AKH with the specific goal of discussing what is not known about the starvation-induced AKH-mediated hyperactivity.</p><p>4) Title of the section &quot;Neuronal AKHR is required for starvation-induced food seeking&quot; needs to be changed accordingly.

Hyperactivity could increase the chance of finding food, without being &quot;food-seeking.&quot; The authors could certainly speculate, propose and discuss that this implies increased food-seeking, but without further evidence, the terminology used should not imply that the purpose of the behavior is known or that this is targeted in any way.</italic> </p><p>Following the suggestions from the reviewers, we have revised the manuscript and toned down our statement. We have now used “starvation-induced hyperactivity” to describe our behavioral assays throughout the main text. We have also changed the title too.</p><p>Meanwhile, as suggested by the reviewers, we have discussed the potential similarities between starvation-induced hyperactivity and food-seeking behavior in the manuscript. Briefly, our rationale is starvation-induced hyperactivity is a simple yet reliable measure of food seeking, because: a) upon starvation, hyperactive flies are directed towards food sources, suggesting their hyperactivity is to locate food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); and b) starvation-induced hyperactivity can be suppressed by food cues (even non-nutritive, palatable food cues), suggesting that this behavior indeed has a clear goal for food search (Yang et al. PNAS 2015).</p><p><italic>2) The authors should verify using either existing genetic mutants or antibody reagents that the central brain neurons identified are indeed AKHR+ as they claim. The RNAi experiments could and should be augmented by use of a genetic mutant and the RT PCR by use of an antibody. Two groups have generated AKHR mutants (Zipursky lab and Kuhnlein lab), UAS-AKHR transgenes, and AKHR antibodies. So there are a number of available reagents that can be used.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers asked us to a) confirm the phenotype of neuronal knock-down of AKHR by using AKHR<sup>-/-</sup> mutants; b) confirm the brain expression of AKHR gene by antibody staining.</p><p>a) We have obtained new data using AKHR<sup>-/-</sup>mutants. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, AKHR<sup>-/-</sup> mutants exhibited no increase in locomotion upon starvation, further confirming that AKHR is required for starvation-induced hyperactivity.</p><p>Notably, besides the nervous system, AKHR is also expressed in the fat body of fruit flies. We thus also tested the effect of neuronal vs. fat body AKHR knock-down. Unlike neuronal knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>), fat body knock-down of AKHR did not block starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data provide an additional piece of evidence that neuronal AKHR but not fat body AKHR is required for this behavior.</p><p>b) We have also tried to get an AKHR antibody. As the reviewers correctly pointed out, Dr. Larry Zipursky’s lab has generated an AKHR antibody as shown in Bharucha and Zipursky J Exp Biol 2008. Unfortunately, this reagent is no longer available per feedback from the Zipursky lab. Generating and validating a new AKHR antibody will take a significant amount of time and will stop us from resubmitting the manuscript within a reasonable time frame.</p><p>As an alternative approach to verify AKHR expression in the brain, we isolated the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells labeled by our AKHR-split-GAL4 from the fly brain, and developed a protocol to conduct single-cell RNA-seq. Consistent with our RT-PCR results, we found that these GFP<sup>+</sup> brain cells showed high level AKHR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). As a control for specificity, we also showed that genes that are specifically expressed in tissues outside the central nervous system (such as Or67d and Gr5a in the peripheral nervous system, Slimfast in the fat body, and MyoD in muscle) are not expressed, or expressed at very low levels, in these GFP<sup>+</sup> brain cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, although we could not verify AKHR expression by antibody staining, we have three independent lines of evidence to support the brain expression of AKHR: GFP expression under the control of endogenous AKHR promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>); single-cell RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>); and single-cell RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Notably, both our single-cell RT-PCR and RNA-seq experiments identified dInR, the receptor of DILPs, in these GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-C</xref>). The expression of dInR in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons is verified by antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This provides an additional validation of our single-cell analysis.</p><p><italic>3) The work should be complemented by experimental activation (by Chrimson or TRPA1) of the AKHR neurons to determine a direct effect of these neurons on motor activity +/- starvation conditions. Time allowing the authors should also ask whether AKHR+ neurons activation in neurons depleted of octopamine (TBH RNAi or mutants) also causes the flies to increase their motility? The prediction would be that they would not, that the final read-out is octopamine release.</italic> </p><p>We have added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) to show the neuronal activation results. To summarize, we have found that a) artificial activation of AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons accelerated the onset of hyperactivity upon starvation; b) artificial activation of AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons did not affect the frequency and duration of feeding, as well as the meal size. Taken together, AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons are both necessary and sufficient for starvation-induced hyperactivity, and are not involved in the regulation of food consumption.</p><p>We have used the ectopic expression of NaChBac, a low-threshold sodium channel, to perform our neuronal activation experiments. NaChBac is a commonly used tool for neuronal activation in flies (for example, see Dus et al. Neuron 2014; Shang et al. PNAS 2008; Zhou et al. Nature Neuroscience 2008).</p><p>Besides NaChBac, we have also tried thermogenic neuronal activation by TRPA1. However we found that acute ambient temperature shift disrupted the locomotor pattern of these flies so that thermogenic control was not an appropriate way for neuronal activation in our assays. Chrimson likely has a similar problem since light stimulus can cause a startle response in free moving flies (Klapotke et al. Nature Methods 2014).</p><p>We have shown that eliminating octopamine signaling in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons blocks starvation-induced hyperactivity (Figure 7D-F), so as eliminating AKHR in octopaminergic neurons (Figure 7G). These results confirm that octopamine release from AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons is indeed required for AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons to induce starvation-induced hyperactivity.</p><p><italic>4) The work shows that AKHR is involved not AKH as stated in the last paragraph of the subsection “A neuron-specific RNAi screen identified AKHR required for starvation-induced hyperactivity”. What is the chance that there is a second ligand? However, a previous study by Lee and Park (2004) showed that starvation increases locomotion activity in Drosophila and this hyperactivity is absent in flies lacking AKH releasing cells. It should be acknowledged that the AKHR result is consistent with the previous AKH result.</italic> </p><p>We have acknowledged the paper by Lee and Park in the revised manuscript. As the reviewers pointed out, Lee and Park found that ablating AKH<sup>+</sup> cells eliminated starvation-induced hyperactivity, which is consistent with our manipulations on AKHR and AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons.</p><p>Furthermore, we have conducted additional experiments to eliminate AKH gene expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>, knock-down of AKH also blocked starvation-induced hyperactivity, phenocopying the results of neuronal knock-down of AKHR and AKHR<sup>-/-</sup> mutants. These results further suggest that AKHR mediates the behavioral effect of AKH. Taken together, we have added both experimental evidence and previous literature to support the direct link between AKH and AKHR in starvation-induced hyperactivity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The results from this study show that AKH and its receptor AKHR are required for starvation-induced hyperactivity. Thus, experimentally, the data are interesting and valuable. However, the main concern from the previous review, that the experimental results need to be interpreted more carefully and critically, has not yet been addressed satisfactorily.</italic> </p><p><italic>Crucially, the authors overstate the findings as indication that AKH signaling is required for &quot;food-seeking&quot; in Drosophila. The language needs to be toned back consistently to better integrate the authors findings with previously published work, and to distinguish between what is actually &quot;shown&quot; by the work and what the authors speculate this may be informing us about Biology.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors should include a model summarized below, which all the reviewers agree to be the most parsimonious and probable interpretation of available data.</italic> </p><p><italic>Upon starvation animals may exhibit two physiological/ behavioral changes, both of which contribute to food-seeking (or foraging or food finding) behavior. One is a change in sensory responses (for example, the change in gustatory neurons as shown by David Anderson and Kristin Scott, and the increased in the sensitivity of Or42b ORNs and the decrease in the sensitivity of Or85a ORNs shown by Jing Wang). Another of which is an increase in locomotion activity as shown in this study and the previous publications. Starvation-induced hyperactivity may simply facilitate food finding (by allowing a wider area to be scanned by the fly) while the targeting aspects are provided by a change in the chemosensory system.</italic> </p><p><italic>There is no evidence from this study that AKH or its receptor is required for anything beyond the hyperactivity. The fact that starved flies tend to accumulate around food and display a reduced walking speed (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) merely supports the notion that food (sugar in this experiment) consumption reduces the hyperactivity through the metabolic hormone insulin as shown in the current study that the AKHR-positive neurons also express InR. The findings of the current study are interesting, but they must be presented and discussed more conservatively and in context of what is already known in the field.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have toned down our interpretation and discussions of the behavioral data throughout the manuscript. We have now made it clear that starvation modulates food-seeking behavior in two ways (modulation of food perception and starvation-induced hyperactivity), and that the main focus of the present study is only about starvation-induced hyperactivity. We have largely eliminated the use of “food seeking” in the manuscript. We have also acknowledged the recent findings on food-seeking behavior more thoroughly.</p><p>More specifically:</p><p>In the Introduction section, we have followed the logic flow suggested by the reviewers: the importance and the regulation of food intake (Paragraph 1); the concept of food seeking, and how it is modulated by starvation in two ways (modulation of the chemosensory systems as well as locomotion) (Paragraph 2-3); the relationship between starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption (Paragraph 4); as well as a summary of the motivation and key findings of this present study (Paragraph 5).</p><p>Specifically, as suggested by the reviewers, we have summarized the recent findings on the modulation of olfactory and gustatory sensory neurons by starvation from Jing Wang, David Anderson, and Kristin Scott’s labs (Paragraph 2). Meanwhile, we have also discussed the previous reports on AKH and octopamine signaling in starvation-induced hyperactivity (Paragraph 3).</p><p>In the Results section, we have revised the interpretation of video-recording assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–H</xref>). We agree with the reviewers that these data did not really demonstrate that neuronal AKHR is required for food seeking, but rather provides an additional piece of evidence that neuronal AKHR is required for starvation-induced hyperactivity.</p><p>In the Discussion section, we have now clearly stated that starvation facilitates food seeking by modulating the perception of food cues and by enhancing the locomotion, and that the main focus of the present study is the latter (Paragraph 1).</p><p>Last but not least, we have revised our model to reflect all these changes mentioned above. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, starvation induces two separate behavioral responses, food consumption and food seeking, the latter of which can be further divided into the targeting component (perception of food cues) as well as the exploration component (hyperactivity). The focus of this present study, as highlighted in red, is only one of the several behavioral responses to starvation.</p><p><italic>Before the paper can be accepted, the authors must do a better job of addressing the following non-exhaustive list of issues focused on this major concern, which was also &quot;major comment #1&quot; in the previous decision letter.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Abstract. First sentence &quot;Starvation induces sustained increase in locomotion, which resembles food-seeking behavior and facilitates food localization and acquisition&quot;. This should be changed to &quot;Starvation induces a sustained increase in locomotion, which acts to facilitate food localization and acquisition&quot;.</italic> </p><p><italic>2) Introduction. &quot;We have also shown that starvation induced hyperactivity facilitates food localization and acquisition, partly resembling food-seeking behavior in flies&quot;. This needs to be revised accordingly (the &quot;partly resembling food-seeking behavior in flies&quot; phrase should be removed).</italic> </p><p>We have removed such statements throughout the manuscript. As suggested by the reviewers, we have now clearly stated that starvation induced two adaptive changes to facilitate food seeking: starvation-induced hyperactivity and starvation-induced changes in the perception of food cues. The focus of this current study is only around starvation-induced hyperactivity, while the progress on the modulation of chemosensory systems is also discussed in depth.</p><p><italic>3) In general, the Introduction should be revised to be more precise and scholarly. It should be framed around the concept that, food seeking behavior has sensory and locomotion aspects. For the sensory aspect, both olfactory and gustatory contributions must be included. The authors should also discuss the previous papers on AKH with the specific goal of discussing what is not known about the starvation-induced AKH-mediated hyperactivity.</italic> </p><p>We have now discussed the previous literature on the regulation of olfactory and gustatory sensory systems by starvation. We have also discussed the previous findings on AKH-producing cells and octopamine in starvation-induced hyperactivity.</p><p><italic>4) Title of the section &quot;Neuronal AKHR is required for starvation-induced food seeking&quot; needs to be changed accordingly. The whole section must be edited to deliver a consistent accurate and balanced message.</italic> </p><p>We have removed “starvation-induced food seeking” in that section. Along with the reviewers, we agree that the video-recording experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) provide an additional piece of evidence for the role of neuronal AKHR in starvation-induced hyperactivity.</p><p><italic>5) The Discussion section should also be revised in the same manner.</italic> </p><p>We have substantially revised the Discussion section, starting from describing the targeting (perception of food cues) and exploration (hyperactivity) components of food-seeking behavior, followed by the summary of our present study. We have also made it clear that our current study is only about the hyperactivity induced by starvation.</p><p><italic>6) Figure 8I shows that sNPF and NPF are only involved in food consumption. This is incorrect. Previous work has shown that both are involved in foraging behavior. The text should acknowledge that food seeking is separated into sensory and locomotion aspects.</italic> </p><p>We have revised the model (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>) to incorporate these valuable comments. Specifically, we have made it clear that starvation modulates food seeking in two ways: one for targeting (modulated perception of food cues) and the other for exploration (hyperactivity). We have also summarized recent findings on the targeting component of food-seeking behavior from Jing Wang, David Anderson, and Kristin Scott’s labs (including NPF and sNPF).</p></body></sub-article></article>
