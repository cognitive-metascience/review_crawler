Nodal signaling is essential for patterning of the AP axis while planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling polarizes cells with respect to this axis, but how these two signaling systems interact during C and E is unclear. We find that the neuroectoderm of Nodal-deficient zebrafish gastrulae exhibits reduced C and E cell behaviors, which require Nodal signaling in both cell- and non-autonomous fashions. PCP signaling is partially active in Nodal-deficient embryos and its inhibition exacerbates their C and E defects. Within otherwise naïve zebrafish blastoderm explants, however, Nodal induces C and E in a largely PCP-dependent manner, arguing that Nodal acts both upstream of and in parallel with PCP during gastrulation to regulate embryonic axis extension cooperatively.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>convergence &amp; extension</kwd><kwd>nodal</kwd><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>embryo</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99HD091386</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Margot L K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Solnica-Krezel</surname><given-names>Lilianna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nodal signaling regulates gastrulation cell behaviors largely in parallel with planar cell polarity signaling and is sufficient for ex vivo extension of embryonic explants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The embryonic body plan first emerges during gastrulation, when the three primordial germ layers — ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm — are formed and shaped, and embryonic axes are morphologically manifest. At this time, the anteroposterior (AP) body axis undergoes dramatic extension, a process that is essential for proper body plan formation and neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wallingford and Harland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson and Keller, 1999</xref>). Axial extension results from highly conserved convergence and extension (C and E) movements that simultaneously elongate tissues along the AP axis and narrow them in the orthogonal mediolateral (ML) dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Warga and Kimmel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>). This process is driven in vertebrate embryos by a combination of highly polarized cell behaviors, including mediolateral intercalation behavior (MIB) and directed migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Warga and Kimmel, 1990</xref>). MIB entails the ML alignment and elongation of cells and the acquisition of bipolar protrusive behavior through which cells intercalate in a polarized fashion between their anterior and posterior neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shih and Keller, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shih and Keller, 1992b</xref>).</p><p>This ML polarization of cells and their behaviors requires planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wallingford et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park and Moon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jessen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heisenberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kilian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Topczewski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tada and Smith, 2000</xref>). First discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this conserved signaling network is essential for collective polarity across cellular fields, within the plane of a tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vinson and Adler, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strutt and Strutt, 2005</xref>). Core PCP components acquire asymmetric distribution within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastock et al., 2003</xref>), with some becoming enriched at the anterior or posterior aspects of vertebrate cells as they undergo gastrulation movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roszko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciruna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yin et al., 2008</xref>). Because impairment of PCP signaling dramatically disrupts the polarized cell behaviors underlying axis extension but has little effect on patterning, it is thought to act as a molecular compass that allows cells to sense and/or respond to positional cues within the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gray et al., 2011</xref>). This implies the existence of a molecular mechanism by which patterning information is communicated to this compass, and ultimately to the cellular machinery that drives polarized C and E cell behaviors.</p><p>In contrast with vertebrate embryos, PCP signaling is not essential for axial extension in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which instead requires AP patterning that confers the striped expression of pair-rule genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</xref>). These in turn regulate the expression of Toll-like receptors in a partially overlapping striped pattern, comprising a positional code along the extending AP axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). AP patterning is similarly a prerequisite for extension of the gut tube in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and during <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ninomiya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johansen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2008</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ninomiya et al., 2004</xref> reported that <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrula explants with different AP positional values extend when apposed ex vivo, whereas those with the same positional identity do not. Notably, these positional values could be recapitulated in explants by different doses of the TGFβ ligand Activin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ninomiya et al., 2004</xref>), which signals largely via the Nodal signaling pathway during early vertebrate embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pauklin and Vallier, 2015</xref>). These results demonstrate that AP patterning is required for axial extension ex vivo and implies a crucial role for Nodal signaling at this intersection of tissue patterning and morphogenesis in vivo.</p><p>Nodal is a TGFβ-superfamily morphogen whose graded signaling within the embryo produces discrete developmental outcomes depending on a cell’s position within that gradient and the resulting signaling level/duration to which it is exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyson and Gurdon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gurdon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van Boxtel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubrulle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Schier, 2001</xref>). Upon binding of Nodal–Gdf3 (Vg1) heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelliccia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisgrove et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Montague and Schier, 2017</xref>), the receptor complex — comprised of two each of the Type I and Type II serine-threonine kinase receptors Acvr1b and Acvr2b and the co-receptor Tdgf — is activated and phosphorylates the downstream transcriptional effectors Smad2 and/or Smad3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gritsman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schier and Shen, 2000</xref>). Nodal signaling is essential for specification of endoderm and mesoderm germ layers and their patterning along the AP axis, with the highest signaling levels producing endoderm and the most dorsal/anterior mesoderm fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thisse et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gritsman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vincent et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dougan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feldman et al., 2000</xref>). Mouse embryos that are mutant for Nodal signaling components fail to gastrulate, resulting in early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conlon et al., 1994</xref>). Nodal-deficient zebrafish undergo highly abnormal gastrulation, failing to specify endoderm and most mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubrulle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gritsman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldman et al., 1998</xref>), resulting in embryos that are comprised largely of neuroectoderm and displaying severe neural tube and axis extension defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aquilina-Beck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonsar et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Restoration of mesoderm to maternal-zygotic <italic>one-eyed pinhead</italic> (MZ<italic>oep</italic>) zebrafish mutants, which lack the essential Tdgf Nodal co-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gritsman et al., 1999</xref>), improves AP axis length and the morphology of the neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araya et al., 2014</xref>), implying that Nodal promotes C and E of the neuroectoderm non-autonomously via specification of mesoderm. However, additional evidence points to a more direct role for Nodal signaling in C and E cell behaviors. First, Activin signaling via Nodal receptors is sufficient for C and E of <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ninomiya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Symes and Smith, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Howard and Smith, 1993</xref>) and for the underlying planar polarity of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shindo et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of two out of six <italic>Xenopus</italic> Nodal ligands disrupts C and E movements without affecting mesoderm specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luxardi et al., 2010</xref>). Nodal and Activin were also shown to promote translocation of the core PCP component Disheveled to cell membranes, suggesting that it acts upstream of PCP signaling activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ninomiya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trichas et al., 2011</xref>). Further evidence suggests that AP patterning is required in addition to PCP for C and E morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ninomiya et al., 2004</xref>), and while such patterning can be recapitulated by graded exposure of explants to Activin, it is not known whether Nodal and/or other signals play this role in vivo. Therefore, how Nodal interfaces with the PCP molecular compass during gastrulation remains to be determined.</p><p>Here, we investigate the role of Nodal signaling in C and E gastrulation movements in zebrafish. We demonstrate that defective C and E movements in the neuroectoderm of MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutant gastrulae are associated with reduced ML cell alignment and protrusive activity. Transplantation of mutant cells into the prospective neuroectoderm of wild-type (WT) embryos only partially restored their ML polarity during gastrulation, demonstrating both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous roles for Nodal in planar cell polarization. Surprisingly, MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> neuroectoderm cells exhibited normal, anteriorly biased localization of Prickle-GFP, a hallmark of PCP signaling activity. Consistent with active PCP signaling in the absence of Nodal, C and E defects in MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutants were exacerbated by interference with the core PCP component Vangl2. To examine further this cell-autonomous function of Nodal signaling in morphogenesis, we employed zebrafish blastoderm explantation to isolate the effects of Nodal from endogenous signaling centers of intact embryos. We found that, as for Nodal and Activin in <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap assays, expression of Nodal ligands was sufficient to induce robust, PCP-dependent ML cell polarization and C and E of naïve zebrafish blastoderm explants in culture. Treatment of explants with a Nodal inhibitor revealed a continuous requirement for Nodal signaling in ex vivo extension after mesoderm was specified and even in the absence of mesoderm, implying a primary, mesoderm-independent role for Nodal in C and E. Together, these data support a model in which Nodal signaling promotes ML cell polarity and C and E, both upstream and independent of PCP signaling, and predicts additional AP patterning mechanisms that instruct the PCP compass during vertebrate gastrulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nodal regulates C and E cell behaviors cell-autonomously and non-autonomously</title><p>Zebrafish embryos that are double mutant for the two <italic>nodal</italic>-related genes expressed during gastrulation, <italic>ndr1</italic> (<italic>sqt</italic>) and <italic>ndr2</italic> (<italic>cyc</italic>), or that lack both maternal and zygotic function of the co-receptor Tdgf (MZ<italic>oep<sup>–/</sup></italic><sup>﻿–</sup>) or the downstream effector Smad2, exhibit severe dorsolateral mesendoderm deficiencies and impaired AP extension of the enlarged neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubrulle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gritsman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, underlying cell behavior defects during gastrulation have not been fully characterized. We therefore analyzed cell movements in the dorsal region of WT and MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutants by time-lapse confocal microscopy for a period of three hours, beginning shortly after the onset of C and E movements (80% epiboly, 8.5 hr post-fertilization [hpf]). Automated tracking of fluorescently labeled nuclei in WT gastrulae revealed clear convergence of cells from lateral positions toward the dorsal midline, and concomitant extension along the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, top, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Analysis of cell velocities demonstrated that rates of cell movement were highest in the lateral-, anterior-, and posterior-most regions of the gastrula and lowest in the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top). This is consistent with mediolateral intercalation, which is characterized by a stationary point near the embryo’s equator and cell velocities that increase proportionally with their distance from this point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glickman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Concha and Adams, 1998</xref>).

We found that WT neuroectoderm cells were significantly more elongated than MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> cells throughout gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; p&lt;0.0001, Mann-Whitney tests). Unlike the marked ML alignment of WT cells that increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, blue), MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> cells were significantly less well aligned at both 8.5 and 10 hpf time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, purple) (p&lt;0.0001, K-S test). We then measured the orientation of cellular protrusions within the neuroectoderm of WT and MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> gastrulae using cell transplantation to achieve sparse labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–M</xref>). Protrusions made by WT cells exhibited a strong ML bias typical of MIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–M</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keller et al., 2000</xref>), whereas protrusions of MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> cells were essentially randomly oriented with a slight anterior bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–M</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate a severe disruption of C and E movements and polarized cell behaviors in MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutant gastrulae.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that axis extension can be largely rescued by restoration of mesoderm to MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araya et al., 2014</xref>), but the autonomy of Nodal signaling within the neuroectoderm has not been examined at the level of cell polarity. To determine whether Nodal regulates ML alignment cell-autonomously within the neuroectoderm, we transplanted membrane-labeled MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> cells into the prospective neuroectoderm of WT host embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). We then measured donor cell alignment at late gastrulation (10 hpf) and found that MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> cells within WT hosts were significantly less well aligned than WT control donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>; p&lt;0.0001, K-S test). At mid-gastrulation (8.5 hpf), some experiments showed that the alignment of MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> donor cells was not significantly different from that of WT donor cells in WT hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>), whereas other experiments indicated that MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> donor cells were significantly less well aligned than WT controls at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; p&lt;0.001, K-S test). Because cell alignment in unmanipulated WT gastrulae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) more closely resembles that of the WT control donors shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, we conclude that the alignment of MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> cells within WT hosts is reduced compared to WT control donors. Notably, mutant cells in WT host gastrulae were significantly better aligned than MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> cells in MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> hosts at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>) (p&lt;0.0001, K-S test). Orientation of MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/– </sup>cellular protrusions was also partially improved within WT hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–M</xref>), as the distribution of these protrusions differed significantly from that in MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> controls but did not align to the same degree as in WT cells (p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.0053, respectively, Chi-square test).

Although this suggests that Nodal signaling does not regulate PCP at the level of gene expression, we hypothesized that it could instead regulate the activity of these signaling components. We therefore assessed PCP signaling activity by examining the intracellular localization of the core PCP component Prickle fused to GFP (Pk-GFP), whose association with anterior cell membranes is indicative of PCP activation and polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciruna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yin et al., 2008</xref>), using transplantation to achieve sparse labeling of neuroectoderm cells. We found that WT cells (in WT hosts) and MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> cells (in MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> hosts) exhibited similar proportions of anteriorly localized Pk-GFP puncta, although MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutant cells contained significantly more membrane-associated puncta that were not anteriorly localized (chi-square, p=0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>), suggesting that PCP signaling is largely active in Nodal signaling-deficient gastrulae.</p><p>Because PCP signaling establishes planar polarity via intra- and inter-cellular interactions between its molecular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayly and Axelrod, 2011</xref>), we hypothesized that the partial ML polarization of MZ<italic>oep</italic><sup>–/–</sup> cells observed upon transplantation into WT hosts indicates the ability of Nodal-deficient cells to respond to host PCP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L, N</xref>).

Together with the mosaic analyses described above and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–N</xref>, these results reveal a cell-autonomous role for Nodal in ML cell polarization throughout gastrulation. Finally, we tested whether disrupting PCP signaling using a <italic>vangl2</italic> MO reduced axis extension in MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutant gastrulae.

To test whether Nodal is also sufficient for these behaviors, we sought to define the role of Nodal during axis extension in relative isolation, independent of other signaling and patterning events within the embryo. To this end, we employed blastoderm explantation, a technique that is used to excise only the animal-most region of the blastoderm from ~2.5 hpf zebrafish embryos, thereby isolating this region from endogenous signaling centers at the embryonic margin and producing clusters of relatively naïve cells that can be grown and manipulated in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sagerström et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schauer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trivedi et al., 2019</xref>).

Therefore, 10 pg <italic>ndr2</italic> was used for most subsequent experiments. Automated nuclear tracking within <italic>ndr2</italic>-expressing explants revealed patterns of cell movement that were characteristic of C and E by MIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>), with the axis of explant extension defined as ‘AP’ and the orthogonal axis as ‘ML’.

We also examined cell divisions within <italic>ndr2</italic>-expressing explants to address the possibility that differential proliferation contributes to ex vivo extension. Although divisions were preferentially localized along the axis of extension, they were not concentrated in any particular region of the explant, and the number of cell divisions detected at these stages was relatively small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The noncanonical Wnt/PCP signaling network is thought to act as a molecular compass that recognizes anterior and posterior cell edges in order to mediate ML cell polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gray et al., 2011</xref>). Although exogenous Wnt ligands were shown to reorient PCP components and planar cell polarity in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrulae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu and Sokol, 2016</xref>), it is unclear whether endogenous Wnt ligands, either exclusively or in cooperation with additional signals, orient the PCP compass in vivo. Additional mechanical cues such as tension at tissue boundaries and directional strain also regulate planar cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chien et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Williams et al., 2018</xref>), but how such cues are linked to axial patterning is not well understood. Here, using a combination of intact zebrafish gastrulae and an ex vivo model of axial extension, we have defined critical roles for the morphogen Nodal in regulating cell behaviors underlying C and E of the primary embryonic axis. Our findings support a model in which Nodal signaling promotes C and E cell behaviors both upstream of and in parallel with PCP signaling, while additional Nodal-independent mechanisms — likely AP patterning cues — polarize PCP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for the roles of PCP and Nodal signaling in C and E gastrulation movements.</title><p>In intact embryos (left), Nodal signaling acts largely in parallel with PCP signaling to regulate the ML cell polarization that underlies C and E. PCP signaling activity and localization of its components are regulated by an additional unknown signal(s) (X), and maintains residual polarizing activity in the absence of Nodal.

Indeed, we found that impaired C and E in the neuroectoderm of Nodal signaling-deficient gastrulae was associated with reduced ML cell polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), a phenotype also observed in PCP mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jessen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kilian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Topczewski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ulrich et al., 2003</xref>). We further found, as others have observed for Activin and Nodal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ninomiya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shindo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), that Nodal can induce both ML cell polarity and C and E in naïve explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, this ex vivo Nodal-induced C and E is strongly reduced when PCP signaling is disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), indicating that Nodal functions upstream of PCP signaling. However, additional in vivo evidence suggests a more complex interaction between these two signaling systems. We found that within Nodal-deficient MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutant gastrulae, transcripts encoding PCP signaling components were expressed at largely normal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the asymmetric intracellular localization of the core PCP component Prickle-GFP was only mildly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Finally, defects in C and E cell behaviors and axis extension, resulting from complete loss of Nodal signaling, were exacerbated by disrupted PCP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), providing additional evidence that PCP signaling remains active in the absence of Nodal. On the basis of these lines of evidence, we posit that Nodal is not absolutely required for the asymmetric distribution of this core PCP component nor for the transcriptional regulation of PCP genes in vivo, and plays only a minor role in regulating PCP signaling in intact embryos. Importantly, this indicates that Nodal is required for polarized C and E cell behaviors <italic>in addition to</italic> intact PCP signaling, rather than acting strictly upstream. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PCP and Nodal are each necessary – but not sufficient – for full ML polarization of cell behaviors underlying C and E, suggesting that Nodal functions largely in parallel with PCP in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). They also suggest that an additional signal (or signals) beyond Nodal instructs PCP signaling and the asymmetry of its components within the gastrula (‘X’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Results from explant experiments lead us to refined conclusions regarding the relationship between Nodal and PCP. Because 1) no cell polarity or C and E is observed in the absence of Nodal signaling in naïve blastoderm explants, 2) expression of Nodal ligands is sufficient to induce PCP-dependent ML cell polarization and C and E in the absence of other apparent patterning cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), and 3) this Nodal-induced ML cell polarization is strongly reduced by interference with PCP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we interpret these results as indicating that PCP functions wholly downstream of Nodal in this ex vivo context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that an additional non-Nodal signal regulates PCP in explants (‘X’), any such signal would also operate downstream of Nodal. It is also possible that ‘X’ functions strictly in parallel with Nodal in vivo, and that this signal is absent from the explant system.</p><p>C and E and cell polarization were reduced but not completely abolished in <italic>ndr2</italic>-expressing <italic>vangl2</italic> morphant explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), as is observed in intact <italic>trilobite/vangl2</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jessen et al., 2002</xref>). This may indicate that Nodal contributes to polarized cell behaviors ex vivo through an additional PCP-independent mechanism (‘Y’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), that knockdown of <italic>vangl2</italic> alone does not completely abolish PCP signaling, or a combination of both. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that PCP is a complex signaling network comprised of multiple functionally discrete modules, such that loss of one may not entirely disrupt PCP as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gray et al., 2011</xref>). For example, <italic>vangl2</italic> and <italic>gpc4</italic> compound zebrafish mutants have an additive C and E phenotype, implying that these two PCP components do not work in a simple linear pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marlow et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>scribble</italic> and <italic>vangl2</italic> were also recently reported to function in parallel with non-canonical Wnt ligands to align hair cells in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Navajas Acedo et al., 2019</xref>), reinforcing the notion of multiple modules under the larger PCP umbrella. This complexity raises the possibility that Nodal signaling regulates only a subset of PCP signaling modules. For instance, although Nodal is not strictly required for asymmetric localization of Pk-GFP or Vangl2-dependent cell polarity in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), it may regulate the localization/activity of other PCP modules or PCP-associated molecules.</p><p>The results reported here are consistent with, but expand significantly upon, previous models for the role of Nodal in gastrulation morphogenesis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ninomiya et al., 2004</xref> proposed that AP patterning by Nodal-related signals is required to orient the polarity of PCP signaling during C and E gastrulation movements. Although we similarly found that Nodal signaling is sufficient to induce both asymmetric patterning and PCP-dependent C and E, our genetic analyses indicate that Nodal is not strictly required for PCP polarization in vivo, and that the role of Nodal in C and E is not limited to AP patterning. Furthermore, although we observed asymmetric Nodal signaling in extending explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), it is not yet clear that this asymmetry is required for C and E cell behaviors. The source of this asymmetry is also unclear because the embryos were injected with <italic>ndr2</italic> RNA at the single-cell stage. We speculate that feed-back and feed-forward signaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Müller et al., 2012</xref>) may act to amplify small (and unavoidable) asymmetries in the distribution of injected RNAs. The importance of Nodal in axis extension has also been attributed to its ability to specify mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aquilina-Beck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonsar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araya et al., 2014</xref>), implying that Nodal-dependent mesoderm is required for C and E rather than Nodal signaling per se. We demonstrate here that Nodal contributes to ex vivo extension after mesoderm is specified and even in the absence of mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), arguing for a primary, mesoderm-independent role for Nodal in C and E in addition to its well-described mesoderm-dependent functions. Transcriptional targets of Nodal signaling that regulate C and E independently of either PCP or mesoderm formation (‘Y’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) remain largely unknown, and identification of these molecules will be an important goal for future studies.</p><p>The blastoderm explants described in this study provide a robust, simplified model of axial extension in which a signaling molecule of interest — in this case, Nodal — can be studied independently of endogenous patterning and signaling events. It has been shown that some methods of zebrafish blastoderm explantation do not require the addition of Nodal or any other signaling molecules to induce extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schauer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trivedi et al., 2019</xref>), but these explants are generated from the entire blastoderm and therefore contain signals (Nodal and otherwise) already present at the embryonic margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erter et al., 1998</xref>). By contrast, unmanipulated explants containing only the animal-most blastoderm are comparatively naïve, as they exclude endogenous signals from the margin, and fail to extend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sagerström et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schauer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trivedi et al., 2019</xref> [this work]), similar to classic <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Howard and Smith, 1993</xref>). Although explants from any species are a powerful tool, we must acknowledge ways in which this system differs from intact embryos. Namely, because explants do not contain the full complement of molecular signals and tissue interactions present in intact embryos, the contribution of additional signals to C and E may be masked by the reliance of explant extension on Nodal alone. This is illustrated by the function of PCP both downstream of and in parallel with Nodal in vivo, but strictly downstream of Nodal ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The absence of a yolk cell also dramatically alters the geometry of explanted tissues and removes signaling input from the extraembryonic yolk syncytial layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schauer et al., 2020</xref>). Despite these differences, explants exhibit a suite of complex, biologically relevant behaviors in common with intact embryos, including C and E morphogenetic movements, ML cell polarization, timing of C and E onset, and transcriptional responses to Nodal. These explants therefore provide a simplified platform that has allowed for new insights into the role of Nodal signaling in C and E morphogenesis and for dissection of its complex relationship with PCP. Although Nodal signaling functions wholly upstream of PCP-dependent ML planar polarity of cells ex vivo, in vivo it functions in an overlapping fashion and cooperates with PCP signaling, whose activity is regulated by additional, as yet unidentified, signaling events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

To measure cell orientation and elongation, the AP axis in all embryo images was aligned prior to manual outlining of cells. A fit ellipse was used to measure the orientation of each cell’s major axis and its aspect ratio. To assess Pk-GFP localization, isolated donor cells co-expressing Pk-GFP and H2B-RFP were scored according to the subcellular localization of GFP signal. Cell protrusions were manually detected within time-lapse stacks of transplanted neuroectoderm cells and their orientation measured in ImageJ. These orientations were binned into one of 12 sectors (30° each), which were categorized as mediolateral (within 60° of horizontal), anteroposterior (within 60° of vertical), or neither (the remaining 120°). The distribution of protrusions within each of these categories was then compared between experimental conditions using Chi-square tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Automated nuclear tracking</title><p>Imaris software and the ImageJ TrackMate plugin were used to detect and track labeled nuclei automatically in the dorsal hemisphere of WT and MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutant gastrulae and in embryonic explants injected with RNA encoding H2B-RFP, and to produce color-coded depictions of their trajectories and measurements of speed and displacement. Track displacement in the X (mediolateral) and Y (anteroposterior) dimensions were calculated independently, and plotted against their starting positions within the embryo/explant using Graphpad Prism 8 software. Cell divisions were manually detected within time-lapse stacks of explants from WT embryos co-injected with <italic>H2B-RFP</italic> and <italic>ndr2</italic> RNA, and their locations with respect to the center of each explant were measured using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-3"><title>Morphometric measurements</title><p>To measure the length/width ratios of explants, we divided the length of a segmented line drawn along the midline of each explant (accounting for curvature) by the length of a perpendicular line spanning the width of the explant near its midpoint.

Data were tested for normal distribution, and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney and Kolmogorov-Smirnov) were used for all non-normally distributed data. Normally distributed data with similar variance between groups were analyzed using parametric tests (T-tests). All tests used were two-tailed.

controls tissue specification, whereas Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling controls morphogenesis by regulating cell movements that elongate the anterior-posterior axis through convergent extension. This paper now provides strong evidence that both Nodal and PCP signaling participate in convergent extension. The authors found that Nodal signaling is necessary and sufficient to drive axis extension in zebrafish embryos and naive cell clumps, likely independently of its role in tissue specification. Together, these results support a revised model for the role of Nodal signaling in anterior-posterior axis formation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Nodal and Planar Cell Polarity signaling cooperate to regulate zebrafish convergence &amp; extension gastrulation movements&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Williams and Solnica-Krezel propose that Nodal and PCP signaling cooperate to regulate convergence and extension (CE) movements during zebrafish axis formation. The authors nicely show that the absence of Nodal signaling impairs extension and, to a lesser degree, also convergence movements of ectoderm. Moreover, they show that the cell alignments defects in Nodal signaling-deficient embryos are worsened by impaired PCP signaling. Similarly, the extension of blastoderm explants depends on the right dosage of Nodal signaling and is impaired in PCP signaling-deficient explants. The authors suggest that these results indicate that Nodal works both in parallel and upstream of PCP signaling in vivo. However, more evidence is needed to substantiate these claims.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The fact that the MZoep phenotype is worsened by the absence of Vangl2 indicates that both pathways are needed for ectoderm CE. Yet, it is not clear to what extent Nodal might also function upstream of PCP signaling. Especially, the evidence that PCP signaling is partially disrupted in MZoep mutants is not entirely convincing. To strengthen this conclusion, it would be good to test, for instance, (i) to what extent the MZoep CE phenotype can be rescued by PCP activation, and (ii) which aspect of PCP signaling (dynamic subcellular localization, expression level, turnover etc.) might partially depend on Nodal signaling.</p><p>2) If CE is affected by loss of Nodal activity, a widening of the neural plate would be expected similar to the findings for the <italic>vangl2</italic> MO. However, MZ<italic>oep</italic> embryos actually have narrower neural plates than WT (Figure 2E, F), undermining the proposal that Nodal regulates CE. Also, why are the markers in Figure 2E more intensely stained in MZ<italic>oep</italic> embryos compared to WT?</p><p>3) The statement &quot;Orientation of MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- cellular protrusions was also only partially improved within WT hosts (Figure 1I)&quot; is not supported and should be adjusted, since the graphs in Figure 1H and I look similar. The finding that MZ<italic>oep</italic> cells transplanted into wildtype hosts display nearly normal protrusion orientation is interesting. Does this depend on the polarization of the surrounding cells and would, for instance, wildtype ectoderm cells have a more random orientation of the protrusions when transplanted into MZ<italic>oep</italic>?</p><p>4) Using the blastoderm explants, the authors suggest that convergence movements in this ex vivo system depend on Nodal signaling and that Nodal acts upstream of PCP signaling. However, the extension of the explant or the alignments of the cells aren't necessarily a readout of convergence movements. To claim this, it would be necessary to show actual convergence movements of the cells. Is it possible that elongation is promoted by a general increase in cell movements or differential proliferation? Is Prickle-GFP localization polarized in explants? Furthermore, injection of Nodal ligands also induces the specification of endoderm and mesoderm, which are both lacking in the uninjected control. The activation of PCP signaling during the extension of the explant could be due to the presence of endoderm and mesoderm rather than due to the activity of Nodal signaling per se. Drug treatment to block Nodal signaling after acquisition of cell fate could be a possible experiment to discriminate whether continuous Nodal signaling activity is needed. The paper would also benefit from a clearer distinction between elongation and CE. This is crucial since the effect of Nodal could in principle be mostly on prechordal plate migration rather than CE.</p><p>5) Nodal acts highly locally, not in a widespread manner throughout the embryo (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Xu et al., 2014). How would Nodal regulate cell behavior far away in the neuroectoderm?</p><p>6) The conclusions rely on &quot;significant differences&quot; between experimental conditions determined by statistical tests. However, the effect sizes are often very small, and the variance within experimental groups is high. The low p values are a consequence of the very high sample numbers, but the biological significance of the determined effect sizes remains unclear. The authors should therefore apply bootstrapping or resampling methods using subsets from the data distributions to test whether the effect sizes are reproducible.</p><p>7) It is unclear why embryos uniformly injected with <italic>ndr2</italic> give rise to polarized explants. It would be good to show that the presence of asymmetry does not depend on asymmetric injection of Nodal ligands, e.g. by executing in situ hybridization stainings with probes for injected <italic>ndr2</italic> (perhaps with a GFP tag or the like to distinguish it from endogenously produced Nodals). If injected <italic>ndr2</italic> is uniformly distributed, is Nodal autoactivation required for polarization, i.e. what happens in MZ<italic>sqt</italic>;<italic>cyc</italic> embryos?</p><p>8) The authors state that &quot;Although the PCP genes <italic>wnt5b</italic>, <italic>vangl2</italic> (<italic>trilobite</italic>), and <italic>gpc4</italic> (<italic>knypek</italic>) were expressed at apparently normal levels in MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- gastrulae by whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B)&quot;, but the data does not show this; instead all genes seem to be upregulated in MZ<italic>oep</italic> embryos. Please adjust the conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54445.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The fact that the MZoep phenotype is worsened by the absence of Vangl2 indicates that both pathways are needed for ectoderm CE.

However, two pieces of data indicate that PCP signaling is somewhat perturbed in MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- gastrulae. First, whereas we show that WT and mutant cells exhibit comparable enrichment of Prickle-GFP at their anterior cell membranes, we also note that the mutant cells exhibit an increased proportion of Pk-GFP puncta that are not limited to anterior cell edges compared with WT (Figure 2A). This has proven to be our most reliable read-out of PCP signaling status during gastrulation, and demonstrates a mild PCP phenotype in Nodal-deficient mutants. Second, we have included new RNA-sequencing data directly comparing gene expression between stage matched MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- and WT embryos at 90% epiboly stage. Analysis of these data demonstrates that the expression of most PCP genes is unchanged in MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- compared to WTs, but the core PCP component <italic>prickle1b</italic> is significantly reduced in these mutants, again demonstrating a mild effect on PCP function. These data have been included as the new panel A in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and are described within the Results section.</p><p>Processed RNA-sequencing data are included as Source Data Files 1 and 2, and raw sequence data have been deposited within the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under GEO Accession Number: GSE147302. These data can be accessed by reviewers prior to publication using the Reviewer Key wveduewuxlknfmp.</p><p>Finally, our investigations of blastoderm explants indicate that PCP signaling functions downstream of Nodal in ML cell polarization and explant extension (Figure 5).</p><p>While we agree that it would be ideal to suppress the Nodal loss-of-function phenotype by activating PCP signaling, this experiment is not feasible to our knowledge. There are no reliable downstream targets of PCP signaling that can be reliably manipulated during gastrulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) If CE is affected by loss of Nodal activity, a widening of the neural plate would be expected similar to the findings for the vangl2 MO. However, MZoep embryos actually have narrower neural plates than WT (Figure 2E, F), undermining the proposal that Nodal regulates CE.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. The articles first describing the phenotypes of Nodal-deficient mutant zebrafish embryos (including MZ<italic>oep</italic>) note that extension is almost completely blocked, but that the other gastrulation movements of epiboly and convergence are intact (1, 2). As the reviewer points out, convergence of the neuroectoderm is apparent, but why this results in a narrower neural plate than WT is not known. Further, although convergence within MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutants doubtless occurs, previous reports demonstrate that the speed and persistence of converging neural plate cells within MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutants are significantly reduced compared to WTs at post-gastrulation stages (3), providing experimental evidence for disrupted convergence as well as extension. To better characterize convergence and extension movements in MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- gastrulae and compare them quantitatively to WTs, we have re-analyzed our 4D nuclear tracking data to evaluate cell displacement in the mediolateral (convergence) and anteroposterior (extension) dimensions independently. By plotting these directional displacement data against a cell’s position within the embryo, characteristic slopes emerged representing convergence and extension movements, respectively. We also quantified absolute displacement along each axis in embryos of each genotype. Such analysis revealed that, although convergence was still apparent in MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- mutants, cell displacement in the ML dimension was significantly reduced compared to WT. AP extension was also severely disrupted in terms of both absolute displacement and spatial organization of cell movements. These new analyses have been added to Figure 1 and are described within the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, why are the markers in Figure 2E more intensely stained in MZoep embryos compared to WT?</p></disp-quote><p>Our new RNA-seq data comparing WT and MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- gastrulae demonstrate that <italic>dlx3b</italic> is expressed at slightly higher levels in MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutants, which may account for stronger staining. This is further compounded by increased cell density resulting from reduced extension of the neuroectoderm in these mutants (2). We have included these RNA-seq expression data in the new panel D in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and discuss it briefly within the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The statement &quot;Orientation of MZoep-/- cellular protrusions was also only partially improved within WT hosts (Figure 1I)&quot; is not supported and should be adjusted, since the graphs in Figure 1H and I look similar. The finding that MZoep cells transplanted into wildtype hosts display nearly normal protrusion orientation is interesting. Does this depend on the polarization of the surrounding cells and would, for instance, wildtype ectoderm cells have a more random orientation of the protrusions when transplanted into MZoep?</p></disp-quote><p>To statistically analyze the orientation of protrusions, measured orientations were binned into one of 12 sectors (30° each, 360° total) which were then categorized as mediolateral (within 60° of horizontal), anteroposterior (within 60° of vertical), or neither (the remaining 120°). These bins have been color-coded on the rose diagrams of protrusive orientation in Figure 1M. The distribution of protrusions within each of these categories was then compared between experimental conditions using Chi-square tests. This analysis revealed that the distribution of protrusions in MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- cells transplanted into WT hosts differed significantly from both MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- to MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- controls (p&lt;0.0001) and WT to WT controls (p=0.0053), showing that while the polarity of their protrusions was improved by a WT environment, they did not align to the same degree as WT cells. These results are described within the Results section, and this analysis is further described in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>That MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- cells transplanted into the neuroectoderm of WT hosts exhibit significantly improved alignment of their cell bodies and orientation of protrusions indeed demonstrates a non-autonomous effect on planar cell polarization. While it would be interesting to know whether this is likewise true in the reciprocal experiment (WT donors in MZ<italic>oep</italic>-/- hosts), we hesitated to do this experiment because the results would be too difficult to interpret. When WT cells are transplanted into MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutants they tend to become mesoderm, and it would be difficult to confirm that donor cells were neuroectodermal (so as to compare “oranges with oranges”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Using the blastoderm explants, the authors suggest that convergence movements in this ex vivo system depend on Nodal signaling and that Nodal acts upstream of PCP signaling. However, the extension of the explant or the alignments of the cells aren't necessarily a readout of convergence movements. To claim this, it would be necessary to show actual convergence movements of the cells.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have performed automated 4D cell tracking within nuclear labeled explants both with and without ectopic <italic>ndr2</italic>. These data were analyzed in the same fashion as tracking data from intact embryos, and yielded remarkably similar results. Cell tracks within <italic>ndr2</italic>-expressing explants were observed moving inward from lateral positions while moving outward along the axis of extension, tell-tale signs of C&amp;E. Further, by graphing displacement along each axis against cell positions, we see slopes that are very similar to those in WT embryos, all highly suggestive of C&amp;E as the primary morphogenetic mechanism of explant extension. These data have been included as new panels G-K in Figure 3 and described within the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it possible that elongation is promoted by a general increase in cell movements or differential proliferation?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the possibility of differential or localized proliferation, we manually annotated cell divisions within time-lapse series of nuclear labeled explants and plotted their locations with respect to the center of each explant. We found that cell divisions were concentrated along the axis of extension, and although this may partially reflect the elongated shape of <italic>ndr2</italic>-expressing explants, it suggests a possible role for cell divisions in ex vivo extension. However, the number of cell divisions during these stages of ex vivo development is relatively small. Furthermore, an article recently published in <italic>eLife</italic> demonstrated that blocking cell divisions in zebrafish blastoderm explants did not prevent their extension (4). We also did not observe a “hotspot” of proliferation that would indicate a region of outgrowth. Together these data suggest that differential proliferation may play a small role in explant extension, but is unlikely to contribute substantially. These data are shown in a new figure supplement, Figure 3—figure supplement 2, and described in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is Prickle-GFP localization polarized in explants?</p></disp-quote><p>To evaluate Pk-GFP localization in intact embryos, sparse labeling was achieved by transplanting cells from embryos injected with RNA encoding Pk-GFP (and H2B-RFP) into host embryos. Due to their small size, such transplantations between explants were not feasible. As an alternative approach, we attempted to achieve sparse labeling in explants through mosaic injections into one of sixteen blastomeres, but failed to observe reliable Pk-GFP puncta.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, injection of Nodal ligands also induces the specification of endoderm and mesoderm, which are both lacking in the uninjected control. The activation of PCP signaling during the extension of the explant could be due to the presence of endoderm and mesoderm rather than due to the activity of Nodal signaling per se. Drug treatment to block Nodal signaling after acquisition of cell fate could be a possible experiment to discriminate whether continuous Nodal signaling activity is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We in fact already performed this exact experiment, which was included in the second, co-submitted manuscript addressing mesoderm-independent roles for Nodal in C&amp;E. Because this second manuscript was not recommended for publication, we moved these data into a new Figure 6 for the current revised manuscript. We indeed found that inhibition of Nodal signaling after mesoderm specification significantly reduces ex vivo extension, and further found that Nodal promotes extension of explants devoid of mesoderm marker expression. Together these results demonstrate that continuous Nodal signaling (per se) is required for full explant extension. This new Figure 6 is accompanied by 2 figure supplements, Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 2, and is described in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper would also benefit from a clearer distinction between elongation and CE. This is crucial since the effect of Nodal could in principle be mostly on prechordal plate migration rather than CE.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the distinction between extension and C&amp;E is important, as morphogenetic mechanisms other than C&amp;E certainly contribute to AP extension. However, we find it unlikely the prechordal plate (ppl) migration contributes to explant extension for the following reasons:</p><p>1) Highly extending explants from embryos injected with 10 pg of <italic>ndr2</italic> do not express markers for ppl, such as <italic>gsc</italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>2) We observed expression of <italic>gsc</italic> in explants from embryos injected with higher doses of <italic>ndr2</italic> (25-100pg), but this appears to be inversely correlated with their degree of extension (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), arguing against the notion that explant extension is driven by prechordal plate migration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Nodal acts highly locally, not in a widespread manner throughout the embryo (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Xu et al., 2014). How would Nodal regulate cell behavior far away in the neuroectoderm?</p></disp-quote><p>Van Boxtel at al., 2015 (5) demonstrate that there is low-level activation of downstream Nodal signaling within the zebrafish neural plate at gastrulation stages. Moreover, Sampath et al., 1998 (6), showed that <italic>cyc/ndr2</italic> is expressed in the axial mesoderm up to 90% epiboly – thus, just below the neuroectoderm undergoing C&amp;E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The conclusions rely on &quot;significant differences&quot; between experimental conditions determined by statistical tests. However, the effect sizes are often very small, and the variance within experimental groups is high. The low p values are a consequence of the very high sample numbers, but the biological significance of the determined effect sizes remains unclear. The authors should therefore apply bootstrapping or resampling methods using subsets from the data distributions to test whether the effect sizes are reproducible.</p></disp-quote><p>As in any complex living system, cell shape, alignment, and movements are (expectedly) highly variable within live embryos. This is why we have quantified – as the reviewer noted – a large number of cells and/or embryos for every experiment. However, we disagree that the resulting effect sizes are small or insignificant. Although the difference between an orientation of 20° and 45° may not sound substantial, it is the difference between a highly polarized (20°) and randomly oriented (45°) cell. And while not every cell in even a WT embryo will achieve this level of polarization, our statistics demonstrate that <italic>as a population,</italic> these cells are highly polarized and mutant cells are significantly less so. In the relevant figures, we included individual data points for all of our cell and explant measurements to be transparent about exactly how variable this type of data is. However, these plots can be misleading, and suggest, for example, that populations of cells are less well polarized than they are. To better represent differences between groups, in the revised manuscript we have changed our graphical representations of cell shape and alignment (in Figures 1, 2, and 5) to violin plots. Individual data points are still included, but we feel these plots more clearly illustrate the “shape” of each dataset as a whole and highlight important differences between them. One example is shown in Figure 1J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is unclear why embryos uniformly injected with ndr2 give rise to polarized explants. It would be good to show that the presence of asymmetry does not depend on asymmetric injection of Nodal ligands, e.g. by executing in situ hybridization stainings with probes for injected ndr2 (perhaps with a GFP tag or the like to distinguish it from endogenously produced Nodals).</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed speculate that small asymmetries resulting from injection are amplified by feed-back and feed-forward Nodal signaling (7), as it is not possible to ensure perfectly uniform distribution of injected RNA. This is because 1) we are injecting a small 1 nL volume into an embryo with a 600 mm diameter, and we will rarely hit the exact center, and 2) we have no control over cytoplasmic streaming, which distributes cytoplasm and injected RNAs between the cells of the early embryo. We have included a small section in the Discussion section describing this speculated source of asymmetry (fifth paragraph). While we are certainly curious to discover the origins of this asymmetry in future studies, we do not feel that how the asymmetry arises in any way affects our interpretation of the data presented nor any conclusions drawn therefrom.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If injected ndr2 is uniformly distributed, is Nodal autoactivation required for polarization, i.e. what happens in MZsqt;cyc embryos?</p></disp-quote><p>Although we speculate that in our injected experimental embryos Nodal may not be evenly distributed, we would be similarly excited to perform this experiment to dissect the role of Nodal autoactivation. However, given that this experiment would require the arduous task of germline transplantation to make MZ mutants, we had neither the time nor resources to complete it in a timely manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors state that &quot;Although the PCP genes wnt5b, vangl2 (trilobite), and gpc4 (knypek) were expressed at apparently normal levels in MZoep-/- gastrulae by whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B)&quot;, but the data does not show this; instead all genes seem to be upregulated in MZoep embryos. Please adjust the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have since included RNA-seq data demonstrating that most PCP genes, including <italic>wnt5b,vangl2</italic>, and <italic>gpc4</italic>, are expressed at normal levels in MZ<italic>oep</italic> mutants.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Feldman B, Gates MA, Egan ES, Dougan ST, Rennebeck G, Sirotkin HI, et al.
