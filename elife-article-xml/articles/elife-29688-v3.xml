We show this is not the case for hippocampal presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP<sub>pre</sub>), which is expressed as an increase in transmitter release probability (P<sub>r</sub>). We find that LTP<sub>pre</sub> can be induced by pairing pre- and postsynaptic spiking in the absence of glutamate signalling. LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction involves a non-canonical mechanism of retrograde nitric oxide signalling, which is triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, not postsynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs), and does not require glutamate release. When glutamate release occurs, it decreases P<sub>r</sub> by activating presynaptic NMDARs, and promotes presynaptic long-term depression. Net changes in P<sub>r</sub>, therefore, depend on two opposing factors: (1) Hebbian activity, which increases P<sub>r</sub>, and (2) glutamate release, which decreases P<sub>r</sub>. Accordingly, release failures during Hebbian activity promote LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction. Our findings reveal a novel framework of presynaptic plasticity that radically differs from traditional models of postsynaptic plasticity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29688.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses. One neuron at the synapse releases a chemical substance called a neurotransmitter, which binds to and activates the other neuron. The release of neurotransmitter thus enables the electrical activity of one cell to influence the electrical activity of another. The efficiency of this communication can change over time, as is thought to occur during learning. If the neurons on both sides of a synapse are repeatedly active at the same time, the ability of the neurons to transmit electrical signals to each other increases.</p><p>One way that communication between neurons can become more efficient is if the first neuron becomes more likely to release neurotransmitter. Most synapses in the brain release a neurotransmitter called glutamate, and most types of learning involve changes in the efficiency of communication at glutamatergic synapses. But glutamate release is unreliable. Active glutamatergic neurons fail to release glutamate about 80% of the time. If glutamate has a key role in learning, how does the brain learn efficiently when glutamate release is so unlikely?</p><p>To find out, Padamsey et al. studied glutamatergic synapses in slices of tissue from mouse and rat brains. When both neurons at a synapse were repeatedly active at the same time, the first neuron would sometimes become more likely to release glutamate. But this only happened at synapses in which the first neuron usually failed to release glutamate in the first place. This suggests that communication failures help to drive change at synapses. When two neurons that are often active at the same time do not communicate efficiently, this failure triggers molecular changes that make future communication more reliable.</p><p>Previous results have shown that synapses can change when glutamate release occurs. The current results show that they can also change when it does not. This means that the brain can continue to learn despite frequent communication failures between neurons. Many neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, show altered glutamate signalling at synapses. Padamsey et al. hope that a better understanding of this process will lead to new therapies for these disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>presynaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>LTP</kwd><kwd>LTD</kwd><kwd>NMDA receptors</kwd><kwd>L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channels</kwd><kwd>nitric oxide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emptage</surname><given-names>Nigel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emptage</surname><given-names>Nigel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological and optical analysis of neurotransmitter release at central synapses reveals that glutamate signalling is not required for the long-term potentiation (LTP) of presynaptic function, and instead only promotes presynaptic long-term depression (LTD).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Learning and memory are thought to require synaptic plasticity, which refers to the capacity for synaptic connections in the brain to change with experience. The most frequently studied forms of synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which respectively involve long-lasting increases and decreases in synaptic transmission. LTP and LTD can be expressed either postsynaptically (LTP<sub>post</sub> or LTD<sub>post</sub>), as changes in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) number, or presynaptically (LTP<sub>pre</sub> or LTD<sub>pre</sub>), as changes in glutamate release probability (P<sub>r</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Padamsey and Emptage, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bliss and Collingridge, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Larkman and Jack, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lisman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lisman and Raghavachari, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>). Traditionally, postsynaptic NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation is believed to be important for both pre- and postsynaptic forms of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bliss and Collingridge, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lüscher and Malenka, 2012</xref>). Postsynaptic changes, in particular, have been causally and convincingly linked to NMDAR-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which, via the activation of postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive kinases and phosphatases, triggers changes in the number of synaptic AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lüscher and Malenka, 2012</xref>). The link between postsynaptic NMDAR activation and presynaptic plasticity, however, is less clear. In the case of LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction, it is traditionally thought that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through postsynaptic NMDARs triggers the synthesis and release of a retrograde signal, most likely nitric oxide (NO), which in turn triggers increases in P<sub>r</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garthwaite and Boulton, 1995</xref>) (though other forms of presynaptic plasticity exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yang and Calakos, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castillo, 2012</xref>]). Consistent with this, several studies have demonstrated that LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction is impaired by the blockade of NMDAR or NO signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ryan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ratnayaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emptage et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bliss and Collingridge, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Enoki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nikonenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stanton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnstone and Raymond, 2011</xref>). However, some groups have found that presynaptic enhancement can be induced in the presence of NMDAR antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blundon and Zakharenko, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zakharenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayazitov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zakharenko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stricker et al., 1999</xref>) (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grover and Yan, 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grover, 1998</xref>]). Under these conditions, presynaptic plasticity relies on L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (L-VGCC) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blundon and Zakharenko, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zakharenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayazitov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zakharenko et al., 2001</xref>), but may still depend on NO signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pigott and Garthwaite, 2016</xref>). These findings suggest that LTP<sub>pre</sub> may require neither the activation of postsynaptic NMDARs nor NMDAR-dependent NO synthesis; nonetheless, results across studies are largely inconsistent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">(Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>), and the exact mechanism and retrograde signal underlying LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction remains unclear.</p><p>The role of glutamate signalling in presynaptic plasticity is also unclear. Glutamate release is of course necessary to drive the postsynaptic depolarization required for the induction of both LTP<sub>pre</sub> and LTP<sub>post</sub>. However, this does not explain why any given synapse needs to release glutamate in order to be potentiated, since depolarization triggered by one synapse can affect another, either directly via electrotonic spread, or indirectly via the actions of dendritic or somatic spikes. The necessity for site-specific glutamate release in LTP induction, at least in the case of LTP<sub>post</sub>, is instead imposed by the strict requirement of postsynaptic NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx for potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bliss and Collingridge, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lüscher and Malenka, 2012</xref>). However, that NMDARs may not to be necessary for the induction of LTP<sub>pre</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blundon and Zakharenko, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>) suggests that the role of synapse-specific glutamate release in presynaptic plasticity may be different. Indeed, a common finding across a number of studies is that high P<sub>r</sub> synapses are more likely to show LTD<sub>pre</sub>, whereas low P<sub>r</sub> synapses are more likely to show LTP<sub>pre</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ryan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Slutsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Larkman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hardingham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sáez and Friedlander, 2009</xref>). Moreover, glutamate release can induce LTD<sub>pre</sub> by acting on presynaptic NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McGuinness et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2013</xref>), or metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the case of younger tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zakharenko et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, enhanced glutamate release at a presynaptic terminal, unlike at a dendritic spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lüscher and Malenka, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harvey and Svoboda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Makino and Malinow, 2009</xref>), may not necessarily result in enhanced potentiation, but instead promote depression. Several studies have also demonstrated that presynaptic terminals initially releasing little or no glutamate are reliably potentiated following tetanic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ryan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emptage et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Slutsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Larkman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hardingham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sáez and Friedlander, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McGuinness et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Enoki et al., 2009</xref>). How low P<sub>r</sub> synapses, including those that are putatively silent, can undergo activity-dependent potentiation raises questions as to the necessity of synapse-specific glutamate release in presynaptic plasticity.</p><p>Here we re-examined the mechanisms underlying activity-dependent presynaptic changes at CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses, with a particular focus on understanding the role of glutamate in presynaptic plasticity. We find that, contrary to current thinking, Hebbian activity, via L-VGCC-triggered NO signalling, is sufficient to induce LTP<sub>pre</sub> without the need for synapse-specific signalling by glutamate. When glutamate release occurs, it inhibits LTP<sub>pre</sub> and instead promotes LTD<sub>pre</sub> by activating presynaptic NMDARs. Thus, for presynaptic potentiation to occur, a presynaptic neuron must not only fire together with its postsynaptic partner, but it must also fail to release glutamate. Our findings reveal a novel set of rules and mechanisms governing presynaptic plasticity that are distinct from those associated with traditional, postsynaptic models of plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High frequency presynaptic activity inhibits LTP<sub>pre</sub> and promotes LTD<sub>pre</sub></title><p>We started by examining how manipulating glutamatergic signalling at synapses would affect activity-driven changes in presynaptic function. We recorded excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in CA1 neurons in cultured hippocampal slices. Cells were recorded using patch electrodes (4–8 MΩ) and EPSPs were evoked by Schaffer-collateral stimulation. Baseline EPSP recordings were kept short (5 min) to minimize dialysis as we found that longer baseline recordings prevented LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction (see Materials and methods). For LTP induction we used a pairing protocol, in which individual presynaptic stimuli were causally paired with postsynaptic spiking, 60 times at 5 Hz. Because LTP<sub>pre</sub> is preferentially induced under conditions of strong postsynaptic depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blundon and Zakharenko, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zakharenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayazitov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zakharenko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stricker et al., 1999</xref>), we paired presynaptic stimuli with a current injection of sufficient amplitude to generate 3–6 postsynaptic spikes over a 50–60 ms time course.

To do so, we used glutamate uncaging instead of high-frequency presynaptic stimulation to artificially elevate P<sub>r</sub> at synapses during LTP induction. Glutamate uncaging was restricted to single synapses, and activity-dependent changes in presynaptic function (i.e. P<sub>r</sub>) were assessed by imaging postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emptage et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Emptage et al., 1999</xref>).

P<sub>r</sub> was calculated as the proportion of trials in which the first of the two presynaptic stimuli generated a fluorescent increase in the spine head; the second of the two presynaptic stimuli was ignored.

We then repeated the experiment but this time, during LTP induction, each presynaptic stimulus was coupled with photolysis of caged glutamate at the synapse, regardless of whether the synapse released glutamate or not, in order to artificially elevate P<sub>r</sub> during stimulation. We adjusted the laser power to ensure that photolysis mimicked the fluorescent changes elicited by uniquantal glutamate release evoked by single presynaptic stimuli (ΔF/F; photolysis vs. stimulation: 0.46 ± 0.07 vs. 0.55 ± 0.09; n = 15 spines; p=0.23; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

This demonstrates that, consistent with our hypothesis, transiently elevating glutamate signalling at synapses inhibited the induction of LTP<sub>pre</sub>. In eight of the synapses imaged under these conditions, LTP induction was repeated for a second time, but in the absence of caged glutamate during photolysis; in these experiments, the expected increase in P<sub>r</sub> was observed (ΔP<sub>r</sub>: 0.23 ± 0.02; n = 8 spines; vs. control: p=0.48; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Biii</xref>, post-photolysis control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of photolysis on P<sub>r</sub> was due to glutamate release, as opposed to non-specific effects of uncaging.</p><p>We also examined the effects of glutamate photolysis delivered in the absence of postsynaptic depolarization (unpaired stimulation). Delivery of 60 presynaptic stimuli at 5 Hz, consistent with our electrophysiological recordings, produced no changes in P<sub>r</sub> at the majority of synapses imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E,F</xref>). We did, however, notice that synapses with initially high release probabilities (P<sub>r</sub> &gt;0.5), showed a modest decrease in P<sub>r</sub> following unpaired stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>); this decrease was not likely to be detected by electrophysiological recordings because high P<sub>r</sub> synapses comprise an estimated &lt;10% of synapses in our preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ward et al., 2006</xref>).

Physiologically, glutamate is clearly necessary for driving the postsynaptic spiking required for LTP, and all major classes of glutamate receptors including: AMPARs, Kainate receptors (KARs), NMDARs, and mGluRs can contribute to membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grienberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schiller and Schiller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grover and Yan, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chemin et al., 2003</xref>). If, however, membrane depolarization is the only function of glutamate in LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction, then a presynaptic terminal could in principle be potentiated even if it failed to release glutamate, provided that its activity coincided with strong postsynaptic depolarization, as driven by glutamate release at other co-active synapses. If this is the case, we reasoned that we should be able to experimentally trigger LTP<sub>pre</sub> in a full glutamate receptor blockade provided that, during presynaptic stimulation, we supplemented the depolarizing effects of glutamate with somatic current injection. If, however, glutamate is additionally required for some form of synapse-specific signalling, as in the case of LTP<sub>post</sub> induction, then the induction of LTP<sub>pre</sub> should not be possible in full glutamate receptor blockade no matter how much we depolarize the neuron during presynaptic stimulation.</p><p>To test this possibility we attempted to induce LTP<sub>pre</sub> at CA3-CA1 synapses with all known glutamate receptors (AMPARs, KARs, NMDARs, and mGluRs) pharmacologically inhibited (10 µM NBQX, 100 µM D-AP5, 0.5 mM R,S-MCPG, 100 µM LY341495); we used AP5 instead of MK-801 in order to block both ionotropic and metabotropic effects associated with NMDAR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nabavi et al., 2013</xref>). Given the additional time required for these experiments, we recorded from CA1 neurons using high-resistance patch electrodes (18–25 MΩ) to limit the effects of postsynaptic dialysis. Following pharmacological abolishment of the EPSP, we delivered paired stimulation as before, during which strong postsynaptic depolarization again took the form of a complex spike induced by somatic current injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The antagonist cocktail was then washed out in order to recover the EPSP. As expected with the use of high concentrations of NBQX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holbro et al., 2010</xref>), EPSP recovery was never complete and varied across experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), and so it was necessary to compare the EPSP recorded from the pathway receiving paired stimulation to a second, independent control pathway recorded simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). We found that paired stimulation induced a robust enhancement of the EPSP in the stimulated pathway relative to the control pathway (fold ΔEPSP<sub>slope</sub>; paired vs. control: 1.12 ± 0.13 vs. 0.71 ± 0.12; n = 7 cells; p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>); this enhancement was not seen when pairings were anti-causal, with presynaptic stimuli following postsynaptic spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> ). Causal pairings resulted in a 1.72 ± 0.21 fold potentiation, which we estimated by normalizing the fold change in the EPSP of the paired pathway to that of the control pathway. Notably, EPSP recovery of the control pathway was not significantly different from experiments in which drugs were applied in the absence of paired stimulation (control vs. drugs-only: 0.71 ± 0.12 vs. 0.54 ± 0.11; n = 7, 5 cells; p=0.59; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), suggesting that LTP was restricted to only synapses that were active during the pairing.

The NMDARs are particularly potent sources of depolarization, especially given their role in dendritic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schiller and Schiller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>) and somatic spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grienberger et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is possible that NMDAR blockade inhibits LTP<sub>pre</sub> expression by inhibiting postsynaptic depolarization. This is less likely to be an issue when strong postsynaptic depolarization is driven via somatic current injection, as in our experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), than when depolarization is driven by presynaptic stimulation alone (e.g. tetanic stimulation). To test this reasoning, we induced LTP using standard 100 Hz tetanic stimulation to drive postsynaptic spiking. This protocol produced robust potentiation of the recorded EPSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,D</xref>), and an increase in presynaptic efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>). As in previous studies, NMDAR inhibition with AP5 abolished LTP induction, including its presynaptic component of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B,D</xref>). However, we found that if we augmented the levels of postsynaptic depolarization by current injection during tetanic stimulation, then LTP induction in AP5 was rescued, at least presynaptically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,E</xref>). These findings suggest that the importance of postsynaptic NMDAR signalling in LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction is to provide a source of depolarization rather than any necessary source of synapse-specific signalling. These findings also underscore the importance of taking the level of postsynaptic depolarization into consideration when LTP is induced following the blockade of one or more glutamate receptor class.</p><p>Collectively, our findings suggest that the role of glutamate signalling (including postsynaptic NMDAR signalling) in LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction is to drive postsynaptic depolarization.

Given the poor signal-to-noise ratio associated with DAF-FM imaging, we drove strong postsynaptic depolarization by elevating extracellular K<sup>+</sup> to 45 mM, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sattler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stanika et al., 2012</xref>). Under these conditions, we observed increases in fluorescence in neuronal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). These increases were dependent on NO synthesis as they could be prevented by postsynaptic injection of cPTIO (ΔF/F; control vs. cPTIO: 0.38 ± 0.04 vs. −0.03 ± 0.05; n = 5 cells/condition; p&lt;0.05) or bath application of the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME (ΔF/F: 0.00 ± 0.05; n = 5 cells; vs. control: p&lt;0.05).

We found that with 600 complex spikes, the accumulated NO signal in the dendritic arbour was sufficiently large to detect by our setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>).

To address this, we examined whether increases in P<sub>r</sub> could be elicited when presynaptic stimulation was paired with rapid photolytic release of NO (0.5–1 mM RuNOCl<sub>3</sub>), in the absence of postsynaptic depolarization. We used Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to determine basal P<sub>r</sub> at a single synapse. We then paired 30–60 presynaptic stimuli, delivered at 5 Hz in full glutamate receptor blockade, with brief photolysis of NO, which was targeted to the spine head in order to emulate postsynaptic NO release. As with our standard LTP induction protocol, pairing was causal, with each NO photolysis event timed to occur 7–10 ms after each presynaptic stimulus. Under these conditions, we found significant increases in P<sub>r</sub> when assessed 30 min post-pairing (ΔP<sub>r</sub>: 0.29 ± 0.07; n = 10 spines; p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>).

We loaded CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute slices with caged NO (100 µM RuNOCl<sub>3</sub>) while recording EPSPs in the presence of AP5. Wide-field photolysis was triggered using a 1 ms flash from a UV lamp. Causal pairings of presynaptic activity with photolysis resulted in an enhancement of the EPSP and a decrease in PPR. These increases were absent when pairings were anti-causal, or when pairings occurred in the presence of cPTIO, which instead resulted in a modest depression of the EPSP.

We have previously reported functional and immunohistological evidence for the existence of presynaptic NMDARs at CA3-CA1 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McGuinness et al., 2010</xref>); notably, these receptors act as reliable detectors for uniquantal glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McGuinness et al., 2010</xref>), and have been implicated in LTD<sub>pre</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Min and Nevian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrade-Talavera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sjöström et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore examined whether glutamate was acting on these receptors to drive decreases in presynaptic efficacy. Given the difficulties associated with selectively blocking pre-, as opposed to post-, synaptic NMDARs, several groups have investigated the role of presynaptic NMDARs in plasticity by comparing the effects of bath application of AP5 or MK-801, which blocks both pre- and postsynaptic NMDARs, with that of intracellular MK-801 application, which selectively blocks postsynaptic NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corlew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corlew et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cormier and Kelly, 1996</xref>). We sought to use a similar approach. However, because MK-801 does not readily washout, and since postsynaptic NMDARs greatly contribute to spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grunditz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Emptage et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holbro et al., 2010</xref>), we first examined whether the permanent loss of postsynaptic NMDAR signalling affected our ability to measure P<sub>r</sub> using postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. We found that at about 50% of synapses, NMDAR blockade reduced, but did not entirely abolish synaptically-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). The residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were mediated by activation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) in response to AMPAR-mediated depolarization, and could be used to accurately measure P<sub>r</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Importantly, the average P<sub>r</sub> of these synapses did not significantly differ from that of synapses lacking a residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in NMDAR blockade (ΔP<sub>r</sub>; AP5-sensitive vs. AP5-insensitive: 0.42 ± 0.07 vs. 0.47 ± 0.11; n = 8 spines/condition; p=0.67; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). These findings suggest that, in NMDAR receptor blockade, VGCC-dependent spine-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx can be used as a means of calculating P<sub>r</sub> at a sizeable and representative proportion of presynaptic terminals; nonetheless the use of VGCC-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients presents an inevitable selection bias in our study.</p><p>Using VGCC-dependent spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, we found that when both pre- and postsynaptic NMDARs were blocked by bath application of either AP5 or MK-801, paired stimulation triggered increases in P<sub>r</sub> (ΔP<sub>r</sub>: 0.34 ± 0.03; n = 18 spines) that were not significantly different from those produced in full glutamate receptor blockade (p&gt;0.99), but that were greater than increases in P<sub>r</sub> produced under control conditions (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>).

Notably, bath application of MK-801 produced similar effects as AP5, suggesting that the effects of NMDARs on P<sub>r</sub> are associated with its ionotropic, rather than metabotropic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nabavi et al., 2013</xref>) (ΔP<sub>r</sub>; bath MK-801 vs. AP5 paired stimulation: 0.33 ± 0.04 vs. −0.32 ± 0.03; n = 8,9 spines; p=0.47; bath MK-801 vs. AP5 unpaired stimulation: 0.00 ± 0.03 vs. −0.04 ± 0.03; n = 8,9 spines; p=0.27; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>)</p><p>To then specifically block postsynaptic NMDARs, we bolus-loaded cells intracellularly with MK-801 (see Materials and methods).

Collectively, these results suggest that glutamate release acts on pre-, but not post-, synaptic NMDARs to drive long-lasting decreases in P<sub>r</sub> observed during both paired and unpaired stimulation.

Based on our findings we present an entirely novel framework of presynaptic plasticity in which changes in P<sub>r</sub> at active presynaptic terminals are driven by two processes: (1) Hebbian activity, which promotes increases in P<sub>r</sub> via L-VGCC- and NO- dependent signalling, and (2) glutamate release, which promotes decreases in P<sub>r</sub> via presynaptic NMDAR activation. Both processes operate together to tune presynaptic function during synaptic activity, with net changes in P<sub>r</sub> depending on the strength of each process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29688.026</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of presynaptic plasticity.</title><p>Changes in P<sub>r</sub> at active presynaptic terminals are determined by two opponent processes. (1) Increases in P<sub>r</sub> are driven by Hebbian activity, during which strong postsynaptic depolarization triggers the release of NO from neuronal dendrites. NO synthesis is dependent on NO synthase (NOS), activation of which is triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through L-VGCCs. Importantly, NO drives an increase in P<sub>r</sub>, but only at presynaptic terminals whose activity precedes its release. The detection of such an event requires an unidentified Hebbian detector (Δt) that is sensitive to the relative timings of NO release and presynaptic activity. (2) Decreases in P<sub>r</sub> are driven by glutamate release, via presynaptic NMDAR signalling. Net changes in P<sub>r</sub> depend on the strength of each process, and therefore on the amount of Hebbian signalling and glutamate release present during synaptic activity.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29688-fig9-v3"/></fig><p>Consistent with this model, we found that when glutamate release was made reliable, either by presynaptic burst stimulation or by glutamate photolysis, Hebbian activity failed to drive net increases in P<sub>r</sub>. Consequently, for presynaptic potentiation to occur, a presynaptic neuron must not only fire together with its postsynaptic partner, but it must also fail to release glutamate.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Experimental techniques</title><p>Our study is robust because we examine presynaptic plasticity under a diverse range of experimental conditions. We used both Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and PPR to assess presynaptic plasticity in cultured and acute hippocampal slices using a number of pharmacological and genetic manipulations. With such diverse experimental techniques, preparations, and manipulations, we found consistent support for the proposed model of presynaptic plasticity.</p><p>PPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging are markedly different techniques to assess presynaptic efficacy, each with its own assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging provides a powerful means to monitor P<sub>r</sub> at single synapses in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Padamsey and Emptage, 2011</xref>). The excellent signal-to-noise with which this technique can be used to detect uniquantal glutamate release makes P<sub>r</sub> estimates robust to large changes in postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Indeed, either removal of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) or bath application of AP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which more than doubles or halves the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient respectively, has no effect on P<sub>r</sub> calculations made at resting membrane potential. Nonetheless, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging may bias synapse selection, particularly in favour of synapses producing large Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Padamsey and Emptage, 2011</xref>). Such selection bias, conversely, is absent in PPR calculations, which reflect aggregate changes in P<sub>r</sub> over a larger number of stimulated synapses. However, PPR is an indirect measures of P<sub>r</sub>, and may be confounded by factors such as postsynaptic receptor desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yang and Calakos, 2013</xref>); though, not at the interpulse intervals used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai and Lynch, 1998</xref>). Despite these caveats, in our study, results from PPR measurements and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging were consistent with one another across a range of experimental conditions, making it unlikely that our assessment of presynaptic plasticity was confounded. Both of these techniques, therefore, present valid means of measuring presynaptic efficacy, at least in the context of this study. </p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>LTP<sub>pre</sub> can occur in the absence of glutamate receptor signalling</title><p>The proposed model provides a mechanism by which presynaptic terminals releasing little or no glutamate can become potentiated provided that their activity is accompanied by strong postsynaptic depolarization. Notably, most central synapses have low glutamate release probabilities, with some synapses appearing to release no glutamate in response to presynaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Voronin and Cherubini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stevens, 2003</xref>). This is true for synapses recorded in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> preparations from young and adult rodents. In fact, under electron microscopy, a significant portion of synapses (up to 35–50%) in the adult rodent hippocampus have presynaptic zones lacking synaptic vesicles in their near proximity (&lt;170 nm); these so-called ‘nascent zones’ have been hypothesized to be functionally silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell et al., 2014</xref>). Although the existence of <italic>bona fide</italic> presynaptically silent synapses remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Voronin and Cherubini, 2004</xref>), the low release probabilities (average P<sub>r</sub> of approximately 0.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murthy et al., 1997</xref>]) of central synapses suggests that it is possible that activity at a presynaptic terminal may not elicit glutamate release at the synapse, but may still coincide with strong postsynaptic depolarization, driven by glutamate release at other co-active synapses. Under such conditions, the mechanisms proposed in this study could enable presynaptic induction of Hebbian potentiation at these synapses.</p><p>Our finding that presynaptic enhancements can occur without glutamatergic signalling at the synapse raises the question as to why many studies show that LTP induction can be abolished or impaired by blockade of one or more glutamate receptor subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holbro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collingridge et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bashir et al., 1993</xref>). To address this question, it is first necessary to recognize that not all LTP induction protocols are associated with presynaptic enhancements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>). This is because LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction requires higher levels of postsynaptic depolarization than LTP<sub>post</sub> induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zakharenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayazitov et al., 2007</xref>). Whether presynaptic enhancements are obtained will therefore depend on the levels of postsynaptic depolarization achieved during LTP induction, which in turn will be influenced by a variety of experimental factors, including the frequency and intensity of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, even studies reporting LTP<sub>pre</sub> also find that inhibition of glutamate receptors, in particular NMDARs, abolish or reduce presynaptic enhancements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ryan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ratnayaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emptage et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bliss and Collingridge, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Enoki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nikonenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stanton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zakharenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayazitov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zakharenko et al., 2001</xref>). In such cases it is important to recognize that AMPARs, KARs, NMDARs, and mGluRs can all contribute to postsynaptic depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grienberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schiller and Schiller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grover and Yan, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chemin et al., 2003</xref>). Given that presynaptic changes rely on the voltage-dependent release of NO, it is possible that blockade of any of these glutamate receptor classes would abolish or reduce LTP<sub>pre</sub> in an indirect way, by reducing postsynaptic depolarization and the activation of L-VGCCs. This may explain, in part, why experimental manipulations that augment the levels of postsynaptic depolarization reliably rescue LTP in AMPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holbro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fuenzalida et al., 2010</xref>), NMDAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grover and Teyler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zakharenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayazitov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zakharenko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kullmann et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grover et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Morgan and Teyler, 2001</xref>), and mGluR blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wilsch et al., 1998</xref>). Critically, our LTP induction protocol used strong postsynaptic depolarization, which was elicited by somatic current injection, and therefore independent of synaptic activity. This circumvented the need for any glutamate receptor-dependent depolarization during paired stimulation and enabled us to directly assess the function of glutamate signalling in LTP<sub>pre</sub>, independent of its effects on postsynaptic depolarization. Based on these results, we argue that the physiological role of glutamate release in LTP<sub>pre</sub> is for driving postsynaptic spiking as opposed to conveying a synapse-specific signal; this contrasts with the role of glutamate release in postsynaptic plasticity, in which synapse-specific activation of postsynaptic NMDARs is necessary for LTP<sub>post</sub> induction. </p><p>While our approach for inducing LTP resembles that of traditional STDP protocols, which rely on NMDAR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dan and Poo, 2004</xref>), there are two key differences. Firstly, in our study, postsynaptic depolarization took the form of complex spikes, which included a brief period (7–10 ms) depolarization before the first spike (see Materials and methods). This period of subthreshold depolarization is known to facilitate the induction of LTP, possibly by inactivating voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels within the dendrite, which otherwise impede action potential backpropagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Watanabe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gasparini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoffman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Johnston et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Migliore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sjöström and Häusser, 2006</xref>). Secondly, like complex spikes recorded <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ranck, 1973</xref>), the spike trains we triggered contained broadened action potentials, which likely reflect strong depolarization in the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoffman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Migliore et al., 1999</xref>). Consequently, the postsynaptic waveforms used in our study were likely to generate greater levels of postsynaptic depolarization, and in a manner independent of glutamate release and NMDAR activation, than those used in traditional STDP studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>LTP<sub>pre</sub> requires nitric oxide signalling</title><p>It has long been recognized that the induction of LTP<sub>pre</sub> requires a retrograde signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Williams et al., 1989</xref>). One promising candidate is NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garthwaite and Boulton, 1995</xref>). The role of NO in plasticity has been a source of much controversy, and some studies have concluded that NO signalling is not necessary in LTP induction (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>]). However, given that NO is likely to be important for presynaptic strengthening, the effect of NO signalling on synaptic plasticity will depend on whether presynaptic enhancements are obtained following LTP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Padamsey and Emptage, 2014</xref>). Indeed, studies that actually confirm presynaptic changes following LTP induction, including our own, consistently demonstrate that presynaptic enhancements depend on the synthesis and release of NO in both acute and cultured hippocampal preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ratnayaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nikonenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stanton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnstone and Raymond, 2011</xref>).</p><p>It has generally been assumed that NO synthesis is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from postsynaptic NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garthwaite and Boulton, 1995</xref>); however, several studies, including our own, have demonstrated that induction of LTP<sub>pre</sub> is possible in NMDAR blockade, suggesting that a NMDAR-dependent NO signalling pathway is not required for LTP<sub>pre</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zakharenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayazitov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zakharenko et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we provide direct evidence for an alternative pathway for NO synthesis that is crucial for presynaptic strengthening, and that is driven by strong postsynaptic depolarization via the activation of L-VGCCs. Why L-VGCC-, as opposed to NMDAR-, mediated NO signalling is specifically required for LTP<sub>pre</sub> is not known, but may result from differences in the magnitude, kinetics, and/or spatial extent of NO signalling associated with L-VGCC and NMDAR activation. Unfortunately, the poor sensitivity of NO-indicator dyes makes this possibility difficult to currently investigate.</p><p>It has previously been shown that exogenous NO can potentiate synaptic transmission, and that this potentiation is restricted to synapses that are active during NO release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arancio et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhuo et al., 1993</xref>). Here, we extend these findings by showing that photolysis of NO at single synapses can directly drive increases in Pr, and that this increase can occur in the absence of glutamatergic signalling. Moreover, we demonstrate that the potentiating effects of NO are not only restricted to active synapses, but specifically at synapses whose activity precede, rather than follow, NO release; thus, the requirements of NO signalling are consistent with those of Hebbian and spike-timing dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dan and Poo, 2004</xref>). These findings also suggest the existence of a Hebbian detector at the presynaptic terminal that is sensitive to the timing between presynaptic activity and NO release; at least one isoform of guanylate cyclase is sensitive to NO in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, making it a potential candidate for integrating NO signalling and presynaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zabel et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Although our study focussed on phasic NO signalling, LTP may additionally require a tonic, low-level of NO signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hopper and Garthwaite, 2006</xref>). It will be important to examine the differential roles of tonic and phasic NO signaling in presynaptic plasticity in future studies. Moreovoer, while we provide evidence in support of NO as a retrograde signal in LTP<sub>pre</sub>, it may not be the only retrograde signal involved. Indeed, neurotrophic factors, transsynaptic signals, as well as contact-dependent processes are all known to regulate P<sub>r</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Regehr et al., 2009</xref>); whether such signals play a role in LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Glutamate drives LTD<sub>pre</sub> by activating presynaptic NMDARs</title><p>At active presynaptic terminals, whereas Hebbian activity drives increases in P<sub>r</sub>, we show, unexpectedly, that glutamate release drives decreases in P<sub>r</sub> by acting on presynaptic NMDARs. Using both pharmacological and genetic manipulations, we found that presynaptic NMDAR signalling operated both during LTP<sub>pre</sub> and LTD<sub>pre</sub> induction paradigms to reduce P<sub>r</sub>. Our finding suggests that the potentiating effects of Hebbian activity and the depressing effects of endogenous glutamate release occur concurrently during synaptic activity. Thus, the processes underlying LTP<sub>pre</sub> and LTD<sub>pre</sub> induction do not act independently as originally believed, but operate jointly to tune synaptic function. Our results may explain why sometimes the same pairing protocol that produces LTP<sub>pre</sub> at low P<sub>r</sub> synapses, produces LTD<sub>pre</sub> at high P<sub>r</sub> synapses; presumably the level of Hebbian activity achieved by such protocols is not of sufficient magnitude to prevent the depressing effects of glutamate release at high P<sub>r</sub> synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hardingham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sáez and Friedlander, 2009</xref>). Our results may also explain why the locus of LTP expression, whether pre- or postsynaptic, appears to depend on initial P<sub>r</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Larkman et al., 1992</xref>). With higher basal release probabilities, more glutamate is released for a given LTP induction protocol, meaning that LTP<sub>post</sub> is favoured owing to greater postsynaptic NMDAR-signalling, whereas LTP<sub>pre</sub> is inhibited owing to greater presynaptic NMDAR-signalling. Thus, low P<sub>r</sub> synapses will have a tendency to express LTP presynaptically, while high P<sub>r</sub> synapses will have a tendency to express LTP postsynaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Larkman et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to our findings, inhibition of presynaptic NMDARs at neocortical synapses does not appear to effect LTP magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sjöström et al., 2003</xref>). It is possible that the low frequency (0.2 Hz) of presynaptic stimulation used during LTP induction in these studies does not elicit sufficient glutamate release to drive decreases in P<sub>r</sub> via presynaptic NMDAR activation.</p><p>Studies using STDP protocols, however, have found a role for presynaptic NMDARs in the induction of LTD<sub>pre</sub> at neocortical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Min and Nevian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sjöström et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sjöström et al., 2007</xref>). This form of LTD<sub>pre</sub> is thought to additionally require endocannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) signalling. Although we also found presynaptic NMDARs to be necessary for LTD<sub>pre</sub> induction, we found no requirement for CB1Rs. However, the protocol we used to induce LTD<sub>pre</sub> was not a STDP protocol, and did not involve postsynaptic spiking, which is thought to be necessary to drive endocannabinoid release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Min and Nevian, 2012</xref>). Instead, our protocol used presynaptic stimulation, either in the form of single or short bursts of action potentials, delivered in the absence of postsynaptic depolarization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2013</xref> similarly found that patterned presynaptic stimulation delivered in the absence of postsynaptic spiking induced LTD<sub>pre</sub> at neocortical synapses, and in a manner independent of CB1R activity. Such findings suggest that under some experimental conditions, glutamate release from presynaptic terminals alone is sufficient to induce LTD<sub>pre</sub> by acting on presynaptic NMDARs without the additional need for endocannabinoid signalling.</p><p>NMDARs can have both metabotropic and ionotropic receptor signalling capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dore et al., 2016</xref>). We found that blocking ionotropic signalling with bath, but not postsynaptic, application of MK-801 was sufficient to prevent glutamate from driving decreases in P<sub>r</sub>. Combined with our conditional NMDAR knockout experiments, these findings suggest that ionotropic presynaptic NMDAR signalling is necessary for depressing P<sub>r</sub>. Blockade of presynaptic NMDAR function with MK-801 similarly abolishes LTD<sub>pre</sub> in neocortex induced by STDP protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2011</xref>). A recent paper by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter and Jahr, 2016</xref>), however, failed to find functional evidence for presynaptic NMDARs in the neocortex (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsson et al., 2017</xref>]), and showed that instead, metabotropic signalling by postsynaptic NMDARs was responsible for spike-timing dependent LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter and Jahr, 2016</xref>). The locus of LTD expression, however, was not assessed in this study. Given that metabotropic receptor signalling from postsynaptic NMDARs is believed to underlie the induction of LTD<sub>post</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nabavi et al., 2013</xref>), and based on our current findings, we would hypothesize that ionotropic presynaptic NMDAR signalling will preferentially play a role in LTP<sub>pre</sub> and LTD<sub>pre</sub> induction.</p><p>Previously we have demonstrated that presynaptic NMDARs at hippocampal synapses facilitate transmitter release during theta stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McGuinness et al., 2010</xref>). When considered with our current findings, presynaptic NMDARs appear to be important for presynaptic facilitation in the short-term, but presynaptic depression in the long-term. This is consistent with the finding that presynaptic NMDARs in the neocortex similarly mediate short-term plasticity of glutamate release, and yet are similarly implicated in LTD<sub>pre</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Min and Nevian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sjöström et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corlew et al., 2008</xref>). It may appear peculiar for a single protein to mediate seemingly disparate functions; however, another way to view the presynaptic NMDAR is as a dynamic regulator of presynaptic activity, appropriately tuning glutamate release depending on the patterns of pre- and postsynaptic activity. As such, the receptor may aid glutamate release during theta-related activity, but, triggers LTD<sub>pre</sub> when this release fails to elicit sufficiently strong levels of postsynaptic depolarization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications of the proposed model of presynaptic plasticity</title><p>In this study we present evidence for a novel model of presynaptic plasticity, in which changes in P<sub>r</sub> at presynaptic terminals depend on the levels of 1) Hebbian signalling and 2) glutamate release that accompany presynaptic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Critically, the levels of glutamate release at a synapse will not only depend on basal P<sub>r</sub>, but also on the pattern of presynaptic activity and on the state of the synapse (e.g. facilitating or depressing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dobrunz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997</xref>), which dictates how P<sub>r</sub> changes throughout a train of stimulation.</p><p>One interpretation of the proposed model is that presynaptic plasticity, by adjusting P<sub>r</sub>, corrects any mismatch between two variables: 1) the likelihood that presynaptic activity is accompanied by strong postsynaptic depolarization (i.e. Hebbian activity) and 2) the likelihood that presynaptic activity is accompanied by glutamate release. Accordingly, as we have shown in this study, increases in P<sub>r</sub> will preferentially occur when Hebbian activity is present at the synapse, but glutamate release is absent; whereas decreases in P<sub>r</sub> will preferentially occur when Hebbian activity is absent, but glutamate release is present. These scenarios reflect the correction of an otherwise profound mismatch that exists between the ability for presynaptic activity at a synapse to <italic>drive</italic> postsynaptic activity (reflected by the amount of glutamate release), and the ability for presynaptic activity to <italic>predict</italic> postsynaptic spiking (reflected by the amount of Hebbian signalling). We would hypothesize that P<sub>r</sub> would continue to change until these mismatches are corrected. This could explain why, for a given plasticity induction protocol, P<sub>r</sub> tends to a common equilibrium value across synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hardingham et al., 2007</xref>); this value presumably reflects the point at which the levels of glutamate and Hebbian signalling associated with the stimulation protocol are equally matched.</p><p>A key implication of our model is that the pattern of presynaptic activity will substantially impact changes in P<sub>r</sub>. As demonstrated in our study, when high frequency bursts of presynaptic stimulation are paired with postsynaptic spiking, P<sub>r</sub> remains low, whereas when single presynaptic stimuli are instead paired with postsynaptic spiking, P<sub>r</sub> potentiates to higher values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). At high P<sub>r</sub> synapses, it is known that glutamate release is preferentially driven by single spikes, and otherwise depresses in response to high frequency bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dobrunz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997</xref>). By contrast, at low P<sub>r</sub> synapses, glutamate release is preferentially driven by high frequency bursts, and is minimally responsive to single presynaptic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dobrunz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997</xref>). Thus, presynaptic plasticity appears to adjust P<sub>r</sub> such that glutamate release is preferentially driven by the pattern of presynaptic stimulation (bursts or singe spikes) that best predicts strong postsynaptic depolarization; P<sub>r</sub> is set low in the case of presynaptic bursts and high in the case of single presynaptic spikes. This is particularly relevant given that different patterns and frequencies of presynaptic firing are likely to convey different information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butts and Goldman, 2006</xref>). Consequently, presynaptic plasticity would enable the presynaptic terminal to act as a dynamic filter by preferentially tuning P<sub>r</sub> to ensure that only information relevant for postsynaptic spiking is transmitted. Such a process would greatly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of synaptic transmission.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All animal work was carried out in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 (UK).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cultured hippocampal slices</title><p>Unless otherwise stated in the text, cultured hippocampal slices were used for imaging and electrophysiological experiments owing to the excellent optical and electrophysiological access to cells and synapses afforded by this preparation.

For dense transfection of the CA3 region, a total of 75–150 nL of virus was injected over three sites at a high titer (Cre – 6.6 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/mL; tdTomato – 2.94 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/mL). For sparse transfection of CA1 cells, a single CA1 site was injected with 50 nL of virus at a lower titre. For controls, injections into CA3 or CA1 lacked Cre recombinase.

Continuous basal stimulation (0.05–0.10 Hz) was present for all experiments, and was only interrupted to deliver paired-pulse or tetanic stimulation.

Paired-pulse stimulation, unless otherwise stated, consisted of 2 presynaptic stimuli delivered 70 ms apart.</p><p>Baseline recordings were kept short (approximately 5 min) when recording using low resistance patch electrodes (4–8 MΩ) to minimize the effects of dialysis. We found that LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction was impaired with longer baseline recordings. Indeed, we could induce LTP<sub>pre</sub> under NMDAR blockade following a 5 min baseline recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>) but not a 10 min baseline recording (5 vs. 10 min: fold ΔEPSP<sub>slope</sub>: 1.91 ± 0.13 vs 0.87 ± 0.08; ΔPPR: −0.48 ± 0.08 vs −0.03 ± 0.03; n = 12 vs. 5 cells; p&lt;0.01).</p><p>LTP induction consisted of 60 single pulses delivered at 5 Hz each paired with postsynaptic depolarization. Postsynaptic depolarization took the form of a complex spike. To emulate a complex spike, we injected a postsynaptic current waveform (2–3 nA) that was approximately 60 ms in duration and resulted in 3–6 spikes at ~100 Hz, with the first spike occurring 7–10 ms after the presynaptic stimulus. This was done by injecting a current waverform (2–3 nA) with a 7–10 ms rising phase, a 20 ms plateau phase, and a 30–33 ms falling phase. However, in experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the current waveform took the form of a 50 ms flat current step; although successful, this protocol led to poorer control of the start of postsynaptic bursting. LTP induction in both instances was more robust when the cell was depolarized by approximately 10–15 mV from resting membrane potential (approx. −65 mV) during the 12 s induction protocol; this facilitated broad spiking during postsynaptic current injeciton. Stimulating electrodes were placed within 50–70 µm of the soma to ensure that postsynaptic depolarization reached stimulated synapses without significant attenuation. In glutamate receptor blockade experiments, the two stimulating electrodes used were placed at the same depth in the slice to ensure that drug washout rates were comparable in both pathways. In these experiments, if a strong monosynaptic IPSP was present following application of full glutamate receptor blockade, the experiment was omitted. For two pathway experiments, to ensure each electrode was stimulating independent populations of axons we used the collision test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lipski, 1981</xref>). Briefly, each pathway was successively stimulated, 1–2 ms apart. If both axonal populations are perfectly overlapping, then successive stimulation should generate a synaptic response comparable to the stimulation of either pathway alone, owing to the axonal refractory period. If however, both axonal populations are perfectly independent, successive stimulation should generate an EPSP response comparable to the sum total of the EPSP generated by stimulation of either pathway alone.</p><p>LTD induction consisted of either 60 single or paired (inter-stimulus interval of 5 ms) presynaptic pulses delivered at 5 Hz in the absence of postsynaptic depolarization; single pulses only induced LTD<sub>pre</sub> at high P<sub>r</sub> synapses (P<sub>r</sub><underline> &gt;</underline>0.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>), whereas paired pulses induced LTD at all synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). During either stimulation regime, the membrane was hyperpolarized (&lt;-100 mV) to prevent somatic and dendritic spiking; stimulation intensity was also kept low to avoid spiking, such that basal EPSP amplitude did not typically exceed 5 mV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiology and analysis</title><p>All electrophysiological data was recorded using WinWCP (Strathclyde Electrophysiology Software) and analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Insturments) and Excel (Microsoft). The initial EPSP slope, calculated during the first 2–3 ms of the response, was used to analyze changes in the EPSP throughout the recording. This was done to ensure only the monosynaptic component of the EPSP was analyzed. This is particularly important in cultured slices in which polysynaptic activity may confound EPSP amplitude measures. All data was normalized to the average EPSP slope recorded during baseline to yield ΔEPSP slope. Paired pulse ratio (PPR) was calculated as the average EPSP slope evoked by the second stimulation pulse divided by the average EPSP slope evoked by the first stimulation pulse, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim and Alger, 2001</xref>); averages were calculated from 5 to 10 paired pulse trials.

Slow withdrawal of the patch using a piezoelectric drive ensured re-sealing with no observable adverse effects to cell health.

For visualization purposes, electrode tip was coated with bovine serum albumin Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (ThermoFisher Scientific, Invitrogen, UK), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ishikawa et al., 2010</xref>).

Pipette tips were placed in the solution for 2–5 min.</p><p>To find a synapse responsive to axonal stimulation, axons were stimulated with pairs of stimuli (2 pulses 70 ms apart) to increase the chances of eliciting a Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. During stimulation, laser scanning was initially restricted to a single line through a number of synapses on the dendrite to enable for rapid assessment of potentially responsive spines. Because stimulation intensity was kept low to prevent dendritic and somatic spiking, generally only one or two spines could be clearly identified as responding to stimulation; though only one spine was typically taken for experimentation since laser scanning had to be restricted to a line crossing both the spine and a region of underlying dendrite in order to determine if spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were contaminated by dendritic or somatic spikes. Responsive synapses were always found in the vicinity of the stimulating electrode, which was placed within 100 µm of the soma. Synapse selection, however, was invariably biased in favour of mushroom spines, with head diameters ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 µm, as these synapses were clearly visible and produced larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> images were acquired in line scan mode at a rate of 500 Hz and analyzed using ImageJ and Microsoft Excel. Increases in spine fluorescence (ΔF/F = F<sub>transient</sub>–F<sub>baseline</sub>/F<sub>baseline</sub>) following the delivery of the first stimulus is thought to reflect successful glutamate release from the presynaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emptage et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Emptage et al., 1999</xref>). The proportion of successful fluorescent responses to the first stimulus across stimulation trials was used to calculate P<sub>r</sub>. P<sub>r</sub> was assessed on the basis of 15–40 trials at baseline and at 25–30 min post-tetanus. For high P<sub>r</sub> synapses (&gt;0.8) the number of stimulation trials was limited to 15–20 to avoid photodynamic damage that results from imaging the frequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses generated at these synapses. For all other synapses, P<sub>r</sub> was generally assessed using 20–35 trials of stimulation. Stimulation was kept of a sufficiently low intensity to avoid somatic and dendritic spiking. When spikes did occur, as evidenced by a simultaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in both the spine and the dendrite, a successful release event would require spine fluorescence to precede that of the dendrite, or to be of greater magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nevian and Helmchen, 2007</xref>). Synapses with initial P<sub>r</sub> values of 0–0.7 were used for LTP experiments, and synapses with P<sub>r</sub> values of 0.4–1.0 were used for LTD experiments. In experiments involving glutamate receptor blockade, P<sub>r</sub> was measured prior to drug application at baseline, and measured post-tetanus, following drug washout. In experiments involving NMDAR blockade, using either AP5 or MK-801, drugs were present for the duration of the experiment and, therefore, present for both the baseline and post-tetanus measurements of P<sub>r</sub>. Experiments were excluded if the synapse became non-responsive and there was evidence of either substantial drift of the stimulation electrode or photodynamic damage (i.e. blebbing of the dendrite or sudden increases in basal fluorescence intensity).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Nitric oxide imaging</title><p>Experiments involving DAF-FM (ThermoFisher Scientific, Invitrogen, UK) imaging were carried out in Tyrodes buffer (in mM: 120 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 30 glucose, 4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 25 HEPES) containing 50 µM D-AP5, 10 µM NBQX, 500 µM MCPG, and 100 µM LY341495 (Abcam, UK) to block glutamate receptors, as well as 1 µM Bay K-8644 (Abcam, UK) to prevent L-VGCC desensitization during K<sup>+</sup> application as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sattler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stanika et al., 2012</xref>).

The laser was focussed to a small spot (~1.2 µm diameter) by overfilling the back aperture of a 60x water-immersion lens (Olympus, UK). Electrode manipulators and recording chambers were mounted on a movable stage, which enabled a region above the spine head to be positioned beneath the photolysis spot. Laser exposure was controlled using a fast shutter (LS6; Uniblitz). For glutamate photolysis, MNI glutamate (Tocris, UK) was focally delivered through a glass pipette (4–8 MΩ; 10 mM MNI glutamate) using a picospritzer (Science Products, Germany). Laser exposure was limited to ~2 ms and, in each experiment, the laser intensity (0.5–2 mW) was adjusted to generate a Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in the underlying spine that was comparable to the response generated by electrical stimulation. Ruthenium nitrosyl chloride (RuNOCl<sub>3</sub>), which has sub-millisecond release kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bettache et al., 1996</xref>), was used for NO photolysis experiments. For spot photolysis, 0.5–1 mM RuNOCl<sub>3</sub> (Sigma) was bath applied and uncaged using 30–60 laser pulses (25 ms; 2 mW) delivered at 5 Hz; presynaptic stimulation either preceded or followed NO photolysis by 7–10 ms. Using the NO-indicator, DAF-FM (Invitrogen), we calibrated laser power to liberate approximately 10 nM of NO per pulse. We did this by targeting the soma of DAF-FM loaded neurons (250 µM bolus-loaded) for photolysis at different laser powers while recording the resulting increases in fluorescence using the confocal laser in line scan mode (500 Hz). We aimed for an increase in fluorescence of about 6–7% (averaged across several trials), which based on the manufacturer’s data on the concentration-dependent fluorescence of DAF-FM, amounts to a release of approximately 10 nM of NO. For wide-field UV photolysis, 100 µM RuNOCl<sub>3</sub> was added to the patch electrode and allowed to diffuse into the cell for 10–15 min prior to commencing the experiment. A UV Flash Lamp (HI-TECH Scientific) was used to deliver a 1 ms wide-field uncaging pulse (100 V) that was timed to occur 7–10 ms before or after presynaptic stimulation.

In the case of MK-801, slices were pre-incubated with the drug for at least 1 hr prior to experimentation. Experiments in which NMDARs were blocked with bath application of AP5 and with bath application of MK-801 produced similar results and so conditions were combined for data analysis. Postsynaptic NMDARs were blocked by bolus loading of 5 mM MK-801 for 60 s, after which 20 min was given for the drug to diffuse and take effect.

However, this protocol may have resulted in more intracellular loading of MK-801 than our rapid (60 s) bolus loading approach, and may have therefore resulted in off-target effects.

L-VGCCs were blocked with nitrendipine (20 µM; Abcam, UK). NO synthase was inhibited by pre-incubation of slices with L-NAME (100 µM; Sigma, UK), which started at least 20 min prior to experimentation. Extracellular NO was scavenged by bath application of cPTIO (50–100 µM; Sigma, UK). Intracellular NO was scavenged by bolus loading cells with 5 mM cPTIO. Endocannabinoid signalling (CB1 receptor) was inhibited by bath application of the AM-251 (2 µM; Tocris, UK).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Tests used to assess statistical significance are stated at the end of all Figure captions. Only non-parametric tests were used owing to small sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Siegel, 1956</xref>). For single comparisons, two-tailed Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank tests were used, depending on whether the data was unpaired or paired, respectively. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were also used to determine if data significantly differed from an expected value. For multiple comparisons, Kruskal-Wallis tests were used with post-hoc Dunn’s tests. Means and standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) are represented in the text as mean ±S.E.M.</p><p>Sample sizes that were typical for the field (n = 5–15; independent experiments/biological replicates) were used in this study, and provided sufficient power (&gt;80%) to detect the expected experimental effects reported in our study. For spine imaging, typically only one spine was imaged per cell per experiment. Samples were randomly assigned to conditions that were being concurrently run. Masking was not used for sample allocation or data collection. A single data point reflected the average of multiple measurements (technical replicates) within an experiment; this is detailed in the relevant Materials and methods sections.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>ZP was funded by a Clarendon Scholarship, a scholarship from the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and a Junior Research Fellowship from Magdalen College, University of Oxford.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stanislav Zakharenko (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>A comprehensive understanding of Hebbian plasticity requires solving many open questions, including those addressed by Padamsey and colleagues. In their new study, the authors use an impressive variety of techniques to further investigate the mechanisms of long-term plasticity at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses at the level of a single synapse. The manuscript delivers two major conclusions. First, the presynaptic component of LTP (LTP<sub>pre</sub>) is induced by postsynaptic depolarization that is mediated by L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Postsynaptic depolarization generates nitric oxide, a retrograde messenger that acts on a cognate presynaptic terminal to increase the probability of release (hence LTP<sub>pre</sub>). The second conclusion is that glutamate released by presynaptic terminals acts through presynaptic NMDARs and decreases the probability of release, without a contribution of postsynaptic NMDARs. The authors argue that LTP<sub>pre</sub> depends on the basal level of probability of release.</p><p>Despite the importance of all topics touched in this work and their impressive number, the authors need to strengthen the <italic>direct</italic> evidence of the LTP<sub>pre</sub> in the observed phenomena. Electrophysiological tools do not allow for unequivocal proof of LTP<sub>pre</sub> / LTD<sub>pre</sub> expression and modulation. Thus, the reviewers expect that the authors strengthen their data using optical tools to monitor CaT or synaptic vesicle exocytosis to support the major conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Please consider the detailed concerns below and write back with your plans to address these experimentally and an estimate of the time it will take to do so. We will share your response with the Board and reviewers who will then confer to issue their thoughts on your proposed experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Why didn't the authors base the entire experimental design on the optical methodology they have developed in the past (Emptage et al., 2003; Emptage, Bliss and Fine, 1999)? Imaging the number of successful postsynaptic calcium transients (assuming that the responses to single quanta of glutamate are indeed reliably detected) would focus on presynaptic changes thus being much more direct and rewarding. This approach was used here but just as a confirmation of the electrophysiological results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Unfortunately, results from recordings of EPSPs and from optical experiments are not superimposable. Intracellular recordings of synaptic potentials sample large populations of synapses, a likely mix of different presynaptic and postsynaptic phenotypes and forms of plasticity. On the contrary, postsynaptic calcium transients sample a small subset of these, presumably biasing the selection toward spiny synapses located on proximal dendrites, with larger sizes, more responsive to afferent stimulation, with a larger number of calcium permeable channels, with stores more full of calcium. If the scope of this paper is to characterize LTP<sub>pre</sub>/LTD<sub>pre</sub>, it would be then more appropriate to use postsynaptic calcium transients to obtain a careful time-dependent comparison of the effects of the different stimulation paradigms and drug manipulation-dependent comparison (see comment below) and use electrophysiology to confirm optical data. Average results from LTP/LTD optical experiments should be presented as average time courses across many synapses, cells and conditions to illustrate time-dependent changes and to compare the effects of the different stimulation paradigms and drug manipulations. The synaptic selection method and the location and morphological characteristics of the investigated synapses in these experiments should be better explained in the Materials and methods section discussing potential caveats.</p><p>Unfortunately, the authors extensively use a change in pair-pulse facilitation as a reliable way to demonstrate changes occurring in the presynapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The authors state: &quot;[…]robust and reliable LTP which had a presynaptic component of expression as assessed by a decrease in the pair pulse ratio&quot;. This is a weak and very indirect argument that could lead to false conclusions. The mechanisms behind PPF in the hippocampus are still debated, the most popular hypothesis explains presynaptic facilitation by the enhanced recruitment of quanta from calcium left inside the presynapse, following the first stimulus in the pair. Even assuming that this hypothesis was true (some recent results on presynaptic proteins speak against it, for example those on the triple KO for synapsins), a drop in the pair-pulse ratio can be seen only if the site of action of LTP<sub>pre</sub> is shared out with PPF. This is unlikely because the synaptic release process involves many passages, and if LTP<sub>pre</sub> were to act upstream or downstream the PPF-locus, the pair-pulse ratio would not be changed (LTP<sub>pre</sub> would have a proportional effect on the first and second response). More importantly for this study, a change in PPF is not a sufficient indication for a presynaptic change. Some post-synaptic processes (for example a change in local dendritic potential, a fast desensitization of post-synaptic receptors) do affect PPF. Furthermore, a specific problem with cultured slices experiments is the high incidence of polysynaptic connections which generate reverberant activity, often contaminating the PPF observation window. These caveats should be discussed in the paper.</p><p>2) Calcium imaging data are from small N (N = 12 spines; N = 5 spines; N = 3 spines (subsection “Glutamate photolysis inhibits LTP<sub>pre</sub> and promotes LTD<sub>pre</sub>”, third paragraph)) – the authors have to increase the sample size. It is also unclear if these values refer to spines from one or from a set of neurons. The number of independent experiments and the number of spines analyzed for each condition should be clearly indicated in each case. If the N is from just one or few experiments there will be a strong dependency of measured data, hence pooled observations would not be independent and there won't be equal variation across different experimental manipulations. In this respect it would be important to explain how the most adequate sample size was set to reach a meaningful statistical power.</p><p>3) The authors' claim that nitric oxide is <italic>the</italic> retrograde messenger at CA3-CA1 synapses is too strong. This claim is based on PTIO and L-NAME pharmacological experiments, which are not entirely definitive. The donor uncaging experiment only proves that nitric oxide is sufficient for LTP<sub>pre</sub>. Given that several other candidates for retrograde messenger have been described, we recommend that the conclusion be softened (i.e., “LTP<sub>pre</sub> requires nitric oxide signalling”) and other candidates be discussed. Moreover, the authors should provide time courses of DAF-FM and DAQ fluorescence increases to interpret the kinetics of NO release from postsynaptic cells.</p><p>4) The evidence for functional presynaptic NMDARs at CA3-CA1 synapses heavily relies on pharmacology. The experiments presented in the paper don't exclude the involvement of NNMDARs expressed by astrocytes. The authors may use the Cre-Lox system to remove GluN1 from CA3 pyramidal neurons or use a knockdown strategy. If not, alternative possibilities should be discussed in the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29688.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Despite the importance of all topics touched in this work and their impressive number, the authors need to strengthen the direct evidence of the LTP<sub>pre</sub> in the observed phenomena.

We found the reviewers’ comments very helpful in guiding our experimental plans and revisions for the purposes of presenting a stronger case for our findings.</p><p>We have now conducted all of the revisions and experiments we had originally proposed to address the reviewers’ concerns. This includes strengthening our evidence for presynaptic changes by 1) increasing our sample sizes and 2) using time lapse Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and paired pulse ratios (PPR) to more extensively characterize presynaptic changes across time. Perhaps most significantly, we have done these time lapse experiments in conditional GluN1 knockout mice to confirm the roles of pre- and postsynaptic NMDARs in LTP<sub>pre</sub> and LTD<sub>pre</sub> induction. We feel that the newly incorporated experiments have greatly strengthened our findings and provide further support for our proposed framework of presynaptic plasticity.</p><p>We address the reviewers’ comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Why didn't the authors base the entire experimental design on the optical methodology they have developed in the past (Emptage et al., 2003; Emptage, Bliss and Fine, 1999)? Imaging the number of successful postsynaptic calcium transients (assuming that the responses to single quanta of glutamate are indeed reliably detected) would focus on presynaptic changes thus being much more direct and rewarding. This approach was used here but just as a confirmation of the electrophysiological results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Unfortunately, results from recordings of EPSPs and from optical experiments are not superimposable. Intracellular recordings of synaptic potentials sample large populations of synapses, a likely mix of different presynaptic and postsynaptic phenotypes and forms of plasticity. On the contrary, postsynaptic calcium transients sample a small subset of these, presumably biasing the selection toward spiny synapses located on proximal dendrites, with larger sizes, more responsive to afferent stimulation, with a larger number of calcium permeable channels, with stores more full of calcium.</p></disp-quote><p>The study uses both Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and electrophysiology to support its conclusions. The reason for using both techniques is that we recognise that each has its own advantages and disadvantages. We therefore believe that both techniques combined provide a much stronger case of support for our results, and are more likely to appeal to a wider audience, including scientists from both imaging and electrophysiology communities.</p><p>On the basis of the reviewers’ comments, we have now discussed the caveats and strengths of both techniques in the Discussion. The relevant portion of the discussion is pasted below:</p><p>“Discussion – Experimental techniques</p><p>Our study is robust because we examine presynaptic plasticity under a diverse range of experimental conditions. […] Both of these techniques, therefore, present valid means of measuring presynaptic efficacy, at least under the experimental conditions used in this study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the scope of this paper is to characterize LTP<sub>pre</sub>/LTD<sub>pre</sub>, it would be then more appropriate to use postsynaptic calcium transients to obtain a careful time-dependent comparison of the effects of the different stimulation paradigms and drug manipulation-dependent comparison (see comment below) and use electrophysiology to confirm optical data. Average results from LTP/LTD optical experiments should be presented as average time courses across many synapses, cells and conditions to illustrate time-dependent changes and to compare the effects of the different stimulation paradigms and drug manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>The idea of using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to assess Pr over time is an excellent suggestion. As proposed, we assessed P<sub>r</sub> at a number of time points (baseline, +5, +15, +30, +45 minutes) following plasticity induction. We did this in slices in which GluN1, the obligatory NMDAR subunit, was knocked out presynaptically (i.e. in CA3 neurons). Consistent with our previous results, we found that knockout of presynaptic NMDARs augmented increases in Pr induced by paired stimulation and abolished decreases in Pr induced by unpaired stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, changes in P<sub>r</sub> were always greater than control when presynaptic NMDARs were knocked out, regardless of whether we were delivering paired our unpaired stimulation. These findings confirm that presynaptic NMDAR activation serves to promote decreases in P<sub>r</sub>.</p><p>Reassuringly, we found that increases in Pr following paired stimulation and decreases in Pr following unpaired stimulation grew over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D, H</xref>), consistent with the initial observation by Bayazitov et al. (2007) that presynaptic changes evolve over time. We make mention of this observation in the paper. Moreover, the effects of presynaptic NMDARs on Pr were observable throughout the post-induction period, starting from 5 minutes. This suggests that presynaptic NMDARs are unlikely to dynamically alter the evolving expression of presynaptic plasticity.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we also complemented our imaging findings with electrophysiological data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) in these slices. We examined both the EPSP and PPR over time following paired and unpaired stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, 7D</xref>). As can be seen, changes in EPSP and PPR nicely mirror one another. When PPR changes from electrophysiological experiments were plotted alongside changes in Pr obtained from imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D, H</xref>), we found nice correspondence between the two measures. Such findings help to validate both PPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging as techniques for assessing presynaptic efficacy.</p><p>In electrophysiological experiments, we additionally examined the effects of knocking out postsynaptic NMDARs (i.e. in CA1 neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Under these conditions, we were still able to induce LTP<sub>pre</sub> and LTD<sub>pre</sub>. Consistent with our previous findings, this suggest that postsynaptic NMDARs are not strictly required for the induction of presynaptic plasticity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The synaptic selection method and the location and morphological characteristics of the investigated synapses in these experiments should be better explained in the Materials and methods section discussing potential caveats.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed the method of synapse selection more clearly in the Materials and methods, and have stated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging biases us to sampling mushroom spines that have larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.

The authors state: &quot;[…]robust and reliable LTP which had a presynaptic component of expression as assessed by a decrease in the pair pulse ratio&quot;. This is a weak and very indirect argument that could lead to false conclusions.

These caveats should be discussed in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We do appreciate the reviewers concerns and we do agree that the use of paired pulse ratio (PPR) is not without issue. In the Discussion we have stated that PPR is an indirect measure of presynaptic efficacy that could be potentially confounded by postsynaptic changes. However, we should express the following:</p><p>1) The strength of our paper lies in using both PPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to investigate presynaptic plasticity. We have consistently found good agreement between both of these measures across our study. Perhaps this is best exemplified with the newly included experiments, in which time lapse PPR recordings and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging showed very similar trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D, H</xref>) following both LTP and LTD induction. Thus, although the exact mechanisms underlying PPR may be debated, at least within our experimental conditions, PPR functions as a good readout for presynaptic changes.</p><p>2) We have previously reported that at single synapses, PPR decreases after LTP. Using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, Emptage et al. (2003) assessed Pr during the first and second pulse of stimulation during paired pulse stimulation (ISI 70ms). They took the ratio of the two [Pr(2<sup>nd</sup> pulse)/Pr(1<sup>st</sup> pulse)] to calculate PPR and found that individual synapses show paired pulse facilitation, and that the PPR at these synapses decreases after LTP. Similarly, in our current study, in response to the reviewers’ comments we looked at PPR changes at single synapses in one set of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data. We found that single synapse PPR decreased following LTP<sub>pre</sub> induction (ΔPPR = -0.42 ± 0.12; n = 12; p&lt;0.01), and increased following LTD<sub>pre</sub> induction (ΔPPR = +0.97 ± 0.24; n = 9; p&lt;0.01). Again, while the mechanisms underlying PPR and its associated changes can be debated, we find that at the level of single synapses, changes in PPR measured with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging are consistent with changes in PPR recorded more globally across synapses using electrophysiology. This suggests that bonafide changes in PPR do occur in response to LTP and LTD induction, and that changes in PPR recorded electrophysiologically are a good proxy for assessing presynaptic changes, at least in our experimental conditions.</p><p>3) Although postsynaptic effects, namely receptor desensitization, can confound PPR measures, they do not affect PPR measurements at the interpulse interval (70 ms) used in our study (Yang and Calakos, 2013).</p><p>4) Although polysynaptic activity can be problematic for PPR analysis, reverberant activity was minimal in our cultured slice (see representative PPR traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, we always quantified EPSPs using their initial slope (first 2-3 ms) rather than their amplitude to prevent polysynaptic activity from confounding our analysis. Furthermore, from our results it is evident that results from PPR analyses in cultured slices yielded similar results to that obtained in acute slices, in which polysynaptic activity is less of a concern (see for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5C, F</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Calcium imaging data are from small N (N = 12 spines; N = 5 spines; N = 3 spines (subsection “Glutamate photolysis inhibits LTP<sub>pre</sub> and promotes LTD<sub>pre</sub>”, third paragraph)) – the authors have to increase the sample size.

In total, 9 experimental conditions were revisited for these purposes. All data sets have been updated in the figures and in the main text. None of our conclusions have changed. We should also stress that, because our effect sizes are large, we are able to achieve a statistical power of &gt; 90% across experimental conditions with our sample sizes.</p><p>For the reviewers’ interest, our sample sizes are low because Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, at least within the hippocampus, does not allow for a large number of synapses to be analysed in parallel. At least in our hands, the technique is generally quite difficult, especially in the context of plasticity experiments because of the time (&gt;35 minutes) required to maintain electrical control over the imaged synapse. Even after finding a synapse responsive to stimulation, many experiments fail owing to even slight drift in the stimulating electrode during the time course of the experiment (which is generally tolerable when recording EPSPs, but not when recording Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients), resulting in the loss of presynaptic control over the imaged synapse. This is typically why the N’s are low in plasticity experiments using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, especially when measurements need to be obtained at the same spine after a period of time. For example, in our previous studies (Emptage et al., 2013, Neuron and Ward et al., 2006, Neuron) we use an N of 4-13 and 6-14 respectively, depending on the difficulty of the experiment. A similar study of presynaptic plasticity by Alan Fine’s group (Enoki et al., 2009, Neuron) used an N of 5-8 throughout their study. A paper from the Sabatini lab (Kwon and Sabatini, 2011, Science) used an N of 5-11 in their study in an experiment which required assessing Pr of newly formed spines after several minutes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors' claim that nitric oxide is the retrograde messenger at CA3-CA1 synapses is too strong.
