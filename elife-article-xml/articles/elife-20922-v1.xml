pathway choice. This cascade involves the ubiquitylation of histone H2A by the RNF168 ligase and the subsequent recruitment of RIF1, which suppresses homologous recombination (HR) in G1 cells. The RIF1-dependent suppression is relieved in S/G2 cells, allowing PALB2-driven HR to occur. With the inhibitory impact of RIF1 relieved, it remains unclear how RNF168-induced ubiquitylation influences HR. Here, we uncover that RNF168 links the HR machinery to H2A ubiquitylation in S/G2 cells. We show that PALB2 indirectly recognizes histone ubiquitylation by physically associating with ubiquitin-bound RNF168. This direct interaction is mediated by the newly identified PALB2-interacting domain (PID) in RNF168 and the WD40 domain in PALB2, and drives DNA repair by facilitating the assembly of PALB2-containing HR complexes at DSBs. Our findings demonstrate that RNF168 couples PALB2-dependent HR to H2A ubiquitylation to promote DNA repair and preserve genome integrity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20922.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20922.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>PALB2</kwd><kwd>RNF168</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>ubiquitylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>863.11.007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luijsterburg</surname><given-names>Martijn S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Leiden University Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luijsterburg</surname><given-names>Martijn S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Toxicogenomics Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>050-060-510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mullenders</surname><given-names>Leon H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Institute of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masson</surname><given-names>Jean-Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dutch Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-6843</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Attikum</surname><given-names>Haico van</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>617485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Attikum</surname><given-names>Haico van</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new mechanism is uncovered by which the RNF168 ubiquitin ligase couples PALB2-dependent homologous recombination to H2A ubiquitylation to promote DNA repair and preserve genome integrity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) that arise in S phase during DNA replication or early in G2 phase are removed by the homologous recombination (HR) machinery, which utilizes the intact genetic information from the sister chromatid as a template for repair. Following their detection, the ends of a DSB are resected to generate extended 3’ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhangs, which are bound by the ssDNA-binding protein RPA. One of the key players in HR is the partner and localizer of breast cancer susceptibility protein 2 (PALB2), which is mutated in a subset of breast cancer and Fanconi Anaemia patients (FANCN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reid et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antoniou et al., 2014</xref>). PALB2 forms oligomers to interact with the breast cancer susceptibility proteins 1 and 2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2) and the recombinase RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buisson and Masson, 2012</xref>). The interaction between BRCA1 and PALB2 is tightly regulated in a cell-cycle dependent manner to ensure suppression of HR in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Orthwein et al., 2015</xref>) and activation of HR in S/G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buisson et al., 2017</xref>). Once recruited to resected DSB ends by BRCA1, PALB2 facilitates the assembly of BRCA2 and RAD51 onto broken DNA ends, the latter of which catalyzes strand invasion and DNA transfer during HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2009b</xref>). This mechanism is responsible for the error-free repair of DSBs in S/G2 phase.</p><p>The alternative pathway for DSB repair is non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which is dominant in G1 and late G2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karanam et al., 2012</xref>). The choice between HR and NHEJ during the cell cycle is regulated by a signaling pathway that involves the progressive modification of chromatin surrounding DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polo and Jackson, 2011</xref>). This pathway involves the concerted action of the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168, which promote the ubiquitin-dependent recruitment of the BRCA1-Abraxas-RAP80-MERIT40 (BRCA1-A) and 53BP1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang and Elledge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolas et al., 2007</xref>). It has been demonstrated that the RNF168-dependent recruitment of 53BP1, through its effectors RIF1 and MAD2L2, inhibits DNA end-resection and subsequently HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boersma et al., 2015</xref>). However, the action of RNF168 and 53BP1 does not seem to be intrinsically inhibitory to HR. For instance, the recruitment of RIF1 and its inhibitory impact on HR are restricted to G1 cells, which favors repair by NHEJ in that cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The accumulation of RIF1 is antagonized by BRCA1 in S/G2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2013</xref>), alleviating the inhibitory impact on HR and allowing this repair pathway to reach maximal activation during these stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karanam et al., 2012</xref>). With the inhibitory impact of RIF1 relieved, RNF168 is still capable of ubiquitylating chromatin in S/G2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doil et al., 2009</xref>), raising the question whether RNF168-induced ubiquitylation affects HR during these cell cycle stages. In this study, we reveal an unexpected role of RNF168 in physically coupling the HR machinery to H2A ubiquitylation in S/G2 cells through a newly identified PALB2-interacting domain (PID). These findings delineate a new RNF168-dependent mechanism that is paramount to PALB2 recruitment and efficient execution of HR in S/G2 phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNF168 promotes PALB2 recruitment to chromatin</title><p>To explore potential links between RNF168 and the homologous recombination (HR) machinery, we used a chromatin-tethering approach, exploiting the strong interaction between the LacR protein and the LacO DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luijsterburg et al., 2012</xref>).

Conversely, it was demonstrated in several other studies that RAP80 and Abraxas inhibit PALB2-dependent HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coleman and Greenberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kakarougkas et al., 2013</xref>). We recently reported that PALB2 and RAP80 reside in biochemically distinct and mutually exclusive BRCA1-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Typas et al., 2015</xref>). In line with this observation, we found that RAP80 depletion did not affect PALB2 recruitment after RNF168 tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Importantly, immunofluorescence and western blot analysis confirmed the efficient knock-down of RAP80 under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Additionally, knock-down of BRCA1, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), also did not change the RNF168-dependent assembly of PALB2 in this experimental system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>), suggesting that RNF168 can promote PALB2 accrual independently or downstream of BRCA1.</p><p>It should be noted that while RNF168-mediated recruitment of PALB2 in the tethering system does not require BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>), its recruitment into ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) that contain DSBs is fully dependent on BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which is in agreement with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2009b</xref>).

It should be noted that a number of studies have previously reported a role for RNF8 in regulating HR through different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), while other studies have reported that loss of RNF8 or RNF168 did not affect HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meerang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muñoz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakada et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the function of RNF8 and particularly RNF168 in HR is currently unclear. To elucidate the role of these proteins in this repair process, we depleted cells of RNF8 or RNF168 and monitored the recruitment of HR factors into IRIF. Cells stably expressing the mAG-tagged cell cycle marker geminin were engineered to specifically monitor recruitment in S and G2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Typas et al., 2015</xref>). As expected, mAG-geminin-expressing cells showed recruitment of endogenous PALB2 into foci after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, a quantitative analysis of IRIF formation revealed that knock-down of RNF8 or RNF168 largely abolished the accrual of PALB2 in mAG-geminin-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>). The knock-down of either ubiquitin ligase was verified by immunoblotting using specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, while BRCA1 depletion completely abolished PALB2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2009b</xref>), loss of RAP80 had no appreciable impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These results suggest that RNF8/RNF168 contribute to the BRCA1-dependent loading of PALB2 at DSBs independently of RAP80, which is in accordance with our tethering results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>), and consistent with several studies showing that RAP80 does not contribute to, or may even antagonize HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coleman and Greenberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Typas et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, depletion of RNF8 or RNF168 also impaired efficient RAD51 assembly in cycling cells, following either IR-inflicted DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E</xref>) or UV-A laser micro-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). This is in line with the effect on PALB2 recruitment, which is required for RAD51 loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2009b</xref>). We confirmed these findings in an siRNA-independent manner by utilizing fibroblasts from an RNF168-deficient RIDDLE patient who suffers from radiosensitivity and immunodeficiency, and displays dysmorphic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stewart et al., 2007</xref>). Analysis of mAG-geminin-expressing (S/G2) RIDDLE cells revealed markedly reduced RAD51 recruitment after IR when compared to the same cells complemented with RNF168 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E</xref>). To corroborate these results, we depleted endogenous RNF168 and transfected cells with siRNA-resistant GFP-tagged RNF168. Importantly, the expression of RNF168 fully rescued the loss of PALB2 foci after IR in cyclin B1-positive (S/G2) cells, demonstrating that this phenotype is not due to an off-target effect of the siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). To further validate these findings, we assessed whether knock-down of RNF168 would render cells sensitive to PARP inhibition, which is a feature of HR-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCabe et al., 2006</xref>). RNF168-depleted cells were hypersensitive to treatment with PARP inhibitor (PARPi), although not to the extent observed after PALB2 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting a role for RNF168 in HR. Interestingly, the additional knock-down of PALB2 further sensitized RNF168-depleted cells to the same levels as PALB2 single knock-down cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating that RNF168 is epistatic to PALB2 in HR. To establish whether RNF168 promotes HR, we turned to the well-established DR-GFP reporter for HR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pierce et al., 1999</xref>). Control experiments revealed that knock-down of BRCA2 almost fully impaired the HR-mediated repair of a nuclease-induced DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Using this reporter, we found that depletion of either RNF8 or RNF168 caused a significant reduction in HR efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) without any impact on cell cycle distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Finally, we generated RNF168 knock-out mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing. The genetic ablation of RNF168 was confirmed in two independent clones by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Both RNF168 knock-out clones showed a significant reduction in HR efficiency measured by the DR-GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), confirming our data in human cells. Together our results suggest that RNF168 facilitates PALB2/RAD51 loading and efficient execution of HR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BRCA1 recruitment to HR sites does not require RNF168</title><p>The recruitment of PALB2 during HR requires both RNF168 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2009b</xref>). This raises the question whether RNF168 promotes HR at the level of PALB2 itself, or whether RNF168 acts upstream of PALB2 at the level of BRCA1. To address this, we specifically monitored BRCA1 foci formation in geminin-positive S/G2 cells at late time points post IR (6 hr after 10 Gy), when functional HR complexes have been assembled. While control cells showed clear accumulation of BRCA1 and 53BP1 in S/G2 cells, knock-down of RNF168 still allowed BRCA1 recruitment in cells that failed to form 53BP1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). It has previously been established that proteins involved in DSB signaling show extensive spreading from DSB sites, while proteins involved in HR show a more limited spreading, which is likely confined to resected DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Typas et al., 2015</xref>). As a consequence of this difference in the spreading from DSBs, signaling proteins form significantly larger IR-induced foci when compared to HR factors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for a graphical representation of this phenomenon). To confirm and extend these findings, we performed quantitative measurements on IR-induced foci size. Our analysis confirmed that signaling proteins, such as MDC1, RNF168, BRCA1 and RAP80 form foci in the order of 0.15 µm<sup>2</sup> in size, whereas HR proteins, such as RPA, PALB2 and RAD51 form considerably smaller foci in the range of 0.06 µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Interestingly, the knock-down of RNF168 shifted the average BRCA1 foci size from that of the typical large foci (0.16 µm<sup>2</sup>) to that in the range observed for HR proteins (0.08 µm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). A similar phenotype has been observed in RAP80-depleted cells both by us and by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Typas et al., 2015</xref>). Although RNF168-depleted cells do form IR-induced BRCA1 foci in S/G2, we noted that the absolute number of BRCA1 foci is decreased compared to control S/G2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, a direct comparison between BRCA1 foci numbers in these conditions is difficult, because RNF168-depleted cells only form small HR foci, while control cells show small HR foci in addition to large signaling foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In summary, our findings suggest that while RNF168 loss affects the formation of large BRCA1 foci, which arise from RAP80-dependent BRCA1 recruitment during DSB signaling, it does not impair the formation of small BRCA1 foci in S/G2 cells that are typical for factors involved in HR. This conclusion also fits with the observation that the RNF168-mediated recruitment of PALB2 in the tethering system does not require BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>), and suggests that RNF168 promotes HR downstream of BRCA1, likely at the level of PALB2.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20922.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>RNF168 does not affect recruitment of BRCA1 to HR sites in S/G2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) BRCA1 (green) and 53BP1 (white) IRIF formation in mCherry-geminin-expressing (red) S/G2 U2OS cells transfected with siLuc.

To test this, we performed a pulldown assay from cell extracts that revealed an interaction between GFP-tagged RNF168 and endogenous PALB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To rule out an indirect interaction between these proteins, we purified GST-tagged PALB2 and His-tagged RNF168 and addressed whether these proteins interact in vitro. In accordance with our pulldown results, we found that recombinant PALB2 efficiently bound recombinant RNF168, demonstrating a direct protein-protein interaction between these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We next set out to map the region in PALB2 that associates with RNF168. To this end, we tested a series of recombinant PALB2 deletion mutants for their interaction with RNF168 in in vitro binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Regions encompassing the ChAM domain (T3) and the C-terminal WD40 domain (T5) of PALB2 most strongly associated with RNF168 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). To verify whether these PALB2 domains are required for the association with RNF168 in living cells, we monitored the interaction between RNF168 and internal deletion mutants of PALB2 lacking the ChAM (T6) or WD40 domain (T7). Both PALB2<sup>WT</sup> and PALB2<sup>ΔChAM</sup> (T6) interacted equally strongly with RNF168, while PALB2<sup>ΔWD40</sup> (T7) showed a markedly reduced ability to interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). To reciprocally verify this result, we pulled down YFP-tagged PALB2<sup>WT</sup> or PALB2<sup>ΔWD40</sup> (T7) and examined their association with RNF168. While RNF168 readily bound YFP-PALB2<sup>WT</sup>, this interaction was nearly lost in the absence of the WD40 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Similarly, the interaction between PALB2 and RAD51 was lost when the WD40 domain was lacking, agreeing with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buisson et al., 2010</xref>). The C-terminal WD40 domain is also the region in PALB2 that interacts with BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oliver et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, we confirmed in pulldown experiments that BRCA2 readily associates with YFP-PALB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We therefore asked whether RNF168, perhaps through its interaction with PALB2, can also associate with BRCA2. In addition to PALB2, we indeed found BRCA2 to also associate with GFP-RNF168 in pulldown experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To validate these findings, we performed in vitro binding assays using purified PALB2, BRCA2 and RNF168 proteins. In these experiments, we initially used a smaller chimeric BRCA2 protein of 1009 amino acids (piccolo BRCA2 or piBRCA2), which interacts with both PALB2 and RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buisson et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, we found that recombinant PALB2 readily interacted with either piBRCA2 or RNF168. When all three proteins were incubated together, we also detected an efficient association of PALB2 with both piBRCA2 and RNF168 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Similar results were obtained when using purified full-length BRCA2 protein of 3330 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These findings show that PALB2 interacts with RNF168 through its WD40 domain in a manner that is non-mutually exclusive with BRCA2 association.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20922.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>PALB2 directly interacts with RNF168 via its WD40 domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pulldowns of the indicated GFP fusion proteins in U2OS cells.

This would be predicted considering that RNF168 facilitates the recruitment of PALB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and because PALB2 interacts with RNF168 through its WD40 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Using the chromatin-tethering system, we found that, similarly to endogenous PALB2, YFP-PALB2<sup>WT</sup> was recruited to chromatin following tethering of RNF168 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). In stark contrast, YFP-PALB2<sup>ΔWD40</sup> (T7) failed to be recruited following tethering of RNF168, suggesting that the accrual of PALB2 in this system is WD40 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Subsequently, we assessed the recruitment of YFP-tagged PALB2 to sites of DNA damage. Importantly, we found that YFP-PALB2<sup>ΔWD40</sup> (T7) did not accumulate as readily as YFP-PALB2<sup>WT</sup> at laser-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>), as well as at nuclease-induced DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–I</xref>). To further establish the importance of the WD40 domain for PALB2 recruitment, we complemented PALB2-deficient FANCN cells with YFP-tagged PALB2<sup>WT</sup> or PALB2<sup>ΔWD40</sup> (T7). While YFP-PALB2<sup>WT</sup> efficiently localized to sites of IR-induced DNA damage in cycling cells, its ΔWD40 counterpart showed significantly reduced recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J,K</xref>). Importantly, BRCA1 was clearly recruited to nuclease-induced DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>), as well as to sites of IR-induced DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J,K</xref>) in cells that did not show PALB2<sup>ΔWD40</sup> (T7) recruitment, suggesting that the inability of PALB2<sup>ΔWD40</sup> to accumulate at DSBs is not related to a defect in BRCA1 recruitment. This is in line with the observation that the interaction between BRCA1 and PALB2 relies on the N-terminal coiled-coiled domain and not the C-terminal WD40 domain of PALB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2009b</xref>).

Interestingly, efficient recruitment of RNF168 itself to DSBs requires an auto-amplification loop that involves the binding of RNF168 to its own ubiquitylation product through its ubiquitin-dependent DSB-recruitment module 2 (UDM2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thorslund et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore first asked whether this auto-amplification loop contributes to PALB2 accrual. To this end, we tethered catalytically inactive RNF168<sup>C16S</sup> to a LacO array, which resulted in substantially reduced ubiquitin conjugation compared to tethering RNF168<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Strikingly, catalytically dead RNF168<sup>C16S</sup> failed to recruit PALB2 to the LacO array in most cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), with PALB2 assembly being exclusively observed in cells retaining residual ubiquitin conjugates at the array, suggesting this is due to leakiness of the RNF168<sup>C16S</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These data suggest that PALB2 recruitment is strictly dependent on the catalytic activity of RNF168.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20922.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>RNF168-mediated PALB2 recruitment is ubiquitylation dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Recruitment of ubiquitin conjugates (FK2; white) and endogenous PALB2 (green) upon tethering of the indicated mCherry-LacR-RNF168 variants (red) to a genomic LacO array in U2OS 2-6-3 cells.

If this hypothesis is correct then PALB2 should be able to indirectly associate with ubiquitin and such an interaction should require its WD40 domain, which mediates its association with RNF168 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>). In agreement with this rationale, recombinant GST-ubiquitin efficiently pulled down both RNF168 and YFP-PALB2<sup>WT</sup> from cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). As a control we included ubiquitin with a mutation in one of the key residues of the hydrophobic patch (I44), which inhibits the interaction with many ubiquitin-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoeller et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, both GST alone and GST-ubiquitin<sup>I44A</sup> failed to pulldown either PALB2 or RNF168, showing that the hydrophobic patch on the surface of ubiquitin is required for the interaction with RNF168/PALB2. Strikingly, YFP-PALB2<sup>ΔWD40</sup> (T7) failed to interact with GST-ubiquitin, indicating that the PALB2-ubiquitin interaction requires an intact WD40 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>), and suggesting that RNF168 constitutes a bridge between ubiquitin and PALB2. To exclude that PALB2 itself is not capable of binding to ubiquitin, we performed in vitro interaction experiments using recombinant ubiquitin and either full-length or fragments of recombinant PALB2. Indeed, the WD40 domain of PALB2 was unable to bind poly-ubiquitin chains of various linkages under our assay conditions (K48, K63 and K27; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Moreover, none of the five PALB2 fragments spanning the entire protein, nor the full-length protein itself, was able to interact with recombinant ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These findings suggest that the WD40-dependent association of PALB2 with ubiquitin is not mediated by a direct interaction, but likely involves its ubiquitin-binding partner RNF168.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>PALB2 interacts with ubiquitin through RNF168</title><p>We next sought to address if PALB2 associates with ubiquitin conjugates through its ubiquitin-binding partner RNF168 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thorslund et al., 2015</xref>). To this end, we performed in vitro GST-binding assays using recombinant K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains, as these are the chains preferentially bound by RNF168 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pinato et al., 2011</xref>). As expected, we found that purified RNF168 could interact with K63-polyubiquitin chains, but this association was not stimulated in the presence of PALB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In line with our previous data, we found that purified PALB2 was unable to bind K63-polyubiquitin chains on its own, but it was proficient in doing so when recombinant RNF168 was included in the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, our in vitro reconstitution experiments reveal an RNF168-dependent association of PALB2 with poly-ubiquitin conjugates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>PALB2 recruitment requires H2A ubiquitylation at K13/K15</title><p>It was demonstrated that RNF168 specifically ubiquitylates the core histone H2A at N-terminally situated lysines 13 and 15 in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattiroli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013</xref>). To address if these histone marks contribute to PALB2 recruitment, we made use of a point-mutant of RNF168 (R57D), which is still able to ubiquitylate, but has no activity toward H2A in a nucleosomal context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattiroli et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to RNF168<sup>WT</sup>, tethering LacR-tagged RNF168<sup>R57D</sup> failed to recruit 53BP1 and PALB2, suggesting that RNF168-mediated H2A ubiquitylation promotes PALB2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). To corroborate these findings, we used a replacement strategy in which cells depleted for endogenous RNF168 were transfected with siRNA-resistant versions of GFP-tagged RNF168. Ectopic expression of GFP-RNF168<sup>WT</sup> fully rescued both PALB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>) and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) recruitment into IRIF. Conversely, neither RNF168<sup>C16S</sup> nor RNF168<sup>R57D</sup> were proficient in restoring PALB2 or 53BP1 foci formation after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Importantly, GFP-RNF168<sup>R57D</sup>, like its wild-type counterpart, was still recruited into IRIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) or to nuclease-induced DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), albeit not as efficiently as wild-type RNF168. To further test the contribution of RNF168-mediated ubiquitylation of H2A on K13/K15, we over-expressed FLAG-tagged versions of either H2A<sup>WT</sup> or H2A<sup>K13/15R</sup> in U2OS cells harboring a stably integrated LacO array and an inducible version of FokI-mCherry-LacR. Tethering of FokI-mCherry-LacR and subsequent DSB formation at the array triggered the robust recruitment of YFP-PALB2 in FLAG-H2A<sup>WT</sup>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Conversely, expression of FLAG-H2A<sup>K13/15R</sup> caused a significant decrease in YFP-PALB2 recruitment even though the accumulation of FokI-mCherry-LacR was similar between cells expressing H2A<sup>WT</sup> or H2A<sup>K13/15R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>). These results indicate a strong dominant-negative effect of the FLAG-H2A<sup>K13/15R</sup> mutant on PALB2 recruitment. We also witnessed a considerable decrease in 53BP1 recruitment in H2A<sup>K13/15R</sup>-expressing cells, demonstrating the validity of this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Together, these results show that the catalytic activity of RNF168 toward H2A on K13/15 is required to promote efficient PALB2 recruitment. We propose that the initial RING-dependent ubiquitylation of H2A by RNF168, and the subsequent MIU-dependent binding of additional RNF168 proteins to this ubiquitin mark creates a chromatin-bound binding platform for the recruitment of PALB2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref> for a model).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20922.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>PALB2 associates with K63-polyubiquitin chains via RNF168.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GST pulldowns to assess the binding of GST-PALB2 or GST-alone to K63 polyubiquitin (pUb) chains in the presence or absence of His-RNF168.

Already supporting this possibility was our finding that the WD40 domain in PALB2 is required for both its interaction with RNF168 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), as well as its efficient recruitment to DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, considering that the WD40 domain of PALB2 also serves as the interaction surface for a number of other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pauty et al., 2014</xref>), we set out to map the region in RNF168 that is required for the interaction with PALB2. To this end, we generated a series of deletion mutants and tested their ability to interact with endogenous PALB2 in pulldown assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>). Using this approach we found that GFP-tagged RNF168<sup>WT</sup>, RNF168<sup>Δ1-189</sup> (T1) and RNF168<sup>Δ191-382</sup> (T2) associated with PALB2 with equal efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>), suggesting that the N-terminus and central region of RNF168 are not required for this interaction. Conversely, RNF168<sup>Δ384-571</sup> (T3) showed an almost complete loss of PALB2 binding, indicating that the C-terminus of RNF168 mediates its interaction with PALB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>). Considering that RNF168<sup>Δ384-571</sup> (T3) lacks the UDM2 required for the recruitment of full-length RNF168, we generated additional C-terminal deletion mutants that do include this domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Analysis of these mutants revealed that RNF168<sup>Δ479-571</sup> (T4) and RNF168<sup>Δ525-571</sup> (T5) also failed to efficiently bind PALB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>). We conclude that the C-terminal ~50 amino acids of RNF168 comprise a new PALB2-interacting domain, which we have named PID (for <underline>P</underline>ALB2-<underline>I</underline>nteracting <underline>D</underline>omain). An alignment of the PID in human RNF168 revealed considerable conservation of this domain in mammalian species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Having identified which region in RNF168 mediates its association with PALB2, we finally examined the functional relevance of this region for PALB2 recruitment. We reconstituted RNF168-depleted cells with siRNA-resistant GFP-tagged wild-type RNF168 or C-terminal deletion mutants of RNF168 that lack the PID and are therefore unable to interact with PALB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). For this analysis we only used RNF168 mutants RNF168<sup>Δ479-571</sup> (T4) and RNF168<sup>Δ525-571</sup> (T5) since these mutants, in contrast to RNF168<sup>Δ384-571</sup> (T3), contain the UDM2 and are therefore proficient in accumulating at DSBs. Expression of these GFP-RNF168 variants rescued the 53BP1 foci defect in RNF168-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>), which shows that these mutants are recruited to DSBs and are able to ubiquitylate H2A. Conversely, while expression of RNF168<sup>WT</sup> fully restored PALB2 foci formation in geminin-positive S/G2 cells, the C-terminal deletion mutants RNF168<sup>Δ479-571</sup> (T4) and RNF168<sup>Δ525-571</sup> (T5) failed to fully rescue this PALB2 foci defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>). These data further prove that the RNF168-mediated recruitment of PALB2 depends on a direct protein-protein interaction that is mediated by the C-terminal PID of RNF168. To further corroborate these findings, we assessed the relevance of the PID of RNF168 for PALB2-driven HR in PARPi survival assays. To this end, we used the Flp-In/T-REx system to establish HeLa cells stably expressing inducible siRNA-resistant GFP-tagged RNF168 alleles that were either able (WT) or unable (T5) to interact with PALB2. HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-NLS were generated to serve as a control. To perform PARPi survival assays, we knocked-down endogenous RNF168 with siRNAs in these cells and induced ectopic expression of RNF168 alleles with doxycycline (DOX). The expression was shut down by a DOX wash-out 12–24 hr before cells were subjected to a 24 hr pulse of 1 µM PARPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>), resulting in ectopic RNF168 expression levels in the near-physiological range during the treatment with PARPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). Using this approach, we found expression of GFP-RNF168<sup>WT</sup> to almost fully rescue the PARPi sensitivity of RNF168-depleted cells, while expression of GFP-NLS or GFP-RNF168<sup>Δ525-571</sup> (T5) failed to rescue this defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Notably, we observed this effect in two independent clones expressing RNF168<sup>WT</sup> or RNF168<sup>Δ525-571</sup> (T5). These findings suggest that the interaction between PALB2 and the C-terminal PID of RNF168 contributes to efficient DSB repair by HR. In summary, our findings support a piggyback ride mechanism for PALB2 recruitment, which links the ability of RNF168 to amplify and bind ubiquitin conjugates at damaged chromatin to a direct protein-protein interaction between PALB2’s WD40 domain and RNF168’s C-terminal PID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20922.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Recruitment of PALB2 requires its interaction with RNF168’s PID.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of full-length RNF168 (WT) and five deletion mutants (T1–T5).

We demonstrate that RNF168 drives the recruitment of PALB2 to DSBs in a manner depending on its ubiquitin ligase activity toward histone H2A on K13/K15. Moreover, we show that RNF168 recruits PALB2 to DSBs through a direct protein-protein interaction that is established by the newly identified C-terminal PID of RNF168 and the C-terminal WD40 domain of PALB2. These findings advance our mechanistic understanding of the RNF168-dependent response to DSBs by revealing a physical and functional link between RNF168 and the core HR protein PALB2.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>RNF168 promotes DSB repair through HR</title><p>The repair of DSBs in S/G2 cells relies on HR, which involves the sequential assembly of a functional repair complex consisting of BRCA1, PALB2, BRCA2 and RAD51. The accumulation of PALB2 depends on BRCA1 and is subsequently required for the efficient recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2009b</xref>). Our current study reveals an unexpected role of the ubiquitin ligase RNF168 in promoting HR in S/G2-phase cells. Firstly, we show that knock-down of RNF168 impairs the recruitment of PALB2 and RAD51 to DSBs in S/G2 phase. This phenotype is also observed in cells from RNF168-deficient RIDDLE patients. Moreover, re-expression of siRNA-resistant RNF168 in RNF168-depleted cells, and of RNF168 in RIDDLE cells fully restored the HR defects, showing that these are a specific consequence of impaired RNF168 protein function. Secondly, we demonstrate that knock-down of RNF168 in human cells or knock-out of RNF168 in mouse ES cells confers a defect in HR measured by the well-established DR-GFP reporter. Thirdly, we find that knock-down of RNF168 leads to pronounced PARP inhibitor sensitivity, which is an established hallmark of defective HR. Previous studies also lend support for a role of RNF168-induced H2A ubiquitylation in promoting HR-mediated DSB repair. For example, cells deficient of the USP51 deubiquitylase, or the TRIP12 and UBR5 ubiquitin ligases display elevated levels of RNF168-induced H2A ubiquitylation at DSBs, which is accompanied by an increase in HR efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gudjonsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Our results provide a mechanistic basis for these reported findings by showing that RNF168 couples the HR machinery to H2A ubiquitylation in S/G2 cells. Although the role of RNF168, and to a lesser extent RNF8, in regulating HR has remained controversial largely due to conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meerang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muñoz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), our study solidifies the importance of RNF168 in promoting efficient HR. Consistently, we find that RNF8, which facilitates the recruitment of RNF168 to damaged chromatin through ubiquitylation of histone H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thorslund et al., 2015</xref>), also contributes to HR. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that RNF8 promotes HR by targeting substrates other than H1 for ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Auto-amplification of RNF168 recruitment contributes to PALB2 accrual</title><p>The RNF168 protein contains at least three domains required for its function. Firstly, the UDM1 domain associates with RNF8-generated ubiquitin conjugates on histone H1, which is the initial step of ubiquitin-dependent DSB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thorslund et al., 2015</xref>). Secondly, once recruited to RNF8-generated ubiquitin conjugates through UDM1, RNF168 utilizes its catalytic RING domain to ubiquitylate histone H2A at K13 and K15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattiroli et al., 2012</xref>). Thirdly, the UDM2 domain in RNF168 promotes its association with the ubiquitin conjugates on H2A. Once bound, RNF168 can further ubiquitylate neighboring H2A using its RING domain and bind to these moieties through the UDM2. This auto-amplification through the UDM2 is critical for efficient RNF168 recruitment to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thorslund et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings suggest that the ability of RNF168 to promote its own recruitment is also an integral part of PALB2-dependent HR. We show that both the catalytically inactive mutant RNF168<sup>C16S</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doil et al., 2009</xref>) and the RNF168<sup>R57D</sup> mutant, which is not able to bind and ubiquitylate nucleosomal H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattiroli et al., 2012</xref>), fail to promote PALB2 recruitment. Both these mutants could neither support PALB2 recruitment in the LacR/LacO tethering system nor to DSBs in complementation experiments with RNF168-depleted cells. Furthermore, we find that over-expression of H2A<sup>K13/15R</sup>, which lacks the ubiquitylation sites targeted by RNF168, inhibited PALB2 recruitment to nuclease-induced DSBs. Together, these findings suggest that the ubiquitin-dependent accumulation of RNF168 on broken chromosomes is critical for PALB2 recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RNF168 recruits PALB2 through protein-protein interactions</title><p>The significance of RNF168 in PALB2 recruitment is further corroborated by in vitro studies with purified RNF168 and PALB2, which reveal a direct protein-protein interaction. Domain mapping uncovered that the C-terminally located WD40 domain of PALB2 is the key determinant for this interaction. In line with RNF168 supporting PALB2 recruitment through a direct interaction, we find that full-length PALB2 lacking its WD40 domain is recruited much less efficiently to laser-, nuclease-, and IR-induced DSBs. Interestingly, biochemical reconstitution experiments reveal that PALB2 indirectly associates with poly-ubiquitin chains through a WD40-dependent interaction with recombinant RNF168. Thus, we can fully reconstitute the interaction between PALB2, RNF168 and poly-ubiquitin, providing a molecular mechanism for the RNF168-dependent recruitment of PALB2. Domain mapping also revealed that PALB2 associates with a previously unrecognized region in the C-terminus of RNF168, which we termed the PALB2-Interacting Domain (PID). Intriguingly, RNF168 mutants lacking the PID proved to be separation-of-function mutants which fully support 53BP1 foci formation, but are defective in supporting PALB2 accumulation at DSBs. Similarly, we found that stable ectopic expression of RNF168<sup>WT</sup> rescued the PARPi sensitivity of RNF168-depleted cells, while a mutant lacking the PID (RNF168<sup>Δ525-571</sup> (T5)) failed to do so. These findings illustrate the importance of the protein-protein interaction between PALB2 and RNF168 in HR, and unveil the presence of a previously unrecognized domain in the C-terminus of RNF168 that is critical for its role in HR. One interesting possibility is that RNF168 through this direct protein-protein interaction targets PALB2 for ubiquitylation. However, whether this is the case and whether this potential RNF168-dependent ubiquitylation of PALB2 has functional significance for HR remains to be established.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A new RNF168-dependent mechanism for PALB2 recruitment</title><p>Based on our findings, we propose the following model for RNF168-dependent regulation of HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>): RNF168 decorates histones and other proteins with ubiquitin following its binding to RNF8-modified chromatin in the ssDNA-containing compartment proximal to DSBs. Although it may be expected that resected DNA is devoid of histones, previous studies have shown that resection can actually occur in a nucleosomal context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsukuda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costelloe et al., 2012</xref>). RNF168 auto-amplifies its accumulation in the ssDNA compartment and recruits PALB2 through a direct protein-protein interaction. Once recruited, PALB2, in turn, facilitates BRCA2 and RAD51 assembly and promotes efficient HR. We propose that these events contribute to a trimodular mechanism for PALB2 recruitment in which (1) BRCA1 promotes PALB2 recruitment in an RNF168-independent manner through a protein-protein interaction involving the coiled-coil domain situated at the N-terminus of PALB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2009b</xref>), (2) the more centrally located chromatin-association motif (ChAM) of PALB2 stabilizes its binding to damaged chromatin in the ssDNA compartment, and (3) the C-terminal WD40 domain of PALB2 further facilitates its retention by associating with the C-terminal PID of RNF168. We propose that integrating these independent recruitment signals leads to the efficient and specific accrual of PALB2 to HR sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). Such a multifaceted recruitment mechanism is not uncommon in the DSB response. For instance, the assembly of 53BP1 at damaged chromatin requires the simultaneous presence of two distinct marks on histones H4 and H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tuzon et al., 2014</xref>). It is clear that the action of RNF168 in chromatin more distal to DSBs results in the ubiquitin-dependent recruitment of 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>) and the BRCA1-Abraxas-RAP80-MERIT40 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coleman and Greenberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2011</xref>), both of which are inhibitory to DNA-end resection. It is important to note that the RNF168-mediated modification of H2A at K13/15 and the subsequent association of 53BP1 to this mark are not intrinsically inhibitory to HR. The inhibition of end resection is mediated downstream of 53BP1 by the recruitment of RIF1, which is restricted to G1 cells. Thus, RNF168 is only inhibitory to HR in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Orthwein et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, our results reveal that RNF168 promotes PALB2 accrual and subsequent RAD51 loading on resected DNA in S/G2 cells to promote HR. These findings demonstrate the versatility of the RNF168-mediated ubiquitylation of H2A in regulating HR in a cell cycle-dependent manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>All cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) containing 10% FCS (Bodinco BV) at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Single copy integration was verified by Southern blot analysis and by PCR. An antisense guide RNA (5’-ACTGACATTCGGCTAAGGAA-3’) targeting the first exon of RNF168 was inserted into the pSpCas9(BB)−2A-GFP vector (PX458; Addgene #48138). Transfected DR-GFP mouse ES cells were sorted by flow cytometry for GFP expression, plated at low density after which individual clones were isolated. Knock-out of RNF168 in the isolated clones was verified by western blot analysis and Sanger sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>HR assay</title><p>HEK293T, or mouse ES cells (WT or RNF168-/-) containing a stably integrated copy of the DR-GFP reporter were used to measure the repair of I-SceI-induced DSBs by HR as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pierce et al., 1999</xref>). Briefly, 48 hr after siRNA transfection, the cells were co-transfected with an mCherry expression vector and the I-SceI expression vector pCBASce. 48 hr later the percentage of GFP-positive cells among mCherry-positive cells was determined by FACS on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) using FACSDiva software version 5.0.3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>PARP inhibitor survival</title><p>U2OS cells were transfected with siRNA on day 1 and 2.

Papers in this field are highly relevant to a wide audience in the life sciences. Luijsterburg et al. reveal how a central player in the early stage of the DSB response, the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF168, is involved in mediating a critical DSB repair pathway – homologous recombination repair (HRR), which takes place in late S or G2. The work shows how RNF168 mediates the recruitment to DSB sites of a critical HR player – PALB2. The core finding is the physical interaction between RNF168 and PALB2, which explains how PALB2 reads histone ubiquitylation – a basic and essential PTM in this pathway. The work provides evidence that RNF168 and PALB2 directly interact and propose further that complex formation involves the C-terminus of RNF168 (referred to as the PALB2 interaction domain, PID) and the WD40 domain of PALB2.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Since it has been previously shown that BRCA2 binds to the WD40 β-propeller domain of PALB2, the fact that RNF168 interacts with the exact same region of PALB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) raises a few questions that should be discussed in more detail (subsection “A new RNF168-dependent mechanism for PALB2 recruitment”); especially in the light of the simplified model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref> that is lacking BRCA2 and RAD51. For instance, do RNF168 and BRCA2 interact with PALB2 in a mutually exclusive manner? Does RNF168 eventually compete with BRCA2 for PALB2 binding? How is the potential handover of PALB2 from RNF168 to BRCA2 regulated?</p><p>All interaction studies were performed with (transiently) overexpressed, epitope-tagged versions of RNF168. To address this issue, you could co-immunoprecipitate endogenous RNF168 from cell lysates and probe the bound fractions for PALB2 and BRCA2. If this is not possible for technical reasons, GFP-RNF168 pulldown fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) should also be probed for the presence of endogenous BRCA2.</p><p>It is shown that RNF168 depletion results in hypersensitivity to olaparib treatment and decreased HR efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2H and 2H</xref>), but not to the same extent as compared to BRCA2 depletion, which is expected. The question remaining is whether RNF168 acts epistatically to PALB2 with regards to HR or in genetically separable pathways.

However, the IP efficiencies proved to be (too) low and high background levels of PALB2 and RNF168 binding were experienced in these IPs despite stringent IP/wash conditions. This precluded us from examining whether endogenous RNF168 interacts with PALB2 and BRCA2. Instead, we have performed pulldown experiments using cells transiently expressing GFP-RNF168. These new pulldown experiments revealed an association between GFP-RNF168 and PALB2 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), corroborating our previous findings. In addition to PALB2, we also found BRCA2 to associate with GFP-RNF168 in these experiments (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To validate these findings, we performed in vitrobinding assays using purified PALB2, BRCA2 and RNF168 proteins. In these experiments, we initially used a smaller chimeric BRCA2 protein of 1009 amino acids (piccolo BRCA2 or piBRCA2), which interacts with both PALB2 and RAD51 (Buisson et al. 2010). Indeed, we found that recombinant PALB2 interacts with piBRCA2 and RNF168 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Similar results were obtained when using purified full-length BRCA2 protein of 3330 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). PALB2 interacts with both RNF168 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and BRCA2 (Oliver et al. 2009) through its WD40 domain. Thus, our findings suggest that RNF168 and BRCA2 interact with PALB2 through its WD40 domain in a non-mutually exclusive manner. To incorporate these new findings, we have included an extended model that also shows BRCA2 and RAD51 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>.</p><p><italic>It is shown that RNF168 depletion results in hypersensitivity to olaparib treatment and decreased HR efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2H and 2H</xref>), but not to the same extent as compared to BRCA2 depletion, which is expected.

While knock-down of RNF168 leads to a moderate sensitivity to PARPi, the additional knock-down of PALB2 further sensitized RNF168-depleted cells to the same levels as PALB2 single knock-down cells. These findings indicate that RNF168 is epistatic to PALB2 in HR. See subsection “BRCA1 recruitment to HR sites does not require RNF16” and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>.</p><p><italic>The PALB2-RNF168 interactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> are not convincing. The proteins are grossly overexpressed. A question remaining is whether the endogenous proteins interact.</italic> </p><p>As indicated above, for technical reasons we have been unable to address whether endogenous PALB2 and RNF168 interact. However, the RNF168-PALB2 interaction studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> are in our opinion convincing, as the pulldowns show a high degree of specificity. Near equal amounts of GFP-NLS, RNF168<sup>WT</sup>, RNF168<sup>Δ1-189</sup> (T1), RNF168<sup>Δ191-382</sup> (T2), RNF168<sup>Δ384-571</sup> (T3), RNF168<sup>Δ479-571</sup> (T4) and RNF168<sup>Δ525-571</sup> (T5) were pulled down. Proteins containing the PID domain (WT, T1 and T2), associated with PALB2 at very similar levels, while those lacking this domain (T3, T4 and T5, or GFP-NLS) failed to bind PALB2 efficiently. These findings, together with the interaction between recombinant PALB2 and RNF168 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and the finding that RNF168 lacking its PID domain fails to rescue PALB2 IRIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-F</xref>) and PARP inhibitor sensitivity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G-I</xref>) in RNF168-depleted cells illustrate the functional significance of the PID domain in RNF168 for the PALB2-RNF168 interaction.</p><p><italic>To further corroborate the role of the RNF168-PALB2 interaction in HR, it would be important to examine olaparib hypersensitivity of RNF168-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) stably expressing either siRNA-resistant GFP-RNF168 wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) or GFP-RNF168 T5 mutant lacking the PID domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</italic> </p><p>To address this issue, we used the Flp-In/T-REx system to establish HeLa clones stably expressing inducible siRNA-resistant GFP-tagged RNF168 alleles that were either able (WT) or unable (T5) to interact with PALB2. HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-NLS were generated to serve as a control. To perform PARPi survival assays, we knocked-down endogenous RNF168 with siRNAs in these stable HeLa cells and induced ectopic expression of RNF168 alleles with doxycycline. This expression was shut down by doxycycline wash-out 12-24 hours before cells were subjected to a 24 hour pulse of 1 µM PARPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>), resulting in ectopic RNF168 expression levels in the near-physiological range during the treatment with PARPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). Using this approach, we found expression of GFP-RNF168<sup>WT</sup> to almost fully rescue the PARPi sensitivity of RNF168-depleted cells, while expression of GFP-NLS or GFP-RNF168<sub>Δ525-571</sub> (T5) failed to rescue this defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Notably, we observed this effect in two independent clones expressing RNF168<sub>WT</sub> or RNF168<sub>Δ525-571</sub> (T5). These findings suggest that the interaction between PALB2 and the C-terminal PID domain of RNF168 contributes to efficient DSB repair by HR. See subsection “PALB2 recruitment requires its interaction with the C-terminus of RNF168”.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> examines recruitment of PALB2 in irradiated S/G2 cells. Recruitment requires RNF8, RNF168 and BRCA1, but not RAP80. Rad51 recruitment also requires RNF8 and RNF168. Most of these observations are not novel and needs to be indicated</italic> </p><p>We would like to point out that the existing literature on the role of RNF168 in HR is quite mixed. While a number of studies have previously reported a role for RNF8 in regulating HR through different mechanisms (Huang et al. 2009; Lu et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012), other studies have reported that loss of RNF8 or RNF168 did not affect HR (Meerang et al. 2011; Sy et al. 2011; Munoz et al. 2012; Nakada et al. 2012). Thus, the role of RNF8 and particularly RNF168 in HR is currently unclear. More importantly, recent studies have suggested that PALB2 recruitment requires RNF8 through a mechanism that depends on RAP80 (Zhang et al. 2012). However, our work shows that RAP80 does not contribute to PALB2 recruitment (Typas et al. 2015), which is consistent with several studies showing that RAP80 does not contribute to, or may even antagonize HR (Coleman and Greenberg 2011; Hu et al. 2011; Typas et al. 2015). We have now indicated that there is no clear consensus on the role of RNF168 in HR and we cite the relevant literature in which conflicting results have been reported (see–subsection “RNF168 promotes PALB2 recruitment to DSBs and execution of HR”).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> claims that RNF168 does not affect recruitment of BRCA1 to HR sites in S/G2 cells, but there is some reduction of recruitment of BRCA1 at HR sites in cells transfected with siRNF168 (as also shown in panel C), and others have reported that BRCA1 recruitment to IRIF is dependent on RNF168. However, the text (subsection “BRCA1 recruitment to HR sites does not require RNF168”) says: &quot;knock-down of RNF168 still allowed significant BRCA1 recruitment&quot;. The wording should be different here.</italic> </p><p>We now state that: “knock-down of RNF168 still allowed BRCA1 recruitment in cells that failed to form 53BP1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref>)” (see subsection “BRCA1 recruitment to HR sites does not require RNF168”). We also explain in the same section that the knock-down of RNF168 shifted the average BRCA1 foci size from that of the typical large signalling foci (0.16 µm<sup>2</sup>) to that in the range observed for HR proteins (0.08 µm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In other words, we lose the larger RAP80-BRCA1 foci in RNF168-depleted cells, but we retain the smaller HR- associated BRCA1 foci. We also state that: “Although RNF168-depleted cells do form IR-induced BRCA1 foci in S/G2, we noted that the absolute number of BRCA1 foci is decreased compared to control S/G2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). […] In summary, our findings suggest that while RNF168 loss affects the formation of large BRCA1 foci, which arise from RAP80-dependent BRCA1 recruitment during DSB signaling, it does not impair the formation of small BRCA1 foci in S/G2 cells that are typical for factors involved in HR.”</p><p><italic>The co-precipitation experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are not clean enough.
