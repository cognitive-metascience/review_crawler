and metastasis. However, therapies targeting Ral signalling are not available yet. By a novel optogenetic approach, we found that light-controlled activation of Ral at plasma-membrane promotes the recruitment of the Wave Regulatory Complex (WRC) via its effector exocyst, with consequent induction of protrusions and invasion. We show that active Ras signals to RalB via two RalGEFs (Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors), RGL1 and RGL2, to foster invasiveness; RalB contribution appears to be more important than that of MAPK and PI3K pathways. Moreover, on the clinical side, we uncovered a potential role of RalB in human breast cancers by determining that RalB expression at protein level increases in a manner consistent with progression toward metastasis. This work highlights the Ras-RGL1/2-RalB-exocyst-WRC axis as appealing target for novel anticancer strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40474.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancers develop when cells in the body divide rapidly in an uncontroled manner. It is generally possible to cure cancers that remain contained within a small area. However, if the tumor cells start to move, the cancer may spread in the body and become life threatening. Currently, most of the anti-cancer treatments act to reduce the multiplication of these cells, but not their ability to migrate.</p><p>A signal protein called Ras stimulates human cells to grow and move around. In healthy cells, the activity of Ras is tightly controled to ensure cells only divide and migrate at particular times, but in roughly 30% of all human cancers, Ras is abnormally active. Ras switches on another protein, named RalB, which is also involved in inappropriate cell migration. Yet, it is not clear how RalB is capable to help Ras trigger the migration of cells.</p><p>Zago et al. used an approach called optogenetics to specifically activate the RalB protein in human cells using a laser that produces blue light. When activated, the light-controlled RalB started abnormal cell migration; this was used to dissect which molecules and mechanisms were involved in the process.</p><p>Taken together, the experiments showed that, first, Ras ‘turns on’ RalB by changing the location of two proteins that control RalB. Then, the activated RalB regulates the exocyst, a group of proteins that travel within the cell. In turn, the exocyst recruits another group of proteins, named the Wave complex, which is part of the molecular motor required for cells to migrate.</p><p>Zago et al. also found that, in patients, the RalB protein was present at abnormally high levels in samples of breast cancer cells that had migrated to another part of the body. Overall, these findings indicate that the role of RalB protein in human cancers is larger than previously thought, and they highlight a new pathway that could be a target for new anti-cancer drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Invasion</kwd><kwd>Ral</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Exocyst</kwd><kwd>Wave</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJA 20151203371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parrini</surname><given-names>Maria Carla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PC201530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coppey</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coppey</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By moving from correlations to causality in cancer signal transduction using optogenetics, the sufficiency of RalB activation to trigger invasion and the underlying molecular mechanisms were established.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the most frequent oncogenic events in human cancers is the activation by constitutive mutations of Ras GTPases: K-Ras, H-Ras, N-Ras. Roughly 30% of all human tumors carry Ras genetic alterations; the Ras mutation frequency is particularly high for pancreas (91%), lung (33%) and colon (51%) cancers (cbioportal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simanshu et al., 2017</xref>). Up-to-date no effective targeted therapies can be offered to patients with tumors carrying Ras mutations. Since Ras proteins are still considered undruggable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cox et al., 2014</xref>), the focus for anti-Ras drug discovery moved downstream. Ras activates three major downstream pathways: the MAP kinases, the PI3 kinases and the Ral GTPases. Despite the considerable translational research efforts on the downstream kinases, the results are very deceiving. For example, MAPK pathway inhibition with MEK inhibitor therapy turned out to be largely ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jänne et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the targeting of Ral GTPases has been a much less exploited strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yan and Theodorescu, 2018</xref>). The two human Ral proteins (RalA and RalB) are activated by six RalGEFs (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neel et al., 2011</xref>). Among the six, four RalGEFs (RalGDS, Rgl1, Rgl2, Rgl3) have a Ras-association (RA) domain and are direct effectors of Ras. Activated GTP-bound Ras recruits these RalGEFs at the plasma-membrane triggering the activation of Ral by GDP to GTP exchange. The two remaining RALGEFs (RalGPS1 and RalGPS2) do not bind Ras; their specific activators are still unknown, but they do contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rebhun et al., 2000</xref>), responsible for membrane targeting, and a proline-rich motif which binds to SH3-containing signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ceriani et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Even though, in some cellular contexts, RalA and RalB seem to have overlapping effects, several evidences pointed out a distinct role for RalB in supporting the invasiveness of transformed cells. In the case of migration of the UMUC3 human bladder cancer cell line (K-Ras mutated), RalA seems to even antagonize the pro-migratory function of RalB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oxford et al., 2005</xref>). The requirement of RalB for invasion in vitro (by Transwell Invasion assay) was shown by shRNA knock-down approach in seven out of nine K-Ras mutated human pancreatic cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lim et al., 2006</xref>). Consistently, another study showed that RalB, but not RalA, plays a role in invadopodia formation in human pancreatic cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neel et al., 2012</xref>). RalB, but not RalA, is required for the contractility-driven invasion of lung cancer cells (A549, K-Ras mutated) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biondini et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, in vivo metastasis assays in mice (tail vein injection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ward et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lim et al., 2006</xref>) and in hamsters (subcutaneous injection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rybko et al., 2011</xref>) supported a function of RalB pathway in the formation of tumor metastasis, both in Ras-mutated and Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells. Besides the cancer context, we previously found that RalB, but not RalA, controls the mesenchymal migration of normal cells (NRK, HEK-HT, wild-type for Ras) by mobilizing its effector exocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rossé et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parrini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biondini et al., 2016</xref>), which is an octameric protein complex involved in the tethering of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane prior to SNARE-mediated fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu and Guo, 2015</xref>).</p><p>All these works allowed to recognize the relevance of RalB pathway for motility, invasion and metastasis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neel et al., 2012</xref>). We reasoned that the emerging optogenetics technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Toettcher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tischer and Weiner, 2014</xref>) might help to overcome this limitation, because of its capacity to dissect the cause-effect relationships linking the activity of a specific protein of interest and the consequent cell behaviors, in time and space. To date, various light-gated protein-interaction modules have been introduced to perturb intracellular protein activities. The one we exploited is based on the interaction between two proteins from <italic>Arabidopsis Thaliana:</italic> CIB1 and cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>). Blue-light illumination induces the heterodimerization of CRY2 with the N-terminus of CIB1 (CIBN). This reaction is reversible and rapid, with response times in the order of seconds (few seconds for dimerization and ~5 min for dissociation after cessation of blue illumination), and does not require exogenous cofactors. In this work, we applied the CRY2-CIBN light dimerization system to selectively activate Ral cascade and to study the primordial phenotypic effect of this activation.</p><p>By using this novel optogenetics approach, we precisely established the molecular mechanism underlying the capacity of RalB to drive invasion. This mechanism involves the exocyst-dependent recruitment at the leading edge of the Wave Regulatory Complex (WRC), a five-subunit protein complex involved in the formation of the actin cytoskeleton through interaction with the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alekhina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), but unexpectedly independently of the small GTPase Rac1, a well-established WRC activator and master regulator of protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ridley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ridley, 2006</xref>). We also found that RalB pathway contribution might be much more relevant than MAPK and PI3K contributions to drive Ras-dependent invasion, as ascertained by using a genetically controlled cell model: the isogenic pair HEK-HT and HEK-HT-H-RasV12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hahn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Hayer and Counter, 2006</xref>). Light-induced Ral activation was instructive in promoting cell invasion of the non-transformed HEK-HT cells. Finally, we analyzed Ral proteins’ expression in a cohort of breast cancer samples, pointing out for the first time a potential role of RalB in the invasiveness and metastatic spread of human breast cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optogenetic control for selective activation of ral proteins</title><p>We exploited the CRY2/CIBN light-gated dimerization system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>) to induce activation of endogenous RalA and RalB proteins with a spatial and temporal control. We chose to activate Ral at the plasma-membrane because Ral oncogenic signaling emanates at least in part from the plasma-membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ward et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamad et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lim et al., 2005</xref>). To do so, the GFP-fused CIBN protein was constitutively targeted to the plasma membrane via a K-Ras CAAX motif. The minimal GEF domain of RGL2 (1–518 aa), which is catalytically active on both RalA and RalB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferro et al., 2008</xref>), was fused to CRY2-mCherry (RalGEF-CRY2-mCherry). We stably expressed these two constructs in HEK-HT cells, which are immortalized but not transformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hahn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Hayer and Counter, 2006</xref>), to generate the ‘OptoRal’ cell line (CIBN-CAAX/RalGEF-CRY2). As control, we generated the ‘OptoControl’ cell line which expresses CRY2-mCherry only, without the RalGEF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Upon blue light illumination (100 ms pulses every 15 s), RalGEF-CRY2-mCherry reversibly translocated to the plasma membrane following its binding to GFP-CIBN-CAAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as shown by TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Moreover, we provide a detailed molecular model of how the Ras-RalB signaling axis governs cell invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>): active Ras binds and recruits the two RalGEFs RGL1 and RGL2, which activate RalB; activated RalB binds to the exocyst complex, promoting its assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moskalenko et al., 2003</xref>) and recruitment to the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rossé et al., 2006</xref>); by its direct association with the WRC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biondini et al., 2016</xref>), exocyst drives WRC to the leading edge, where WRC stimulates actin polymerization, protrusion formation, motility and invasion.</p><p>Unexpectedly, using the model of isogenic cell lines HEK-HT and HEK-HT-H-RasV12, we found that hyper-activations of MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways were not required for Ras-driven invasion. A huge previous literature had undoubtedly shown that MAPK and PI3K are involved in migration and invasion of various normal and cancer cell models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keely et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klemke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ward et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Janda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2007</xref>). However we speculate that this could not be the case in specific, relevant cellular contexts, such as the HEK-HT-H-RasV12 cells in which the RalB pathway appears to be the dominant driver of invasion down-stream oncogenic Ras. In support of this hypothesis, in a panel of pancreatic cell lines, Ral pathway was found to be more commonly activated as compared to MAPK and PI3K, since abnormally high Ral-GTP levels were much more frequent than abnormally high levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 or phosphorylated AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lim et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In human cancer contexts, the contribution of Ral pathway activation is likely still under-estimated. Even though genetic alterations in Ral genes are rare events in human cancers, occurring in only 1.5% to 2% of patient cases considering a variety of cancer types, alterations in genes coding for Ral regulators in human tumors are not uncommon. Notably, RGL1 and RalGPS1 are found amplified in 11% of breast cancer patients, meanwhile RalGAPA1, RalGAPA2 and RalGAPB are altered in 14%, 8% and 6% of lung cancer patients, respectively (cbioportal bioinformatics platform) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with the notion that dysregulation of Ral might be important for oncogenesis or tumor progression.</p><p>In almost all cancer types examined (pancreas, colon, lung, bladder, prostate, melanoma), increased overexpression and/or activation of both RalA and RalB have been observed in patient tumor samples compared with normal tissues, regardless of their Ras mutation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yan and Theodorescu, 2018</xref>).

After 6 hr of incubation at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, the insert was washed with PBS, non-invasive cells on the top of the insert were removed with a cotton swab. The cells that did invade on the bottom were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.5% NP-40 and incubated with 5 mg/ml DAPI to stain the nuclei. The porous membranes were cut out and mounted on slides using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Cell nuclei were imaged using an epifluorescence a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (10X objective), images were acquired with a Coolsnap HQ2 camera (Roper Scientific) and counted using ImageJ plugin ‘Cell Counter’. The Invasion index is calculated from the mean of all the replicates per each condition, normalized on the mean of the control per each experiment. For Transwell coupled with optogenetic, each well was illuminated with an independent LED using a custom-made illumination device consisting of an array of 5 mm blue LEDs (480 nm, 12 cd, 30°) driven by an Arduino Due micro-controller and delivering 3.5 mW each. Blue light was administered continuously from the bottom of the Transwell plate for the whole duration of the experiment (6 hr).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Inverted invasion assay</title><p>Inverse invasion assays were performed accordingly to a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kajiho et al., 2016</xref>), but using a collagen gel instead of Matrigel. An ice-cold gel preparation of bovine collagen type I (#5005-B, Advanced Biomatrix) at a final concentration of 2.3 mg/mL, in MEM medium containing 0.28% NaHCO3 (pH = 8), was incubated 2.5 hr at 4°C (nucleation step), pipetted into 12-well 8-μm-pore-diameter transwells (#353182, Corning) (230 μm gel preparation per insert), inserted into a 12-well tissue culture plate, and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr (polymerization step). The transwells were then inverted, 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells were seeded on the underside of the porous membrane, and placed in 6-well plate for 2 hr (cell attachment step). The transwells were inverted back, washed 3 times with 1 ml of serum-free medium, and placed in 1.5 ml of serum-free medium inside a 12-well plate (lower chamber); 230 µl of 10% FBS-DMEM supplemented with 25 ng/ml EGF were added inside the transwell (upper chamber). The cells were then allowed to invade upward into the bovine collagen and toward the gradient of serum/EGF for 4 days at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were live stained with CellTrace yellow (Thermofisher) for 1 hr at 37°C and rapidly imaged by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM880, 10x objective, excitation at 545 nm and emission at 605 nm). Optical sections were captured at 5 µm intervals, starting from the underside of the transwell membrane and moving upward in the direction of cell invasion. The resulting fluorescence images were quantified using ImageJ software. For each independent experiment, data were generated from two duplicate transwells, and optical sections were acquired from two areas of each transwell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunoblotting, Immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR</title><p>For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.5% NaDOC, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 10% Glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0) containing 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM DTT and a protease inhibitor mixture (#0589291001, Roche). Equal amounts of protein were diluted in 4x Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman) by wet transfer and blocked with 3% BSA in TBS/0.05% Tween-20 for 30 min. Primary antibodies were: mouse anti-RalA (#610222, BD Transduction Laboratories, dilution 1:1000); rabbit anti-RalB (#3523, Cell Signaling, dilution 1:500); mouse anti AKT(pan) (#2920, Cell Signaling, dilution 1:1000); rabbit anti p-AKT(Ser437)(#9271, Cell Signaling, dilution 1:1000). Protein levels were detected using LICOR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences) upon incubation with IRDye secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature.</p><p>For immunofluorescence, cells were cultured on coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, quenched with 1M Glycine solution, permeabilized with 0.1% of Triton-100X, incubated with 4% FBS +1% BSA blocking solution, then with primary and secondary antibodies, every step being in PBS buffer. Primary antibodies were: mouse anti-RalB (#WH0005899M4, clone 4D1, Sigma-Aldrich, dilution 1:200), mouse anti-RGL2 (#H00005863-M02, clone 4D10, Novus biologicals, dilution 1:200). For RT-qPCR analysis, total RNA was extracted using RNaeasy Plus Mini kit (Quigen). Retrotranscription and amplification were obtained using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad), the SYBR Green Master Mix kit or TaqMan (Applied Biosystems) on the ABI Prism7900 SequenceDetection System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems).

A similar pull-down assay was used for RalB activity but using home-made beads-coupled GST-Sec5GBD. For RalB activity measurement by FRET, cells were transfected with a validated FRET-based RalB biosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin et al., 2014</xref>) and imaged with an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with a FRET filter set (86002v1JP4, Chroma Technology) and a 63x oil-immersion objective.

Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 40 000 r.p.m. for 30 min. Protein was fractionated on a Superose 6 10/300 GL Increase (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) connected to an ÄKTA pure chromatography system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Protein Expression and Purification Core Facility, Institut Curie). The column was eluted with 30 mM Tris (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl and 1% CHAPS at 0.5 ml/min and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. Prior to SDS-PAGE analysis, proteins were concentrated with 20% Trichloroacetic Acid Protein (TCA), washed in Acetone and resuspended in Laemmli buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Breast cancer samples</title><p>Primary tumors and lymph nodes were surgically removed before any radiation, hormonal or chemo-therapy, using a cohort of patients (n = 649) treated at the Institut Curie from 2005 to 2006. In this cohort, 502 invasive ductal carcinomas were selected for Ral detection; after discarding the samples with staining problems, the final numbers of analyzed cases were n = 466 for RalA and n = 448 for RalB. Tissue microarrays (TMA) consisted of replicated tumor cores (1 mm diameter) selected from whole-tumor tissue sections and a matched tissue core from adjacent non-tumoral breast epithelium (referred to as normal breast tissue). Immunoistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed using a Dako Autostainer Plus according to previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lodillinsky et al., 2016</xref>). Antibodies were: anti-RalB (#WH0005899M4, clone 4D1, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-RalA (#610222, BD Transduction Laboratories). H-scores were calculated using the following formula: stained cell percentage x stain intensity/100.</p><p>Analysis of human samples was performed in accordance with the French Bioethics Law 2004–800, the French National Institute of Cancer (INCa) Ethics Charter, and after approval by the Institut Curie review board and ethics committee (Comité de Pilotage du Groupe Sein) that waived the need for written informed consent from the participants. Women were informed of the research use of their tissues. Data were analyzed anonymously.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>Results are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism (v5.0) and R Software v.3.3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">R Core Team, 2016</xref>). Comparisons between two groups were assessed using Student t-test. Comparisons between more than two groups were assessed using one-way ANOVA test. Comparisons between paired data were assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For breast cancer H-score analysis, Shapiro-Wilk normality test and non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired data were used. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the staff of Flow Cytometry Core Facility of Institut Curie for their excellent assistance, the Cell and Tissue Imaging (PICT-IBiSA), Institut Curie, member of the French National Research Infrastructure France-BioImaging (ANR10-INBS-04), Chiara Vicario for discussion and analysis help, and Hiroaki Kajiho and Giorgio Scita for very kindly sharing their detailed protocols.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;RalB directly triggers invasion downstream oncogenic Ras by mobilizing the Wave complex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor/Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see, all three reviewers recognise the significant potential interest of the work. At the same time, they also identify several limitations of the study. Very concisely, as the detailed reviews are pasted below, the major concerns fall into the following categories:</p><p>1) Concerns that Transwell invasion assay may not be a fair reporter of invasive behaviour of cancer cells.</p><p>2) Concerns that observed effects may reflect possible mislocalization of the probes.</p><p>3) Concerns that sample sizes might be too small to support or deny effects.</p><p>4) Concerns whether the observed effects apply to cancer cells or to normal/physiological context.</p><p>5) Concerns of over-reliance on a single approach without further validation with orthogonal approaches.</p><p>We are afraid that addressing these concerns thoroughly would take in excess of approximately two months, the time limit for revision at <italic>eLife</italic>, and therefore we prefer to return the manuscript to you so that you can decide how to proceed with the manuscript farther.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Zago et al. investigate the mechanisms whereby oncogenic Ras drives invasion. They provide data pointing to RalB as the main driver of invasiveness via the RalGEFs RGL1 and RGL2, independently of MAPK and PI3K. For this, they utilize a novel optogenetic approach, whereby light-controlled local activation of Ral promoted, via its effector exocyst, the recruitment of the Wave Regulatory Complex at the cell leading edge in a Rac1-independent fashion.

Unfortunately the fact that part of the experiments are performed in a Ras mutant context and part in a Ras WT context, and that no validation experiments are performed in human cancer cell lines, makes this distinction difficult. I encourage the authors to either validate the role of RalB in invasion in few (Ras mutant and Ras WT) human cancer cell lines (for example by CRISPR knockout of RalB, followed by a Transwell invasion assay), or to mitigate their speculations about the link between RalB and migration in a Ras mutant and tumor context.</p><p>In Figure 1C, the authors show that silencing of RalB, but not RalA, impaired invasion of HEK-HTRasV12 cells of approximately 60%. The authors do not comment on the remaining 40% invasiveness that is not inhibited by RalB suppression.

At the end of their result description the authors conclude that &quot;since the OptoRal cells do not carry Ras mutations, this experiment shows that RalB activation is able to drive cell invasion even in a wild-type Ras genetic context&quot;. The authors can't make this conclusion, because in their system Ral activation is artificially made independent of Ras activation and mutation status (unless they can quantitatively compare the level of Ral activation following illumination in their OptoRal cells with the levels of endogenous Ral activation in the presence of WT or mutant Ras).</p><p>In Figure 5A, the authors should include OptoRal and OptoControl cells (without iRFP-Abi1) to show if invasion is increased after illumination-induced Ral activation in the presence of endogenous levels of Abi1, or if overexpression is needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript Zago et al. report that Ral activation causes recruitment of the Scar/WAVE complex via the exocyst complex. The authors describe the development of an elegant novel optogenetics approach to recruit a RalGEF to the plasma membrane upon blue light illumination thereby activating Ral proteins at this location. They report that this causes recruitment of the Scar/WAVE complex and causes consequently membrane protrusion independent of Rac activity. They further claim that active Ras induced cell invasion depends on Ral but not MAPK or PI3K activity and is mediated by RalGEFs RGL1/2. Finally, they suggest that Ral mediated increase in cell invasion is mediated by the exocyst recruiting the Scar/WAVE complex.</p><p>This is potentially a very exciting story: Even though many regulatory mechanisms of the Scar/WAVE complex are known, it is still not clear how its activity is controlled in time and space during lamellipodia protrusion and cell migration and invasion. In general, the study is done with great care and well controlled. Therefore, I would be willing to support the publication of this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic> if my major concerns are adequately addressed:</p><p>1) Transwell invasion assays used in Figure 1 and 5 have inherent shortcomings: It is an endpoint analysis which does not allow visualization of the invasion. Thus, it does not control for a defect or increase in adhesion and these could be interpreted as a decrease or increase in invasion. Inverted invasion assays are more reliably controlled in vitro invasion assays.</p><p>2) In Figure 1B: It is quite a big statement that Ras driven invasion is mediated by Ral from this one Transwell assay. This needs to be backed up by data from other assays for example, inverted invasion assays using knockdown, MAPK pathway inhibitors etc. The spread of the mean between individual experiments is huge and does not give confidence in the reliability of the Transwell experiment.</p><p>3) Figure 4B, D: Why does the iRFP-Abi in the OptoRal cells does not localise to the leading edge of cells as one would expect if it is incorporated into the Scar/WAVE complex? This is seen for the iRFP-Abi in the OptoControl cells. An increase of the iRFP-Abi in the OptoRal cells at the leading edge and not just at the membrane underneath the cell would increase confidence that RalB-exocyst activation contributes to a physiological recruitment of the WRC to the leading edge of cells. Could you activate a smaller area only at the leading edge of cells with blue light? Alternatively, you could use mesenchymal cells that form larger lamellipodia. In addition to Abi another component of the Scar/WAVE besides Abi should be imaged since Abi can interact with N-WASP independently of the Scar/WAVE complex.</p><p>4) For some of the experiments more appropriate statistics should be used (see below).</p><p>Figure 1B-E: Repeated t-test is inappropriate.

We now changed the order as follows.</p><p>First, we better introduce the previous literature supporting a role for RalB role in human cancer invasion (Introduction, second paragraph), and we clearly state that the optogenetic approach is a tool to study the underlying molecular mechanisms (subsection “Optogenetic control for selective activation of Ral proteins”, first paragraph). Of course, optogenetic Ral activation must be performed in a wt Ras context, in which Ral is not abnormally stimulated; this is why we chose the HEK-HT cell model. We engineered our constructs in a way to activate Ral at the plasma-membrane because the literature indicates that Ral oncogenic signaling emanates at least in part from the plasma-membrane: the membrane-targeted murine RalGEF Rlf-CAAX transforms HEK-HT and BJ-HT human cells (Hamad et al., 2002; Lim et al., 2005); the expression of membrane-targeted human RalGDS-CAAX promotes metastasis of murine 3T3 cells in a tail vein injection assay (Ward et al., 2001).</p><p>Second, we describe the optogenetic experiments and conclusions on the cause-effect link between Ral activation (at the plasma-membrane), WRC recruitment, protrusion formation, and invasion (now adding results from a second in vitro invasion assay, new Figure 5B, 5D).</p><p>Third, we evaluate the relative contributions of Ral, MAPK and PI3K pathways, in an oncogenic Ras context, the HEK-HT-H-RasV12 cell model, finding that RalB pathway appears to be the major driver of Ras-dependent invasiveness, as shown by the V12G37 mutant and by pharmacological inhibitors (new Figure 5F).</p><p>Fourth, by a siRNA screen, we identified RGL1 and RGL2 as the missing molecular link between H-RasV12 and RalB for invasion. Consistently, we now show that oncogenic Ras drives recruitment of endogenous RGL2 and RalB at the cell plasma-membrane (new Figure 6B, 6C).</p><p>Fifth, we now add clinical data from breast cancer tissue samples, showing that RalB protein expression increases in a manner consistent with cancer progression (normal &lt; in situ &lt; invasive &lt; metastatic tissues) (new Figure 7).</p><p>We note that while the application of optogenetics led us to robust mechanistic conclusions, in the revised version a conspicuous amount of the reported results (3 out of 7 figures) do not rely on the optogenetic system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) For the initial observation they use H-RasV12.

Indeed, our future efforts go towards this direction. The point of this paper is that activation of Ral at plasma-membrane leads to invasiveness, without excluding other outputs, depending or not on the location of Ral activity.</p><p>As proposed by the reviewer, we studied RGL2 (and RalB) subcellular localization in HEK-HT versus H-RasV12 transformed cells: oncogenic Ras drives recruitment of endogenous RGL2 and RalB at the cell plasma-membrane (new Figure 6B, 6C), thus supporting the relevance of our choice to optogenetically activate Ral at the plasma-membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In this respect, the extent to which the optogenetic system using RGL2 Cdc25 domain resembles &quot;total&quot; RGL2 is doubtful.

We never meant to mimic RGL2 signaling using just its catalytic RalGEF Cdc25-like domain. We totally agree with the reviewer that very likely any other catalytic RalGEF Cdc25-like domain would yield a very similar outcome, i.e. protrusion and invasion. The choice of RGL2 was motivated by the fact that its minimal RalGEF Cdc25-like domain has been well characterized biochemically (Ferro et al., 2008), not because it was a hit in our screen. To avoid this misinterpretation we now present the results of the RalGEFs screen after the results of optogenetics. In fact, we exploited a minimal RalGEF domain and removed on purpose the regulatory sequences of RGL2, in order to assess the effects of only Ral activation at the plasma membrane, without stimulation of any other pathway. The fact that we see invasiveness just with a RalGEF domain shows that Ral activation per se (at the plasma-membrane) is sufficient for this outcome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Following this line of argument, it would help their case very much if they showed whether overexpression, or inducible expression, of RGL1/2 mimicked the results obtained with the optogenetic system with respect to the exocyst &gt; WRC recruitment.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the above explanations clarified the fact that our optogenetic system (at the plasma-membrane, with a minimal RalGEF Cdc25 domain) allows indeed the fine control of when and where we activate endogenous Ral, and for this reason it is superior to an overexpression approach of full-length RGL2 which might lead to uncontrolled/mislocalized Ral hyperactivation and/or dominant negative effects.

We now make this point clearer by specifying the genetics of OptoRal and OptoControl cells also in panels B and C of Figure 2, in addition to the main text (subsection “Optogenetic control for selective activation of Ral proteins”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2E: How reliable is the Sec5GBD-iRFP or PakGBD recruitment as a tool to measure Ral and Rac activity? This should be confirmed using a FRET biosensor or pulldown assays of active Rac or RalB.</p></disp-quote><p>Recruitment of GBD domains is a widely used strategy to follow GTPase activities by live imaging. PakGBD-iRFP was used in a previous work (Valon et al., 2015). Sec5GBD-iRFP was cloned for this work, using a Sec5GBD domain (aa 5-97) previously validated for Ral pull-down assays.</p><p>We agree that it is important to be sure that our approach activates RalB. We performed additional experiments: both pull-down assays (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) and a RalB FRET biosensor indicated (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1B) that light stimulates RalB activity in our OptoRal cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1C: What is the extra band at 110 kDa in the mCherry blot that shows up in both Opto control and Ral lysates?</p></disp-quote><p>The band is a non-specific band recognized by anti-Cherry antibodies.

However, for our purposes, we are interested in comparing each variable independently. We want to test i) the effect of changing light/dark variable on each cellular condition, ii) the effect of changing cellular condition variable in dark, and iii) the effect of changing cellular condition variable in light. We never compare two groups in which both conditions are changing, for example we do not test OptoControl dark versus OptoRal light. For these reasons we believe that the most appropriate test is One-way ANOVA.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have re-written the study and provided new data to generate a coherent and convincing case.</p><p>A minor experiment would be necessary to round up the whole story: authors speculate that the &quot;light-controlled stimulation of cell protrusions is essentially due to the activation of endogenous RalB, rather than RalA&quot;.
