vasopressin (AVP) increases in the hypothalamus, and this is accompanied by extension of the 3′ poly(A) tail of the AVP mRNA, and the up-regulation of the expression of RNA binding protein Caprin-2. Here we show that Caprin-2 binds to AVP mRNAs, and that lentiviral mediated shRNA knockdown of Caprin-2 in the osmotically stimulated hypothalamus shortens the AVP mRNA poly(A) tail at the same time as reducing transcript abundance. In a recapitulated in vitro system, we confirm that Caprin-2 over-expression enhances AVP mRNA abundance and poly(A) tail length. Importantly, we show that Caprin-2 knockdown in the hypothalamus decreases urine output and fluid intake, and increases urine osmolality, urine sodium concentration, and plasma AVP levels. Thus Caprin-2 controls physiological mechanisms that are essential for the body's response to osmotic stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09656.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09656.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09656.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are only able to work properly if they maintain a more or less constant balance of water and salts. In mammals, a hormone called arginine vasopressin regulates water and salt levels in the whole body. This hormone is made by cells in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus, and is then transported to the pituitary gland. When the level of water relative to the level of salts in the blood starts to drop (i.e., during dehydration), arginine vasopressin is released into the blood and travels to the kidneys where it acts as a signal to retain more water in the body.</p><p>However, if water levels continue to remain low, the stores of arginine vasopressin in the pituitary gland may run out and so more protein needs to be made in the hypothalamus. Like all proteins, arginine vasopressin is made by first copying a template encoded in a particular gene into a molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). During dehydration, the cells in the hypothalamus produce more of these corresponding mRNA molecules. Also, the mRNAs are slightly larger than normal because they have longer ‘polyA tails’ (structures added to the ends of all newly-made mRNAs). However, it was not clear how or why this happens.</p><p>Here, Konopacka et al. studied the production of arginine vasopressin in rats. The experiments show that a protein called Caprin-2 accumulates in hypothalamic neurons when rats are dehydrated. Furthermore, Caprin-2 is able to directly bind to the mRNA that encodes arginine vasopressin and is responsible for increasing the length of the polyA tail. To test whether this interaction is important for regulating the balance of water and salts, Konopacka et al. decreased the levels of Caprin-2 protein in the hypothalamus of live rats. When these rats became dehydrated, they had lower levels of the arginine vasopressin mRNA and these mRNAs had shorter polyA tails. Furthermore, the rats drank less water and urinated less than normal rats. Further experiments show that Caprin-2 helps to stabilize the structure of these mRNAs so that they accumulate in cells.</p><p>Together, Konopacka et al.'s findings show that Caprin-2 regulates the production of arginine vasopressin by interacting with and modifying its corresponding mRNA in the rat hypothalamus. The next challenge is to find out which other mRNAs in the hypothalamus are regulated by Caprin-2, and to determine their roles in the body.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09656.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09656.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>polyadenylation</kwd><kwd>osmoregulation</kwd><kwd>vasopressin</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/G006156/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Konopacka</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name><name><surname>Paton</surname><given-names>Julian</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J015415/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paton</surname><given-names>Julian</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097822/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Konopacka</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000866</institution-id><institution>Cardiff University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Konopacka</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004386</institution-id><institution>Universiti Malaya</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/MED/22 H-20001-E000086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Konopacka</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name><name><surname>Paton</surname><given-names>Julian</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004386</institution-id><institution>Universiti Malaya</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP011-13HTM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loh</surname><given-names>Su-Yi</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Caprin-2 is up-regulated in the rat hypothalamus by osmotic stress and controls vital homeostatic osmoregulatory mechanisms by altering the length of the poly(A) tail on arginine vasopressin mRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The maintenance of salt and water homeostasis is a sine qua non condition for the survival of all living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antunes-Rodrigues et al., 2004</xref>). In mammals, this process is centrally regulated by the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS), the source of the antidiuretic neuropeptide hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). The HNS consists of the large peptidergic magnocellular neurones (MCNs) of the hypothalamic supraoptic nuclei (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN), the axons of which course though the internal zone of the median eminence and terminate on blood capillaries of the posterior pituitary (PP) gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargmann, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burbach et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antunes-Rodrigues et al., 2004</xref>), a neuro–vascular interface through which the brain regulates peripheral organs in order to maintain homeostasis.</p><p>The biosynthesis of the AVP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brownstein et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burbach et al., 2001</xref>) starts with the translation of AVP-encoding messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) into a large precursor preprohormone that comprises a signal peptide (SP), the nine amino acid AVP moeity itself, the neurophysin II carrier molecule, and a C-terminal glycopeptide (copeptin) of unknown function. Delivery of AVP to the pituitary starts with the insertion of the preprohormone into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum with the removal of the SP. The resulting prohormone is folded then routed unidirectionally to the trans-Golgi network, where it is targeted specifically into the large dense core vesicle of the regulated secretory pathway. Whilst these granules are anterogradely transported some considerable distance towards the PP, the prohormone is processed to generate the biologically active, mature AVP, which is stored in PP axon terminals until mobilised for secretion into the systemic circulation. The rise in plasma osmolality that follows dehydration is detected by intrinsic MCN mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourque, 2008</xref>) and by specialised osmoreceptive neurons in the circumventricular organs such as the subfornical organ, which provide excitatory inputs to shape the firing activity of MCNs for hormone secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McKinley et al., 2004</xref>). Upon release, AVP travels through the blood stream to specific receptor targets located in the kidney where it promotes water reabsorption in the collecting duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breyer and Ando, 1994</xref>), and sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ares et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>As a consequence of the depletion of pituitary stores that accompanies a chronic osmotic stimulation, there is a need to synthesize more AVP. This starts with an increase in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murphy and Carter, 1990</xref>), which results in an increase in the abundance of both the precursor heteronuclear RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kondo et al., 2004</xref>) and the mature mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sherman et al., 1986</xref>). In addition, following the onset of an osmotic challenge, the AVP mRNA is subject to a curious post-transcriptional modification in the form of an increase in the length of the 3′ poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrazana et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zingg et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter and Murphy, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murphy and Carter, 1990</xref>). Until this report, the regulation and physiologiocal function of this poly(A) tail length increase were not understood.</p><p>In order to better understand the network of plastic events in the osmotically challenged SON and PVN, and in an attempt to identify novel regulatory players, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hindmarch et al., 2006</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yue et al., 2006</xref>) have used microarrays to ask how chronic osmotic stress evokes changes in the transcriptome. One of the genes found to be differentially up-regulated in the SON and PVN was cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein-2 (Caprin2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mutsuga et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hindmarch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yue et al., 2006</xref>), otherwise known as C1q domain containing 1 (C1qdc1), EEG1 and RNA granule protein 140 (RNG140). In these various guises, Caprin2 has been implicated in the inhibition of cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerbajinai et al., 2004</xref>), differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerbajinai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lorén et al., 2009</xref>), the enhancement of canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores and Zhong, 2015</xref>), and, as an RNA-binding protein, the maintenance of the dendritic structure in the adult vertebrate brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010</xref>).</p><p>We sought to understand the physiological role of Caprin2 in the function related plasticity exhibited following an osmotic challenge. Specifically, given that Caprin2 is an RNA binding protein, we tested the hypothesis that it may associate with AVP transcripts and hence mediate changes in poly(A) tail length and/or mRNA stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Caprin-2 expression is up-regulated by osmotic stress in rat AVP neurones</title><p>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis (qRT-PCR) was used to demonstrate robust up-regulation of Caprin-2 mRNA expression in the rat PVN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and SON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) following two different types of chronic osmotic stress—7 days of salt-loading (obligate consumption of 2% NaCl wt/vol in tap water) or 72 hr of dehydration (complete fluid deprivation).

In Ctrl rats, as in naïve rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greenwood et al., 2015</xref>), salt loading resulted in increases in urine output and fluid intake that were both attenuated by Cap KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

We show that Caprin-2 is expressed in AVP MCNs in the SON and PVN and that Caprin-2 expression in these neurons increases during osmotic stress. Importantly, we demonstrate that Caprin-2 knockdown in the SON and PVN disrupts physiological osmoregulatory mechanisms. Normally, chronic salt loading leads to a gradual increase of urine output and fluid intake. Loss of Caprin-2 significantly reduces the salt loading-induced urine output and fluid intake and increases urine osmolality, urine sodium concentration and plasma AVP levels.</p><p>We then explored the molecular mechanisms of Caprin-2 action in homeostatic osmoregulatory hypothalamic neuronal circuits. Caprin-2 has recently been identified in vitro as an RNA binding protein RNG140 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010</xref>). However, up until now, no specific RNA binding partners of Caprin-2 have been identified. Here we show that Caprin-2 binds to the AVP mRNA in the SON and PVN of EU and SL rats in vivo, and, in doing so, modulates both its abundance and poly(A) tail length.</p><p>By stimulating water retention at the level of the kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breyer and Ando, 1994</xref>), AVP plays a central role in the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis, particularly blood volume and osmolality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antunes-Rodrigues et al., 2004</xref>). The increase in AVP biosynthesis in MCNs that follows osmotic stimulation is accompanied by a plethora of changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mutsuga et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hindmarch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yue et al., 2006</xref>). One of the novel genes identified as such by transcriptome analysis was Caprin-2. Here we confirm the transcriptome data, and that Caprin-2 protein is up-regulated at the mRNA level by chronic hyperosmotic cues. Using double immunostaining we also provide evidence that Caprin-2 protein is present in the cytoplasm of VP MCNs, and that its expression increases during osmotic stress. Caprin-2 has been reported to play a role in several physiological processes, including differentiation, apoptosis in erythroblasts or lens fiber cells, and synaptic plasticity in the mouse cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerbajinai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lorén et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores and Zhong, 2015</xref>). Although expression of Caprin-2 in the HNS has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mutsuga et al., 2004</xref>), its role in the maintenance of fluid homeostasis had not previously been addressed. We therefore investigated the physiological consequences of Caprin-2 gene knockdown using virally delivered specific shRNAs in the SON and PVN in vivo. The Caprin-2 shRNA had no effect on water homeostasis in euhydrated rats. In naïve rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greenwood et al., 2015</xref>), and in rats transduced with a scrambled control shRNA, as shown here, salt loading results in production of large amounts of dilute urine and excessive fluid intake. However, compared to the control animals, salt loaded Caprin-2 knockdown rats only minimally increased their urine production and they drank less fluid. Urine osmolality and sodium levels were also higher in Caprin-2 knockdown rats. These observations may be explained by water retention resulting from the elevated plasma AVP levels found in the Caprin-2 shRNA-transduced rats. Our data suggest that Caprin-2 knockdown rats increase their ability to concentrate urine and so doing they prevent the decrease in sodium excretion (i.e., elevation of plasma sodium) resulting from lower urine output by producing more concentrated urine.</p><p>We then explored the molecular mechanisms of Caprin-2 action in the hypothalamus, based on our hypothesis that this RNA binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010</xref>) might associate with the AVP mRNA. Here we show that Caprin-2 does indeed bind to AVP mRNAs in the SON and PVN in vivo. We then asked if Caprin-2 binding has any role in the alterations in AVP mRNA metabolism that occur as a consequence of the chronic osmotic stimuli of dehydration or salt-loading, namely an increase in abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sherman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murphy and Carter, 1990</xref>), and the unusual post-transcriptional modification of an increase in the length of the 3′ poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrazana et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zingg et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter and Murphy, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murphy and Carter, 1990</xref>). Our in vivo studies show that knockdown of Caprin-2 in the rat SON and PVN prevented the salt-loading-induced increases in the abundance of the AVP mRNA, and the elongation of its poly(A) tail. In HEK293T cells transfected with a plasmid containing rat AVP genomic sequences under constitutive CMV promoter, concomitant overexpression of Caprin-2 increased AVP mRNA abundance, whilst addition of the Caprin-2 shRNA significantly reduced AVP mRNA levels. At the same time, Caprin-2 overexpression resulted in elongation of the poly(A) tail of the AVP mRNA, whilst Caprin-2 knockdown shortened the poly(A) tails of the AVP mRNA. The direct binding and positive regulation of AVP transcript levels suggest that Caprin-2 may be important for stabilization of AVP mRNAs during osmotic stress, in a similar way to another AVP mRNA binding protein, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mohr et al., 2002</xref>). It is thus tempting to speculate that the two processes, increased poly(A) tail length and increased mRNA abundance, are consequential. An important role of poly(A) tail length in regulation of mRNA degradation and stability has been demonstrated for many transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Curinha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). It is therefore possible that one of the functions of Caprin-2-mediated poly(A) tail length regulation is protection of AVP transcripts from degradation, which in turn would lead to the observed increase of AVP mRNA levels. Note that we are unable to distinguish between a process that promotes polyadenylation, or one that prevents deadenylation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, whilst Caprin-2 knockdown in the PVN and SON resulted in a decreased AVP mRNA levels in those structures, plasma AVP (peptide) levels increased. Although the precise mechanisms underlying this paradoxical effect require separate investigation, examination of the existing literature leads us to propose two possible hypotheses. Firstly, Caprin-2 binding to AVP mRNA might inhibit translation, a phenomenon observed as a consequence of other association mRNA-RNA-binding protein interactions, such as the binding of PABP to the AVP mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mohr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Richter, 2008</xref>). This is not necessarily in disagreement with the fact that Caprin-2 stimulates extension of poly(A) tail in AVP mRNAs—recent studies have revealed that a correlation between the length of poly(A) tail and translational activity is not always present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Weill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown previously that recombinant Caprin-2 inhibits the translation of a luciferase mRNA in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010</xref>). This is consistent with our observation that Caprin-2 knockdown in the SON and PVN increases circulating plasma AVP levels. It is conceivable that this effect results from the increased translation of AVP mRNA under conditions when Caprin-2 protein level is too low to suppress this process. Moreover, knockdown of Caprin-2, whilst increasing the translation of the AVP mRNA, might increase its turnover, and hence decreases steady state transcript levels and poly(A) tail length. We have previously examined the polysome distribution of the AVP mRNA in euhydrated and salt-loaded SON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murphy and Carter, 1990</xref>), and showed no difference in the pattern association with heavy polysome fractions. However, the AVP mRNA is small, and subject to a high rate of translation, even in euhydrated animals. Thus, the rates of translation initiation, elongation and termination, none of which are directly measured by polysome analysis, especially when the size of the RNA limits ribosome number, could be influenced, positively or negatively, by poly(A) tail length. Quantification of Caprin-2 and AVP levels in AVP in the SON neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) revealed that salt-loading elicits a significant increase in the former protein, but a significant decrease in the latter, consistent with Caprin-2 being an inhibitor of the translation of the AVP mRNA. However, it is important to point out the steady-state level of AVP in hypothalamic MCNs is not only determined by translation rate. As we describe in some detail in the Introduction, the AVP precursor is subject to axonal transport from cell bodies in the hypothalamus to terminals in the PP, a process that is activated by the need to deliver mature peptide to the circulation following an osmotic stimulus. Thus, further studies are needed to examine the translation of the AVP mRNA under different physiological conditions.</p><p>A second, but not mutually exclusive hypothesis is that the effects that we observe after Caprin-2 knockdown could be modulated by changes in dendritic release of AVP. Dendritic release and autocrine or paracrine action of AVP has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ludwig and Stern, 2015</xref>). AVP released from dendrites inhibits the electrical activity of AVP neurons, thus suppressing axonal release to the blood stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ludwig and Stern, 2015</xref>). Caprin-2 protein is present in the RNA granules localized in the rat neuronal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that Caprin-2 knockdown results in a decrease of the synthesis and dendritic release of AVP, which in turn decreases AVP-mediated auto-inhibition of AVP neurons and leads to an increase of AVP release in the neurohypophysis and increased plasma concentration, as we observe after Caprin-2 knockdown in the SON and PVN.</p><p>In this report, we have shown that, during an osmotic stimulus, three things happen to the AVP mRNA in the SON and PVN due to the action of Caprin-2: the abundance of Caprin-2 protein/AVP mRNA complexes increases, the AVP mRNA poly(A) tail elongates, and there is an increase in steady state levels of the AVP mRNA. On the basis of these data, we propose a new mechanism mediating the regulation of AVP gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Whilst it has previously been demonstrated that a chronic osmotic stimulus results in an increase in the transcription of the AVP gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murphy and Carter, 1990</xref>), the data presented here provides new evidence that post-transcriptional process, governed by Caprin-2, are also operative. Both the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional mechanisms would contribute to overall steady-state AVP mRNA abundance. However, it would appear that the increase in AVP mRNA mediated by Caprin-2 does not result in an increase in AVP peptide production. Indeed, our results are consistent with previous reports that showed that Caprin-2 inhibits translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010</xref>). Thus we suggest that association with Caprin-2 may inhibit the production of AVP peptide, perhaps by directly interfering with the translational apparatus, or through sequestration of AVP mRNA in translationally inert mRNP storage or transport granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchan, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, polysome analysis revealed a heavy class of EDTA-resistant AVP mRNA containing fractions that might represent storage granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murphy and Carter, 1990</xref>). We also note that AVP transcripts are known to be transported to dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mohr et al., 2002</xref>) and to axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murphy et al., 1989</xref>), although in the latter case, the AVP RNAs are characterised by a short poly(A) tail that does not change in length following osmotic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murphy et al., 1989</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09656.013</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A model for the actions of Caprin-2.</title><p>Caprin-2 expression increases in the rat SON and PVN following an osmotic stimulus.

Further, identification of the sequences within the AVP mRNA that are recognised by Caprin-2, and the Caprin-2 protein modules that mediate binding to the AVP mRNA and poly(A) tail extension, might reveal interactions with other known Caprin-2 functions, such as the modulation of Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores and Zhong, 2015</xref>) that may have regulatory and physiological relevance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and physiological manipulations</title><p>Male Sprague–Dawley rats (Harlan, UK) weighing ∼300 g were housed at a constant temperature of 22°C and a relative humidity of 50–60% (vol/vol) under a 14:10 hr light/dark cycle.

Oligonucleotides (c2784 Caprin-2 shRNA, top strand: 5′ GGGAGAGACCTTTGATCTTCATTCAAGAGATGAAGATCAAAGGTCTCTCCCTTTTTT 3′, bottom strand: 5′ AATTAAAAAAGGGAGAGACCTTTGATCTTCATCTCTTGAATGAAGATCAAAGGTCTCTCCCGGCC 3′; scrambled Ctrl shRNA, top strand: 5′ GCGTTAAGCGAGCATGTTCTATTCAAGAGATAGAACATGCTCGCTTAACGCTTTTTT 3′, bottom strand: 5′ AATTAAAAAAGCGTTAAGCGAGCATGTTCTATCTCTTGAATAGAACATGCTCGCTTAACGCGGCC 3′) containing the loop sequence TTCAAGAGA were purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon, Germany. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were cloned into the pSilencer 1.0—U6 vector (Ambion, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The efficiency of the specific Caprin-2 shRNA was tested in HEK293T/17 cells (human embryonic kidney cell line, CRL-11268, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) transiently overexpressing rat Caprin-2. The U6-shRNA sequences were then amplified from pSilencer 1.0-U6 (F 5′ ATAGATTTAATTAACACTATAGGGCGAATTGGGTA 3′, R 5′ AGTCTTTCTCGAGCCCGGGCTGCAGGAATTA 3′) then cloned into LV pRRL.sin.U6.shRNA.cppt.CMV.GFP.wpre. High titer LVs were propagated as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenwood et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Lentivirus-mediated Caprin-2 knockdown in the SON and PVN</title><p>Preliminary experiments were performed to assess the efficiency of Caprin-2 shRNA lentivirus transduction in vivo<italic>.</italic> Rats (300–340 g) were anaesthetized by i.m. administration of Domitor/Vetalar (Pfizer, New York City, NY, USA) and placed in a stereotaxic frame in the flat skull position. A 2 cm rostral-caudal incision was made to expose the surface of the skull. One 0.8 mm hole were drilled at co-ordinates 1.3 mm posterior to bregma and 1.95 mm left to the midline for SON injection. An additional one 1 mm hole was drilled at co-ordinates 1.8 mm posterior to bregma, and ±0.4 mm lateral to midline for PVN injection. A 5 µl pulled glass pipette (Sigma–Aldrich) was positioned −8.8 mm (SON) or −7.5 mm (PVN) ventral to the surface of the brain and 1 µl of LV at the concentration of 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> particles/ml, was delivered separately into each nucleus, over 5 min/nucleus. At the end of surgery the rats received an agonist Antisedan (Norden Laboratories, Lincoln, NE, USA) and analgesic Rimadyl (Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ, USA). After 3 weeks the animals were deeply anaesthetized (Lethobarb, Fort Dodge, IA, USA) and perfused with PBS and PFA, as described before. Brain samples were further fixed in 4% (wt/vol) PFA for 24 hr, cryoprotected in 30% (wt/vol) sucrose in PBS and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Coronal hypothalamic sections were stained with anti-GFP (Abcam), AVP NP-II (PS-41, kindly provided by Prof. Harold Gainer, NIH, Bethesda, USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Barak et al., 1985</xref>]) and Caprin-2 antibodies (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology) and the imaging was performed using fluorescent confocal microscope (Leica, Germany) as described earlier. Quantification analysis has been performed on the Z-stack and single-plane confocal microscope images obtained from the SON and PVN of 5 rats injected with scrambled (Ctrl) or Caprin-2 (Cap2 KD) shRNA, using Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Similar surgical procedure was performed for determination of physiological results of Caprin-2 knockdown, except that it involved bilateral injections into the SON and PVN. To this end two 0.8 mm holes were drilled at co-ordinates 1.3 mm posterior to bregma and 1.95 mm lateral to midline for SON injection and one 1 mm hole was drilled at co-ordinates 1.8 mm posterior to bregma, and ±0.4 mm lateral to midline for PVN injection, and 1 µl of LV at the concentration of 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> particles/ml, was delivered separately into four nuclei, over 5 min/nucleus. Like previously, at the end of surgery the rats received Antisedan (Norden Laboratories) and analgesic Rimadyl (Zoetis). After the surgery the animals were individually housed in standard laboratory cages for two and a half week before being transferred to metabolic cages (Techniplast, Italy), for precise daily measurements of fluid intake and urine output. Animals were weighed and allowed to acclimatize to the cage for 48 hr. Fluid intake, urine output, urine osmolality and body weights were recorded for 10 days, between 10–11 am. The animals received ad libitum water for the first 3 days, and 2% (wt/vol) NaCl for the next 7 days. At the end of the experiment the animals were culled by stunning and decapitation and trunk blood samples were collected and processed immediately for plasma isolation. Brain tissue was frozen in powdered dry ice and stored in −80°C for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. Accuracy of injections and Caprin-2 knockdown were confirmed by eGFP and Caprin-2 mRNA expression analysis in each individual SON and PVN using qRT-PCR. Two separate groups of animals were used. In the first group, individual Caprin-2 shRNA-injected nuclei with 25% or higher Caprin-2 knockdown (as compared to the average control, scrambled shRNA-injected PVNs or SONs) were retrospectively chosen for gene expression analysis. In the second group, rats with more than 30% of Caprin-2 gene knockdown in both SON and PVN (5 out of the 10 animals injected) were retrospectively chosen for analysis of physiological parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Measurement of urine sodium and osmolality</title><p>Urine osmolality was measured in 100 µl of 10×-diluted samples by freezing point depression using a Roebling micro-osmometer (Camlab, UK). Urine sodium levels were determined in 2 ml of 10×-diluted samples using Cole–Parmer Sodium Combination Epoxy Body Electrode (Vernon Hills, IL, USA) and Jenway 3310 pH/mV meter (UK). The ionic strength of standards and samples was adjusted with 4 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl/4 M NH<sub>4</sub>OH added in 1:50 ratio. Sodium concentration in samples was calculated from the calibration curve representing potentials (mV) recorded for 0.1–100 mM NaCl standards.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Determination of plasma osmolality and AVP concentration</title><p>Blood plasma was isolated from trunk blood collected after decapitation into chilled EDTA-treated plastic tubes (5 µl 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0/1 ml blood) and centrifuged at 1600×<italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C. 100 µl plasma samples were placed on ice and plasma osmolality was determined within 2 hr, as described before. The remaining plasma was aliquoted and stored in −80°C for AVP determination. AVP was extracted from 0.5 ml of plasma with acetone and petroleum ether and measured using arg8-Vasopressin EIA kit, according to the manufacturer protocol (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA immunoprecipitation assay</title><p>Tissue punches from the left and right SON or PVNs were cross-linked with 1% (vol/vol) formaldehyde (Sigma–Aldrich) in PBS, for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was terminated by 5 min incubation with 0.125 M glycine (pH 7.0) and samples were washed three times in PBS, using a centrifuge (5 min, 2000×<italic>g</italic>, 4°C). After homogenization in 100 μl of NT- RNA immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT), Complete protease inhibitor (Roche), 200 U/ml RNase Out (Invitrogen, USA) samples were incubated for 10 min on ice and pre-cleared with 25 μl of Protein G-coated Dynabeads (Life Technologies). Protein levels were determined using BCA method (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pierce, Waltham, MA, USA). First, we analyzed suitability of two different anti-Caprin-2 antibodies: rabbit (kindly provided by Prof. Lin Li, Shanghai, China) and goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), against non-specific rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and goat IgG specific to an irrelevant antigen DKK (Dickkopf-related protein 1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Both antibodies recognising Caprin-2 gave similar results. The data presented here was derived using the antibody raised in goat from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Tissue extracts containing 60 µg (PVN samples) or 30 µg (SON samples) of protein were incubated overnight on a rotating wheel at 4°C with either, goat anti-Caprin-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with non-specific goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a concentration ratio 1:8, in PBS buffer supplemented with RNase Out (200 U/ml) and Complete Protease Inhibitor. Extracts equivalent to 20% of each sample were preserved in −80°C for input mRNA analysis. Next, the protein—antibody extracts were incubated with G-protein Dynabeads (pre-washed with PBS and blocked with 10% BSA for 10 min at RT) for 2 hr, at 4°C, on a rotating wheel. After 3 washes with PBS, the protein-G-adsorbed complexes were washed out with 50 µl of the crosslinking reversal buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 200 U/ml RNase Out) at 70°C, for 45 min. All steps have been carried out in RNase-free environment, in a presence of RNase Out (washing buffers—50 U/ml, reaction buffers—200 U/ml) and Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche). Total RNA was isolated with 1 ml of Reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies), cleaned with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen) and eluted with 14 µl of water, of which 8 µl was treated with DNase I (Life Technologies) and used for qRT-PCR analysis, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Northern blot analysis of mRNA poly(A) tails</title><p>RNA extracted from SONs and PVNs of rats injected with lentiviruses and from the in vitro experiment on HEK cells was subjected to Northern blot analysis using Ambion NorthernMax kit (Life Technologies). Briefly, samples containing 300 ng of RNA were incubated for 15 min at 65°C with formaldehyde load dye containing ethidium bromide (10 µg/ml) and separated (5 V/cm) on 1% (wt/vol) agarose gel along with the BrightStar Biotinylated RNA Millenium marker (Life Technologies). The gel was exposed under UV light and photographed, then downward-transferred overnight to the BrightStar-Plus membrane and crosslinked for 2 min using a standard UV transilluminator. Quality of the transfer was assessed by visualizing the gel and the membrane under the UV light. Membrane was placed in the hybridization bag (Roche) and subjected to prehybridization, blocking and overnight hybridization at 37°C ULTRAhyb buffer. We used 100 pM oligonucleotide probes double biotinylated at the 5′ and the 3′ ends (Eurofins MWG Operon). The sequences of the anti-sense (AS) oligonucleotide probes used are as follows:</p><p>rAVP-AS–5′ GTAGACCCGGGGCTTGGCAGAATCCACGGACTCTTGTGTCCCAGCCAG 3′,</p><p>rGAPDH-AS–5′ CCAGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGACGCCAGTAGACTCCACGACA 3′.</p><p>After washing in low stringency solution (2 × SSC, 0.1% wt/vol SDS), the signal was developed using the chemiluminescent BrightStart BioDetect kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, USA) and captured on Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare, UK). At the end the probes were stripped by dipping membranes in boiling DEPC-treated water with 0.1% SDS until they reach RT, and re-probed for GAPDH.</p><p>To determine if the observed changes in the size of AVP mRNA were associated with changes in the length of their poly(A) tails, in parallel we performed Northern blot analysis on samples subjected to poly(A) tail removal. 200 ng of RNA was incubated with oligo(dT<sub>12–18</sub>) primers (Life Technologies) for 5 min at 85°C to denature RNA, followed by 10 min hybridization at 42°C and slow cooling (1°C/min) to 32°C. Double-stranded poly(A) tails were then digested with 3.75 U of RNase H (New England Biolabs) at 37°C for 30 min. Samples were cleaned with 1 volume of phenol-chloroform, precipitated for 30 min at −20°C with 20 µg/ml of linear polyacrylamide (Ambion, Life Technologies), 10% (vol/vol) of 5 M ammonium acetate and 2 vol of 100% (vol/vol) ethanol and centrifuged at 12,000×<italic>g</italic>, 4°C for 20 min. After cleaning with ethanol the RNA pellet was resuspended in 20 µl of formaldehyde load dye containing ethidium bromide (10 µg/ml, Sigma–Aldrich), incubated for 15 min at 65°C and separated in agarose gel alongside the non-digested samples as described before. RNase-free conditions were maintained throughout the whole protocol. Molecular sizes of the RNA bands were calculated based on the migration distances of the ladder bands in each individual gel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>In vitro studies</title><p>HEK 293T/17 cells (ATCC, USA) were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 300,000 cells/well in DMEM high glucose media (Sigma–Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1× NEAA (Sigma–Aldrich).

Previous studies by this lab have shown that Caprin-2 mRNA level is induced in response to osmotic challenges. In the present manuscript they show that the induction of Caprin-2 protein is important to maintain physiological responses to osmotic stimuli (i.e. fluid intake and urine output, osmolality and sodium concentration). They associate this response to the regulation of AVP levels by Caprin-2. Thus, they show that Caprin-2, which is a known RNA-binding protein, forms a complex with AVP mRNA following osmotic challenge. Through a set of experiments using shRNA knockdown and/or overexpression of Caprin-2 in vivo and in vitro they show that the binding of Caprin-2 to AVP affects the levels of AVP mRNA via regulation of AVP's poly(A) tail elongation.</p><p>The reinstatement of AVP levels in the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) following chronic osmotic stimulation is critical for the organism's survival as AVP is the major regulator of water balance. Murphy and others previously reported that at the onset of an osmotic challenge AVP mRNA is subjected to an increase in the length of the poly(A) tail, which may affect AVP levels in neurons. In the present manuscript they provide a mechanism for this post-transcriptional modification and associate it to a critical physiological response.</p><p>Although the reviewers appreciate the importance of the work, they have raised a number of specific concerns that need to be addressed for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. These are listed in the “Essential revisions” section. There are also a number of recommendations that the authors feel would strengthen the manuscript but are not essential and these are listed in the “Optional revisions” section.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is standard in studies using siRNAs or shRNAs to rule out off target effects. This is typically done by showing that a second, unrelated siRNA or shRNA against the same target has a similar effect. The authors need to show that a second shRNA against Caprin-2, which is unrelated to the first Caprin-2 shRNA, has a similar effect in the key experiments/figures in this study. Alternatively, they can perform a “rescue” experiment involving ectopic expression of a Caprin-2 cDNA that is resistant to knockdown by the shRNA.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: There needs to be some control for RNA binding specificity to rule out the possibility that Caprin 2 is a non-specific RNA binding protein. The most straightforward approach is to perform the RIP experiment with some other negative control RNA such as GAPDH.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Does the AVP antibody recognize AVP NP-II precursor peptide? If so, it should be labeled AVP NP-II, not just AVP. The experiments here should include the qPCR quantification of AVP mRNA along with Cap2 mRNA in SON and PVN isolated from EU, SL and DH rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). The immunostaining data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and 1D</xref> need to be quantified, so both protein and RNA levels of Cap2 and AVP in SON and PVN of EU, SL and DH rats can be compared side-by-side to provide a initial hint whether a change in translation efficiency may contribute to increased AVP synthesis. Alternatively, is it possible to divide the SON and PVN lysates to isolate RNAs for RT-qPCR and to prepare protein samples for western blotting? The images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> seem to suggest that AVP-immunostained signal is weaker in SL than EU-stimulated SON. Moreover, osmotic stress-increased Cap2 but not AVP protein is more widely occurred in SON and PVN MCN neurons. Is this true? The authors claimed this is a “Caprin-2-like” signal. What does this mean? Are the authors not sure this signal is really Caprin-2? Some neurons with high AVP signal did not necessarily have high Cap2 signal, vice versa. Are Cap2 also up-expressed in non-AVP neurons in response to osmotic stress or some AVP secreted already?</p><p>In the figure legend, description of PVN (PVN 1.03 ± 0.04…) and SON (SON 1.01 ± 0.07…) data should be switched to follow the order of subfigures. For example, “Co-localization with AVP and OT” – what is OT? Oxytoxin? This abbreviation is also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> but the entire manuscript does not address oxytoxin at all. In addition, scale bar of 100 μm is not marked in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: The control and Cap2 KD images are in different magnification without scale bars. Moreover, it is not clear why GFP is localized in the cytoplasm of Cap2 KD neurons but diffusely distributed in control neurons. Does “n” mean the number of animals? If so, why the number here is far more than the number of animals (Cap2 KD, n=5) used for physiology characterization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>? As the authors claimed, only the physiological data from rats with more than 30% of Cap2 KD in both SON and PVN were chosen for subsequent analysis. Does this mean that only 5 animals out of 11-26 (2a, n=11; 2c, n=26) rats injected with siCap2 lentivirus fit in this criteria? Here, we did not see a decrease or increase in AVP-immunostained signal in Cap2 KD neurons in 2b images. Is this true? The authors should quantify not just Cap2 but also AVP-immunostained signal.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is a misleading figure. The data only demonstrated that Cap2 is in complex with AVP RNA in the RIP assay. Does Cap2 also bind to OT RNA? Otherwise, please remove OT RNA in the legend. Because SL increases the amounts of Cap2 protein and AVP RNA and the amount of immunoprecipitated Cap2 proteins under EU and SL conditions was not shown to see whether “the effect of SL on AVP mRNA binding” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> is indeed increased. Such an increase in 4B could be simply caused by more input AVP RNA and more precipitated Cap2 protein and has nothing to do with increased binding under SL condition. In addition, RIP data alone is insufficient to draw the conclusion “Cap2 binds to AVP RNA”. The content of data in this figure is too little to stand alone.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: A large fraction of poly(A) tail is not influenced by altering Cap2 expression because the presence of oligo(dT) and RNase H further reduced the size of AVP RNA (5C, 5C'). Please specify the poly(A) tail length (looks like is more than 100-150-bp) that is not affected by Cap2.</p><p>7) In the Discussion, please clarify the sentence: “These observations may be explained by water retention resulting from the elevated plasma AVP levels found in the Caprin-2 shRNA-transduced rats.”</p><p>The authors explain that paradoxically increased plasma AVP could be due to increased osmolarity. If so, could authors directly measure the AVP content from posterior pituitary where MCN-synthesized AVP was first delivered to. It is still confusing whether Cap2 KD directly alters (increases or decreases) AVP peptide production and whether the aberrant physiological responses in SL-stimulated Cap2 KD rats could be explained by elevated AVP action?</p><p>Optional revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: Please provide western blot of Cap2 in KD and overexpression conditions. In addition, can the protein level of AVP be detected by nonapeptide ELISA (used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) or immunofluorescence labeling by the antibody detecting AVP NP-II (used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>)?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: Does the AVP RNA with shorter or longer poly(A) tail distributed differentially in the polysome profile? Moreover, this figure should be combined with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and the protein levels of Cap2 and AVP should be measured by western blotting/ ELISA/ immunostaining (whichever is appropriate to detect Cap2 and AVP) and included in this figure. Can overexpression of an RNA binding-defective Cap2 mutant not affect poly(A) tail of AVP RNA?</p><p>3) If HEK 293 cells can recapitulate the relation of AVP RNA and Cap2 observed in SON and PVN, whether expression of Cap2 promotes polyadenylation or inhibits deadenylation of AVP RNA and whether AVP RNAs with long or short poly(A) tail distribute differently in polysomes could be simply tested in this system. The authors should consider the molecular approaches used to study polyadenylation, deadenylation and translation efficiency in cells to experimentally test these possibilities without extensive speculations in the Discussion section. This is important since the authors found a paradoxical increase in circulating AVP peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) that is not in conceptual accordance with decreased poly(A) tail and stability of AVP RNA found in SON and PVN. Despite Bartel's genome-wide study did not show strong correlation between poly(A) tail (at the steady state) and translation efficiency, their results do not rule out that translation efficiency of any given RNA can be influenced by</p><p>ongoing polyadenylation or deadenylation events. For example, the authors (along with many published studies) observed the strong correlation between the change in poly(A) length of AVP RNA in vivo as a function of the degree of physiological responses by altering AVP expression. However, Cap2 is only able to affect a portion of poly(A) tail (∼20-30 bp out of ∼160 bp under KD condition) in response to osmotic stress. Thus, the change in AVP expression is likely influenced by polyadenylation or deadenylation event itself instead of poly(A) length.</p><p>4) The authors claimed that they are unable to distinguish the role of Cap2 between a process that promotes polyadenylation or one that prevents deadenylation. Because the authors can recapitulate Cap2 effect in the poly(A) length of AVP RNA in HEK293 cells, it is doable tasks to delineate the role of Cap2 in these two aspects of regulation.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: The big puzzle here is that the increased plasma AVP (detecting the mature AVP nonapeptide by ELISA) in Cap2 KD SL rats did not evoke stronger physiological responses than control SL rats. Can this measurement be done using blood withdrawal from rats at SL1 and SL3 besides SL7? How about the expression levels of AVP and Cap2 in posterior pituitary since the earlier study showed that poly(A) elongation of AVP RNA is only in hypothalamus but not in posterior pituitary?</p><p>6) Related to point 2, it is important to at least roughly map the position of the caprin-2 binding site on the AVP mRNA. Most likely it will be near the 3' end. Mapping can be accomplished by performing RIP or CLIP using region specific primer-pairs and/or by in vitro RNA-protein binding experiments.</p><p>7) A schematic model that summarizes the main findings would be helpful.</p><p>8) The section “Cloning and characterization of rat brain Caprin-2 mRNA isoforms” interrupts the flow of the text. It is more appropriate for the Methods section.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>: Scale bars are missing.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: The upper and lower panels (Control and shRNA) should be presented at the same magnification. Also, there is no annotation of the colors used to label Caprin and AVP.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: Histograms “a” and “b” are confusing. It is not clear that “a” is Caprin-2 binding of AVP mRNA Vs. Ig control whereas “b” is Caprin-2 binding of AVP mRNA in ehuhydrated vs. salt loaded animals. We would consider omitting “a”. A schemata depicting the RNA pull-down procedure would be helpful.</p><p>12) The reviewers suggest changing the subheading “Caprin-2 regulates AVP…in vitro” to “Caprin-2 directly regulates AVPin vitro”</p><p>13) In the Discussion the authors write: “Salt loading increases the amount of AVP mRNA bound to Caprin-2. This can be attributed both to the increases in Caprin-2 protein levels and the abundance of AVP mRNAs.” One of the reviewers found this confusing because the increased Caprin-2 protein levels are responsible for the AVP mRNA abundance. Thus, this is one not two phenomena, and the word “both” is confusing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09656.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) It is standard in studies using siRNAs or shRNAs to rule out off target effects.

Mapping can be accomplished by performing RIP or CLIP using region specific primer-pairs and/or by in vitro RNA-protein binding experiments.</italic></p><p>Although interesting, these experiments are also beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p><italic>7) A schematic model that summarizes the main findings would be helpful.</italic></p><p>A schematic model has been included (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p><italic>8) The section “Cloning and characterization of rat brain Caprin-2 mRNA isoforms” interrupts the flow of the text. It is more appropriate for the Methods section.</italic></p><p>This has been moved as suggested.</p><p><italic>9)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2"><italic>Figures 1 and 2</italic></xref><italic>: Scale bars are missing.</italic></p><p>This has been corrected.</p><p><italic>10)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref><italic>: The upper and lower panels (Control and shRNA) should be presented at the same magnification.

It is not clear that “a” is Caprin-2 binding of AVP mRNA Vs. Ig control whereas “b” is Caprin-2 binding of AVP mRNA in ehuhydrated vs. salt loaded animals. We would consider omitting “a”. A schemata depicting the RNA pull-down procedure would be helpful.</italic></p><p>We have omitted (a) at the suggestion of the referee.

This has been done.</p><p><italic>13) In the Discussion the authors write: “Salt loading increases the amount of AVP mRNA bound to Caprin-2. This can be attributed both to the increases in Caprin-2 protein levels and the abundance of AVP mRNAs.” One of the reviewers found this confusing because the increased Caprin-2 protein levels are responsible for the AVP mRNA abundance. Thus, this is one not two phenomena, and the word “both” is confusing.</italic></p><p>The referee makes a good point. This text has been cut so as to avoid confusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
