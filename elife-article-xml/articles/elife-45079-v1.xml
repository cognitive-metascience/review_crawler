Retrospective studies of natural zoonoses and passaging in the lab have identified a modest number of host-adaptive mutations. However, it is unclear if these mutations represent all ways that influenza can adapt to a new host. Here we take a prospective approach to this question by completely mapping amino-acid mutations to the avian influenza virus polymerase protein PB2 that enhance growth in human cells. We identify numerous previously uncharacterized human-adaptive mutations. These mutations cluster on PB2’s surface, highlighting potential interfaces with host factors. Some previously uncharacterized adaptive mutations occur in avian-to-human transmission of H7N9 influenza, showing their importance for natural virus evolution. But other adaptive mutations do not occur in nature because they are inaccessible via single-nucleotide mutations. Overall, our work shows how selection at key molecular surfaces combines with evolutionary accessibility to shape viral host adaptation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45079.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses copy themselves by hijacking the cells of an infected host, but this comes with some limitations. Cells from different species have different molecular machinery and so viruses often have to specialize to a narrow group of species. This specialization consists largely of fine-tuning the way that viral proteins interact with host proteins.</p><p>For instance, in bird flu viruses, a protein known as PB2 does not interact well with the machinery in human cells. Because PB2 proteins form part of the viral polymerase (the structure that copies the viral genome), this prevents bird flu viruses from replicating efficiently in humans. Sometimes however, changes in the PB2 protein allow bird flu viruses to better replicate in humans, potentially leading to deadly flu pandemics.</p><p>To understand exactly how this happens, researchers have previously used two approaches: examining the changes that have happened in past flu viruses, and monitoring the evolution of bird flu viruses grown in human cells in the lab. However, these approaches can only look at a small number of the many possible genetic changes to the virus. This makes it hard to anticipate the new ways that flu might adapt to human cells in the future.</p><p>To overcome this problem, Soh et al. systematically created all of the single changes to the bird flu PB2, altering every element of the protein sequence one-by-one. They then tested which of the changes to PB2 helped the virus grow better in human cells. The modifications that made the viruses thrive were on the surface of the protein, suggesting that they might improve interaction with the cell machinery of the host. Some changes have been found in bird flu viruses that have recently jumped into humans in nature, although fortunately none of these viruses have yet spread widely to cause a pandemic.</p><p>Many factors affect the evolution of viruses, and their ability to infect new species. Understanding which changes in proteins help these microbes adapt to new hosts is an important element that scientists could consider to assess future risks of pandemics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>deep mutational scanning</kwd><kwd>host jump</kwd><kwd>PB2</kwd><kwd>cross-species transmission</kwd><kwd>pandemic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI127893</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedford</surname><given-names>Trevor</given-names></name><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM119774-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedford</surname><given-names>Trevor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2271-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soh</surname><given-names>Y Q Shirleen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedford</surname><given-names>Trevor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mahan Postdoctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soh</surname><given-names>Y Q Shirleen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Complete mapping of human-adaptive mutations to the avian influenza PB2 protein shows how selection at key molecular interfaces combines with evolutionary accessibility to shape viral host adaptation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viruses are exquisitely adapted to interact with host-cell machinery to facilitate their replication. Despite significant differences in this machinery across host species, some viruses like influenza can evolve to infect divergent hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parrish et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Webster et al., 1992</xref>). Such zoonotic transmissions can have severe public health consequences: transmission of influenza virus from birds or pigs to humans has resulted in four pandemics over the last century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taubenberger and Kash, 2010</xref>). These pandemics require the virus to adapt to the new host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Long et al., 2019</xref>). Delineating how viruses adapt to new hosts will aid in our ability to understand what determines if a chance zoonotic infection evolves into a human pandemic.</p><p>One critical determinant of influenza host range is the viral polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Long et al., 2019</xref>), which transcribes and replicates the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eisfeld et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016</xref>). Avian influenza polymerases perform poorly in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cauldwell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mänz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Massin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naffakh et al., 2000</xref>). This host range restriction likely arises from the need for the viral polymerase to interact with host proteins such as importin-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Resa-Infante and Gabriel, 2013</xref>) and ANP32A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Long et al., 2016</xref>), which differ between avian and mammalian hosts. However, it remains unclear exactly how the molecular interfaces between the polymerase and these host proteins are altered during adaptation to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Long et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Studies of natural zoonoses and experimental passaging of viruses in the lab have identified a number of mutations that adapt avian influenza polymerases to mammalian hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bussey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cauldwell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cauldwell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Finkelstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gabriel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mänz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mehle and Doudna, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miotto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mok et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naffakh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reperant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Taft et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tamuri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). The best known of these mutations is E627K in the PB2 subunit of the polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Subbarao et al., 1993</xref>). This mutation alone significantly improves avian influenza polymerase activity in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Long et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Massin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mehle and Doudna, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naffakh et al., 2000</xref>), and was considered a key step in adaptation to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taubenberger et al., 2005</xref>). But surprisingly, the recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic lineage lacks the E627K mutation. Instead, it has acquired mutations to PB2 at sites 590 and 591 that similarly confer improved polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mehle and Doudna, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>). This fact underscores the possibility that natural evolution has explored only a small fraction of the possible host-adaptation mutations. Examining only the currently available instances of adaptation in nature or the lab may therefore overlook additional mechanisms of adaptation and evolutionary paths to future zoonoses.</p><p>Here, we map all single amino-acid mutations to an avian influenza PB2 protein that enhance growth in human cells versus avian cells. We do so by leveraging deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boucher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fowler and Fields, 2014</xref>), which previously has only been used to measure the functional effects of mutations to several influenza proteins in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doud and Bloom, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wu et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wu et al., 2014b</xref>). We show that comparative deep mutational scanning in human versus avian cells identifies numerous human-adaptive mutations that have never before been described. These mutations cluster on the surface of the PB2 protein, highlighting potential interfaces with host factors. Some of these mutations are enriched in avian-human transmission of H7N9 influenza, demonstrating the utility of our experiments for anticipating PB2’s adaptation in nature. The human-adaptive mutations that have not been observed in nature are often inaccessible by single-nucleotide mutations. Overall, our complete map of human-adaptive mutations sheds light on how species-specific selection and evolutionary accessibility shape influenza virus’s evolution to new hosts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deep mutational scanning of an avian influenza PB2</title><p>To identify host-adaptation mutations in PB2, we used deep mutational scanning to measure the effects of all amino-acid mutations to this protein in both human and avian cells.

To quantify the functional selection on each mutation during viral growth, we deep sequenced the initial plasmid mutant libraries and the passaged mutant viruses to measure the frequency of mutations before and after selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). All experiments were also performed in parallel on virus carrying wild-type PB2 as a control to quantify the rate of errors arising during sequencing, library preparation, and viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>).</p><p>To assess the efficacy of selection without the complication of errors arising from sequencing and passaging, we examined the post-selection frequency of stop and nonsynonymous mutations accessible by &gt;1 nucleotide substitution. Stop and nonsynonymous mutations fell to 2–7% and 26–35% of their initial frequencies respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>). In contrast, synonymous mutations remained at 68–87% of their initial frequency. Therefore, the experiments effectively selected for functional PB2 mutants.</p><p>We quantified selection at the amino-acid level in terms of the ‘preference’ of each site in the protein for each amino acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloom, 2015</xref>). The preference for an amino acid is proportional to its enrichment during functional selection. We assessed the reproducibility of our experiments across biological replicates by examining the correlations of preferences for all 14,421 amino acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Biological replicates passaged in each cell type were well correlated (Pearson’s <italic>R</italic> in human cells was 0.74 to 0.79; Pearson’s <italic>R</italic> in avian cells was 0.76 to 0.79), and were generally better correlated within cell types than between cell types (Pearson’s <italic>R</italic> between cell types was 0.67 to 0.78). For downstream analyses, we rescaled our preferences to match the stringency of selection in nature (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Experimental measurements are consistent with natural selection and known functional constraints on PB2</title><p>Our experiments reflect known functional constraints on PB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, the start codon shows a strong preference for methionine in both human and avian cells. PB2’s cap-binding function is mediated by a hydrophobic cluster of five phenyalanines (F404, F323, F325, F330, F363), H357, E361, and K376 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guilligay et al., 2008</xref>). Phenylalanines are strongly preferred in the hydrophobic cluster in both host cell types, with the exception of site 323, which also tolerates aliphatic hydrophobic residues in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). E361 is also strongly preferred in both cell types, as is K376 in the duck cells. A number of other amino acids are tolerated at site 376 in human cells, and at site 357 in both cell types. At site 357, aromatic residues tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are preferred in addition to histidine, consistent with previous observations that the H357W substitution enhances binding to the m<sup>7</sup>GTP base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guilligay et al., 2008</xref>).

Thus, our experimentally measured preferences largely agree with what is known about PB2 structure and function, and further suggest that functional constraints at these critical sites are similar in both human and avian cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45079.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Functional constraints on PB2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The amino acid preferences measured in human and avian cells for key regions of PB2: the start codon, sites involved in cap-binding, and sites comprising the nuclear localization sequence (NLS).

These protein-wide measures of mutational tolerance are also consistent with natural sequence variation. Natural variation is generally low in natural avian sequences, probably because influenza A virus is highly adapted to avian hosts so there is little pressure for additional adaptation. Natural variation is generally higher in natural human sequences, likely because of increased genetic diversity generated as a result of directional selection to adapt to the human host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">dos Reis et al., 2011</xref>), and diversifying selection to escape immune selection on PB2-derived T-cell epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assarsson et al., 2008</xref>).

We focused on the 34 mutations most adaptive in our human cell selection (differential selection &gt;1.5 and mutational effect in human cells &gt; 1). Among these 34 mutations, only one (D701N) has already been described as human adaptive. The E627K mutation is favored in human cells in our experiments, though it is not in this set of top 34 mutations. However, two other mutations at this site (E627C and E627S) are among the top 34 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). S627 is naturally encoded by bat influenza and, in the context of bat influenza polymerase, supports high polymerase activity in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tong et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, it appears that many mutations at site 627 are human adaptive, with the exception of E627D. These observations are consistent with prior findings that a wide range of amino acid residues can be accommodated at site 627, and in fact improve polymerase activity in human HEK293T cells over the consensus avian wild-type glutamic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chin et al., 2014</xref>). We additionally identified 42 mutations as adaptive in avian cells (differential selection &lt;-2 and mutational effect in avian cells &gt; 1), and seven mutations that are more favorable than the wild-type amino acid in both cell types (mutational effect &gt;1 in both human and avian cells).</p><p>From these top adaptive mutations identified in our deep mutational scanning, we chose 26 for experimental validation.

We prioritized mutations that had consistent measurements across biological replicates. When there were multiple strongly adaptive mutations at a site, we chose just one mutation at that site to test mutations across more sites. Finally, we also validated additional mutations of particular interest, such as the only mutation at site 627 (E627D) that appeared to be favored in avian over human cells (negative differential selection), and mutations observed in avian-to-human transmission of H7N9 influenza (see below for more details).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Human-adaptive mutations identified in deep mutational scanning improve polymerase activity and viral growth in human cells</title><p>The main function of the influenza polymerase is to transcribe and replicate the viral genome.

We selected some mutations that increased transcriptional activity, and others that had no effect of transcriptional activity. Our rationale in these choices was to determine if mutations that were identified in our screen but did not increase transcriptional activity still resulted in improved viral growth in human over avian cells. For each competition, we infected human (A549) and avian (CCL-141) cells with mutant and wild-type viruses mixed at a 1:1 ratio of transcriptionally active particles as determined by flow cytometry for HA expression in infected cells. We then measured the frequencies of mutant to wild-type virus by deep sequencing. To measure kinetics of viral genome replication from a single round of infection, we infected cells at MOI of 0.1, collected samples at 10 hr post infection, and sequenced vRNA from cellular extract. To measure multi-cycle replication kinetics, we infected cells at MOI of 0.01, collected samples at 48 hr post infection, and sequenced vRNA from the supernatant. At the end of the infection, we calculated the ratio of mutant to wild-type virus in human cells divided by the same ratio in avian cells. Because this quantity is a ratio of ratios, it corrects for any possible deviations from a 1:1 ratio of infectious particles in the initial inoculum. Therefore, ratios greater than one indicates that the mutation confers a relative benefit for viral growth in avian versus human cells.</p><p>Almost all putative human-adaptive mutations identified in the deep mutational scanning improved growth in human over avian cells, as reflected by an increase in the ratio of mutant to wild type in human cells versus avian cells over the time course of the competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). Of the putative human-adaptive mutations that did not improve polymerase activity, one mutation, R355G, improved growth in human over avian cells at both 10 and 48 hr post-infection. An additional mutation, R355K, slightly improved growth in human cells by 48 hr post-infection. These two mutations may therefore confer a human-specific growth benefit due to some mechanism other than polymerase activity.

Experimentally identified sites 69 and 82 are located on the surface close to sites 64 and 81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: ii), which are located near the template exit channel and were recently shown to modulate generation of mini viral RNAs that act as innate-immune agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Te Velthuis et al., 2018</xref>). Experimentally identified site 698 is located near known sites 701 and 702 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gabriel et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: iii, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>: i). Experimentally identified mutations are also located in regions not yet identified to be important for host-adaptation: we find a cluster of experimentally identified sites on the surface of the PB2-N terminal domain (169, 176, 183, 190, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: iv), partially occluded by the flexible PA endonuclease domain in the transcription pre-initiation structure. Experimentally identified sites 163 and 182 are not surface exposed, but are buried right underneath the cluster of four sites.</p><p>Almost all sites that are not highly surface exposed in the transcription pre-initiation conformation of the polymerase become exposed upon conformational rearrangement of the polymerase from the transcription pre-initiation form to the apo form (PDB: 5D98) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hengrung et al., 2015</xref>). The experimentally identified sites 521 and 522 which face the product exit channel, site 355 which faces the core of the polymerase, and site 669 which faces PB1 in the transcription pre-initiation structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: v – vii), are more fully surface-exposed in the apo structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>: ii – iv). However, some sites remain inaccessible: site 156 faces the internal core of the polymerase in both transcription pre-initiation and apo forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: viii, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>: v). Therefore, with only a few exceptions, the human-adaptive mutations cluster in patches on the surface of PB2. Taking a comprehensive approach has therefore allowed us to map surfaces of PB2 that might mediate host-interactions.</p><p>Next, we asked if host-adaptation mutations occur at known interaction interfaces with host proteins. One known interacting host protein is importin-α, which mediates nuclear import of PB2 and has been proposed to have a role in viral transcription and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Resa-Infante et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tarendeau et al., 2007</xref>). PB2 of avian viruses uses importin-α3 in human cells, whereas PB2 of mammalian-adapted viruses uses importin-α7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gabriel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gabriel et al., 2008</xref>). We mapped total positive differential selection on each site of PB2 (see legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), and asked how this selection on PB2 relates to its interaction with importin-α. Sites on PB2 that interact with the major and minor NLS-binding surfaces of importin-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pumroy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tarendeau et al., 2007</xref>) generally have low differential selection, indicating that host-adaptation mutations do not occur at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; PDB: 4UAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pumroy et al., 2015</xref>). This is expected, since all importin-α isoforms share an invariant NLS-binding surface. However, adjacent PB2 sites have higher differential selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>: i-iii). Some of these PB2 sites are in close proximity to regions of importin-α that differ between the α−7 and α−3 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>: i, iii), suggesting that adaptation at these PB2 sites affects importin-α usage.</p><p>PB2 also interacts with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, and this interaction is proposed to stabilize the polymerase in the transcription-competent conformation (PDB: 6F5O) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Serna Martin et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to what we observe with importin-α, PB2 sites thought to directly interact with RNA polymerase II tend to have low differential selection, whereas adjacent PB2 sites have higher differential selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, it appears that host adaptation may involve mutations at sites adjacent to the core residues that directly interact with host proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Experimentally defined human-adaptive mutations are enriched in avian-to-human transmission of H7N9 influenza</title><p>A challenge in the surveillance of non-human influenza and assessment of pandemic risk is determining which of the many mutations that occur during viral evolution are human-adaptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lipsitch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Russell et al., 2014</xref>).

Indeed, human mutations more often had high differential selection (a value &gt;0.5) than avian mutations (Fisher’s exact test, p=2.69e-7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The H7N9 human mutations with differential selection &gt;0.5 include the well-studied human-adaptive mutations 627K and 701N. Indeed, these two mutations make up the majority of H7N9 human mutations with high differential selection. But we also identified a number of other mutations with high differential selection that occurred at least four independent times in jumps of H7N9 influenza into humans: 627V, 534F, 355K, and 521I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>–5, 6B, 3D), only one of which has been previously characterized (E627V, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Taft et al., 2015</xref>). A second mutation at site 355 (355G) with high differential selection also occurs during jumps of H7N9 influenza into humans.

Our results separate the constraints on PB2 into those that are maintained across cells from diverse species versus those that are specific to human or avian cells. The vast majority of sites are under extremely similar constraint in human and avian cells, including at residues already known to be critical for PB2 function. Layered upon this conserved constraint are mutations with host-specific effects. Our approach therefore represents a powerful strategy for mapping viral determinants of cross-species transmission.</p><p>The viral determinants of influenza host specificity in the PB2 protein have been intensely studied for decades. Earlier studies addressing this question focused on mutations that have fixed during viral adaptation in nature or in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bussey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cauldwell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Finkelstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gabriel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mänz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mehle and Doudna, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miotto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mok et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naffakh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tamuri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). Recent studies have sampled more mutations by random mutagenesis at key sites such as positions 627, 701, and 702 of PB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chin et al., 2017</xref>), or error prone PCR across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Taft et al., 2015</xref>). We can now place these previously characterized mutations in the context of a complete map, thus revealing how selection at molecular interfaces and evolutionary accessibility shapes influenza’s adaptation to humans.</p><p>Examination of our maps of differential selection at known molecular interfaces, such as with importin-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pumroy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tarendeau et al., 2007</xref>) and RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Serna Martin et al., 2018</xref>) suggest an interesting hypothesis: host-adaptive mutations are located adjacent to but not at core residues that directly interact at host proteins, suggesting that host adaptation may involve mutations at sites at the periphery of core interactions. Of course, it remains unclear precisely how any of these new human-adaptive mutations act, though initial validations show that most improve polymerase activity in human cells. However, an intriguing set of mutations such as at site 355 improve viral growth but not polymerase activity in human cells. We speculate that the effects of these mutations on viral growth are mediated by other effects of PB2, such as in modulating the innate-immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Graef et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Te Velthuis et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Even though we have focused our analyses mostly on host-adaptive mutations, our measurements are also useful to studies of PB2 function independent of host adaptation. Our complete maps of amino acid preferences in each cell type provide context for the handful of residues well-known to be critical for PB2 functions. For example, although our data recapitulate most of the known functional constraints on sites previously defined to be critical for mRNA cap-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guilligay et al., 2008</xref>), they also reveal that some of these sites can tolerate alternate residues. Thus, our complete survey of the mutational constraints at each site complements other functional and structural knowledge.</p><p>We also show that our comprehensive experimental measurements can identify human-adaptive mutations that occur during avian-to-human transmission of H7N9 influenza. These measurements therefore help address a fundamental challenge in assessing the risk of potential pandemic influenza virus strains: determining which of the many mutations observed during viral surveillance affect whether a virus will be successful in human hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lipsitch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Russell et al., 2014</xref>). Our high-throughput approach therefore enables phenotypic measurements to keep pace with the challenge of interpreting the many viral mutations that are observed during genotypic surveillance of virus evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grubaugh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>However, although some amino-acid mutations we experimentally identified as human-adaptive occur frequently in nature, others have never been observed. In addition, the strengths of differential selection measured in our experiments do not necessarily correspond to observed frequencies of mutations in nature. These apparent inconsistencies highlight the important role of evolutionary accessibility in shaping influenza’s host adaptation. First, most human-adaptive mutations observed in natural influenza evolution are accessible by single nucleotide substitution from current avian genotypes, demonstrating how the architecture of the genetic code impacts viral adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fragata et al., 2018</xref>). Second, even among single-nucleotide substitutions, transition mutations are about ten-fold more frequent than transversions during influenza replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloom, 2014</xref>). This might explain why E627K (which requires a G→A transition) is much more frequently observed than E627V (which requires a A→T transversion), despite the latter being more strongly selected in human cells in our experiments. Of course, many additional factors not captured by our experiments can impact which adaptive mutations fix in nature.

For generating the mutant plasmid library, we cloned the S009 PB2 coding sequence into a pHW2000 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>) from which we removed the CMV promoter (final plasmid pHW_noCMV_S009_PB2). The mutant library insert was cloned into the recipient vector pHW_noCMVnoTerm_BsmBI, which lacks the Pol I terminator (terminator sequence is part of the insert). The reason that we generated a pHW plasmid without a CMV promoter is that we were unable to maintain a stable bacterial clone of the S009 PB2 coding sequence on the pHH21 plasmid backbone – we observed frequent deletions in the coding sequence during plasmid propagation, suggesting that the insert on the pHH21 plasmid backbone is toxic to the bacterial host. For generating helper virus and virus for viral competitions, we cloned the S009 PB2, PB1, PA, and NP coding sequences into pHW2000 (pHW_S009_PB2, pHW_S009_PB1, pHW_S009_PA, pHW_S009_NP). In all cases we used non-coding viral-RNA termini from the respective A/WSN/1933(H1N1) gene segment. For protein expression and the minigenome assay, we cloned the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP coding sequences from S009 into a protein-expression plasmid with a CMV promoter (HDM_S009_PB2, HDM_S009_PB1, HDM_S009_PA, HDM_S009_NP). All mutants of PB2 were made by site-directed mutagenesis on the appropriate plasmid backbone.</p><p>Helper virus plasmids: To generate a PB2 vRNA lacking a functional PB2 protein, we cloned GFP flanked by PB2 sequence into the pHH21 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neumann et al., 1999</xref>) (pHH_PB2_S009_flank_99_eGFP_100). The flanking non-coding viral-RNA termini are from WSN PB2, and the coding sequences are from S009 PB2. The length of flanking sequences, 99 and 100 bases on the 5’ and 3’ end of the PB2 coding sequence respectively, are based on prior experiments analyzing how much terminal sequence is needed for effective genome packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liang et al., 2005</xref>). We mutated out start codons 5’ to the GFP start site in the mRNA sense. Our helper virus rescue also required the reverse genetics plasmids encoding HA, NA, M, and NS from WSN (pHW184_HA, pHW186_NA, pHW187_M, pHW188_NS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>). To generate a cell line with doxycycline-inducible expression of S009 PB2 for expansion of PB2-deficient helper virus, we cloned the S009 PB2-E627K coding sequence into the pSBtet vector (pSBtet_RP_S009_PB2_E627K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kowarz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Minigenome assay: In addition to protein expression plasmids described above, we used a pHH-PB1-flank-eGFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloom et al., 2010</xref>), and pcDNA3.1-mCherry as a transfection control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Primers</title><p>All primer sequences used in this study are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

At 18 hr after seeding cells, we added 1 µg/ml doxycycline to induce PB2 expression. One hour after adding doxycycline, we transfected each well with 250 ng each of pHH_PB2_S009_flank_99_eGFP_100, HDM_S009_PB2-E627K, pHW_S009_PB1, pHW_S009_PA, pHW_S009_NP, pHW184_HA, pHW186_NA, pHW187_M, and pHW188_NS using BioT (Bioland Scientific, B01-01). At four hours post-transfection, we replaced D10 media with WGM supplemented with 1 µg/ml doxycycline. We collected viral supernatant 52 hr post-transfection. To expand the helper virus, we seeded MDCK-SIAT1-tet-S009-PB2-E627K cells in D10 media 4 hr prior to infection at 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per 15 cm dish. We then infected each dish with 40 µl of fresh viral supernatant, using WGM supplemented with 1 µg/ml doxycycline to induce PB2 expression. At 48 hr post-infection, we collected viral supernatant containing expanded helper virus and clarified the supernatant by centrifugation at 400x g for 4 min. We measured the infectious particle (IP)/µl titer of the helper virus by infecting HEK293T cells with a known volume of viral supernatant, and quantifying the number of GFP+ cells by flow cytometry 18 hr post-infection.</p><p>Mutant virus library rescue: For each mutant plasmid library, we seeded 36 wells of a 6-well dish with 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> HEK293T cells, and transfected each well 17 hr later with 375 ng each of HDM_S009_PB2-E627K, HDM_S009_PB1, HDM_S009_PA, HDM_S009_NP, and 500 ng of PB2 mutant plasmid library using BioT. For the wild-type control, we seeded six wells and used pHW_noCMV_S009_PB2 in place of the mutant plasmid library. At 6 hr post-transfection, we infected cells with helper virus at MOI of 1 IP/cell in WGM. At 2 hr post-infection, we replaced the inoculum with fresh WGM. At 20 hr post-infection, we harvested viral supernatants and clarified the supernatant by centrifugation at 400x g for 4 min. Supernatants were titered by TCID<sub>50</sub> on MDCK-SIAT1 cells. The titers for the three library replicates and wild-type control were 262, 68, 100, and 1467 TCID<sub>50</sub>/µl respectively.</p><p>Passaging of mutant virus libraries: We aimed to passage 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of each mutant virus library in A549 and CCL-141 cells at MOI of 0.01 TCID<sub>50</sub>/cell as determined in MDCK-SIAT1 cells. Therefore, we aimed to have 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> total cells each at the time of infection. The day prior to each infection, we seeded between 8 × 10<sup>7</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> A549 cells in D10 in 4 × 5 layered cell culture flasks (Corning, 353144), and 8 × 10<sup>7</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> CCL-141 cells in E10 in 8 × 5 layered cell culture flasks. To estimate the total number of each cell type at the time of each infection, we plated an equivalent density of cells in a T225 flask. Just prior to infection, we counted the number of cells in the T225 flask, and extrapolated the total number of cells to be infected. We calculated, for an MOI of 0.01, the number of TCID<sub>50</sub>s to be passaged for each of the three library replicates and wild-type control in A549 cells to be 9.39 × 10<sup>5</sup>, 1.02 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 1.20 × 10<sup>6</sup>, and 9.30 × 10<sup>5</sup> respectively, and in CCL-141 cells to be 8.46 × 10<sup>5</sup>, 8.92 × 10<sup>5</sup>, 9.54 × 10<sup>5</sup>, and 8.58 × 10<sup>5</sup> respectively. We infected cells by removing D10 or E10 media, rinsing each flask with PBS, and then adding the calculated amount of virus diluted in WGM. At 3 hr post-infection, we replaced the inoculum with fresh WGM. The low MOI passage is expected to purge any non-replicative virus, including those containing the GFP segment. We confirmed this by our observation that there is limited spread of GFP expression over the course of infection. We harvested viral supernatant 48 hr post-infection, and clarified the supernatant by centrifugation at 400x g for 4 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Barcoded subamplicon sequencing</title><p>We ultracentrifuged clarified viral supernatant at 27,000 rpm in a Beckman Coulter SW28 rotor, for 2 hr at 4°C.

We titered the concentrated viral supernatant by TCID<sub>50</sub> on MDCK-SIAT1 cells to estimate the total TCID<sub>50</sub> from which we extracted RNA (ranged from 2.80 × 10<sup>5</sup> to 8.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>); we expect the TCID<sub>50</sub> titer to be a lower-bound and underestimate of the total viral variants present in the supernatant, since it measures only infectious virus, whereas we would extract RNA from both infectious and non-infectious virions.</p><p>We used a barcoded-subamplicon deep sequencing strategy that reduces the sequencing error rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doud and Bloom, 2016</xref>), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/bcsubamp.html">https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/bcsubamp.html</ext-link>).

During this amplification, we observed that the band corresponding to full-length PB2 was generally more intense than the smaller bands likely corresponding to the PB2-GFP gene segment, as well as PB2 deletions, suggesting that full-length PB2 was the most prevalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We then PCR amplified the PB2 gene in eight subamplicons using primers containing a random barcode to uniquely identify each template cDNA molecule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Approximately 7.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> uniquely barcoded molecules from each subamplicon library were then amplified by primers that add Illumina sequencing adaptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

To do so, we first asked how well the preferences measured by the deep mutational scanning in either human or avian cells describes evolution of PB2 in both human and avian hosts. We used the preferences to generate an experimentally informed codon substitution model (ExpCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloom, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hilton et al., 2017</xref>), and asked if the ExpCMs described PB2’s natural evolution better than a standard phylogenetic substitution model. The ExpCMs using amino-acid preferences vastly outperformed standard phylogenetic substitution models, suggesting that our experiments do capture some of the natural evolutionary constraint on PB2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The ExpCM stringency parameter had a value of 2.5, indicating that natural selection favors the same amino acids as our experiments, but with greater stringency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hilton et al., 2017</xref>).

Cells were stained for HA using the H17-L19 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gerhard et al., 1981</xref>), which reacts with the WSN HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doud et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Competitions: Viral competition assays were performed in biological duplicate (starting from independent bacterial clones of each PB2 mutant). For each competition, A549 and CCL-141 cells were infected with a mixture of wild-type and PB2-mutant virus at a 1:1 ratio of transcriptionally active particles as measured for that cell type. For samples collected at 10 hr post infection, we infected a minimum of 3.78 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells at MOI of 0.1. For samples collected at 48 hr post infection, we infected a minimum of 7.62 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells at MOI of 0.01. At 2 hr post-infection, we replaced either D10 or E10 media with fresh WGM. At 10 hr post-infection, cells infected at MOI of 0.1 were lysed in buffer RLT and cellular RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. At 48 hr post-infection, we collected viral supernatant from cells infected at MOI of 0.01, and extracted RNA using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, 52904).</p><p>Sequencing to determine mutant frequency: We reverse transcribed the full length PB2 vRNA from the extracted RNA with SuperScript III (ThermoFisher Scientific, 18080051) (primer S009-PB2-full-1F, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>: Viral competition). For each PB2 mutant, we PCR amplified from the cDNA the region of PB2 centered around that mutated codon site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This product was then subject to a second PCR using primers that add Illumina sequencing adaptors. Finally, these libraries were deep sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using 50 bp single-end reads.

Ancestral state reconstruction was only performed for nucleotide states, and was not used to infer ancestral host states. Instead, we inferred host-state transitions associated with each branch of the tree in a way that leveraged the prior knowledge that most H7N9 viruses circulate in avian hosts, and that most human infections arise from direct avian-to-human transmissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, for each node in the tree, starting from the root, we gathered all tips descending from that node. If that clade included only human sequences, and its parent node also included only human sequences, then the current clade falls within a monophyletic human clade, and the branch leading to it was labeled human-to-human. If the current clade includes only human sequences but the parent node includes non-human sequences, then the branch leading to the clade was labeled avian-to-human. If the current clade includes both human and non-human sequences, then the branch leading to the clade was labeled avian-to-avian. Mutations were classified as human if they occurred on human-to-human and avian-to-human branches, and are classified as avian if they occurred on avian-to-avian branches. Note that since H7N9 human influenza typically results from avian-to-human transmissions, the branches we label as human-to-human in reality likely arise from avian-to-human transmissions, but which we cannot accurately reconstruct due to insufficient sampling of avian sequences. For this reason, human-to-human and avian-to-human branches were grouped together.

The accessibility of codon <italic>c</italic> to amino-acid <italic>a</italic> by single-nucleotide mutations is defined as the minimum number of nucleotide mutations needed to generate any codon for that amino-acid. For a collection of sequences, we calculate the accessibility as the weighted average of the accessibilities of all codons observed at that site in the collection of sequences.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Neil Ferguson as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ervin Fodor (Reviewer #1); Benjamin R. tenOever (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Soh et al. present an impressive amount of work and data analyses to comprehensively map residues on the PB2 polymerase subunit of influenza A virus that confer species adaptation. The results of this work provide a map for the most likely host adaptive mutations that might enable an avian influenza A virus strain to replicate efficiency in mammals. Their screens not only identified known PB2 variants involved in the transition from avian to mammalian adaptation, but they also identified a number of novel residues that confer comparable properties. Interestingly, they note that many of the residues implicated in mammalian adaptation fall adjacent to known sites of host interactions and are on the exposed surface of PB2. In addition, they found that those residues that increase transcriptional activity but have not been found in nature generally demand numerous nucleotide substitutions thus making their selection more difficult. Overall, this work is based on a beautiful combination of deep sequencing, functional experiments, correlation to known structural information and evolutionary analyses, and the results may provide an important resource to those trying to predict what strains to monitor from general viral surveillance efforts. Although the underlying mechanisms governing preference for certain amino acids at certain positions remain unexplored, the study is an important addition to the body of literature on the host adaptive changes of the influenza virus RNA polymerase.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 4. Please add statistical tests on the data in panels A, B, and C. For panel C, provide a more detailed description to help the reader to understand exactly what is plotted on the y-axis and how these data correspond with the two different MOIs used and total and viral RNA analyzed at 10 and 48 hpi (Subsection “Viral competition”, second paragraph).</p><p>2) Subsection “Human-adaptive mutations identified in deep mutational scanning improve polymerase activity and viral growth in human cells”, fifth paragraph. Of the mutations that have little to no effect on polymerase activity, only R355G has a convincing effect in the viral competition assays. I292T, S523D, and to a lesser degree R355K do not deviate significantly from the starting ratio of wild type/mutant, especially when considering the E627E negative control.

We have revised the text to clarify which sites are and are not surfaced exposed. We have also added an analysis of the relative solvent accessibility of these sites to Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Only mutations at sites 163 and 182 affect internal PB2 residues and are therefore not exposed in any known conformation of PB2. In addition, site 156, although on the surface of the PB2 protein, faces the internal core of the polymerase in both conformations examined, and is thus likely also inaccessible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 6B.

Please address this apparent inconsistency.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to the Discussion some possible reasons for inconsistencies between our deep mutational scanning measurements and the frequencies of mutations observed in nature. In particular, we address the reviewer’s question of why the E627K mutation is most frequently observed in nature, though it has lower differential selection than other site 627 mutations. First, many mutations with higher differential selection than mutations we observe in nature are inaccessible from current avian influenza sequences by single-nucleotide mutations. This makes them much less likely to arise. Amongst mutations that are accessible by single-nucleotide mutations, such as E627K and E627V, the former is more frequently observed despite having lower differential selection. One possible explanation is that the rate of single-nucleotide mutations can differ depending on whether it is a transition or transversion. For example, the E627K mutation requires a transition from base G to A, whereas E627V requires a transversion from base A to T. Transitions occur at a higher rate than transversions. Specifically, previous measurements of influenza mutation rates estimates that G to A transitions occur at ten times the rate of A to T transversions. Finally, it is possible that other factors which are not captured by our in vitro model preferentially select for E627K.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Saturating mutagenesis has already been performed at the two major sites of adaption, PB2 627 and 701 (Chin et al., 2014, and Chin et al., 2017, respectively).

If it persists, how does the presence of what is effectively semi-infectious virus impact replication?</p></disp-quote><p>The mutant virus library (still containing PB2-GFP gene segments) was passaged at very low MOI after rescue so as to purge any non-replicative virus, including those containing the GFP segment. We confirmed this by our observation that there is limited spread of GFP expression over the course of infection. We have now explained this in the Materials and methods section. During amplification of the PB2 gene segment for sequencing library preparation, we also observed that the band corresponding to full-length PB2 was generally more intense than the smaller bands likely corresponding to the PB2-GFP gene segment, as well as PB2 deletions, suggesting that full-length PB2 was the most prevalent. We suspect that the relative amounts of full-length PB2 could be even higher than indicated by the gel, as the product underwent 22 cycles of PCR, which is known to preferentially amplify shorter templates (such as PB2-GFP and PB2-deletions). We now provide this gel image as Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The Discussion is very perfunctory and primarily repeats points already raised in the Results section. A synthesis of the current findings with the existing literature would help place these findings in context.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded our discussion of the current findings in context of existing literature. We explain how our complete map of adaptive mutations and amino acid preferences provides context for previously identified mutations that affect host adaptation and PB2 function. We explain that our analyses of new adaptive mutations in combination with previously identified mutations and published crystal structures suggest that host adaptation may involve mutations at sites at the periphery of core interactions. Finally, we also expand our discussion of why the magnitude of differential selection as quantified in our experiments do not always correspond to observed frequencies of mutations in nature that have been described in the literature, as explained in our response to comment 4 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 2C-D: the authors don't comment on why the entropy in natural avian sequences is so much lower on average than in human sequences. As a non-expert this is what I noticed first about these panels. Perhaps this could be explained better in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included an explanation in the text describing Figure 2. Entropy, a measure of sequence variation, is generally low in natural avian sequences, probably because influenza A virus is highly adapted to avian hosts so there is little pressure for additional adaptation. Entropy is generally higher in natural human sequences, likely because of increased genetic diversity generated as a result of directional selection to adapt to the human host (dos Reis et al., 2010), and diversifying selection to escape immune selection on PB2-derived T-cell epitopes (e.g. Assaarsson et al., 2008).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Their minigenome assay (Figure 4A-B) is technically only a reporter assay for transcription and not necessarily replication, which they don't mention.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the text to emphasize that the minigenome assay only quantifies the transcription of mRNA by the viral polymerase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 4C, subsection “Human-adaptive mutations identified in deep mutational scanning improve polymerase activity and viral growth in human cells”, fourth paragraph: viral competition assay. the authors say they infect both viruses at a 1:1 ratio, but how do they know it is actually a true 1:1 ratio? The Materials and methods state this is based on the IP/ul titer. This reviewer has no idea what that means as this is certainly not a conventional way of measuring virus. Moreover, how do the authors account for DIs etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified that the IP/ul titer reflects transcriptionally active particles as determined by flow cytometry for HA expression in infected cells. We also clarify that cells were infected with a 1:1 ratio of transcriptionally active particles, to the best of our measurements. Our measurements of transcriptionally active particles includes potential DIs which are competent to infect and express HA, but are not necessarily fully infectious.</p><p>More importantly, as we clarify also in response to Comment 1, the data plotted in Figure 4C is the ratio of mutant:WT virus, in A549 over CCL-141 cells. So even if the ratio of mutant:WT infectious virus is not exactly 1:1, it is corrected for since we compare the ratio in two cell types. Therefore, the quantity on the y-axis is only sensitive to <italic>relative</italic> differences of the wildtype and mutant variants in the two cell types, not their exact ratio in any single cell type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 5: I am not sure the authors have accounted for all of the published PB2 adaptations.

It seems incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>We have double-checked and confirmed that most of the mutations listed above by the reviewer were included in our analyses. We did miss a few, which we have now included.</p><p>We now clarify that in Figure 5 we plot in blue adaptive mutations for which there is prior experimental support (total of 25 mutations). We also clarify that we have labeled only a select few of them as landmarks to refer to in the text. (There is not enough space to label all of them.)</p><p>We provide a full list of published PB2 mutations, both with and without prior experimental support, in Figure 3—source data 1. Our analyses use only those mutations which have been experimentally validated to improve polymerase activity or viral growth in a human or mammalian host. This is because some computationally identified host adaptive mutations have failed to experimentally validate (as reported in previous published studies). We also required that each mutation showed an adaptive effect on its own, rather than in combination with another adaptive mutation, so as to make a fair comparison to our experiments which aim to identify effects of single mutations.</p><p>Of the mutations listed above, the following were already included in our analyses as they have experimental support: T158G, A199S, D253N, D256G, T271A, K526R, A588I, Q591K, A684S.</p><p>Of the mutations listed above, the following were listed in Figure 3—source data 1, but were not used in our analyses as they are not yet supported by experimental evidence. We have repeated literature searches to confirm that there has been no new evidence since: A44S (did not improve polymerase activity when tested in Cauldwell et al., 2013), T105V, R368K (enhances pathogenicity only in combination with E627K), L475M, D567N, G590S (not yet tested separately from Q591R), Q591R (not yet tested separately from G590S), V613T, A661T, A674T (did not improve polymerase activity or viral replication alone, Lee et al., 2017), and G682S.</p><p>We did miss the following mutations: R493K, T559I, T569A, V598T, S714I. Of these, we found experimental support for only T569A. We found that S714I had been experimentally tested but showed rather modest effect (Czudai-Matwich et al., 2014). Another mutation at this same site, S714R was already included in our analyses as having experimental support. We have added these missed mutations to Figure 3—source data 1. We have also updated Figure 5 (as well as Figure 3) to include the one missed mutation with experimental support (T569A).</p></body></sub-article></article>
