drastically different time scales. Sex determination (that is, the primary signal directing the embryo to develop as male or female) can be either environmental or genetic. Genetic sex determination can in turn be either male- or female-heterogametic (with or without heteromorphic sex chromosomes), mono- or polygenic, or haplo-diploid, among other mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charlesworth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Graves, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ellegren, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jablonka and Lamb, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beye et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Merchant-Larios and Díaz-Hernández, 2013</xref>). Primary sex determination is among the most rapidly evolving developmental processes. In African clawed frogs, medaka, salmon, and other animals, there are many examples of recently evolved sex-determining genes, so that the primary sex determination genes can differ between closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bewick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Roco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Myosho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Takehana et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tree of Sex Consortium et al., 2014</xref>). The signals initiating male or female development can vary even within species, as seen in cichlids, zebrafish, house flies, and ranid frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liew et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tomita and Wada, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Meisel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nakamura, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, sexual differentiation (that is, the set of molecular mechanisms that translates the primary sex-determining signal into sexually dimorphic development of specific organs) tends to remain stable for hundreds of millions of years despite the rapid evolution of both sex determination and the multitude of anatomical, physiological, and behavioral manifestations of sexual dimorphism. This fits the broader ‘hourglass’ pattern of developmental evolution, where the most upstream and downstream tiers of developmental hierarchies diverge more rapidly than the middle tiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duboule, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hanken and Carl, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hazkani-Covo et al., 2005</xref>). In the case of vertebrate sexual development, this middle tier is comprised of sex hormones and their receptors, which are largely conserved from mammals to fish, as are the key components of the network of transcription factors and signaling pathways that toggle gonad development between ovary and testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Raymond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brennan and Capel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maatouk et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Matson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lindeman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Herpin and Schartl, 2015</xref>). In nematodes, key components of the sexual differentiation pathway are conserved between <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> and <italic>Pristionchus</italic>, which are separated by 200–300 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pires-daSilva and Sommer, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, the insect sexual differentiation pathway, while unique among metazoans, shows deep conservation across 300 million years of insect evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ohbayashi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Suzuki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hasselmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Oliveira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Saccone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shukla and Palli, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shukla and Palli, 2012b</xref>). This pathway has three distinctive features. First, the <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>) gene is spliced into a male-specific isoform in males and a female-specific isoform in females; the two isoforms encode transcription factors that share a common N-terminal DNA-binding domain but have mutually exclusive C-termini, which lead them to have distinct and often opposite effects on downstream gene expression and morphological development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Wolfner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burtis and Baker, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McKeown, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coschigano and Wensink, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbeitman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rideout et al., 2010</xref>). Second, alternative splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> is controlled by the RNA splicing factor <italic>transformer</italic> (<italic>tra</italic>); and third, <italic>tra</italic> itself is alternatively spliced so that it produces a functional protein only in females, while in males a premature stop codon results in a truncated, non-functional Tra protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boggs et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Inoue et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sosnowski et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoshijima et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Verhulst et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the male-specific <italic>dsx</italic> isoform is produced by default, while the production of the female <italic>dsx</italic> isoform requires active intervention by <italic>tra</italic>. Despite some differences in details, the <italic>transformer-doublesex</italic> splicing cascade is conserved among insect orders separated by &gt;300 million years, including Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera, indicating that this pathway was already present in the last common ancestor of holometabolous insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shukla and Palli, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shukla and Palli, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ruiz et al., 2005</xref>). The one exception to this rule is found in Lepidoptera, where <italic>tra</italic> has been secondarily lost and <italic>dsx</italic> splicing is regulated instead by a male-specific protein and a female-specific piRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kiuchi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although conserved within insects, the <italic>transformer-doublesex</italic> splicing pathway appears to be unique among animals, as nothing similar has been observed in any other animal group. The differences in the molecular basis of sexual differentiation between insects, nematodes, and vertebrates are fundamental. In insects, <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>tra</italic> operate in a mostly cell-autonomous manner, as evidenced for example by dramatic insect gynandromorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Steinmann-Zwicky et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Janzer and Steinmann-Zwicky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Robinett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pereira et al., 2010</xref>). In vertebrates, sexual differentiation is largely non-cell-autonomous. During embryonic development, the originally bipotential vertebrate gonad is biased to become either ovary or testis under the influence of the primary sex-determining signal, which can be either genetic or environmental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Raymond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Devlin and Nagahama, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim and Capel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shoemaker et al., 2007</xref>). Subsequently, male or female hormones produced by the gonad act through nuclear receptor signaling to direct somatic tissues to differentiate in sex-specific ways. In rhabditid nematodes such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a multi-step cell signaling cascade involving secreted ligands, transmembrane receptors, and post-translational protein modification results in sex-specific expression of several transcription factors that direct male or female/hermaphrodite development of particular cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnes and Hodgkin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pilgrim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pires-daSilva, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berkseth et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The deep conservation of fundamentally different mechanisms of sexual differentiation in different animal phyla presents an intriguing question: how do such disparate mechanisms evolve in the first place? Comparison of nematode, crustacean, insect, and vertebrate modes of sexual differentiation suggests that the insect-specific mechanism based on alternative splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> evolved from a more ancient mechanism based on male-specific transcription of an ancestral <italic>dsx</italic> homolog. <italic>dsx</italic> is part of the larger Doublesex Mab-3 Related Transcription factor (DMRT) gene family, which is apparently the only shared element of sexual differentiation pathways across metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kopp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Matson and Zarkower, 2012</xref>). <italic>Dmrt1</italic> is involved in the specification and maintenance of testis fate in mammals and other vertebrates, while repressing ovarian differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Matson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Smith et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Webster et al., 2017</xref>). Due to their function in the androgen-producing Sertoli cells, vertebrate <italic>Dmrt1</italic> genes also play a crucial role in the development of secondary sexual characters. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>mab-3</italic> and several other DMRT family genes are responsible for the specification of various male-specific cells, structures, and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Shen and Hodgkin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Portman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mason et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Siehr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017</xref>). However, in both vertebrates and nematodes, the DMRT genes involved in sexual differentiation are not spliced sex-specifically, but are transcribed in a predominantly male-specific fashion, promote the development of male-specific traits, and are dispensable for female sexual differentiation. In contrast, the insect <italic>dsx</italic> acts as a bimodal switch that plays active roles in both male- and female-specific differentiation through its distinct male and female splicing isoforms. In the absence of Dsx, both males and females develop as intersexes with phenotypes intermediate between males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rideout et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Ridge, 1980</xref>).</p><p>In the closest relative of insects that has been studied to date, the branchiopod crustacean <italic>Daphnia magna</italic>, <italic>dsx</italic> acts in a manner similar to vertebrates and nematodes rather than insects: it is transcribed male-specifically, is not alternatively spliced, controls the development of male-specific structures, and is dispensable in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kato et al., 2011</xref>). The <italic>D</italic>. <italic>magna tra</italic> gene is not spliced sex-specifically and does not differ in expression between males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kato et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>dsx</italic> also shows male-biased transcription and no sex-specific splicing in the shrimp <italic>Fenneropenaeus chinensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2018</xref>) and in the mite <italic>Metaseiulus occidentalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pomerantz and Hoy, 2015</xref>). Thus, the origin of the <italic>transformer-doublesex</italic> splicing cascade was a key event in the evolution of sexual differentiation in insects.</p><p>To understand the evolutionary transition from a transcription-based to a splicing-based mode of sexual differentiation, it is necessary to focus on the phylogenetic interval between branchiopod crustaceans and holometabolous insects. This interval spans several crustacean groups, non-insect hexapods, and many hemimetabolous insect orders, and encompasses a broad range of body plans and developmental mechanisms. Unfortunately, the development of these groups remains poorly studied compared to holometabolous insects; in particular, very little is known about sexual differentiation in hemimetabolous insects.</p><p>To explore the origin of the insect sexual differentiation pathway based on the <italic>transformer-doublesex</italic> axis, we examined the expression of these genes in three hemimetabolous insects: the kissing bug <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> (Hemiptera), the louse <italic>Pediculus humanus</italic> (Phthiraptera), and the German cockroach <italic>Blattella germanica</italic> (Blattodea) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We find that distinct male and female <italic>dsx</italic> isoforms are conserved through Blattodea, the most basal insect order studied to date. However, only <italic>R. prolixus</italic> shows the canonical sex-specific pattern of <italic>tra</italic> splicing. In <italic>B. germanica</italic>, we show that <italic>tra</italic> nevertheless controls female <italic>dsx</italic> splicing and is necessary for female sexual differentiation, as in holometabolous insects. Surprisingly, the <italic>B. germanica dsx</italic> gene is required for male sexual differentiation, but appears to be dispensable in females; in this respect, the cockroach is more similar to crustaceans and non-arthropod animals than to holometabolous insects. Together, our results suggest that the splicing-based mode of sexual differentiation based on the <italic>transformer-doublesex</italic> regulatory pathway has evolved in a gradual fashion in hemimetabolous insects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>doublesex</italic> and <italic>transformer</italic> orthologs are present in hemimetabolous insects</title><p>Although <italic>dsx</italic>, <italic>Dmrt1</italic>, and other DMRT genes have prominent roles in sexual differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Raymond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burtis and Baker, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kopp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Matson and Zarkower, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Shen and Hodgkin, 1988</xref>) many DMRT paralogs are involved in other developmental processes, and most have phylogenetically restricted distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wexler et al., 2014</xref>).

To identify <italic>dsx</italic> orthologs in hemimetabolous insects for functional study, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of arthropod DMRT genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). By mining arthropod gene models, we recovered the deeply conserved Dmrt11E, Dmrt93B, and Dmrt99B subfamilies in addition to a large clade containing <italic>dsx</italic> orthologs. The <italic>dsx</italic> clade contained sequences from several basal insect orders, crustaceans, and chelicerates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and included experimentally characterized <italic>dsx</italic> genes from the branchiopod crustacean <italic>D. magna</italic> (NCBI accession number BAJ78307.1), the decapod crustacean <italic>F. chinensis</italic> (AUT13216.1), and the mite <italic>M. occidentalis</italic> (XP003740429.2 and XP003740430.1). In these species, the <italic>dsx</italic> genes are not spliced sex-specifically, but are transcribed in a strongly male-biased fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pomerantz and Hoy, 2015</xref>). <italic>dsx</italic> genes from holometabolous insects, which direct male and female differentiation via alternative splice forms, are also present in this clade. There are marked departures in this gene tree from the arthropod species tree. Notably, many hemipteran <italic>dsx</italic> sequences group with chelicerates and crustaceans instead of insects, although with low support. The clustering of crustacean and chelicerate <italic>dsx</italic> genes, which control male sexual development via male-specific upregulation, with holometabolous <italic>dsx</italic> genes that control male and female development via alternative spliceforms indicates that sex-specific <italic>dsx</italic> isoforms evolved after the origin of the <italic>dsx</italic> clade.</p><p>Puzzled by the clustering of hemipteran <italic>dsx</italic> genes with those from chelicerates and crustaceans, we conducted a synteny analysis. While the robustness of this analysis is dependent on the quality of genome assembly, the transcription factor <italic>prospero (pros)</italic> is on the same scaffold as <italic>dsx,</italic> with an intervening distance between 17 and 245 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), in seven different holometabolous and hemimetabolous insect orders (Ephemeroptera, Blattodea, Phthiraptera, Thysanoptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera). However, in Hemiptera, tBLASTn searches of the <italic>prospero</italic>-containing scaffolds, ranging in size from ~120 kb to 17 Mb (mean 2.75 Mb), did not identify neighboring DMRT genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Work in the planthopper <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> suggests that at least some of the hemipteran <italic>dsx</italic> genes are alternatively spliced and are necessary for male development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zhuo et al., 2018</xref>). We conclude that hemipterans have <italic>dsx</italic> orthologs, but the synteny between <italic>pros</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> was lost in the common ancestor to true bugs, and Dsx protein sequences evolved rapidly in this clade.</p><p>Transformer proteins have repetitive sequences that evolve rapidly, posing greater difficulties for phylogenetic analysis. Previous studies of insect <italic>tra</italic> genes have identified these genes via the characteristic arginine/serine rich (RS) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hasselmann et al., 2008</xref>), used BLAST to detect a <italic>tra</italic> candidate and demonstrated congruence between a species tree and a gene tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kato et al., 2010</xref>), or simply concluded that a candidate <italic>tra</italic> gene was indeed <italic>transformer</italic> after knocking it down and obtaining a sex-specific phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shukla and Palli, 2012a</xref>). <italic>tra</italic> is related to, but is not part of, a large family of genes structurally defined by the presence of an RNA binding domain and at least one RS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Long and Caceres, 2009</xref>). These proteins, called SR family genes for their amino acid composition, commonly function in pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Long and Caceres, 2009</xref>). Because most insect <italic>tra</italic> genes lack an RNA binding domain (see below), they are classified as RS-like proteins. Our maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of Tra proteins, along with three previously studied SR family genes (Transformer-2, which is not an ortholog of Transformer; SFRS; and Pinin) shows that putative <italic>tra</italic> genes from some hemimetabolous insects including <italic>R. prolixus, P. humanus</italic>, and <italic>B. germanica</italic> cluster with experimentally characterized holometabolous <italic>tra</italic> genes and with the <italic>D. magna tra</italic>, although with low support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In the holometabolous insect orders Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera, a premature male-specific stop codon truncates the <italic>tra</italic> coding sequence, making the male Tra protein unable to regulate <italic>dsx</italic> splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hasselmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boggs et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Inoue et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sosnowski et al., 1989</xref>).

Instead, <italic>P. humanus</italic> and <italic>B. germanica</italic> display novel patterns of alternative splicing, which include the presence of female-biased truncated <italic>tra</italic> isoforms and an interrupted CAM domain.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title><italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> </title><p>In R. prolixus, we identified a tandem duplication of <italic>tra</italic> on scaffold KQ034193 (Rhodnius-prolixus-CDC_SCAFFOLDS_RproC3, v.1) via tBLASTn searches of the R. prolixus genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mesquita et al., 2015</xref>). In the phylogenetic tree of arthropod SR proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), the two R. prolixus paralogs (<italic>RpTraA</italic> and <italic>RpTraB</italic>) cluster within a clade that also contains dipteran, hymenopteran, and coleopteran Tra proteins. The downstream <italic>R. prolixus tra</italic> paralog, which we call <italic>RpTraB</italic>, encodes conserved Tra amino acid residues at its N-terminus, including the CAM domain and an RS domain, but is truncated at the C-terminus and lacks a proline-rich domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, the upstream <italic>RpTraA</italic> paralog encodes a full-length Tra protein with a C-terminal proline-rich domain. Interestingly, <italic>RpTraA</italic> is also predicted to contain a partial RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), a feature which has not been described in previous studies of Tra proteins. However, when we inspected predicted protein domains in Tra sequences from Branchiopoda, Copepoda, Blattodea, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera with CCD/SPARCLE software via NCBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Marchler-Bauer et al., 2017</xref>), we found putative RRM domains in <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> CSD, <italic>R. prolixus TraA</italic>, a predicted Tra protein from the copepod crustacean <italic>Tigriopus californicus</italic>, and the cockroach <italic>B. germanica</italic> Tra ortholog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The absence of the RRM domain from most arthropod Tra sequences suggests that insect Tra proteins once had a functional RRM domain but lost RNA-binding activity over time, perhaps due to the association between Tra and the RNA-binding protein Tra-2 (48). RpTraA and RpTraB are the first reported tra duplicates outside of Hymenoptera, where tra duplications sometimes result in functional innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hasselmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geuverink and Beukeboom, 2014</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether <italic>RpTraA</italic> is expressed similarly to holometabolous <italic>tra</italic> orthologs, we conducted 5’ and 3’ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) to obtain the sets of isoforms expressed in male and female <italic>R. prolixus</italic>. Using separate male and female RNA samples, we also generated de novo transcriptome assemblies using Illumina sequencing and Trinity software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grabherr et al., 2011</xref>).

All transcripts were identified as sex-specific based on their presence/absence in male and female RACE and RNA-seq libraries, and their sex-specificity was further confirmed by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As in the holometabolous <italic>tra</italic> splicing, both male-specific transcripts (<italic>RpTraA_1</italic> and <italic>RpTraA_2</italic>) contain stop codons near the N-terminus and thus encode truncated proteins that are almost certainly incapable of regulating RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Only the <italic>RpTraA_4</italic> transcript encodes a complete Tra protein with the CAM domain followed by an RS domain, RRM domain, and a proline-rich domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The female-specific <italic>RpTraA_3</italic> lacks the stop codon found in male <italic>RpTraA</italic> transcripts, but has truncated RS and CAM domains and lacks the proline-rich domain. The mapping of male and female RNA-seq reads to the four <italic>RpTraA</italic> isoforms identified by RACE further confirmed the sex-specificity of these isoforms: no female reads mapped to the male-specific stop codons in <italic>RpTraA_1</italic> and <italic>RpTraA_2</italic>, and no male reads mapped to female-specific exon junctions of <italic>RpTraA_3</italic> and <italic>RpTraA_4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

As the female feeds on tergal gland secretions, the male extends his abdomen, grasps the female’s genitalia, and copulation follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Roth and Willis, 1952</xref>).

Together, these results suggest that in at least some hemimetabolous insects, <italic>dsx</italic> is spliced as in holometabolous insects, but may function as in the crustacean <italic>D. magna</italic>, where <italic>dsx</italic> is necessary for male but not female development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kato et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The existence of a female-specific <italic>dsx</italic> isoform in the absence of a female-specific <italic>dsx</italic> function is, of course, surprising. Although we examined multiple features of female external and internal anatomy, gene expression, behavior, and reproduction in <italic>B. germanica dsBgDsx</italic> females, we cannot rule out that <italic>dsx</italic> performs some subtle or spatially restricted function in female cockroaches. Such relatively minor and tissue-specific role, if it exists, could provide a crucial stepping stone in the origin of the classical <italic>dsx</italic> function as a bifunctional switch that is indispensable for female as well as male development. One possibility is that, similar to other transcription factors, <italic>dsx</italic> originally evolved alternative splicing as a way of promoting the development of different cell types. If some <italic>dsx</italic> isoforms evolved functions that were dispensable for male sexual development, <italic>dsx</italic> could gradually lose its ancestral pattern of male-limited transcription, opening the way for the evolution of new isoforms with first subtle, but eventually essential, functions in females.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The role of <italic>tra</italic>in sexual differentiation predates canonical sex-specific splicing of <italic>tra</italic></title><p>The opposite pattern is observed for transformer, which apparently evolved a sex-specific role before that role came to be mediated by a male-specific stop codon. In most holometabolous insects, alternative splicing of <italic>tra</italic> produces a functional protein in females but not in males, due to a premature stop codon in a male-specific exon near the 5’ end of <italic>tra</italic>. In hemimetabolous insects, we only observe this type of sex-specific splicing in <italic>R. prolixus</italic>. In <italic>B. germanica</italic> and <italic>P. humanus</italic>, full-length and presumably functional Tra proteins that include all of the important functional domains are produced in both males and females. The female-limited function of Tra in the cockroach could result from higher expression of truncated <italic>BgTra</italic> isoforms in females (see below), or from sex-specific expression of unknown cofactors of Tra. In either case, the function of <italic>tra</italic> in female sexual differentiation predates the evolution of female-limited Tra protein expression.</p><p>Although they lack the canonical sex-specific splicing observed in holometabolous insects, the <italic>tra</italic> genes of <italic>B. germanica</italic> and <italic>P. humanus</italic> show a different pattern of alternative splicing affecting the CAM domain, which plays a role in <italic>tra</italic> autoregulation in holometabolous insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). In some <italic>tra</italic> isoforms, read-through of an exon containing the 5’ half of the CAM domain results in a premature stop codon; in <italic>B. germanica</italic> and <italic>P. humanus</italic>, these transcripts are found in both sexes. In <italic>BgTra</italic>, isoforms with an intact reading frame come in two types. Some of these intact isoforms contain an in-frame exon spliced into the middle of the CAM domain; in the others, this exon is spliced several base pairs upstream of the stop codon, producing an uninterrupted CAM domain. In <italic>P. humanus</italic>, we only isolated <italic>tra</italic> isoforms with an exon interrupting the CAM domain. The splice junction in the middle of the CAM domain is conserved in holometabolous insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hediger et al., 2010</xref>), and the amino acid residues flanking this junction are necessary for female-specific autoregulation of <italic>tra</italic> in the housefly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). It remains to be determined whether the CAM domain is involved in <italic>tra</italic> autoregulation in hemimetabolous insects, but if so, the truncated or interrupted isoforms would likely be incapable of autoregulation, with potentially important consequences for the splicing of <italic>tra</italic> and its downstream targets. Interestingly, the evolution of the canonical holometabolous splicing of <italic>tra</italic>, with a male-specific premature stop codon, coincided with a loss of <italic>tra</italic> isoforms with an interrupted CAM domain. In fact, the splicing pattern of <italic>tra</italic> in <italic>R. prolixus</italic> suggests that the male-specific stop codon originally evolved in the middle of the CAM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This change may indicate a transition from an ancestral state where both sexes had functional as well as non-functional Tra isoforms, to the derived holometabolous condition where functional Tra protein is confined to females, and non-functional Tra to males.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of <italic>tra</italic> in regulating <italic>dsx</italic> splicing predates sex-specific expression of Tra protein</title><p>Although the function of <italic>tra</italic> in female sexual development in <italic>B. germanica</italic> does not appear to be mediated by <italic>dsx</italic>, we find that <italic>tra</italic> is necessary for sex-specific <italic>dsx</italic> splicing in the cockroach, as it is in all holometabolous insects except Lepidoptera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kiuchi et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanism of <italic>dsx</italic> regulation by <italic>tra</italic> is likely to be different in <italic>B. germanica</italic> compared to holometabolous insects. In the latter, functional Tra protein is absent in males but present in females, where it dimerizes with the RNA-binding protein Tra-2 to regulate the splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoshijima et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heinrichs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nagoshi et al., 1988</xref>). In the cockroach, however, full-length Tra proteins containing all the functional domains are expressed at similar levels in both sexes, so that male-specific splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> in males cannot be explained by lack of Tra. It could be due instead to an interaction of Tra with different binding partners in males vs females. We note that while the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Tra protein does not contain an RNA-binding domain and does not bind to RNA without Tra-2, the cockroach Tra protein, as well as those of some other insects and crustaceans, contain predicted RNA recognition motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Inoue et al., 1992</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Tra first evolved its function in regulating alternative splicing as a broadly acting RNA-binding protein that worked in concert with other splicing factors, before losing its ability to bind RNA and becoming a dedicated partner of Tra-2 with a narrow range of downstream targets. If so, the situation we find in <italic>B. germanica</italic> may represent a transitional stage in the evolution of the canonical <italic>tra-dsx</italic> axis, where <italic>dsx</italic> is one of many Tra targets, rather than the main mediator of its female-specific function. In this scenario, the <italic>tra-dsx</italic> axis evolved via merger between expanding <italic>dsx</italic> function (from males to both sexes) and narrowing <italic>tra</italic> function (from a general splicing factor to the dedicated regulator of <italic>dsx</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Evolution of the insect sexual differentiation pathway: stepwise or mosaic?</title><p>A more extensive sampling of hemimetabolous insects will no doubt be necessary to reconstruct the full series of events that produced the familiar holometabolous mode of sexual differentiation, and to determine the timing of the key synapomorphies among the variety of lineage-specific changes. Based on our limited taxon sampling, we can propose a tentative model. We suggest that the canonical insect mechanism of sexual differentiation based on sex-specific splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>tra</italic> evolved gradually in hemimetabolous insects, and may not have been fully assembled until the last common ancestor of the Holometabola (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In crustaceans, mites, and non-arthropod animals, <italic>dsx</italic> and its homologs act as male-determining genes that are transcribed in a male-specific fashion and are dispensable for female sexual differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pomerantz and Hoy, 2015</xref>). One of the earliest events in insects was the evolution of sex-specific <italic>dsx</italic> splicing, where <italic>dsx</italic> is transcribed in both sexes but produces alternative isoforms in males vs females. We do not know whether Tra was involved in sex-specific <italic>dsx</italic> splicing from the beginning, or evolved this function later; in either case, the function of <italic>tra</italic> in controlling female sexual differentiation may well predate its role in regulating <italic>dsx</italic> splicing. Eventually, however, Tra became essential for the expression of female-specific <italic>dsx</italic> isoforms. At the next step, expression of functional Tra protein became restricted to females due to the origin of a male-specific exon with a premature stop codon at the 5’ end of the <italic>tra</italic> gene. As this process unfolded, female-specific <italic>dsx</italic> isoforms gradually evolved female-specific functions, which may have been minor at first but became essential at or before the origin of holometabolous insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47490.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Evolutionary assembly of the insect sexual differentiation pathway.</title><p>Uncertainty in the relationships among Hemiptera, Phthiraptera, and Holometabola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Misof et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freitas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2015</xref>) means that the sequence of events in the evolution of the <italic>tra-dsx</italic> axis is unclear.

Oligosaccharides were further purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Niñonuevo and Lebrilla, 2009</xref>). Structural elucidation employed an Agilent 6520 Q-TOF mass spectrometer paired with a 1200 series HPLC with a chip interface for structural analysis. A capillary pump was used to load and enrich the sample onto a porous graphitized carbon chip, this solvent contained 3% (v/v) ACN/H<sub>2</sub>O with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. A nano pump containing a binary solvent system was used for separation with a flow rate of 0.4 μl/min, solvent A contained 3% (v/v) ACN/H<sub>2</sub>O with 0.1% formic acid and solvent B contained 90% (v/v) ACN/H<sub>2</sub>O with 0.1% formic acid. A 45 min gradient was performed with the following conditions: 0.00–10.00 min, 2–5% B, 10.00–20.00 min, 7.5% B, 20.00–25.00 min, 10% B, 25.00–30.00 min, 99% B, 30.00–35.00 min, 99% B, 35.00–45.10, 2% B. The instrument was run in positive ion mode. Data analysis was performed with the Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis (B.06) software. For quantitative determination samples were run on an Agilent 6210 TOF mass spectrometer paired with a 1200 series HPLC with a chip interface with the same chromatographic parameters.</p><p>Behavioral assays <italic>dsBgTra</italic> females were reared for one week on food pellets (Purina No. 5001 Rodent Diet, PMI Nutrition International) and distilled water in a temperature-regulated walk-in room at 27 ± 1°C, 40–70% relative humidity, and L:D = 12:12 photoperiod (Light, 20:00 – 8:00). A wild-type strain (wild-type, American Cyanamid strain = Orlando Normal, collected in a Florida apartment &gt;60 years ago) was also kept in the same conditions. Newly emerged wild-type males and wild-type females were kept in separate cages to prevent contact. Sexually mature virgin males (20-day-old) and sexually mature virgin females (5–6 days old) were used in behavioral assays. For assays of the wing-raising display in response to isolated female and male antennae, <italic>dsBgTra</italic> females, wild-type females, and wild-type males were acclimated individually for 1 day in glass test tubes (15 cm x 2.5 cm diameter) stoppered with cotton. Observations were carried out at 17:00-19:00 hr (scotophase) in the walk-in incubator room under red fluorescent lights. Each test tube was horizontally placed under an IR-sensitive camera (Everfocus EQ610 Polestar, Taiwan). The antennae of the tested insects were stimulated by contact with either an isolated wild-type female antenna or wild-type male antenna, which was attached to the tip of a glass Pasteur pipette by dental wax. Observation time was 1 min. A single antenna was used for 2–3 tested insects. The percentage of responders was compared by Chi-square test. The latency of wing-raising display was quantified in seconds, from the start of stimulation to the initiation of the display, and compared by t-test (unpaired, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>Observations of nuptial feeding were conducted at 12:00-19:00 hr (scotophase). As above, individual tested insects were acclimated in test tubes, but a single wild-type male or wild-type female was introduced into the test tube and wing-raising and tergal gland feeding behaviors were observed for both insects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cuticular hydrocarbon analysis</title><p>To compare cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) between control and RNAi treatments, individual cockroaches were extracted for 5 min in 200 µL of hexane containing 10 µg of heptacosane (<italic>n</italic>-C26) as an internal standard. Extracts were reduced to 150 µL and 1 μl was injected in splitless mode using a 7683B Agilent autosampler into a DB-5 column (20 m × 0.18 mm internal diameter ×0.18 µm film thickness; J and W Scientific) in an Agilent 7890 series GC (Agilent Technologies) connected to a flame ionization detector with ultrahigh-purity hydrogen as carrier gas (0.75 mL/min constant flow rate). The column was held at 50°C for 1 min, increased to 320°C at 10 °C/min, and held at 320°C for 10 min. For Principal Components Analysis (PCA), we used the percentage of each of 30 peaks previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jurenka et al., 1989</xref>). PCA was conducted in JMP (JMP Pro 12, SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Perry (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers closely agree that this is an important paper that should be published. However, the reviewers also find that the paper could be seriously improved if the logic and the writing were to be improved in several sections as the overall message is diluted by several difficult sections.</p><p>Although one reviewer suggested that adding more species might help, it is likely that more particular cases would be found and this would not clarify the message as they might not represent an overarching trajectory of evolution toward <italic>Drosophila</italic>-like sex determination. However, we would like to encourage you to address this issue in your Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The premise for this study is to understand how sex determining mechanisms are both rapidly evolving and have conservation of the downstream genes specifying sexual development, with a focus on insect sex determining pathways. In holometabolous insects there is a critical regulatory cassette that includes two genes transformer and <italic>dsx. tra</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> encode transcripts that are sex-specifically spliced to produce sex-specific proteins, with <italic>tra</italic> regulating <italic>dsx</italic> splicing. Ancestrally, <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> are regulated independently of each other and male-required <italic>dsx</italic> is regulated transcriptionally for sexual development.</p><p>This study examines <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> in three hemimetabolous insects to bridge a gap in current knowledge of sex determination mechanisms, to understand the potential evolutionary transitions that give rise to different mechanisms. While it is now clear that sex determination evolves rapidly, the molecular-genetic mechanisms that change are not understood. This study provides compelling evidence regarding novel and conserved mechanisms for <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> regulation in three species examined. The mechanistic roles of <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> in sexual development in the German cockroach (<italic>Blattella germanica</italic>) are more deeply examined using RNAi approaches. Overall, the study is carefully performed, using several molecular and computational approaches to identify and validate <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> transcript isoforms from three species. The results of the functional studies in <italic>Blattella</italic> are unexpected and lead to interesting insights about evolution of gene/transcript regulation and function. The study also provides insights into the transitions that might lead to novel sex determination genetic pathways during evolution.</p><p>1) The identification of <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> transcripts is a critical aspect of the study. It appears that the authors were thorough in their search for all transcript isoforms encoded by <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic>, in the three species examined. The gene models presented are convincing and carefully annotated. Can the authors provide more rationales/justification for the tissues they used to identify cDNAs, in terms of identification of all transcript isoforms. For example, can the authors find all transcript isoforms for <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> in public RNA-seq data sets from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> by searching data sets made from the same tissues. Are there other data sets that justify the use of the tissues chosen here? Is there an alternative justification that they can provide? The concern is that the tissues used were gonadal (somatic and germline tissues), as well as additional somatic tissues, so will contain a high abundance of transcripts from germline-expressed genes. <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> are genes with functions in somatic sex determination. Also, please clarify if independent RNA samples were used to validate the cDNAs identified in the three different species.</p><p>2) The other critical findings are from the RNAi knockdown experiments in <italic>Blatella</italic>.</p><p>A) The authors should provide a rationale as to why they chose to perform RNAi experiments in this species and not the other two. This was not clear in the paper.</p><p>B) The unexpected results are that RNAi knockdown of <italic>tra</italic>, but not <italic>dsx</italic>, results in female sex transformation/developmental phenotypes.

This work uncovers several interesting differences that suggest possible intermediate states between the higher insects (largely represented by work in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) and a much less well-studied ancestral state represented by data from a handful of papers in various outgroups. Though the results suggest a somewhat complicated evolutionary history with possible secondary reversions and group-specific specializations, the authors are able to suggest a coherent model for the shift from transcription-based differences in <italic>Dsx</italic> expression to splicing-based differences via Tra. Overall, the work represents a significant advance over what was known previously by examining several difficult to work with groups, and these efforts will lay the foundation for much future work on the evolution of this fascinating system.</p><p>I have only a few relatively minor concerns and specific suggestions (below). Perhaps the biggest question I am left with is how <italic>Dsx</italic> is differentially spliced in B. germanica when both sexes produce the same isoforms of Tra. The Discussion does a good job laying out possibilities but these are difficult to test and it would be great to know what else is targeted by Tra or that interacts with Tra to control sex. Unfortunately, I can't think of an easy or simple experiment to sort this out!</p><p>Given the speculation about the variety of isoforms it is tempting to start thinking about experiments that might test the ideas proposed. What would happen if the <italic>BgTra</italic> isoform with the &quot;interrupting exon&quot; in the CAM domain were specifically knocked down? The section that describes how the interrupting exon relates to the evolution of a male-specific stop codon is not especially clear (subsection “The role of <italic>transformer</italic> in sexual differentiation predates canonical sex-specific splicing of <italic>tra</italic>”, last paragraph). This section should at least be revised, even if further isoform-specific knock down is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><p>While I am not especially surprised that Tra plays the role that it does in Blattodea (complete control of sexually specific morphology and probably behavior as well) this was previously not demonstrated and has been done well here. The differences in <italic>Dsx</italic> splicing and expression are unfortunately complicated but also well documented. I especially appreciate the review of current literature on specification of sex in not well studied insect outgroups, and the placement of the new findings in this context.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47490.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The three reviewers closely agree that this is an important paper that should be published.

Our understanding of sexual differentiation in holometabolous insects rests on studies of about 15 Dipteran species, and about 10 non-Dipteran insects, described in &gt;50 papers. Given the age and diversity of hemimetabolous orders, we expect it will require at least as many taxa to fully understand the sequence of evolutionary changes leading up to the origin of Holometabola. We hope that our report will help inform the design of future studies in this area.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we added the following sentences in the Discussion: “A more extensive sampling of hemimetabolous insects will no doubt be necessary to reconstruct the full series of events that produced the familiar holometabolous mode of sexual differentiation, and to determine the timing of the key synapomorphies among the variety of lineage-specific changes. Based on our limited taxon sampling, we can propose a tentative model.” [Followed by the description of our model reflected in Figure 8]. We then end our paper with the following sentence: “Comparative and functional work in other basal insects, non-insect Hexapods, and crustaceans will be needed to determine the ancestral functions of <italic>tra</italic>, the roles of female-specific <italic>dsx</italic> isoforms in hemimetabolous insects, and other details of this emerging model.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The premise for this study is to understand how sex determining mechanisms are both rapidly evolving and have conservation of the downstream genes specifying sexual development, with a focus on insect sex determining pathways. In holometabolous insects there is a critical regulatory cassette that includes two genes transformer and dsx. tra and dsx encode transcripts that are sex-specifically spliced to produce sex-specific proteins, with tra regulating dsx splicing. Ancestrally, tra and dsx are regulated independently of each other and male-required dsx is regulated transcriptionally for sexual development.</p><p>This study examines tra and dsx in three hemimetabolous insects to bridge a gap in current knowledge of sex determination mechanisms, to understand the potential evolutionary transitions that give rise to different mechanisms. While it is now clear that sex determination evolves rapidly, the molecular-genetic mechanisms that change are not understood. This study provides compelling evidence regarding novel and conserved mechanisms for tra and dsx regulation in three species examined. The mechanistic roles of tra and dsx in sexual development in the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) are more deeply examined using RNAi approaches. Overall, the study is carefully performed, using several molecular and computational approaches to identify and validate tra and dsx transcript isoforms from three species. The results of the functional studies in Blattella are unexpected and lead to interesting insights about evolution of gene/transcript regulation and function. The study also provides insights into the transitions that might lead to novel sex determination genetic pathways during evolution.</p><p>1) The identification of tra and dsx transcripts is a critical aspect of the study. It appears that the authors were thorough in their search for all transcript isoforms encoded by tra and dsx, in the three species examined. The gene models presented are convincing and carefully annotated. Can the authors provide more rationales/justification for the tissues they used to identify cDNAs, in terms of identification of all transcript isoforms. For example, can the authors find all transcript isoforms for tra and dsx in public RNA-seq data sets from Drosophila melanogaster by searching data sets made from the same tissues. Are there other data sets that justify the use of the tissues chosen here? Is there an alternative justification that they can provide? The concern is that the tissues used were gonadal (somatic and germline tissues), as well as additional somatic tissues, so will contain a high abundance of transcripts from germline-expressed genes. tra and dsx are genes with functions in somatic sex determination.</p></disp-quote><p>First, a quick recap: For the cockroach, we used fat body, gonads, and accessory glands. For <italic>Rhodnius</italic>, we used fat body, gonads, and internal reproductive tracts. For louse, we used whole adults.</p><p>We used these tissues for two reasons: an a priori expectation that, since the gonads and reproductive tracts are sex-specific, they are likely to express the genes required for sexual differentiation; and our knowledge of gene expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In flies, <italic>dsx</italic> is transcribed, and spliced sex-specifically, in the somatic gonads and in the fat body (among other tissues), while <italic>tra</italic> expression is apparently ubiquitous (Camara et al., 2019; Clough et al., 2014). Fat body is also known to have a high prevalence of sex-biased gene expression that is regulated by <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>tra</italic> (Arbeitman et al., 2016; Chang et al., 2011). Little is known about the tissue-specificity of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>tra</italic> expression in non-Dipteran insects, but <italic>Dsx</italic> protein is expressed in the pupal wings of butterflies that have sex-specific wing color patterns (Kunte et al., 2014), supporting the idea that tissues that go through sexually dimorphic differentiation are likely to express <italic>dsx</italic>. It is true that gonadal tissues contain a high proportion of germline cells, and that the <italic>Drosophila dsx</italic> and <italic>tra</italic> are involved in somatic but not in germline sexual differentiation. However, we do not see this as a concern because (1) our cloning and transcriptome sequencing strategies do not require <italic>all</italic> cells in our tissue samples to be expressing <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>tra</italic>, and (2) we actually do not know that <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>tra</italic> are NOT involved in germline sexual differentiation in non-Dipteran insects, so we saw the inclusion of sex-specific germline tissues in our samples as an insurance strategy. (As a side note, the presence of separate mechanisms for somatic and germline sex determination that we have in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is unusual even among Diptera (Murray et al., 2010)).</p><p>To address the reviewer’s specific question: the male-specific and female-specific isoforms of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>tra</italic> are present in <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNA-seq datasets representing the gonads, fat body, and reproductive organs.</p><p>There are two reported isoforms of <italic>tra</italic> in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> – the male- and the female-specific one. According to gene expression data collated on Fly Atlas, these isoforms are both present in the fat body of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> males and females, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flyatlas.gla.ac.uk/FlyAtlas2/index.html?search=gene&amp;gene=tra&amp;idtype=symbol#mobileTargetG">http://flyatlas.gla.ac.uk/FlyAtlas2/index.html?search=gene&amp;gene=tra&amp;idtype=symbol#mobileTargetG</ext-link>).</p><p>There are three male and three female isoforms of <italic>D. melanogaster dsx</italic>. The female isoforms are all identical in their coding sequence; two of the male isoforms are identical in their coding sequence, while the third has an additional 23 amino acids at the C-terminus. According to the data collated on Fly Atlas, one of the male isoforms is present in the accessory glands, and one in the fat body. The <italic>dsxM</italic> isoform not represented in the Fly Atlas dataset has the same coding sequence as the <italic>dsxM</italic> isoform expressed in the fat body. Two of the three <italic>dsxF</italic> isoforms are present in the fat body. The third isoform is not expressed in any tissues homologous to those we studied, but its coding sequence does not differ from the two other <italic>dsxF</italic> isoforms with reported expression. Based on many years of <italic>Drosophila</italic> community resource development, including deep sequencing and microarray analysis of multiple tissues and developmental stages and extensive sequencing of cloned EST libraries, only 3 of the <italic>dsx</italic> isoforms are reasonably common; the rest were only identified recently through ultra-deep sequencing, and presumably represent rare isoforms.</p><p>Extrapolating from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> experience, we believe that although our sequencing efforts may have missed some rare isoforms, we have most likely captured the major <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>tra</italic> isoforms by sequencing the main sexually dimorphic tissues. In the revised manuscript, we added the following sentence to Materials and methods: “We reasoned that sexually dimorphic tissues were likely to express <italic>doublesex</italic> and <italic>transformer</italic>, including any sex-specific isoforms of these genes that might exist.”. In the Results section, the relevant sentence has been changed to “To understand when <italic>tra</italic>-dependent alternative splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> evolved, we identified <italic>tra</italic> isoforms expressed in sexually dimorphic tissues of males and females from three hemimetabolous insect orders…” and “To test for the presence of sex-specific <italic>dsx</italic> isoforms, we isolated <italic>dsx</italic> transcripts using PacBio Isosequencing, Illumina RNA-sequencing, and 5’ and 3’ RACE on sexually dimorphic tissues.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, please clarify if independent RNA samples were used to validate the cDNAs identified in the three different species.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, they were.

Though the results suggest a somewhat complicated evolutionary history with possible secondary reversions and group-specific specializations, the authors are able to suggest a coherent model for the shift from transcription-based differences in Dsx expression to splicing-based differences via Tra. Overall, the work represents a significant advance over what was known previously by examining several difficult to work with groups, and these efforts will lay the foundation for much future work on the evolution of this fascinating system.</p><p>I have only a few relatively minor concerns and specific suggestions (below). Perhaps the biggest question I am left with is how Dsx is differentially spliced in B. germanica when both sexes produce the same isoforms of Tra. The Discussion does a good job laying out possibilities but these are difficult to test and it would be great to know what else is targeted by Tra or that interacts with Tra to control sex. Unfortunately, I can't think of an easy or simple experiment to sort this out!</p><p>Given the speculation about the variety of isoforms it is tempting to start thinking about experiments that might test the ideas proposed. What would happen if the BgTra isoform with the &quot;interrupting exon&quot; in the CAM domain were specifically knocked down?</p></disp-quote><p>These are both excellent questions. However, answering these questions definitively will require extensive new experiments in <italic>B. germanica</italic> that we are not yet equipped to perform, so we only have possible hypotheses at this point. We have described these hypotheses in the Discussion. With the data we have, we would not feel comfortable speculating beyond this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The section that describes how the interrupting exon relates to the evolution of a male-specific stop codon is not especially clear (subsection “The role of transformer in sexual differentiation predates canonical sex-specific splicing of tra”, last paragraph). This section should at least be revised, even if further isoform-specific knock down is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-written that section of the Discussion (subsection “The role of transformer in sexual differentiation predates canonical sex-specific splicing of <italic>tra</italic>”, last paragraph). We hope that the revised version conveys our hypothesis more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While I am not especially surprised that Tra plays the role that it does in Blattodea (complete control of sexually specific morphology and probably behavior as well) this was previously not demonstrated and has been done well here. The differences in Dsx splicing and expression are unfortunately complicated but also well documented. I especially appreciate the review of current literature on specification of sex in not well studied insect outgroups, and the placement of the new findings in this context.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
