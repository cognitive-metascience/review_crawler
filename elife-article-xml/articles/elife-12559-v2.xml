Here, we explored neural coding in the barrel cortex of head-fixed mice that tracked walls with their whiskers in tactile virtual reality. Optogenetic manipulations revealed that barrel cortex plays a role in wall-tracking. Closed-loop optogenetic control of layer 4 neurons can substitute for whisker-object contact to guide behavior resembling wall tracking. We measured neural activity using two-photon calcium imaging and extracellular recordings. Neurons were tuned to the distance between the animal snout and the contralateral wall, with monotonic, unimodal, and multimodal tuning curves. This rich representation of object location in the barrel cortex could not be predicted based on simple stimulus-response relationships involving individual whiskers and likely emerges within cortical circuits.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12559.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12559.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12559.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mice are primarily nocturnal animals that rely on their whiskers to navigate dark underground burrows and winding corridors. When a whisker touches an object, cells called neurons at the base of the whiskers produce electrical signals that are relayed to other neurons in an area of the brain called the barrel cortex. However, it is not clear how information is encoded in these electrical signals, in part, because it is technically challenging to collect data about neuron activity and behavior while the mice move around.</p><p>To overcome these difficulties, Sofroniew, Vlasov et al. used a touch-based (or 'tactile') virtual reality system to study how mice navigate along corridors. The system simulated the contact the whiskers would have with the walls of a winding corridor. This was achieved by moving the walls with motors while holding the mouse still enough to be able to measure the activity of neurons in the barrel cortex and observe the behavior of the animal.</p><p>The experiments show that the electrical signals in the barrel cortex encode information about motion as well as the distance between the mouse and the wall. For example, some neurons in the barrel cortex were only activated when a mouse was a particular distance from the walls. The experiments suggest that the barrel cortex processes signals received from several whiskers to build an overall picture of the locations and shapes of objects.</p><p>Sofroniew, Vlasov et al. also used a technique called optogenetics to deliberately activate particular neurons in a manner that mimics their activity patterns during interactions with walls. In the absence of walls, the optogenetic stimuli guided the behavior of the mice so that they tracked along the paths of 'illusory' corridors. Together, these findings reveal the neural code in the barrel cortex that allows mice to navigate by touch.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12559.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12559.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>whiskers</kwd><kwd>barrel cortex</kwd><kwd>navigation</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>electrophysiologygy</kwd><kwd>head-fixed</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sofroniew</surname><given-names>Nicholas James</given-names></name><name><surname>Vlasov</surname><given-names>Yurii A</given-names></name><name><surname>Andrew Hires</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Freeman</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name><name><surname>Svoboda</surname><given-names>Karel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004316</institution-id><institution>International Business Machines Corporation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vlasov</surname><given-names>Yurii A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A tactile virtual reality system reveals the neural codes in the barrel cortex that underlie wall-tracking in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals must understand the spatial relationships of objects in their environment for navigation.

Studying tactile sensation during such natural behaviors is important, because the sensors themselves - digits, whiskers - move in an adaptive manner to produce sensory input.</p><p>Touches between whiskers and objects cause deformations of the whiskers and forces at the base of the whisker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birdwell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pammer et al., 2013</xref>) that are translated into neural excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zucker and Welker, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stuttgen et al., 2008</xref>) by mechanosensory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dörfl, 1985</xref>). Whiskers are elastic rods with a gradually decreasing thickness as a function of distance from the face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birdwell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hires et al., 2013</xref>). Because of the whisker taper, more proximal deflections cause larger forces at the base of the whisker than distal deflections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birdwell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pammer et al., 2013</xref>). Objects that are closer to the face therefore trigger higher spike rates in primary sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Szwed et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Excitation from primary sensory neurons ascends through the brainstem and thalamus to the whisker representation area of the somatosensory cortex, also referred to as barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van der Loos and Woolsey, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diamond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosman et al., 2011</xref>). Layer (L) 4 is the main thalamocortical recipient layer and contains spatial clusters of neurons, termed ‘barrels’. There is a one-to-one correspondence between L4 barrels and specific individual whiskers on the face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van der Loos and Woolsey, 1973</xref>). Neurons in layers 2/3, 5 &amp; 6, above and below a particular barrel, are part of a ‘barrel column’. Neurons in different layers interact through intricate excitatory and inhibitory neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pouille et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hooks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pluta et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Passive whisker deflection causes brief, short latency (~10 ms) excitatory responses in neurons across layers of the corresponding barrel column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simons, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armstrong-James et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Kock et al., 2007</xref>). Individual neurons are sensitive to the direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simons and Carvell, 1989</xref>), amplitude and velocity of whisker deflection, and neural responses increase monotonically with the strength of a whisker stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simons, 1978</xref>). Deflection of neighboring whiskers causes longer-latency, weaker, excitatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armstrong-James et al., 1992</xref>) and surround suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simons, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moore and Nelson, 1998</xref>), implying that neighboring barrel columns can inhibit each other. Similarly, sustained activation of one layer can have mainly inhibitory effects on other layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pluta et al., 2015</xref>), which could underlie complex responses of barrel cortex neurons that are sometimes seen during active sensation involving prolonged interactions with an object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krupa et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>During exploration, mice move their whiskers rhythmically over objects at ~16 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchinson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sofroniew et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sofroniew and Svoboda, 2015</xref>). In a whisker-based pole localization task in head-fixed mice, neurons in layer 4 and layer 2/3 of the barrel cortex show activity highly correlated with touch onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O'Connor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crochet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hires et al., 2015</xref>), with larger forces producing more vigorous responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peron et al., 2015</xref>). These responses are sensitive to the phase of the whisker at touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009</xref>) and the direction of deflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andermann and Moore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peron et al., 2015</xref>). Rodents can use the identity, magnitude, and timing of whisker-object touch to determine the spatial location of nearby objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brecht et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diamond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knutsen and Ahissar, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here, we explored coding in the whisker system during naturalistic behavior. We used a tactile virtual reality system that combines stimulus control and rich behavior with neural recordings and optogenetic manipulation to specifically investigate neural coding of wall position and motion across layers of the barrel cortex during whisker-guided locomotion. Our data show how environmental features are transformed and abstracted by somatosensory circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Barrel cortex is involved in wall tracking</title><p>Mice were head-fixed in a tactile virtual reality system consisting of an air-supported ball and two motorized walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sofroniew et al., 2014</xref>). The lateral distance between mouse and the walls was controlled in closed-loop with motion of the ball, allowing simulation of a winding corridor. When mice ran towards a wall, a motor moved the wall closer to the animal; when mice ran away from a wall, a motor moved the wall away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). When the mice are in the center of the corridor, their whiskers can just touch the walls. Mice use their whiskers to track the walls, staying near the center of the winding corridor without training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sofroniew et al., 2014</xref>). This wall-tracking behavior requires mice to interpret forces exerted by the walls on their whiskers in terms of wall distance.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12559.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Photoinhibition of barrel cortex during wall tracking.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Side view of a mouse in the tactile virtual reality system.

Trials with different bends were randomly interleaved. Mice continued to track the walls and matched their run angle to the bend angle in the corridor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We quantified performance for each trial using angle error, defined as the absolute difference between the run angle of the mouse and the angle of the bend in the corridor.</p><p>Whisker-guided locomotion could depend on activity in the barrel cortex, which rodents use in whisker-dependent gap crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hutson and Masterton, 1986</xref>), object detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyashita and Feldman, 2013</xref>) and object localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O'Connor et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, whisker-guided locomotion might be independent of the barrel cortex, for example, relying instead on the superior colliculus, which by itself can mediate orienting behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sprague, 1966</xref>) and active avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen and Castro-Alamancos, 2007</xref>). We tested whether whisker-guided wall tracking uses neural activity in the barrel cortex. Excitatory neurons in the barrel cortex were silenced by photostimulating GABAergic neurons expressing ChannelRhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in VGAT-ChR2-EYFP transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). Laser light was focused on the skull, 'photoinhibiting' all cortical layers across a 2-mm-diameter area within 20 ms of laser onset, which was reversed within 150 ms after laser offset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Rapid laser movement between spots on the left and right hemispheres enabled bilateral photoinhibition of the cortex. For silencing barrel cortex, the laser was centered on the C2 barrel, localized using intrinsic signal imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O'Connor et al., 2010</xref>). Mice whiskers were trimmed such that either a single C2 whisker (n = 3) or the C1, C2, and C3 whiskers (n = 5) remained. The corresponding barrel columns fall within the central millimeter of the photoinhibition volume, thus ensuring that the relevant representation in the barrel cortex was abolished by photoinhibition. The task was performed in the dark and stray light from the laser was shielded, eliminating visual cues for locomotion. Photoinhibition lasted for the time needed for mice to run through a one-meter bend (typically 3–7 s).</p><p>Silencing barrel cortex bilaterally impaired turning in response to bends in the corridor (angle error 8.09 ± 2.22° vs. 3.68 ± 0.55°, p = 6.4*10<sup>−4</sup> t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). Performance during photoinhibition was similar to performance after trimming all whiskers (angle error 8.09 ± 2.22° vs. 8.83 ± 2.24°, p = 0.52 t-test). In contrast, there was no effect on turning performance in response to bilateral photoinhibition of the visual cortex (angle error 3.20 ± 0.79° vs. 3.68 ± 0.55°, p = 0.19 t-test), controlling for non-specific effects of photoinhibition. We conclude that mice use neural activity in barrel cortex to guide locomotion along the wall.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Optogenetic activation of barrel cortex can guide locomotion</title><p>Object position can be encoded in spike counts in barrel cortex layer 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>). To determine whether activity in the barrel cortex can also drive a wall-tracking like behavior we optogenetically activated layer 4 using <italic>Scnn1a</italic>-TG3-Cre x Ai32 mice. Photoactivation was controlled in a closed-loop with the motion of the ball and in the absence of walls thus creating an 'illusory corridor', where information about distance to illusory walls is encoded in the strength of the photostimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Stimuli consisted of 2-ms laser pulses (10 Hz); at maximum experienced power the photostimulus evoked up to 8 additional spikes per neuron per second in layer 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The power was modulated depending on the position of the mice in the illusory corridor. When mice were in the center of the illusory corridor the laser was off; when mice were on the right side, the left barrel cortex was activated, and vice-versa. The closer the mice were to the edge of the illusory corridor, the higher the laser power in the corresponding hemisphere. Mice responded to photoactivation of layer 4 by making left and right turns at bends in the illusory corridor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), with slightly lower angle error than when responding to real walls (angle error 2.30 ± 0.85° vs. 3.19 ± 0.55°, p = 0.026 t-test). Running speeds in the illusory corridor were slower (13.2 ± 3.6 cm/s) than running speeds in the corridor with walls (20.4 ± 3.8 cm/s). When parietal (n=3 mice) or visual cortices (n=5 mice) were activated mice did not follow the bends in the corridor (angle error 14.01 ± 1.73° vs. 3.19 ± 0.55°, p = 1.7*10<sup>-8</sup> t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). This response to photoactivation was not learnt as all mice performed the task from the very first trial, similarly to how they perform the task with the real walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sofroniew et al., 2014</xref>), and the reward was provided in each trial independent of behavioral performance.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12559.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Photoactivation of layer 4 to guide locomotion.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of an illusory corridor generated with position-dependent photoactivation.

Individual units showed diverse responses to interactions with the wall that were reproducible across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>). Some units had low activity when the wall was out of reach and increased activity monotonically as the wall moved closer or had maximal responses at particular wall distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>). Other units had high activity when the wall was out of reach and decreased activity monotonically as the wall approached certain wall distances. We also observed more complex responses, including a mix of enhancement and suppression across wall distances. Distances eliciting peak responses tiled the relevant space of wall distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>).</p><p>For each unit, we quantified activation and suppression as a function of wall distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). The baseline rate of each unit was the spike rate during periods of running when the wall was out of reach of the whiskers. Activation was the difference between peak spike rate and baseline spike rate; suppression was the difference between baseline spike rate and minimum spike rate. Both the peaks and troughs of the activated and suppressed units tiled the relevant wall distance range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). A modulation index was calculated as the difference between activation and suppression normalized by the sum of activation and suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). This index ranged from one, for activated units, to minus one, for suppressed units, with mixed units that are both activated and suppressed near zero. The majority of units showed activation (106/148; 72% modulation &gt; 0.5), but a sizable fraction showed suppression or mixed responses (42/148; 28% modulation &lt;0.5). Units with negative and near-zero modulation indices tended to be found in infragranular layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>).</p><p>These tuning curves were generated during open-loop movements of the wall, but during natural behavior the wall will move in closed-loop with locomotion. To investigate whether tuning under these conditions is similar, we characterized wall distance tuning during closed-loop wall-movements for a subset of mice (10 mice; 114 regular spiking units). In closed-loop, wall distance sampling is non-uniform because the sensory stimulus depends on behavior. We combined epochs across several widths and bends in the corridor to approximately sample wall distance as in the open-loop condition. Units showed similar tuning curves under both open-loop and closed-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>), with similar average rates over the same wall distances range (107/114; 94% -0.5 &lt; open vs. closed modulation &lt; 0.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3c,d</xref>). A substantial fraction of all units (31%; 46/148) were significantly modulated by running speed in the absence of the walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4a,b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saleem et al., 2013</xref>). However, the wall distance tuning curves computed during slow running and fast running were similar on average (modulation index was −0.10 ± 0.55) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4c,d,e</xref>).</p><p>When running in a narrow corridor, whiskers can interact with both walls simultaneously. Information from the whiskers projects directly to the contralateral barrel cortex from subcortical structures; however, a small callosal projection also carries information from one side of the barrel cortex to the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Czeiger and White, 1993</xref>). For a subset of mice (3 mice; 29 regular spiking units) we recorded activity in response to open-loop movements of the ipsilateral wall. Compared to interactions with the contralateral wall, very few units were strongly modulated by interactions with the ipsilateral wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5a,b,c,d</xref>). Spike rate changes in response to interactions with the contralateral wall were consistently greater than to the ipsilateral wall (27/29; 93% contra vs ipsi modulation &gt; 0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5e,f</xref>). This finding is consistent with the results of the unilateral activation experiment, which suggest the hemisphere contralateral to the wall is predominantly involved in wall-tracking.</p><p>Some units exhibited sensitivity not only to wall position, but also to the direction of wall motion. We compared responses when the wall moved towards or away from the mouse on open-loop trials. Some units were activated when the wall distance decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>, top two), whereas other units were activated when wall distance increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>, bottom two).

Mice used their whiskers to navigate winding corridors in tactile virtual reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sofroniew et al., 2014</xref>). Neural activity in the barrel cortex was necessary for guiding locomotion based on whisker cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, graded activation of layer 4 neurons in the barrel cortex was sufficient to guide locomotion in an illusory corridor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Remarkably, similar to closed-loop wall tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sofroniew et al., 2014</xref>), no training was required for mice to run in an illusory corridor. The tracking accuracy in the illusory corridor was on par or better compared to the real corridor; this may be because the photostimulus provided a stronger distance-dependent signal compared to touch-evoked activity. These experiments show that downstream layers and brain areas can interpret increases of layer 4 spike rate as increased proximity to a wall on the contralateral side and drive the appropriate turning responses. Previous experiments suggest key roles for the superior colliculus in orienting and goal-directed behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sprague, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen and Castro-Alamancos, 2007</xref>). Barrel cortex activity could drive whisker-guided locomotion through the superior colliculus and rubrospinal circuits. These brain areas could also be capable of mediating this behavior independently after chronic barrel cortex lesions.</p><p>The optogenetic experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggest a simple code for wall distance: wall distance could be coded as inversely proportional to neural activity in layer 4. Sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion have monotonic responses to object distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Szwed et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, during passive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simons, 1978</xref>) or simple single-whisker behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simons, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peron et al., 2015</xref>) barrel cortex neurons show monotonic relationships with stimulus strength. The majority of L2/3 and L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b,c</xref>) neurons responded weakly when the wall was out of reach and only responded strongly when the contralateral wall came within reach. However, many neurons exhibited a rich representation of wall distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Some neurons had non-monotonic unimodal relationships with wall distance and were most active at intermediate wall distances. Across the population, neuronal tuning tiled all wall distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Activity of other neurons showed even more complex, multimodal tuning to wall distance. Complex responses to wall distance were especially pronounced in L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). Encoding wall distance with a population of tuning curves that increase monotonically with decreasing wall distance (i.e. sigmoids) would lead to very large metabolic costs when representing small distances. Given a fixed metabolic cost, a population of non-monotonic (i.e. Gaussian) tuning curves that tile the most frequently encountered distances can achieve higher overall encoding accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganguli and Simoncelli, 2014</xref>). Some of the features of these complex tuning curves may also be used for processing by downstream neurons.</p><p>We measured tuning curves from layer 2/3 neurons using both calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Both recording methods revealed neurons that were strongly activated when the wall approached. The calcium imaging dataset in addition contained some neurons that were activated by running and suppressed monotonically as the wall came closer to the face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). These neurons may have been activated by tactile stimuli from the D and E row whiskers that are capable of touching the ball during running, and suppressed as the shorter surround whiskers touched the wall at smaller wall distances. In contrast, in the electrophysiology data the majority of the units were located in the C row barrels and had low baseline activity even during running.</p><p>Calcium imaging revealed 28% of neurons as tuned to wall distance. Using similar methods, 17% of neurons responded to touch during a pole location discrimination task performed with a single whisker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peron et al., 2015</xref>). These differences could arise from the multi-whisker nature of the wall-tracking experiments, the greater complexity of the interactions between the whiskers and the wall compared to the pole, or the fact that mice were running during wall-tracking.</p><p>Neurons were also sensitive to the direction of wall movement. This sensitivity could be produced by neurons that have tuning to the direction of whisker deflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andermann and Moore, 2006</xref>). Wall direction selective neurons could be useful for helping the mice determine wall velocity, and acceleration. Coding for these variables, in addition to wall distance, could help the mice better track the walls through control laws that include derivative feedback alongside proportional feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sofroniew et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Multiple mechanisms could contribute to complex, non-monotonic tuning curves in barrel cortex neurons. Mice may have adjusted their whisker movements in subtle ways with wall distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voigts et al., 2015</xref>) which could change the strengths of the interactions with the wall and thus shape tuning curves. The similarity of tuning curves under open-loop and closed-loop conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), where running direction are different, suggests that the details of whisker motion are unlikely to be a critical factor. Another mechanism is based on cross-columnar inhibition mediated by multi-whisker interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simons, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brumberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moore and Nelson, 1998</xref>). Individual whiskers have different lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ibrahim and Wright, 1975</xref>) and touch the wall at different times as it approaches. Neurons driven by the long whiskers may be suppressed by neurons driven by the shorter whiskers at smaller wall distances, resulting in non-monotonic distance tuning curves. A third mechanism relies on cross-laminar excitation and inhibition. Neurons in different layers are coupled through interlaminar connections which excite both excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons in the target layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hooks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldmeyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pluta et al., 2015</xref>). The balance of excitation and inhibition can change over time scales of milliseconds to seconds. For example, over short time scales the synchronous excitation of L4 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hires et al., 2015</xref>) is expected to drive spikes in L5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>). Over longer time scales L4 activation promotes mostly inhibition in L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pluta et al., 2015</xref>). Cross-columnar and cross-laminar inhibition combined with short-term synaptic plasticity, likely help generate the complex representation of distance in the barrel cortex, which in turn supports wall-tracking behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Twelve VGAT-ChR2-EYFP BAC (line 8) transgenic mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME: <italic>014548; VGAT</italic> corresponds to <italic>Slc321a</italic>) were used for photoinhibition experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2014</xref>).

The light was directed onto a 2D scanning galvo system (Thorlabs, GVSM002). The position of the scan mirrors was controlled with +/− 10 V analogue signals from the behavioral control system. The beam was then expanded 5x with plano-convex lenses (Thorlabs, LA1951-A, and LA1384-A) and focused onto the brain surface with a f = 200 mm lens (Thorlabs, AC508-200-A).

To ensure complete shielding of the stray laser light for silencing experiments, 3D-printed black plastic pieces were secured to the skull of the mouse and to a lens tube via a black bellows junction (McMaster Carr, Elmhurst, IL, 94205K77). A stereomicroscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan, SMZ745, with C-W 10xB [F.N. 22] eyepieces and a G-AL0.5X auxiliary objective) was used to align the laser with vasculature or Bregma.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Photoinhibition parameters</title><p>Bilateral photoinhibition was achieved by deflecting the laser beam between the left and right hemispheres at 100 Hz. On each hemisphere the laser either dwelled at a single spot for 10 ms or dithered between 5 spots arranged in a cross with 300 µm between the spots. For bilateral silencing, three mice were stimulated with average power 25 mW per hemisphere in a 300 µm cross, two mice were stimulated with average power 15 mW per hemisphere in a 300 µm cross, and three mice were stimulated with average power 20 mW per hemisphere at a single spot. For each animal, stimulation of S1 and V1 used the same parameters. Unilateral photoinhibition was achieved by deflecting the laser between the target hemisphere and a spot outside of the preparation at 100 Hz. Four mice were silenced at a single spot with average power 7.5 mW per hemisphere. These parameters result in robust silencing throughout the depth of the cortex over a 2–4 mm<sup>2</sup> area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2014</xref>).

The effects of photoactivation were calibrated using cell-attached recordings in awake but non-running mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). For closed-loop activation experiments, peak laser power was scaled to position in the virtual corridor such that the laser was off when mice were at the center of the corridor and at 4.5 mW power if mice were at the edge of the virtual corridor. Mice mainly stayed in the portion of the corridor where the laser power was under 2 mW. The left hemisphere was stimulated if the mouse was on the right side of the virtual corridor, and the right hemisphere was stimulated if the mouse was on the left side of the virtual corridor.

Open-loop experiments were four seconds long and consisted of one second of the wall moving in towards a fixed distance from the mouse and one second of the wall moving away from the animal. The wall was allowed to come to the face not closer than 4 mm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Electrophysiology analysis</title><p>Raw voltages were band-pass filtered between 300 and 6000 Hz (MATLAB, Natick, MA: ‘idealfilter’). Common noise was estimated by averaging across channels at each time-point (MATLAB ‘trimmean’, using 50% of the channels) and was subtracted from each of the individual channels. All events that exceeded an amplitude threshold of three standard deviations of the background activity were detected. To avoid detecting multiple copies of synchronously spiking neighboring neurons threshold crossings that occurred within a 450 μs shadow period were merged within a mask covering several neighboring channels. The mask depth was adjusted dynamically and varied from 4 to 7 electrodes depending on neighboring activity. The event amplitudes across all 32 channels along with the first 3 PCAs of the waveform were used as features for spike sorting. Spikes were manually sorted in the klusters environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neurosuite.sourceforge.net/">http://neurosuite.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>). A waveform signal to noise ratio &gt; 6 and the false alarm rate &lt; 1.5% were used as quality control metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). With these parameters 95% of the sorted units had a maximum spike rate &gt; 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c</xref>).</p><p>All subsequent data analysis was done in Python using the numpy, scipy, and pandas packages. Spike times were binned in 2-ms bins and compared to the wall distance using the same methods as the calcium imaging.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Neural coding in barrel cortex during whisker-guided locomotion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Sacha Nelson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the reviewers, Daniel Feldman, has also agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates whisker-based sensory coding of wall distance in somatosensory cortex during innate wall following behavior in mice. This is an important extension of prior whisker coding studies in mouse S1, which have focused on simple detection, front-back localization, and surface properties. Using optogenetics, the authors show that S1 firing is necessary and sufficient for accurate wall following. Multi electrode recording, and calcium imaging, show that many S1 neurons encode wall distance, with most neurons preferring close distances, but many showing clear tuning for intermediate wall distances. In addition, many S1 neurons also encode direction of wall motion. Overall, these findings reveal a critical role for S1 activity in encoding distance estimation during wall following behavior.</p><p>Essentials revisions:</p><p>1) Although the text refers to layers 2/3 and 5, the figures do not make clear where the boundaries of L4 are. It would be clearer to actually assign units to specific laminae and not simply distance from the center of L4. If this is not possible, perhaps the average boundaries could be indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>2) Although there are other indications that activity in L2/3 is sparse, the authors should say more about a) whether or not there is overall agreement in the activity of cells studied electrophysiologically and with imaging and b) whether there were indications that the inactive cells were completely inactive or fired occasionally. Related to this is the question of how ROIs were chosen--i.e. is there any approximate sense of how the criteria stated in the methods translates into firing rate? Did a similar minimum firing rate apply in practice to units which could be isolated electrophysiologically?</p><p>3) It might be useful to include some additional analyses of the relationship between firing and running rate. It is not clear how tuning for wall distance and speed interact.</p><p>Additional suggestions:</p><p>One of the reviewers made the following suggestions for additional work that would add to the impact of the paper, but the reviewers agreed this would not be necessary for acceptance of the paper. Perhaps some of these issues could be addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>1) How is distance information read out from S1? The L4-ChR2 results argue for a simple firing rate code for proximity. However, the physiology shows many neurons that are tuned for intermediate distances, and the Discussion argues that such Gaussian tuning curves are metabolically more efficient than monotonic distance-response functions. If distance information is encoded by Gaussian-tuned neurons, why does ChR2 stimulation at varying intensities-which implements a monotonic population firing rate code-effectively drive wall-following behavior? (This fictive wall following is even more accurate than real-wall following!)</p><p>2) How is distance tuning generated for individual S1 neurons? Perhaps the simplest model is that each neuron's preferred distance matches the length of its principal whisker. This would make sense because more distant positions cannot directly drive spikes from the cell, while closer wall positions likely suppress firing by activating additional, shorter surround whiskers, which inhibit the recorded neuron. Such net inhibition between neighboring whiskers has been observed often in passive studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12559.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essentials revisions: 1) Although the text refers to layers 2/3 and 5, the figures do not make clear where the boundaries of L4 are.

The accuracy of tracking in the fictive corridor may depend on the details of the photostimulus (e.g. photostimulation frequency).

We have added text to the Discussion to address this point.</p><p> <italic>2) How is distance tuning generated for individual S1 neurons?
