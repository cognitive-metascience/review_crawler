The NPC is a long-lived and exceptionally large structure. We asked whether NPC quality control is compromised in aging mitotic cells. Our images of single yeast cells during aging, show that the abundance of several NPC components and NPC assembly factors decreases. Additionally, the single-cell life histories reveal that cells that better maintain those components are longer lived. The presence of herniations at the nuclear envelope of aged cells suggests that misassembled NPCs are accumulated in aged cells. Aged cells show decreased dynamics of transcription factor shuttling and increased nuclear compartmentalization. These functional changes are likely caused by the presence of misassembled NPCs, as we find that two NPC assembly mutants show similar transport phenotypes as aged cells. We conclude that NPC interphase assembly is a major challenge for aging mitotic cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nuclear pore complex

transport and communication between the nucleus and cytosol are essential for life in eukaryotes and malfunction is linked to cancer and neurodegeneration (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fichtman and Harel, 2014</xref>). Nucleocytoplasmic transport is exclusively performed by the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) and several nuclear transport receptors (NTRs or karyopherins) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiserova and Goldberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hurt and Beck, 2015</xref>). NPCs are large (~52 MDa in yeast and ~120 MDa in humans) and dynamic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Onischenko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Teimer et al., 2017</xref>). Each NPC is composed of ~30 different proteins, called nucleoporins or Nups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The components of the symmetric core scaffold are long lived both in dividing yeast cells and in postmitotic cells, while several FG-Nups are turned over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Angelo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Savas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thayer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Toyama et al., 2013</xref>) and dynamically associate with the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dilworth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niño et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rabut et al., 2004</xref>). Previous studies performed in postmitotic aging cells (chronological aging) showed changes in NPC structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Angelo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Toyama et al., 2019</xref>), and also in aging mitotic cells (replicative aging) changes in NPCs have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lord et al., 2015</xref>). To study the fate of NPCs in mitotic aging, we use replicative aging budding yeast cells as a model. Individual yeast cells have a finite lifespan which is defined as the number of divisions that they can go through before they die: their replicative lifespan (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Longo et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The divisions are asymmetric and while the mother cell ages the daughter cell is born young. Remarkably, studying the lifespan of this single-cell eukaryote has been paramount for our understanding of aging (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Longo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nyström and Liu, 2014</xref>) and many of the changes that characterize aging in yeast are shared with humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janssens and Veenhoff, 2016b</xref>). In the current study, we address changes to the NPC structure and function during mitotic aging by imaging of single cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48186.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The cellular abundance of some NPC components changes in replicative aging.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cartoon representation of the NPC illustrates different structural regions of the NPC, all FG-Nups are shown in green independently of their localization, the membrane rings in light brown, the inner rings in purple, the outer rings in brown, the mRNA export complex in pink, and the nuclear basket structure in light blue.

Indeed, the proteome and transcriptome data give a comprehensive image of the cellular abundance of NPC components in aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We observe that the cellular levels of NPC components showed loss of stoichiometry during replicative aging, which were not reflected in the more stable transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Clearly in mitotic aging, a posttranscriptional drift of Nup levels is apparent.</p><p>The total abundance of NPC components measured in these whole cell extracts potentially reflects an average of proteins originating from functional NPCs, prepores, misassembled NPCs, and possibly protein aggregates. Therefore, we validated for a subset of Nups (Nup133, Nup49, Nup100, Nup116 and Nup2) that GFP-tagged proteins expressed from their native promoters still localized at the nuclear envelope in old cells. In addition, we validated that changes in relative abundance of the Nups at the nuclear envelope were in line with the changes found in the proteome. We included Nup116 and Nup2 in our experiments as those Nups showed the strongest decrease in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Nup133 was included because its abundance was stable in aging and Nup100 was included because it is important for the permeability barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lord et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Popken et al., 2015</xref>). We used Nup49-mCh as a reference in all of our microfluidic experiments as Nup49 had previously been used as a marker for NPCs. The proteome data indicated that Nup49 showed a relatively stable abundance profile in aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). The tagging of the Nups with GFP and mCherry (mCh) reduced the fitness of those strains to different extents but all retained median division time under 2.5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Nsp1 could not be included in the validation, because the Nsp1-GFP fusion had a growth defect and could not be combined with Nup49-mCh, Nup100-mCh or Nup133-mCh in the BY4741 background. We used microfluidic platforms that allow uninterrupted life-long imaging of cells under perfectly controlled constant conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crane et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

Consistent with the proteome data, and with previously reported data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lord et al., 2015</xref>), in the vast majority of aging cells the abundance of Nup116-GFP decreased relative to Nup49-mCh, while the abundance of Nup133-GFP appears more stable.

Therefore, we could assess if the changes observed for the individual NPC components correlated to the lifespan of a cell and, indeed, for Nup116 and Nup100 such correlations to lifespan were found, where those cells with lowest levels of NE-localized GFP-tagged Nups had the shortest remaining lifespan (for Nup100 r = −0.48; p=1.27×10<sup>−7</sup> and Nup116 r = −0.56; p=6.54×10<sup>−4</sup>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2f,g</xref>). The statistics of these correlations are in line with aging being a multifactorial process where the predictive power of individual features is limited.

Single-cell Nup abundances at the NE can be highly variable (Nup2), while for other Nups (Nup100, Nup116) the loss in abundance at the NE was found in almost all aging cells and correlated with the lifespan of the cell.

Indeed, in postmitotic cells, oxidative damage was proposed to lead to the appearance of carbonyl groups on Nups inducing more permeable NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Angelo et al., 2009</xref>). We have limited information on the maintenance of existing NPCs during replicative aging but there is some precedent for the hypothesis that even in the fast dividing yeast cells damage to existing NPCs may accumulate in aged cells. Indeed, NPCs remain intact during multiple divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colombi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khmelinskii et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thayer et al., 2014</xref>), and especially in aged mother cells a fraction of the NPCs is inherited asymmetrically to the aging mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>). Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the cell is a major source of damage and can result in irreversible carbonylation of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stadtman and Levine, 2003</xref>). Protein carbonyls can be formed through several pathways. Here, we focused on the most prominent one, the direct oxidation of the Lysine, Threonine, Arginine and Proline (K, T, R, P) side chains through Metal Catalyzed Oxidation (MCO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stadtman and Levine, 2003</xref>) by the Fenton reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maisonneuve et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stadtman and Levine, 2003</xref>). Despite extensive efforts and using different in vitro and in vivo oxidative conditions and using different carbonyl-detection methods we could not find evidence for oxidative damage of Nsp1, Nup2, Nic96 and Nup133 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a,b</xref> shows negative results for Nsp1 along with a positive control).</p><p>Further indication that oxidative damage is unlikely to impact the NPC in aging came from modeling studies. We carried out coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations using our previously developed one-bead-per-amino-acid model of the disordered phase of the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghavami et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghavami et al., 2014</xref>).

Chm7 sometimes forms a focus at the NE and the frequency of focus formation is related to NPC assembly problems as mutant strains with impaired NPC assembly show more frequently Chm7 foci at the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). We quantified the frequency of focus formation in differently aged cells. Indeed, the foci are more than twice as frequently seen in the highest age group (age 15–24), compared to cells younger than five divisions.

In addition to facilitating active transport, the NPC is a size dependent diffusion barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Popken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Timney et al., 2016</xref>).

To test whether their transport changes with aging, we used GFP-tcNLS (GFP with a tandem classical NLS, Kap60 and Kap95 import cargo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldfarb et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wychowski et al., 1985</xref>) and GFP-NES (Crm1 export cargo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shulga et al., 1999</xref>) reporter proteins, and GFP as a control. We carefully quantified the steady-state localization of transport reporters in individual aging cells in the non-invasive microfluidic setup (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> for lifespan of strains). In the vast majority of cells, we observed that GFP carrying a tcNLS accumulated more strongly in the nucleus at high ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, middle panel), and, interestingly, the GFP carrying a NES is more strongly depleted from the nucleus in the vast majority of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, right panel). For the control, GFP, we find a more stable N/C ratio in aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, left panel).

The steady state localization of these GFP-reporter proteins depends on the kinetics of NTR facilitated transport (import or export) and passive permeability (influx and efflux). While we cannot formally exclude that retention mechanisms appear during aging, the efflux experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–c</xref> do confirm that GFP remains mobile in aged cells, and also the stable localization of the control, GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), supports that retention mechanisms have little impact. Thus, under the assumption that retention mechanisms play an age-independent and minimal role, we can interpret the steady state ratio’s to report on the balance between the rates of NTR-facilitated-transport (import and export) and passive permeability (influx and efflux). This would mean that the systematic changes in the steady state localization of the reporter proteins that we observe in the aging cells results from a change in the balance between the rates of NTR-facilitated-transport and passive permeability.</p><p>Changes in the rates of NTR-facilitated-transport and passive permeability may be related to changes in the NPCs themselves or they may be related to an increased availability of NTRs. We measure no changes in abundance of NTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>) and find no indication that the abundance of protein cargo changes during aging <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2e,f</xref>). Moreover, the increased nuclear compartmentalization seems to be independent of the reporter protein’s respective NTRs. We thus consider it less likely that the rates of NTR-facilitated-transport and passive permeability are related to an increased availability of NTRs and further explore how changes in the NPCs can explain the altered balance between the rates of NTR-facilitated-transport (import and export) and passive permeability (influx and efflux).</p><p>To our knowledge, mutation or deletion of Nup53 is the only mutation in the NPC that has been shown to lead to increased steady state compartmentalization (of Kap121 dependent cargo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makhnevych et al., 2003</xref>). On the contrary, many strains, including those where NPC components that decrease in abundance in aging are deleted or truncated, show loss of compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lord et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Popken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strawn et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, the only other strain that was previously reported to have an increased compartmentalization is a strain defective in NPC assembly due to a deletion of <italic>apq12</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scarcelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). We found that deletion of <italic>apq12</italic> is genomically instable and not viable in the BY strain background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), hence we recreated the deletion mutant in the W303 background, where it is stable. Indeed, we found that the deletion of <italic>apq12</italic> was sufficient to mimic the increase in compartmentalization seen in aging showing increased nuclear accumulation of GFP-NLS and exclusion of GFP-NES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). To further investigate whether the accumulation of misassembled NPCs could cause an increase in nuclear compartmentalization, we quantified the localization of GFP-NLS in a <italic>vps4Δheh2Δ</italic> double mutant. Both individual mutations were previously shown to progressively accumulate misassembled NPCs during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Webster et al., 2014</xref>). We found indeed that cells at a median age of two divisions had a significantly higher N/C ratio of GFP-NLS than young cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). The increased compartmentalization in aged cells and in the <italic>apq12</italic> and <italic>vps4Δheh2Δ</italic> mutant can be explained if fewer functional NPCs are present in the NE. Reduced numbers of NPCs would predominantly impact passive permeability, as the rate-limiting step for NTR-facilitated-transport is not at the level of the number of NPCs but rather at the level of NTRs and cargos finding each other in the crowded cytosol with overwhelming nonspecific competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinema et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Riddick and Macara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Timney et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A previous report showed a reduction in nuclear accumulation of GFP-NLS in age 6 + yeast cells isolated from a culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lord et al., 2015</xref>), while we see no statistically significant difference at this age. We note that there are many differences in the experimental setups that may explain the difference. One possible explanation is that Lord et al., used a different strain background, which might be differently susceptible to NPC assembly problems in aging. Indeed, we noted that several phenotypes, for example the appearance of SINC (Storage of Improperly assembled Nuclear pore complex Compartment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Webster et al., 2014</xref>) structures related to NPC assembly, are distinct in both strain backgrounds used.</p><p>Next, we addressed the transport of native proteins in aged cells. We studied Srm1, the yeast homologue of Rcc1, as endogenously expressed GFP-tagged protein. Srm1 is the nucleotide exchange factor that exchanges GDP for GTP on Ran and its nuclear localization ensures that Ran-GTP levels inside the nucleus are high. The localization of Srm1 depends on Kap60/Kap95-mediated import and retention inside the nucleus via chromatin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nemergut et al., 2001</xref>). While the cellular abundance of Srm1 was stable during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>), we found that the nuclear accumulation of Srm1-GFP increased during replicative aging in most cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g,h</xref>). The steady-state localization of Srm1 cannot be directly interpreted in terms of transport as retention plays an important role, but it is striking that the change in localization of Srm1-GFP is in line with the changes observed for GFP-NLS. Interestingly, the human homologue of Srm1, Rcc1, was previously also reported to have an increased nuclear concentration in myonuclei and brain nuclei of aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cutler et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Alterations of the nuclear envelope permeability during aging affects transcription factor dynamics</title><p>Additionally, we studied Msn2, a transcriptional regulator that responds to various stresses and translocates to the nucleus in pulses, a so-called frequency modulated transcription factor. Msn2 communicates information about the environment by modifying the frequency of pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hao and O'Shea, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hao et al., 2013</xref>). These pulse dynamics are primarily determined by the rates of nuclear import and nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hao et al., 2013</xref>), but retention mechanisms also apply. By following endogenously tagged Msn2-GFP, we were able to observe the pulse dynamics for individual cells, and quantify specific features of each pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Specifically, for each Msn2 pulse, we determined the peak prominence and the pulse width. To determine how aging affected the import and export kinetics, we imaged mother cells for short periods of time every 10 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). We observed that, as predicted by the alterations in NPCs, the average pulse widths for each cell increased consistently from middle-age onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Similarly, by aligning all Msn2 pulses on top of each other for a given age, we determined a mean pulse shape for each age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). These show similar characteristics, where the aging results in both broader and lower Msn2 pulses. As could be expected given the striking age-related changes, both the pulse width and pulse prominence are correlated to the remaining lifespan of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>, r = −0.36, p&lt;0.0001 and r = 0.47, p&lt;0.0001 for pulse prominence and pulse width, respectively). We consider it likely, that the decrease in Msn2 dynamics is a readout for the NPC’s ability to facilitate rapid responses. Aging cells may thus respond more slowly to changes in their environment due to reduced nuclear cytoplasmic transport and communication.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48186.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Alterations of nuclear envelope permeability during aging affects transcription factor dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic showing pulses of Msn2 translocation to the nucleus and movement back to the cytoplasm.

Here, we study the fate of NPCs in dividing yeast cells with the anticipation that the insights may be relevant to aging of mitotic cells such as stem cells. Overall, our data is consistent with a model where NPC assembly and quality control are compromised in mitotic aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and where misassembled NPCs, which specifically lack the FG-Nups that we see declining in aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), accumulate in aged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Without intervention, the loss of FG-Nups at the NE would almost certainly create leaky NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Popken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strawn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Timney et al., 2016</xref>), as also predicted by our models of aged NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>). However, based on our transport data, we can exclude a scenario where leaky NPCs are present at the NE of mitotically aged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Instead, our data supports that the misassembled NPCs get covered with membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), a structure known to be present in <italic>nup116</italic>, <italic>vps4pom152</italic> and <italic>apq12</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scarcelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Webster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Webster et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wente and Blobel, 1993</xref>).

The defects in NPCs in aging may thus be a consequence of the imbalanced protein levels of the NPC components and assembly factors. This imbalance is not transcriptionally driven since, with few exceptions, the transcriptional changes in Nups, NTRs and assembly factors are small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>), but is rather related to protein synthesis, folding and assembly. Indeed, the proteome changes in the Nups are well linked to other changes in the proteome of aging cells: Nup116, Nsp1, Nup159, Nic96, Nup82, Nup157 and Nup2 appear in the middle clusters of the proteome network meaning that they are predicted to be consequential to earlier changes, but also that they drive later changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>). Our finding of correlations between remaining lifespan of a cell and the abundance of several Nups and assembly factors, as well as the transport dynamics of Msn2, also supports that a potential causal relation between NPC function and lifespan may exist. The ways that faulty NPCs may further drive aging are numerous. For instance, mitotically aging cells are expected to respond more slowly to changes in their environment due to reduced nuclear cytoplasmic transport and communication. Moreover, declining NPC function, which by itself is a consequence of failing protein quality control, will result in aberrant transcription regulation and mRNA export, and, with that, contributes to the further loss of protein homeostasis. Lastly, faulty NPCs may impact the loss of genome stability in aging and the joint dependence of NPC assembly and genome stability on Apq12 provides an interesting observation in this context. Altogether, our study contributes to the emerging view that NPC function is a factor of importance in aging and age-related disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fichtman and Harel, 2014</xref>) impinging on the universal hallmarks of human aging of intercellular communication and loss of protein homeostasis.</p><p>Our work also provides the first clear example that the assembly of large protein complexes is a major challenge in aging of dividing cells. Indeed, there is data to support that loss of protein complex stoichiometry is a prominent and conserved phenotype in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ori et al., 2015</xref>). We speculate that the assembly and quality control of many other long-lived large protein complexes, such as the proteasome and kinetochores, both becoming highly substoichiometric in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ori et al., 2015</xref>), are compromised in mitotically aging cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>All <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed Table 4 and were validated by sequencing.

Fluorescent intensity measurements were corrected for background fluorescence. To quantify the abundance of proteins at the NE, an outline was made along the NE in the mCherry channel. The outline was used to measure the average fluorescent intensities in the mCherry and GFP channels. To quantify the nuclear localization (N/C ratio), the NE was outlined based on the Nup49-mCherry signal and the average fluorescence intensity at the nucleus was measured. A section in the cytosol devoid of vacuoles (appearing black) was selected for determining the average fluorescence intensity in the cytosol. We note that the average fluorescence of GFP in the cytosol may be underestimated in aged cells as aged cells have many small vacuoles that make it hard to select vacuole-free areas in the cytosol. The extent to which this affects the data can best be judged from the cells expression GFP where the N/C ratio on average increases from 1.2 to 1.25 in 30 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).

The process of introducing cells to the device was found to increase Msn2 activity for the first hour or two following device loading. To ensure that the baseline timecourse in young cells was representative of pulse dynamics and not affected by loading stress, fluorescence imaging was begun after cells had been allowed to acclimate for 3 hr. Brightfield images were acquired at every timepoint, with intervals of 5 min when fluorescence images were not acquired. Fluorescence images were acquired for 2 hr, at intervals of 90 s, with three z-slices of 1.5 μm. Following the fluorescence imaging, bright-field images were acquired for 8 hr to ensure that cells could be tracked and the number of daughter divisions could be scored.

This value was used for correlations with remaining lifespan and distribution of pulse widths at each age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These software programs use the partition coefficient <italic>P</italic> (ratio of concentrations in a mixture of two immiscible phases at equilibrium, usually water and octanol) as a measure of hydrophobicity. Since the range of the ratio of concentrations is large, the logarithm of the ratio of concentrations is commonly used: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></p><p>These programs provide different estimates of the value of log <italic>P</italic> for a given chemical structure.

To obtain a reliable value for each of the chemically modified amino acids, a weighted average scheme is used. Instead of using the predicted hydrophobicity for the entire residue, it is more accurate to use the predicted change in hydrophobicity since the change in molecular structure upon introduction of a functional group due to carbonylation is small. To account for the variation in accuracy of the predictor programs, a weight is assigned to each program based on the deviation of the prediction from our existing force field value for the amino-acids in their native state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghavami et al., 2014</xref>).

For instance, the carbonylated form of K and R, that is aminoadipic semialdehyde (Asa) and glutamic semialdehyde (GSA), respectively, loose their positive charge and become neutral, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Petrov and Zagrovic, 2011</xref>). In addition, P has a ring structure which opens up during carbonylation making the polypeptide backbone less stiff.

overall distribution of the disordered phase, we analyzed the changes in net hydrophobicity and charge. While the hydrophobicity for T and P is reduced, the hydrophobicity of K and R increases, resulting in only a 5% increase in net hydrophobicity for a maximally carbonylated NPC (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Furthermore, carbonylation leads to a negatively charged NPC (−7560e) compared to a weakly positive charged wild-type NPC (+512 e) as all K and R become neutral. To separate the effects of charge and hydrophobicity on the structure, we carried out an additional simulation in which we consider only the change in hydrophobicity caused by carbonylation and leave the charge unaffected (termed ‘Carbonylated_HP’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>). The results show that the carbonylated_HP NPC is more hydrophobic than the wild type (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), resulting in a denser FG-Nup network with the maximum at a larger <italic>r</italic>-value. However, when also the charge modification is accounted for in the ‘Carbonylated’ case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref> the Coulombic repulsion leads to a lowering of the density, illustrating that both the change in hydrophobicity and charge affect the distribution of the disordered phase.

After 2 hr, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 50 mM KPi pH7.0 and the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of the same buffer. Drops of the suspension were frozen in liquid nitrogen and the resulting frozen droplets were pulverized in a cryomill, cooled with liquid nitrogen. 1.5 grams of the resulting powder was resuspended in 10 ml 100 mM NaPi pH7 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM MgCl2 5 µg/ml DnaseI, 18 mg/ml PMSF and 5 mM DTT and homogenized with a polytron (2 times 30 s at max speed). The suspension was cleared from non-lyzed cells by centrifugation at 20,000 rcf at 4 degrees for 20 min. 1 ml of Ni-sepharose slurry was pre-equilibrated in a polyprep column (BioRad) with 10 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O and subsequently 10 ml of 100 mM NaPi pH7 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT.

After bead-beating, the cells were incubated on ice for 15 min, and subsequently centrifuged at 20,000 rcf for 15 min to clear the lysates of beads and unbroken cells. The cell lysates were diluted with lysis buffer to 1 ml and 10 µl of GFP-nanotrap beads (Chromotek) were added.

Bound proteins were subsequently eluted from the beads by adding 20 µl of 10% SDS to the beads and 10 min of incubation at 95°C. As a negative control a cell lysate from BY4741, not expressing any GFP-tagged nucleoporin, was treated as above. As positive controls BY4741 was spiked with 2 µg of purified ID-GFP, or 2 µg of ID-GFP which was first in vitro oxidized with 1 mM CuSO4 and 4 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 15 min at RT.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Western blotting and ELISA</title><p>Of the eluate, 4 µl was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to PVDF membrane and GFP-tagged proteins were detected with anti-GFP antibodies.

First, the SDS was removed from the sample using the HIPPR detergent removal kit (Pierce), by diluting the sample to 100 µl with PBS, and following the protocol as provided with the kit. The detergent-free protein was subsequently diluted to 1 ml with PBS and two-fold serial dilutions were prepared in PBS. 96-well Nunc maxisorp plates (Thermo Fischer) were coated with 100 µl of the serial dilutions in duplo, and incubated O/N at 4°C. Protein amounts were determined by detection of GFP-tagged bound protein with anti-GFP antibodies and a standard ELISA protocol.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Age-dependent deterioration of nuclear pore assembly in mitotic cells decreases transport dynamics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael P Rout (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work cannot be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this time.</p><p>Whereas your paper addresses an important and interesting topic, all three reviewers felt that your paper requires additional experiments in order to bolster your main conclusions. For example, this includes new result that would provide mechanistic insight into how the age-dependent changes at the NPC impact function and additional data on Nup49 and NPC assembly during aging. Since these revisions are expected to take more than 2 months to complete the editorial decision was to reject the manuscript. However, if you decided to address these concerns <italic>eLife</italic> would re-consider your manuscript (as a new submission and review). However, given the extend of the required work you might also want to consider to submit your manuscript elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Rempel et al. have applied single cell imaging technique to address age-dependent changes in NPC form and function, building off observations originally described in their 2015 <italic>eLife</italic> paper. The concept that NPC function changes in aged cells presented in this manuscript also fits with previous reports of non-functional NPCs being retained in mother cells and changes in NPC transport function during ageing (e.g. Shcheprova et al., 2008, Makio et al., 2013, Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014, and Lord et al., 2015).</p><p>In this paper, data is presented to further this correlate between ageing and NPC function, focusing in part on Nup116 and Nsp1, leading to a conclusion that aged cells show increased compartmentalization based on GFP-NLS/NES reporters and the localization of endogenous shuttling proteins. However, it remains unclear if and/or how nuclear permeability is being impacted to increase compartmentalization. For example, if the amount or types of cargo being actively shuttled changed in ageing cells, could this result in more efficient shuttling of GFP-NLS/NES cargos and the apparent increase in compartmentalization, as compared to the interpretation that permeability is changing? In the specific case of Msn2, which is seen to change shuttling dynamics, how other changes in aged cells impact these dynamics is unclear, making the interpretation of the data in Figure 4 difficult. For example, does the interaction of Msn2 with DNA change causing increased nuclear residence times? Do other modulators that contribute to Msn2 localization change in aged cells, such as cAMP/PKA that influence the sensitivity and frequency of nuclear localization (PMID 12732613). In addition, it is unclear how Nup116 and Nsp1 fit into this phenotype and ultimately if these changes in NPC function are drivers of ageing or simply the consequence of other cellular processes declining in function. These findings are interesting, but without offering direct mechanistic insights, I would not support publication of the current manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In previous work, a number of the authors comprehensively surveyed changes in the transcriptome and proteome of yeast cells as they replicative age, discovering that an increase in proteins that are part of the protein biogenesis machinery relative to their transcripts seemed causally associated with other characteristic ageing phenotypes, and that one of the downstream consequences of this was a loss of stoichiometry for numerous protein assemblies, including the nuclear pore complex (NPC).</p><p>Here, these findings on the NPC are extended by a detailed examination of the alterations in its composition and function that occur during aging. The abundance of a significant number of key nucleoporins decreases, both at a whole cell level and (for specifically tested examples) at the nuclear envelope. Importantly, the authors establish that the impact of aging on nuclear transport is largely through an age-dependent impediment in proper NPC assembly, rather than through (as previously indicated by others) oxidative damage to NPC components. The authors present numerous lines of evidence indicating that the accumulating misassembled NPCs appear to be rendered impermeable, thus reducing the effective density of functional NPCs over time, leading to an increase in steady state compartmentalization and concomitant decrease in transport dynamics. This detailed focus on the age-related functional consequences of stoichiometric loss for one particular macromolecular assembly provides a new and key insight into the consequences of ageing of dividing cells.</p><p>However, several points need to be clarified by the authors to help the readers navigate the logic of the manuscript and the technical details of the experimental work.</p><p>1) The main conceptual point that is not sufficiently clear throughout the text (including the Abstract), potentially leading general readers to confusion, is the causal relationship between aging and NPC malfunction. In previous publications, the authors showed that an imbalance affecting the protein biogenesis machinery seem to be the major driving force in aging, as beautifully summarized in Figure 6B of Janssens et al., 2015. It would be interesting for the authors to put the NPC and nuclear transport machinery in context by indicating where they would localize in such a schematic based on their previous results: is the NPC ranked in the &quot;causal&quot; or &quot;responsive&quot; areas? This would help the reader interpret the results and properly position the NPC defects within the overall aging process.</p><p>2) The authors decided to validate the changing Nup levels detected previously in their whole proteome analysis by quantifying the NE signal from fluorescently tagged Nups in aging mitotic cells. The approach is very reasonable, but several points are not clear, could affect the interpretation of the results and should be clarified in the manuscript:</p><p>a) What were the criteria used to select the Nups tagged for the fluorescence quantification experiments? Why those and not others? Why not Nsp1, that is specifically referred to later (subsection “The cellular abundance of specific NPC components changes in replicative ageing”, end of last paragraph)? This should be made clear in the text.</p><p>b) Why did the authors picked Nup49 as the reference throughout the fluorescence quantification experiments? I noticed that several Nups, crucially including Nup49, seem to be missing from the original dataset and from the plot in Figure 1C. Is this a labeling issue or Nup49 was not included in such analysis? If so, why is the Nup chosen to act as a normalization reference in most of the experiments? Given that it seems the authors lack the initial information to establish it as a reliable and useful control, would it be informative to plot the raw data without normalizing to Nup49 to get an idea of what is the effect of such normalization?</p><p>c) According to Figure 4—figure supplement 3, overexpression (and as such should be noted in the text) of basically any construct, seems to affect the lifespan of yeast cells. However, how does tagging of Nups affect such lifespan? It is well known that double tagging could generate synthetic effects that could potentially affect the strain fitness. I would strongly suggest that the authors perform a similar analysis as the one shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 3 for the GFP and mCherry tagged strains used in this study versus a non-tagged (wild type) strain. This way, even if some effects were detected, they could be accounted for in the final plots.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In previous studies, the Veenhoff and Heinemann groups have assessed transcriptome and proteome variations in aging populations of yeast cells as a means to interrogate physiological changes in aging mitotic cells. Using data from this previous study, the authors show, in the early figures of this manuscript, that aging populations of cells appear to exhibit changes in protein levels of specific nucleoporins and nuclear transport factors. They suggest that specific changes in Nup levels and the presumed loss of stoichiometry among Nups reflect problems in NPC assembly. As supporting evidence for this conclusion, they present data showing that levels of Heh2-GFP and Apq12-GFP, two proteins that have been previously linked to NE biogenesis and NPC assembly, are reduced relative to Nup49. The authors document direct correlations between a decreased lifespan of individual cells and various parameters such as decreased levels of Nup116 and Nup100, as well as non nups including Heh2, Apq12 and Vps4. Based on these observations, they have attempted to examine nuclear transport changes in individual cells as they age. They showed that steady-state distributions of both import and export cargoes were altered as cells aged, notably showing increased compartmentalization.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study that has applied innovative single-cell analysis approaches to interrogate NPCs and nuclear transport in aging cells. In my view, the two most significant observations reported are age-dependent variations in Nup protein levels and changes in steady-state distributions of nuclear transport cargos as cells age. However, while these are interesting observations, the study fails to provide any mechanistic insight into the interrelationship between these observations (e.g. do changes in Nups levels of the magnitude detected actually alter nuclear transport?). In addition, the authors' main hypothesis that changes in nuclear transport during aging are caused by defects in NPCs assembly is not supported by direct evidence of increased NPC assembly defects in aging cells (e.g. an increased frequency of NPC 'sealing' with aging). In addition, they have not tested whether the observed alterations in the levels of specific Nups or proteins linked to NPC assembly (such as Vps4 and Apq12) are sufficient for altering NPC assembly or nuclear transport. Finally, is there a causal relationship between changes in NPCs/transport and aging? The authors suggest their studies have established such a relationship; however, I feel that, while their data have established interesting correlations, functional insight is limited.</p><p>Several additional points are listed below.</p><p>1) No data are presented on the levels of Nup49 during aging (not seen in Figure 1C and not discussed). As this Nup represents an important standard of comparison for various analyses in the manuscript, the authors need to discuss what the proteome analysis of aging cells revealed about Nup49.</p><p>2) As suggested above, there is no direct evidence that aging is accompanied by defects in NPCs assembly nor is there any evidence that there is an increase in herniations or the sealing over of NPCs in older cells (e.g. EM analysis). Moreover, while null mutants of heh2, vps4 or apq12 exhibit NPC herniation phenotypes, there is no evidence that decreases in the levels of Heh2, Apq12, and Vps4 observed in the aging cells would compromise NPC assembly. This concern also applies to changes in Nup levels and their effects.</p><p>3) The authors state that the &quot;rates of NTR-facilitated-transport (import and export) and passive permeability (influx and efflux) are altered such that in old cells the kinetics of passive permeability is lowered relative to the kinetics of NTR-facilitated-transport.&quot; This conclusion is not justified by the data presented. First, no data on the kinetics (or apparent kinetics) of transport are presented in this manuscript to support this conclusion. Measuring steady-state levels of transport cargoes does not provide information on the kinetics of transport. Moreover, the authors conclude that cargo retention mechanisms are minimal contributors to the steady state distribution of cargo. It is not clear to me how the authors make this conclusion. While the data in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 suggest there is no change in efflux rates during aging, this does not address retention.</p><p>4) Please provide an interpretation of results show in Figure 1—figure supplement 2C. The data presented in this figure suggest the tag (either GFP or mCh) placed on the Nup (49 or 133) can alter its relative levels during aging.</p><p>5) In Figure 3B, the authors state that they exclude outliers; however, the justification for the assignment of these data points as 'outliers' is not clear.</p><p>6) In a number of instances, the authors could more accurately reference their statements. For example, the authors reference Webster et al., 2014 for their statement that 'Misassembled NPCs that are induced by mutations are asymmetrically retained, and accumulated in the mother cell over time'. Prior studies performed by Makio et al., 2013, and Colombi et al., 2013, showed Nup mutants retain NPCs in mother cells. Also, regarding the statement: &quot;there are no strains with mutations in the NPC that have been shown to lead to increased steady state compartmentalization&quot;, there are report of mutants in Nups that cause increased import in mitotic yeast cells (Makhnevych et al., 2003).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48186.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] It remains unclear if and/or how nuclear permeability is being impacted to increase compartmentalization.

We agree that explicit discussion and testing of the alternatives, which had not escaped our attention, is important and we thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The alternative interpretations that we had considered and that we now address and discus (subsection “Increased steady state nuclear compartmentalization in aging is mimicked in NPC assembly mutants”, fourth paragraph) are (i) increasing levels of NTRs (updated Figure 4—figure supplement 2A), (ii) retention of GFP e.g. as a consequence of aggregation (Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 4A, GFP control), (iii) decreasing levels of native cargo (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2E, Figure 4—figure supplement 2E, F).</p><p>In addition, to substantiate that NPCs are indeed the problem in ageing we included new data on two more GFP-NLS reporter proteins, namely with the Nab2NLS (Kap104 import cargo), and a Pho4NLS (Kap121 import cargo) (new Figure 4C). The changes in ageing that we observe are similar to those of GFP-cNLS, namely increased steady state nuclear accumulation in aged cells. We further strengthen the link between assembly and transport by showing that Brl1 levels decrease during aging (new Figure 2F) and that NPC assembly problems can increase nuclear compartmentalization in a vps4Δheh2Δ background (new Figure 4F). Most significantly, we now provide direct evidence that aged cells have more herniations (new Figure 3). Altogether, in the new submission we explicitly discuss or test alternative interpretations and provide important additional data supporting the interpretation that altered transport dynamics are related to the NPCs.</p><p>Indeed, we agree that it is possible, that Msn2 dynamics (and RCC1, or any other native protein) are influenced by other factors than active transport (most prominently retention) and this is why reporter studies provide a good complement. We state this clearly in the text (subsection “Increased steady state nuclear compartmentalization in aging is mimicked in NPC assembly mutants”, fifth paragraph and subsection “Alterations of the nuclear envelope permeability during aging affects transcription factor dynamics”). With regards to the specific suggestion of altered interactions with the DNA: if that were the case we would have expected to observe an increase in peak prominence – which we don’t observe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it is unclear how Nup116 and Nsp1 fit into this phenotype and ultimately if these changes in NPC function are drivers of ageing or simply the consequence of other cellular processes declining in function.</p></disp-quote><p>It was unclear to the reviewer how we connect the decreases in Nup116 and Nsp1 to the transport phenotypes observed. Indeed from previous studies using mutants lacking specific FG-Nups (or FGrepeat regions), as well as from our computational modeling of an aged-NPC mimic (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), it is expected that NPCs are more permeable if they would miss some of the FG-Nups that we show are decreasing in abundance in aged cells. Increased permeability is indeed not what we observe. We connect both phenotypes by showing that aged cells have assembly problems (Figure 2G) and increasing numbers of herniation with transport inert NPCs (new Figure 3) and by proposing that aged cells consequently have fewer functional NPCs.</p><p>With respect to causality we have indeed not been clear enough and we improved this in the second paragraph of the Discussion section. We now make clear that our findings support the hypothesis that, rather than initiating the ageing process, changes at the NPC further drive the aging process. This is supported by our previous system wide models predicting causal relationships as Nup116 and Nsp1 (and Nup159, Nic96, Nup82, Nup157, Nup2) appear rather in the middle clusters of the proteome network meaning they are predicted to be consequential to earlier changes but also that they are driving later changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These findings are interesting, but without offering direct mechanistic insights, I would not support publication of the current manuscript in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>With the extensive additional data now provided, we are the opinion that our data more than sufficiently supports the mechanistic model proposed which was nicely summarized by reviewer 2, “The authors present numerous lines of evidence indicating that the accumulating misassembled NPCs appear to be rendered impermeable, thus reducing the effective density of functional NPCs over time, leading to an increase in steady state compartmentalization and concomitant decrease in transport dynamics.&quot; For clarity we summarize the model in the new Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Several points need to be clarified by the authors to help the readers navigate the logic of the manuscript and the technical details of the experimental work.</p><p>1) The main conceptual point that is not sufficiently clear throughout the text (including the Abstract), potentially leading general readers to confusion, is the causal relationship between aging and NPC malfunction.

This would help the reader interpret the results and properly position the NPC defects within the overall aging process.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. We have indeed looked for the presence of Nups, NTRs and assembly factors in the proteome and transcriptome networks to see if they would be present in the more causal or the more responsive clusters.</p><p>Apart from five exceptions, the Nups, NTR and assembly factor mRNA profiles are stable in ageing and hence they are not present in the transcriptome network (flat profiles cannot be predictive of changes). Five transcripts are found in the transcriptome network, namely, Nmd5 in cluster 2, Apq12 in cluster 3, Brl1 in cluster 5, Brr6 in cluster 7, and Mlp1 in cluster 8, where cluster 1 is most causal and cluster 9 is most responsive.</p><p>Within the proteome network the Nups, NTRs and assembly factors are better represented (especially considering the network is much smaller than that of the transcriptome) and they mostly appear in the more responsive clusters three to five, where cluster 1 is most causal and cluster 5 is most responsive. Specifically, eight Nups are present in proteome network, namely Ndc1 in cluster 2, Nup159 and Nsp1 in cluster 3, Nic96, Nup82 and Nup157 in cluster 4 and Nup116 and Nup2 in cluster 5. Two NTRS (Nmd5, Sce1) and one assembly factor (VPS4) are present in proteome network in clusters 3 and 5.</p><p>Altogether, the transcriptional changes in Nups, NTRs and assembly factors are small and thus unlikely important in ageing. The proteome changes in the Nups however are linked to other changes in ageing and are predicted to appear as a response to earlier more causal changes in the proteome, while also driving further changes in ageing. In the Discussion of the current manuscript we make clear that changes at the NPC are predicted to be consequential to earlier changes but also that they drive later changes (Discussion, second paragraph). We also adjusted the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors decided to validate the changing Nup levels detected previously in their whole proteome analysis by quantifying the NE signal from fluorescently tagged Nups in aging mitotic cells.

Why those and not others? Why not Nsp1, that is specifically referred to later (subsection “The cellular abundance of specific NPC components changes in replicative ageing”, end of last paragraph)? This should be made clear in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain why we picked those Nups specifically and why Nsp1 is not included in the analysis (subsection “The cellular abundance of specific NPC components changes in replicative aging”, second paragraph). Namely, we included Nup116 and Nup2 in our experiments as those Nups showed the strongest decrease in abundance. Nup133 was included because its abundance was stable in ageing and Nup100 was included because it is important for the permeability barrier. We used Nup49-mCh as a reference in all of our microfluidic experiments as Nup49 had previously been used as a marker for NPCs. The proteome data indicated that Nup49 showed a relatively stable abundance profile in aging (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). The tagging of the Nups with GFP and mCherry (mCh) reduced the fitness of those strains to different extents but all retained median division time under 2.5 hours (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). Nsp1 could not be included in the validation, because the Nsp1-GFP fusion had a growth defect and could not be combined with Nup49-mCh, Nup100-mCh or Nup133-mCh in the BY4741 background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Why did the authors picked Nup49 as the reference throughout the fluorescence quantification experiments? I noticed that several Nups, crucially including Nup49, seem to be missing from the original dataset and from the plot in Figure 1C. Is this a labeling issue or Nup49 was not included in such analysis? If so, why is the Nup chosen to act as a normalization reference in most of the experiments? Given that it seems the authors lack the initial information to establish it as a reliable and useful control, would it be informative to plot the raw data without normalizing to Nup49 to get an idea of what is the effect of such normalization?</p></disp-quote><p>We now show the proteome data for Nup49 and three other NPC components that were lacking from Figure 1C (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). They were lacking from Figure 1C because they did not make it through the full data processing pipeline used in Janssens et al. Specifically for Nup49 the problem was that the correction that we applied to account for losses of proteins on the bead surface yielded negative values, which precluded further data processing. The raw profiles for both Nup49 replicates are however still useful and shows that Nup49 levels are rather stable in the ageing proteome.</p><p>Nup49-mcherry is used as an internal reference. The dilemmas with long time lapse experiments is phototoxicity and hence we chose to only image few z-stacks. Also instrument time is an issue and hence we measured on different setups. As a consequence the absolute intensities are variable due to instrument differences and as the NE is not equally well in focus in all images. Quantifying the ratio’s between two Nups solves these issues and provides a more reliable readout. Relating everything to Nup49-mCherry also solves a third complication, which is that the fluorophore tags GFP and mCherry behave differently in ageing. This was shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2E where the same Nup tagged with mCherry of GFP show differential absolute increases. In a separate manuscript in preparation we will detail these age-related differences in fluorophore behavior related to pH and maturation. We took out two of the panels from Figure 1—figure supplement 2 because they seem to have caused confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) According to Figure 4—figure supplement 3, overexpression (and as such should be noted in the text) of basically any construct, seems to affect the lifespan of yeast cells. However, how does tagging of Nups affect such lifespan? It is well known that double tagging could generate synthetic effects that could potentially affect the strain fitness. I would strongly suggest that the authors perform a similar analysis as the one shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 3 for the GFP and mCherry tagged strains used in this study versus a non-tagged (wild type) strain. This way, even if some effects were detected, they could be accounted for in the final plots.</p></disp-quote><p>We have indeed found that tagging of the Nups affects the fitness of our strains. Performing proper lifespan on all mutants would represent a significant effort and much microscopy time, which we do not have available. Instead, we have included a panel in Figure 1—figure supplement 2A that compares the median number of divisions during the first 15 h in the chip to give a measure of the fitness of the cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Overall, this is an interesting study that has applied innovative single-cell analysis approaches to interrogate NPCs and nuclear transport in aging cells. In my view, the two most significant observations reported are age-dependent variations in Nup protein levels and changes in steady-state distributions of nuclear transport cargos as cells age.</p><p>However, while these are interesting observations, the study fails to provide any mechanistic insight into the interrelationship between these observations (e.g. do changes in Nups levels of the magnitude detected actually alter nuclear transport?). In addition, the authors' main hypothesis that changes in nuclear transport during aging are caused by defects in NPCs assembly is not supported by direct evidence of increased NPC assembly defects in aging cells (e.g. an increased frequency of NPC 'sealing' with aging). In addition, they have not tested whether the observed alterations in the levels of specific Nups or proteins linked to NPC assembly (such as Vps4 and Apq12) are sufficient for altering NPC assembly or nuclear transport.</p></disp-quote><p>In the new manuscript we better clarify and support that NPC assembly defects can connect the observations of the age-dependent variations in Nup protein levels and the changes in steady-state distributions of nuclear transport cargos as cells age. In the new version of the manuscript, we additionally show that Brl1 levels decrease during aging (new Figure 2F) and that NPC assembly problems can increase nuclear compartmentalization in a vps4Δheh2Δ background (new Figure 4F). Most significantly, we now provide direct evidence that aged cells have more NE herniations (new Figure 3).</p><p>The reviewer is further concerned that the observed alterations in the levels of specific Nups or proteins linked to NPC assembly may not be sufficient to alter NPC assembly or nuclear transport. Addressing this experimentally would require creating a strain where the expression levels of multiple Nup and four assembly factors is altered simultaneously (an aged-NPC mimic in young cells); this clearly falls beyond the scope of this project and may in fact be close to impossible to do.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, is there a causal relationship between changes in NPCs/transport and aging? The authors suggest their studies have established such a relationship; however, I feel that, while their data have established interesting correlations, functional insight is limited.</p></disp-quote><p>This is also discussed in our answers to reviewer 2 point 1: we have clarified in the Discussion that the current data and the previous system wide study suggest that NPC defects rather further drive the aging process than initiating it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several additional points are listed below.</p><p>1) No data are presented on the levels of Nup49 during aging (not seen in Figure 1C and not discussed). As this Nup represents an important standard of comparison for various analyses in the manuscript, the authors need to discuss what the proteome analysis of aging cells revealed about Nup49.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D; please see also our explanation to reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As suggested above, there is no direct evidence that aging is accompanied by defects in NPCs assembly nor is there any evidence that there is an increase in herniations or the sealing over of NPCs in older cells (e.g. EM analysis). Moreover, while null mutants of heh2, vps4 or apq12 exhibit NPC herniation phenotypes, there is no evidence that decreases in the levels of Heh2, Apq12, and Vps4 observed in the aging cells would compromise NPC assembly. This concern also applies to changes in Nup levels and their effects.</p></disp-quote><p>This important point is addressed in response to reviewer 3’s initial comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors state that the &quot;rates of NTR-facilitated-transport (import and export) and passive permeability (influx and efflux) are altered such that in old cells the kinetics of passive permeability is lowered relative to the kinetics of NTR-facilitated-transport.&quot; This conclusion is not justified by the data presented. First, no data on the kinetics (or apparent kinetics) of transport are presented in this manuscript to support this conclusion. Measuring steady-state levels of transport cargoes does not provide information on the kinetics of transport. Moreover, the authors conclude that cargo retention mechanisms are minimal contributors to the steady state distribution of cargo. It is not clear to me how the authors make this conclusion. While the data in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 suggest there is no change in efflux rates during aging, this does not address retention.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the mentioned statement and explicitly discuss the meaning of the steady state measurements in the third paragraph of the subsection “Increased steady state nuclear compartmentalization in aging is mimicked in NPC assembly mutants”. Also we added additional data on two more GFP-NLS reporters (new Figure 4D). What is requested, direct kinetic measurements of import and export <italic>in ageing</italic> is technically very challenging and impossible at present. The efflux experiments show to the least that the GFP reporters do not aggregate in the nucleus of aged cells (and that the NE is not more permeable).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please provide an interpretation of results show in Figure 1—figure supplement 2C. The data presented in this figure suggest the tag (either GFP or mCh) placed on the Nup (49 or 133) can alter its relative levels during aging.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this panel as it caused confusion, also for reviewer 2. We have no reason to think that the tag alters the actual protein levels in ageing. We do have data to show that the two fluorophores themselves have different behaviors in ageing due to differences in pH and maturation time. As mentioned before, we are preparing a manuscript to detail these effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 3B, the authors state that they exclude outliers; however, the justification for the assignment of these data points as 'outliers' is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified in the manuscript that no outliers were excluded from the analysis. We merely plotted points which were outliers individually. Outliers, are data points outside of the 75<sup>th</sup>/25<sup>th</sup> percentile +/-</p><p>1.5 times the inter quartile range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In a number of instances, the authors could more accurately reference their statements. For example, the authors reference Webster et al., 2014 for their statement that 'Misassembled NPCs that are induced by mutations are asymmetrically retained, and accumulated in the mother cell over time'. Prior studies performed by Makio et al., 2013, and Colombi et al., 2013, showed Nup mutants retain NPCs in mother cells. Also, regarding the statement: &quot;there are no strains with mutations in the NPC that have been shown to lead to increased steady state compartmentalization&quot;, there are report of mutants in Nups that cause increased import in mitotic yeast cells (Makhnevych et al., 2003).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for these mistakes and have corrected our statements and included the reference in our manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
