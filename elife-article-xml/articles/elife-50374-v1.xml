In the presence of nutrients, cells prey cooperatively. Upon starvation, they enter a developmental cycle wherein cells aggregate to produce macroscopic fruiting bodies filled with resistant myxospores. We used RNA-Seq technology to examine the transcriptome of the 96 hr developmental program. These data revealed that 1415 genes were sequentially expressed in 10 discrete modules, with expression peaking during aggregation, in the transition from aggregation to sporulation, or during sporulation. Analysis of genes expressed at each specific time point provided insights as to how starving cells obtain energy and precursors necessary for assembly of fruiting bodies and into developmental production of secondary metabolites.

When nutrients are available, cells divide to produce a community known as swarm. Swarms are predatory (although not obligate) and can digest prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pérez et al., 2016</xref>). Upon starvation, cells in the swarm enter a developmental program, during which they migrate into aggregation centers and climb on top of each other to build macroscopic structures termed fruiting bodies. To form fruiting bodies, starving cells glide on solid surfaces by using two motility systems, known as A- (adventurous) and S- (social) motility, which allow individual cell movement or group movement that requires cell-cell contact, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mauriello et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Islam and Mignot, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schumacher and Søgaard-Andersen, 2017</xref>). After completion of aggregation (24 hr post-starvation), cells differentiate into environmentally resistant myxospores, which are embedded in a complex extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Each fruiting body contains ≈10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> myxospores. Interestingly, only ≈10% of the starving population become myxospores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">O'Connor and Zusman, 1991a</xref>) as most cells (around 60%) undergo programmed cell death, most likely to provide the rest of the population enough nutrients to successfully build fruiting bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wireman and Dworkin, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nariya and Inouye, 2008</xref>). The remaining cells differentiate into a persister-like state, termed peripheral rods (PR), which surround the fruiting bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">O'Connor and Zusman, 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O'Connor and Zusman, 1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">O'Connor and Zusman, 1991c</xref>). While PRs are morphologically similar to vegetative cells, myxospores are coccoid and are surrounded by a thick coat mainly consisting of polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kottel et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Müller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holkenbrink et al., 2014</xref>). Myxospores can germinate when nutrients are available, and collective germination of myxospores from a fruiting body generates a small swarm that facilitates cooperative feeding.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50374.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> developmental program.</title><p>The time line indicates aggregation and sporulation phases. <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells (yellow rods) aggregate into mounds (arrows indicate gliding to aggregation centers) and then differentiate into resistant spores (gray circles) to produce mature fruiting bodies.

The first cue is starvation, which triggers accumulation of cyclic-di-GMP and, via the stringent response, guanosine penta- and tetraphosphate [(p)ppGpp] inside the cells. These global signals somehow activate four master cascade modules (Nla24, Mrp, FruA, and bacterial enhancer-binding proteins [bEBPs]), which interconnect to control the correct timing of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kroos, 2017</xref>). Proper progression of development requires intercellular communication, wherein cells produce and transmit five sequential extracellular signals, named A, B, C, D, and E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bretl and Kirby, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although much knowledge has been generated in the last 40 years about the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> developmental cycle, especially with respect to signaling and gene regulatory networks, we are far from having an overall picture of all the events that occur during aggregation and sporulation. Several partial transcriptome analyses from developmental samples based on microarrays have been published, which were restricted to a few genes related to bEBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jakobsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diodati et al., 2008</xref>), two-component systems (TCSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shi et al., 2008</xref>), A-signaling genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Konovalova et al., 2012</xref>), or lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhat et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we used RNA-Seq technology to measure global changes in transcript abundance at seven time points during <italic>M. xanthus</italic> development, which represents a substantial step forward compared to previous analyses. We found that at least 19.6% of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> genes (1415/7229) had statistically significant changes in transcript abundance during development. These data and analyses provide, for the first time, a comprehensive view of the transcriptional regulatory patterns that drive the multicellular developmental program of this myxobacterium, offering an essential scaffold for future investigations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptome analysis of the developmental program by RNA-Seq</title><p>Global gene expression patterns were examined by RNA-Seq analysis of the wild-type <italic>M. xanthus</italic> strain DK1622 developed on nutrient limited CF agar plates.

First, all genes with &lt;50 reads and/or high replicate variability between the two replicate datasets (R<sup>2</sup> correlation &lt;0.7) were removed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata2">Table 1—source data 2</xref>). 1557/7229 (21.5 %) genes passed quality criteria filters. Some of these genes (142; 9.1%) were not significantly (&gt;2 fold) up- or down regulated during the developmental program, suggesting these genes could be considered constitutively expressed. 1415 significantly regulated genes (90.9% of the genes passing quality control) were then analyzed for clusters of similar expression patterns. Briefly, initial evaluation of several clustering methods (see Materials and methods for details) revealed kmeans clustering with 6–12 clusters produced the best clustering of genes with similar expression profiles. Refinement of kmeans clusters by visual inspection indicated 10 DGs best explained the number of unique gene profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Clusters were organized with peak expression profiles corresponding to progression through the developmental program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The relative expression profiles presented here in the heat maps are a log<sub>2</sub> normalized RPKM value relative to the mean of the entire RNA-Seq trajectory for a given gene. This relative expression profile is log<sub>2</sub>(RPKMi time-point x/RPKMi average), where i is a given gene, x is a given time-point, and RPKM average is the average RPKM value of all time-points.

The number of genes attributed to each cluster ranged from 5.5% (DG3) to 14.1% (DG8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similar proportions of genes exhibited peak expressions in growth (21.8%), aggregation (23.8%), and transition from aggregation to sporulation (18.8%) phases. The final phase accounted for peak expressions of 35.6% of genes, consistent with the significant morphological and physiological rewiring that must occur during spore differentiation and preparation for extended quiescence.</p><p>When the number of genes by RPKM values that account for 50% of all mRNA expression at each time point was compared, it was observed that this number was low (~300) during growth, and at 48 hr it steadily increases to 762 by the end of sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests that the transcriptome is becoming distributed across a broader number of genes during development.</p><p>As a first step in analysis of the DGs, genes that have been previously described to affect <italic>M. xanthus</italic> development were identified. Of the ~280 characterized genes, 167 were included in the DGs. Most showed peak expression patterns at a time point that matched with the developmental phase where they have been reported to function, some of which have a well-defined role on development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). A notable exception to this are genes that are thought to function in very early stages during development, but are included in DG10. Examples of these genes are <italic>sasS</italic>, which is involved in A signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yang and Kaplan, 1997</xref>); <italic>csgA</italic>, which encodes the C signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shimkets and Rafiee, 1990</xref>); and <italic>romR</italic>, which is involved in polarity control of motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leonardy et al., 2007</xref>). However, DG10 genes also showed high expression at 6 hr, consistent with early activities and raising the possibility of additional functions at the latest stage of development. Finally, not all known developmental genes appeared in the 10 DGs defined here (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata4">Figure 3—source data 4</xref>). Of the 108 missing genes, 28 genes encoded TCSs and 20 serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genes identified through chemical induction of sporulation mainly map to DG7 and DG8</title><p>A core sporulation transcriptome was previously defined using an artificial method for inducing spore differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Müller et al., 2010</xref>). Using this method, myxospores can be induced in cells growing in rich broth culture by addition of chemicals such as 0.5 M glycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dworkin and Gibson, 1964</xref>). Chemical-induced sporulation bypasses the requirement for starvation, motility (aggregation), and alternate cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Higgs et al., 2014</xref>). Comparison of these two transcriptome sets determined that 1388 genes passed quality criteria in both transcriptome studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source datas 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7</xref>). 92% (218/237) of genes significantly up-regulated (&gt;2 fold) in the sporulation transcriptome were also significantly up-regulated in the developmental transcriptome. These genes were significantly over-represented in DGs 7 and 8, with low probability (<italic>p</italic>) that this association is due to random chance (p=1×10<sup>−12</sup> and p=2×10<sup>−11</sup>, respectively). DGs 7 and 8 peak expression at the transition to sporulation and sporulation phases, respectively. Co-regulated genes in these groups include those predicted to be involved in generation of sugar precursors for spore coat (see below). Likewise, genetic loci involved in spore coat synthesis (<italic>exo</italic>) and surface polysaccharide arrangement (<italic>nfs</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holkenbrink et al., 2014</xref>) fell in DG8.</p><p>Interestingly, DGs 9 and 10, with peak expression profiles corresponding to the latest developmental time points, were not well represented in the up-regulated sporulation transcriptome. DG9 genes were significantly over-represented in the down-regulated sporulation transcriptome (p=0007). The DG9 cluster represents genes that were expressed during growth in rich media, down-regulated in response to starvation, and later up-regulated during the final phases of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Genes in this cluster appear to be involved in transport, respiration, and transcriptional regulation, and may be required during rapid growth and perhaps in the final maturation phases of sporulation. It is likely that the chemical-induced sporulation transcriptome may not have included very late induced sporulation genes as RNA was harvested until four-hours after induction. Chemical-induced spores are heat and sonication resistant at this stage, but final maturation may continue past this point. Finally, DG10 contained genes that were over-represented (p=7×10<sup>−10</sup>) in the not-regulated sporulation transcriptome gene set. We speculate this pool of genes may be present in PRs, a cell fate enriched late in the developmental program and not present during chemical induction of sporulation. Genes in this DG encode several STPKs, the bEBP Nla26, and several proteins involved in secondary metabolite (SM) biosynthesis (see below).</p><p>Good correlation was observed in genes that were expressed during growth and down-regulated in both transcriptome sets, with genes from DGs 1, 2, 5, and nine being over-represented in the down-regulated sporulation transcriptome set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Of the large pool of genes that were not significantly regulated in the sporulation transcriptome (754), a relatively small number (12%) were also not significantly up- or down-regulated in the developmental transcriptome. This pool of genes likely represents constitutively expressed genes that serve as good normalization markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5</xref>) and includes housekeeping genes such as the transcription termination factor Rho (MXAN_RS11995), the cell cytoskeletal protein MreB (MXAN_RS32880) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Treuner-Lange et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2018</xref>), the gliding motility and sporulation protein AglU (MXAN_RS14565) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">White and Hartzell, 2000</xref>), and the CheA homolog DifE (MXAN_RS32400), which is required for exopolysaccharide production and social motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yang et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Analysis of developmental regulated genes</title><p>All genes included in the 10 DGs were individually analyzed to find out which processes were affected during development, which may explain the different events that occur during aggregation and sporulation.

Our data have revealed that many of the motility genes were developmentally regulated and that the expression profiles of the distinct A- and S-machinery genes clearly differed during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A-motility genes were up-regulated during early development, while S-motility genes first decreased at 6 hr, and then returned to growth levels during aggregation (except for <italic>pilA</italic>), suggesting that A motility is preferentially used by cells during aggregation. During sporulation, expression of genes encoding both motility engines decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), although some of them peaked again at this stage. The peak of some A-motility genes during sporulation is consistent with the repurposing of certain A-motility proteins to function in spore coat assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wartel et al., 2013</xref>).

It is unknown how these pathways contribute to energy production during development when starving cells must synthesize energy currencies (i.e. ATP) over a period of at least three days.</p><p>Analysis of the DGs revealed that most genes involved in energy generation (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation) were found in DG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Therefore, although they are down-regulated at 6 hr, they are later up-regulated at lower levels than during growth. In contrast, many genes encoding enzymes of the glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathway were up-regulated during development, with most reaching maximum expression levels at the completion of aggregation (24–48 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This up-regulated group included genes encoding homologs of glucokinase (<italic>glkC</italic>) and phosphofructokinase (<italic>pfkA</italic>), which are specific for the glycolytic pathway. These observations are consistent with a transcriptional rewiring of metabolic pathways during the developmental program, perhaps to take advantage of changing carbon/energy sources. For instance, developmental up-regulation of the glycolytic pathway genes may allow developing cells to obtain energy from sugars released from cells undergoing developmental lysis or from glycogen. Glycogen accumulates during late stationary phase/early development, and then disappears prior to sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nariya and Inouye, 2003</xref>). Enzymes predicted to be involved in synthesis of glycogen, such as GlgC, were found in DG4, while enzymes involved in utilization of glycogen, such as trehalose synthase, GlgP, and MalQ appeared to be constitutively expressed. The observation that these competing pathways show overlapping expression profiles suggests that regulation of glycogen production/consumption is likely regulated post-transcriptionally, as has been demonstrated by phosphorylation of PfkA by Pkn4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nariya and Inouye, 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50374.021</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Relative developmental expression profiles of genes involved in energy generation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genes encoding protein homologs for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation proteins.

The developmental cycle consists of two consecutive events: aggregation and sporulation, during which cells segregate into three different cell fates. Moreover, this process lasts over three days and is triggered by starvation. During this extended period, starving cells must glide to build fruiting bodies and synthesize numerous macromolecules exclusive to fruiting bodies and myxospores. Consistent with this complexity, the transcriptomic analyses presented here revealed that 1415 genes are developmentally regulated with a high degree of confidence, exhibiting expression times that peak at either growth, aggregation and/or sporulation. Analysis of individual genes and the processes in which they participate has shed some light about how cells regulate the expression of motility genes to allow the cells to reach the aggregation centers, or how they rewire metabolism to both obtain energy and monomers to build new macromolecules or to synthesize SMs. Moreover, these data have also revealed that the translational and transcriptional machinery is deeply altered to modulate the different events of development, offering new insights that require to be experimentally pursued to determine the function of all these regulators.</p><p>Although the role of translation in the regulation of the developmental cycle has not yet been addressed, a large number of transcriptional regulators that function during development have been identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig11sdata1">Figure 11—source data 1</xref>). The data presented here corroborate the results obtained by other myxobacteriologists. For instance, our analyses are in good agreement with an established model in which starvation activates four genetic regulatory networks: bEBP, Mrp, FruA, and Nla24 modules, with the latter being activated by cyclic-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kroos, 2017</xref>). However, the high number of transcriptional regulators and signaling proteins found in this study to be developmentally regulated at the mRNA level is much higher than expected. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, many uncharacterized regulators peak at either aggregation or sporulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig11sdata1">Figure 11—source data 1</xref>). Those that are expressed at the same time point may be interconnected to properly modulate specific events and guarantee the proper sequential expression of genes.

Samples were incubated 10 min at room temperature. RNA extraction was carried out using the RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen) and each sample was eluted in 300 µl of RNase-free water. The concentration of RNA was measured using a NanoDrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA). To remove DNA, each RNA sample was supplemented with 1 unit of DNase I (from the DNA Amplification Grade Kit of Sigma) per µg of RNA and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding the stop solution included in the kit and incubating 10 min at 70°C. The obtained RNA was precipitated with 1/10 vol of 3 M sodium acetate and 3 volumes of ethanol, and resuspended in 50 µl of RNase-free water. The quality of the total RNA was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the concentration was determined using NanoDrop as indicated above.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Double stranded copy DNA synthesis</title><p>First strand DNA was synthesized using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) starting with 5 μg of RNA in a final reaction volume of 20 µl.

After 2 hr at 16°C, the reaction was stopped with 0.03 mM EDTA (final concentration). The obtained DNA was purified and concentrated using the DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit of Zymo Research according to manufacturer’s instructions. The final product was eluted in DNA elution buffer from the kit to reach, at least, a yield of 2 µg of DNA, with a minimum concentration of 200 ng/µl.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sequencing and transcriptomic data analysis</title><p>The cDNA from two biological replicates of each condition (see above) was used for sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq2000 (100 bp paired-end read) sequencing platform (GATC Biotech, Germany).

RPKM values of the remaining genes were then compared across the developmental time-points. Developmental expression was characterized by a &gt; 2 fold change in RPKM values across the time course and a &gt; 0.7 R<sup>2</sup> correlation coefficient of the two time course replicates. Log<sub>2</sub> fold-change calculations were performed using the Cluster 3 Software Package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Hoon et al., 2004</xref>). Genes passing these criteria are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>. Randomization of the time point RPKM values within each replicate data set yielded a false discovery rate of 3.97% based on five randomized simulations that scrambled the order of the time points across all genes in the two datasets. Genes passing the developmental expression criteria were hierarchically clustered using pearson correlation, spearman rank, euclidian distance, and kmeans clustering. By visually inspecting the clusters we found that kmeans clustering gave the best clustering of genes with similar expression profiles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Assay of β-galactosidase activity</title><p>For quantitative determination of β-galactosidase activity during development, strains containing <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) were cultured and spotted onto CF plates as described above.

During development, <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells segregate into three cell types. The data presented here contains the combined changes for all three cell types and no attempts were made to distinguish between cell types. Previously, two transcriptome analyses from developmental samples based on microarrays were published (Diodati et al., Nla18, a key regulatory protein required for normal growth and development of <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic>. J Bacteriol. 188, 1733-1743 (2006) and Shi et al., 2008. Given the technological developments in the past decade to map transcriptomes, the data presented here represent a clear qualitative improvement and represent a rich and important novel resource for the community. Moreover, the data are carefully analyzed and provide a number a testable hypotheses for future studies.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) Introduction third paragraph: Maybe briefly mention that Diodati et al. and Shi et al. previously published transcriptome analyzes of developing cells and how your data represent are different.</p><p>2) Subsection “Transcriptome analysis of the developmental program by RNA-Seq” paragraph two: I did not find microarray analyzes in the Bath et al., 2014 reference. Please clarify.</p><p>3) In the same paragraph: It is appreciated that the authors validate the quality of the RNAseq data using the two lacZ fusions. Later in the text, when expression profiles are discussed for genes that are important for development, it would be helpful to include a reference to those papers and mention if the listed genes were shown to be up- or down-regulated. Also, many more genes than the ones listed are important for development. To further validate the RNAseq data, I was wondering if it would be worthwhile to prepare a list with genes that are known to be important for development, their expression pattern from qRT-PCR or gene fusions and the expression profile reported here.</p><p>4) Subsection “Gene expression profiles organize into 10 developmental groups”: The criteria for including genes in the analysis should be more clearly described: It is my understanding that in order for a gene to be included, it needs to have &gt;50 reads at all seven time points. If this is correct, it seems that this would for instance exclude genes that are not expressed at T=0 or strongly downregulated genes. Please clarify.</p><p>5) Throughout the data presentations: It is not clear (to this reviewer) what is meant by &quot;relative expression profiles&quot;. If the developmental samples are compared to the T=0 samples, then the T=0 induction ratio for the T=0 samples should be 0.00 but it is not. Please clarify precisely what is shown in the expression profiles.</p><p>6) Figure 3, 7, 8 and 9: Standard deviations cannot be derived from n&lt;3; please remove SD from the figures.</p><p>7) Figure 8AB: The logic underlying the order in which genes are listed in these two figures is not clear. Maybe it would be a good idea to list them according to function, e.g. in 8B L subunits would be listed together and S-subunits would be listed together.</p><p>8) Subsection “A large interconnected regulatory network controls development” paragraph three: DmxB is the response regulator-diguanylate cyclase responsible for the increase in c-di-GMP during development and the dmxB gene was previously shown to be upregulated during development (Skotnicka et al., 2016). Is the dmxB gene among the upregulated response regulators?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a comprehensive study of the 96-hour program of fruiting body formation in the bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic>. Gene expression during the development program was investigated by collecting RNA at 7 successive time points and performing RNA-sequencing on two biological replicates. Based on clustering analyses, genes whose expression varied during development were assigned to 10 developmental groups. The composition of each group was discussed in view of 40 years of research on the model organism. This rich dataset will be invaluable to research groups working on Myxococcus and δ-proteobacteria. It might also hold some value to researchers working on other bacteria with well-characterized developmental programs (<italic>B. subtilis, Streptomyces</italic>, C. crescentus), but comparison to these systems has not been explored in the current version of this paper. In addition, the following points require clarification.</p><p>Subsection “Transcriptome analysis of the developmental program by RNA-Seq”: &quot;two independent biological replicates&quot; and &quot;(R2 correlation&gt;0.98), with the exception of 24-h samples (R2 correlation=0.8)&quot;. Why only two and not three? Even though the correlation was high for most samples, the fact that there was lower correlation at one time point might have justified the addition of a third replicate. Also, &quot;high replicate variability between the two replicate datasets (R2 correlation &lt;0.7) were removed&quot;. A third replicate would help for that category as well.</p><p>&quot;After removing the ribosomal sequences (about 98% of the reads)&quot; This seems like a waste of resources. I wonder why the authors did not use a method to pull down rRNA before sequencing? If the authors had done so, they would have saved money for including a third biological replicate.</p><p>Second paragraph of subsection “Transcriptome analysis of the developmental program by RNA-Seq”: &quot;two independent biological replicates&quot;. The authors should insist on how the use of RNA-seq extends previous knowledge acquired from microarray experiments. The impact of the present paper is lessened if the data reported are just a confirmation of previous work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors perform a global analysis of the <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> developmental transcriptome, taking timepoints throughout the biofilm's starvation stress response past the self-organization of fruiting bodies and the differentiation of cells into spores (96 hours). They then compare these data to prior studies, both single gene and high throughput, to determine if the changes in RNA levels for different genes at different time points either match previous data or agree with contemporary functional interaction models. Their comparison serves both as data validation and as the primary source of their conclusions. Because the authors choose to largely limit their manuscript in this way, they miss several opportunities to perform a more varied and compelling set of analyses, and ultimately fails to deliver on their impact statement; the work, as presented, does not &quot;reveal a genetic regulatory network&quot;; with significant modification, it might.</p><p>Many interesting questions that could be addressed by these data are left unanswered. There is enough new knowledge to merit publication, but it will require additional analysis and substantial reorganization. Because the changes are significant, there is more than one way to make them, but at least three core problems need to be addressed in one way or another.</p><p>Problem 1: Analysis of the primary expression data set is not explained in sufficient detail for the reader to understand and reproduce it. Statistics were sometimes provided in the text with incomplete descriptions of analytical methods. For example, what specific methods were used to make the log2FC comparisons? How were criteria established for determining which genes fell into each DG? Were alternative methods tried before settling on these 10 DG clusters, and could alternative methods produce a different number of clusters and/or parsing of genes within them?</p><p>Proposed method to address Problem 1: Additional analyses should be performed on the primary data set to address the following questions: Would application of statistical methods, such as multiple range tests, confirm the stability of the 10 DGs, and are the differences in alternative methods statistically relevant? How much of the transcriptome is involved at each time point (i.e. what percentage of the genome is regulated, and how does that percentage change across the time points)? Are there genes that seem to be unique to each time point (i.e. are there any genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated only at one time point and may therefore be particularly important at that specific time point)? Are there other important expression patterns that can be revealed through different statistical methods, such as a functional PCA (i.e. what is the dimensionality of the time-course data)?</p><p>Problem 2: The main focus of the middle part of the manuscript (Figures 3-9) seems to be the confirmation of an existing 'consensus' interaction network, and the authors accomplish this by providing a supporting narrative. Although this narrative is interesting, the choice of genes to focus on and the alternative explanations for inconsistent data make this part of the manuscript subjective. Developmental data already exists for the majority of genes in the 'consensus' interaction network (Figure 1B); sometimes these data are from individual gene studies and sometimes they are from high-throughput studies (also, the authors should carefully qualify their claims of novelty and double check some references). This prior work can be used to generate hypotheses that can be tested using the their data set.</p><p>Proposed method to address Problem 2: The hypothesis could be something like &quot;given the consensus functional interaction network and data from prior studies, we expect the expression patterns of this set of genes to follow the interaction network in the following way…&quot;. The hypothesis must include genes that do not meet the authors' expression cutoffs. Also, crucial conditional statements and plausible alternative explanations like the one stated in the final sentence of subsection “A‐and S‐motility genes exhibit different developmental expression profiles” can't be left to the end of a section, because they effectively negate everything that comes before it. These statements must be addressed throughout the presentation of relevant results and within the context of prior work, rather than as an afterthought.</p><p>Problem 3: Comparison of starvation-induced to glycerol-induced sporulation expression is a very interesting idea; an analysis might provide meaningful insight regarding the similarities and differences between these seemingly related events. The authors only begin to perform this analysis.</p><p>Proposed method to address Problem 3: The extent and nature of differences in gene expression between starvation-induced and glycerol-induced sporulation must be characterized and quantified. A superficial scan of Figure 2B reveals whole regions of different expression patterns. For example, what are all of the additional repressed genes in DG 9 during glycerol-induced sporulation? Could some of these genes provide insight into the differences between the two kinds of sporulation? Could some of these data be used to address the 'spore versus peripheral rod' alternative hypothesis proposed in subsection “A‐and S‐motility genes exhibit different developmental expression profiles”? Could some of these data be used to support the 'consensus' functional interaction network?</p><p>There are more minor issues involving the consistent use of abbreviations and nomenclature, claims of novelty, appropriate references, and the accuracy of concluding statements, but these can wait for the next round of revisions.</p><p>Major Points: Text</p><p>The text should be divided into three main sections: a comprehensive analysis of the gene expression data generated for this study (see point 1 above), a detailed comparison of these data to a 'consensus' functional interaction network (see point 2 above), and a detailed comparison of these data to the glycerol-induced sporulation time course (see point 3 above). All validation work (i.e. B-gal) should be put in supplementary materials, including figures that parse the expression data to support the narrative.</p><p>Major Points: Figures</p><p>The figures should be reorganized to better help the reader navigate the manuscript; at present, their structure and sequence do not match the text in a linear sequence. In the following discussion, the current figures are referred to as 'old Figure X' and proposed figures are referred to as 'new Figure X'.</p><p>New Figure 1A should be real images of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> development rather than a cartoon. It should include images that represent each of the time points taken so that the reader can see what development looks like under a microscope.</p><p>Old Figure 1B should be moved later in the manuscript because that is when it is discussed in the text.</p><p>New Figure 2 should have the cartoon of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> development running vertically on the left side of the heatmap accurately spaced to represent events, along with representative times. A timeline is also represented horizontally, but the authors use developmental stages and times interchangeably throughout the text, and so it would be helpful to have one diagram that runs along one axis showing clearly which times refer to which DGs and which developmental stages. The times should also match new Figure 1, so that the reader can easily go back and see what each stage actually looks like. Old Figure 2B should be moved later in the manuscript because the comparison to sporulation data is not yet discussed in the text.</p><p>New Figure 3 should include at least some set of analyses (see above).</p><p>Old Figures 3 through 9 should be moved to supplementary figures.</p><p>New Figure 4 should have a diagram showing the interaction of genes like one in Figure 1B. The Results section must be clear regarding which genes have transcription profiles that support the authors' hypotheses and which ones don't, and the figure should also include any genes that didn't make the expression cutoff to be included in the analysis. The interaction network diagram in old Figure 1B is designed to horizontally match to the cartoon showing development in old Figure 1A – this is a good idea for new Figure 4, but the matching should be more obvious, and should include developmental stages and DG groupings as in new Figure 2.</p><p>New Figure 5 should be the comparison between starvation induced development/sporulation vs glycerol-induced sporulation transcription profiles. Emphasis should be focused on genes whose expression profiles are similar between the two data sets, and genes whose expression profiles are different. Perhaps some of the genes from new Figure 4 could be identified as involved in development, sporulation, or both. There may also need to be a new Figure 6 providing additional statistical analysis, similar to new Figure 3.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transcriptome dynamics of the <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> multicellular developmental program&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Most importantly, the statistical analyses involved in the parsing and evaluation of expression data are now described clearly and early in the manuscript. Of course the authors' data are not perfect but, for these kinds of large data sets, variations between experimental replicates must be expected. For example, the relatively weak correlation between replicates of the 24 hour time point does not diminish the overall impact of the manuscript, even though the authors can only speculate about an explanation. The inclusion in supplementary materials of alternate heatmaps for different numbers of Developmental Groups (Figure 2A—figure supplement 1) is also very helpful to a reader who may well use these data for the authors' primary stated purpose – as &quot;important tools and resources for future studies.&quot; The comparison between starvation and glycerol induced spores is particularly interesting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50374.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.

Undoubtedly, their suggestions have improved the manuscript. This kind of manuscript, with such a huge amount of data, are difficult to handle and focus, and I really think they have provided many inputs for improvement.

As it can be observed in the new version, we have reorganized and rewritten most of the manuscript to make clear what it was known and what we consider are our most relevant contributions. Moreover, we have done new analyses, and accordingly, a considerable number of new figures and source data are included in the revised version.

We are aware that using filters will exclude genes that may be important for development. On the other hand, the use of these filters give a high degree of confidence for a gene to be considered as being developmentally regulated.

One reason is that not all the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells in the population are doing the same thing at the same time point (development is not synchronic, and there are particularly differences between the center and the edge of the spot), and for this reason we think that a third replicate would only introduce variability without adding much information. With a third replicate, many genes would be excluded because they will not accomplish the criteria we have used to consider a gene as being developmentally regulated, and they could be quite interesting for further studies, because they fit these restrictive criteria in two replicates. Actually, a few hours delay in one of the samples would make this study nearly useless. Actually, we think the R2 correlation is lower at 24 h than at other time points because some cells already started the sporulation process while other did not complete aggregation, yet (in the other time points they are either aggregating or sporulating). We have added a sentence in the manuscript to mention why variability might be higher at this specific time point. In fact, I must say that we decided to sequence two replicates instead of three for these reasons. We think this manuscript has generated new data (as those related to motility, transcription and translation) that will undoubtedly contribute to this field, because it is an excellent scaffold for future studies. Moreover, although a third replicate would offer a better statistical support, two biological replicates have been widely accepted by many authors and it is operationally fine. A correlation value of 0.8 at 24 h is still quite acceptable and does not justify the necessity of a third replicate. Finally, I would like to mention that I contacted with the journal about the need of a third replicate and they agreed that this is not necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;After removing the ribosomal sequences (about 98% of the reads)&quot; This seems like a waste of resources. I wonder why the authors did not use a method to pull down rRNA before sequencing? If the authors had done so, they would have saved money for including a third biological replicate.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a plethora of kits based on different methodologies to remove the rRNA from the RNA-Seq library constructions. However, it is still out on the best method for ribosomal removal and several publications have shown extensive side-by-side tests of one method versus another and have declared different winners. An additional challenge is presented by the high GC presented by <italic>M. xanthus</italic> genome (68.89%), in which rRNA removal is less efficient. Another factor to consider is that, at the time of sequencing, since probe based rRNA removal methods are sequence specific, the availability of specific probes for Myxococcus were not available. Summarizing, at the end of the rRNA removal process, it is frequently found high amounts of rRNA (50% or more) with the putative mRNA lost in the laboratory manipulations. As this work present a time-series with two replicates, rationale indicates that the less manipulation of the samples, the better. Therefore, we chose the option to keep the rRNA. On the analysis side, ribosomal DNA content was filtered out so that differences in rRNA reads across samples do not affect alignment rates and skew subsequent normalization of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second paragraph of subsection “Transcriptome analysis of the developmental program by RNA-Seq”: &quot;two independent biological replicates&quot;. The authors should insist on how the use of RNA-seq extends previous knowledge acquired from microarray experiments. The impact of the present paper is lessened if the data reported are just a confirmation of previous work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten many parts of the manuscript to clarify how our data contribute to the previous knowledge of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> development. Moreover, we have written a short comparison between our transcriptome work (global) and (partial) published microarrays transcriptomes (Introduction section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors perform a global analysis of the Myxococcus xanthus developmental transcriptome, taking timepoints throughout the biofilm's starvation stress response past the self-organization of fruiting bodies and the differentiation of cells into spores (96 hours). They then compare these data to prior studies, both single gene and high throughput, to determine if the changes in RNA levels for different genes at different time points either match previous data or agree with contemporary functional interaction models. Their comparison serves both as data validation and as the primary source of their conclusions. Because the authors choose to largely limit their manuscript in this way, they miss several opportunities to perform a more varied and compelling set of analyses, and ultimately fails to deliver on their impact statement; the work, as presented, does not &quot;reveal a genetic regulatory network&quot;; with significant modification, it might.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten many parts of the manuscript to emphasize on all the new knowledge our data offer. We have also softened our claim of finding a genetic regulatory network.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many interesting questions that could be addressed by these data are left unanswered. There is enough new knowledge to merit publication, but it will require additional analysis and substantial reorganization. Because the changes are significant, there is more than one way to make them, but at least three core problems need to be addressed in one way or another.</p><p>Problem 1: Analysis of the primary expression data set is not explained in sufficient detail for the reader to understand and reproduce it. Statistics were sometimes provided in the text with incomplete descriptions of analytical methods. For example, what specific methods were used to make the log2FC comparisons? How were criteria established for determining which genes fell into each DG? Were alternative methods tried before settling on these 10 DG clusters, and could alternative methods produce a different number of clusters and/or parsing of genes within them?</p></disp-quote><p>First, I would like to mention that classification of the genes in developmental group is just one of the many results we present in this manuscript. We consider that this classification was especially important to facilitate the analyses, to visualize how the transcriptome is changing upon starvation, and to validate our data with data already published, including the transcriptome of chemically induced myxospores. Therefore, definition of the 10 DGs is one of our data, but not the most relevant one. Once the groups are defined, the current paper focuses on many single gene expression profiles of developmental genes, including those that were expected to be developmentally regulated according to work already published in the last 40 years, and many of the new ones identified here, which have not been demonstrated to be important for development. Our work provides a lot of information that undoubtedly will have to be experimentally pursued to know the exact role of each gene in development. It seems that we failed in the narrative of this last part, and we have written the new version of the manuscript to show the analyses in a clearer manner to make readers understand all the novelties our data and analyses provide. Nevertheless, and going back to the definition of the 10 clusters, we have explained in more details how the 10 DGs were obtained, and why we chose 10 instead of other number (subsections “Gene expression profiles organize into 10 developmental groups (DGs)”; “Sequencing and transcriptomic data analysis”; and “Developmental gene analysis”). We have also included a new figure (Figure 3A—figure supplement 1) to show that the election of 10 groups instead of other number was the most appropriate one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Proposed method to address Problem 1: Additional analyses should be performed on the primary data set to address the following questions: Would application of statistical methods, such as multiple range tests, confirm the stability of the 10 DGs, and are the differences in alternative methods statistically relevant?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have explained in more details how the 10 DGs were obtained, and why we chose 10 instead of other number. We have also included a new figure to show that the election of 10 groups instead of other number was the most appropriate one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How much of the transcriptome is involved at each time point (i.e. what percentage of the genome is regulated, and how does that percentage change across the time points)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included two new figure supplements to respond this question (Figure 3A—figure supplement 2 and 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there genes that seem to be unique to each time point (i.e. are there any genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated only at one time point and may therefore be particularly important at that specific time point)?</p></disp-quote><p>I think the response to this question may already be in the manuscript. For instance, all genes included in DG1 are only required during growth. Additionally, all genes in DG3 peak at 6 h. In other groups and time points, we can find some genes that peak at a specific time point. Nevertheless, we have mentioned in the new version of the manuscript some genes that are involved in regulation of gene expression that peak at specific time points or specific process (aggregation, sporulation or transition from one to the other) (Figure 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there other important expression patterns that can be revealed through different statistical methods, such as a functional PCA (i.e. what is the dimensionality of the time-course data)?</p></disp-quote><p>Although it could be interesting, according to all the responses given above we think this is out of the scope of this manuscript. I agree with the reviewer that many things can be done with the data we have obtained, and in fact, as we mention in the manuscript, our data represent a tool and resource to work in many directions in the future. I think this suggestion (and some others mentioned) is out of this scope of the manuscript we try to publish now. Even more, I encourage Roy, as well as other myxobacteriologists, to use our data once they are public to prepare other(s) manuscript(s) that will undoubtedly help to understand the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> developmental cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Problem 2: The main focus of the middle part of the manuscript (Figures 3-9) seems to be the confirmation of an existing 'consensus' interaction network, and the authors accomplish this by providing a supporting narrative. Although this narrative is interesting, the choice of genes to focus on and the alternative explanations for inconsistent data make this part of the manuscript subjective. Developmental data already exists for the majority of genes in the 'consensus' interaction network (Figure 1B); sometimes these data are from individual gene studies and sometimes they are from high-throughput studies (also, the authors should carefully qualify their claims of novelty and double check some references). This prior work can be used to generate hypotheses that can be tested using the their data set.</p></disp-quote><p>We only partially agree with this this comment. In every section we have dealt with in the manuscript, we have tried to combine what it was already known with the complexity that our data provide. It is clear that we failed to clearly differentiate these two types of data, known and novel, and our novelty seems to be hidden in the manner we presented the data. For this reason, we have rewritten all this sections to make clear what it was already known, what we have found, and how everything matches to explain <italic>M. xanthus</italic> developmental cycle. I would also like to mention that the previous figure addressed a streamlined functional network (and new Figure 3A—figure supplement 4). This functional network diagram illustrates those genes for which known molecular mechanisms exist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Proposed method to address Problem 2: The hypothesis could be something like &quot;given the consensus functional interaction network and data from prior studies, we expect the expression patterns of this set of genes to follow the interaction network in the following way…&quot;. The hypothesis must include genes that do not meet the authors' expression cutoffs. Also, crucial conditional statements and plausible alternative explanations like the one stated in the final sentence of subsection “A‐and S‐motility genes exhibit different developmental expression profiles” can't be left to the end of a section, because they effectively negate everything that comes before it. These statements must be addressed throughout the presentation of relevant results and within the context of prior work, rather than as an afterthought.</p></disp-quote><p>I hope the new presentation of the data satisfy this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Problem 3: Comparison of starvation-induced to glycerol-induced sporulation expression is a very interesting idea; an analysis might provide meaningful insight regarding the similarities and differences between these seemingly related events. The authors only begin to perform this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Proposed method to address Problem 3: The extent and nature of differences in gene expression between starvation-induced and glycerol-induced sporulation must be characterized and quantified. A superficial scan of Figure 2B reveals whole regions of different expression patterns. For example, what are all of the additional repressed genes in DG 9 during glycerol-induced sporulation? Could some of these genes provide insight into the differences between the two kinds of sporulation? Could some of these data be used to address the 'spore versus peripheral rod' alternative hypothesis proposed in subsection “A‐and S‐motility genes exhibit different developmental expression profiles”? Could some of these data be used to support the 'consensus' functional interaction network?</p></disp-quote><p>We think this could also be interesting, but analysis here is simply a hypothesis generator, and without experimental validation, there is no direct point to it. It could also be an interesting point to pursue in the future, but not in this manuscript. We have nevertheless addressed the differences between the two transcriptome sets more precisely and pointed out which gene sets have the potential to reveal differences in spore maturation and alternate cell types (we have rewritten the comparison in the revised version).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Points: Text</p><p>The text should be divided into three main sections: a comprehensive analysis of the gene expression data generated for this study (see point 1 above), a detailed comparison of these data to a 'consensus' functional interaction network (see point 2 above), and a detailed comparison of these data to the glycerol-induced sporulation time course (see point 3 above). All validation work (i.e. B-gal) should be put in supplementary materials, including figures that parse the expression data to support the narrative.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with this comment. As mentioned above, these kinds of data can be handled and many different ways, and while we are sure it would generate an interesting paper doing what the reviewer proposes, we believe that the data should be presented in the manner we have opted to do it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Points: Figures</p><p>The figures should be reorganized to better help the reader navigate the manuscript; at present, their structure and sequence do not match the text in a linear sequence. In the following discussion, the current figures are referred to as 'old Figure X' and proposed figures are referred to as 'new Figure X'.</p></disp-quote><p>Reorganization of the text and Figures was undertaken to address this issue as is indicated in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>New Figure 1A should be real images of M. xanthus development rather than a cartoon. It should include images that represent each of the time points taken so that the reader can see what development looks like under a microscope.</p><p>Old Figure 1B should be moved later in the manuscript because that is when it is discussed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have decided to maintain the cartoon of Figure 1A (Figure A in the revised version). Maybe myxobacteriologists will understand microscopic figures, but a general reader can obtain a clearer information in a cartoon where many details can be drawn that do not appear in an image (for instance, cells that lyse cannot appear in a microscopic image). Nevertheless, and as microscopic images may also be helpful, we have included them in Figure 3A. As addressed above, Figure 1B (functional network) seems to have been problematic for not including ALL genes known to be involved in development. We have deleted previous Figure 1B and recreated a new figure, which is now placed later in text as Figure 3A—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>New Figure 2 should have the cartoon of M. xanthus development running vertically on the left side of the heatmap accurately spaced to represent events, along with representative times. A timeline is also represented horizontally, but the authors use developmental stages and times interchangeably throughout the text, and so it would be helpful to have one diagram that runs along one axis showing clearly which times refer to which DGs and which developmental stages. The times should also match new Figure 1, so that the reader can easily go back and see what each stage actually looks like. Old Figure 2B should be moved later in the manuscript because the comparison to sporulation data is not yet discussed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>This point includes several questions. Regarding the presentation of the situation of the developmental program at each time point, we think that Figure 3A (when it is clear what happens during development depicted in Figure 1)is the moment to include pictures taken under dissecting and electron microscopes. Therefore, we have included pictures about the aggregation stage of the cells and their morphology in the new Figure 3A. Regarding the proposal to move Figure 3B to later, we feel the figure would lose a lot of the information it contains in both panels. Each gene is represented at the same position in panels A and B. Therefore, it is possible to visualize what happens with each individual gene (and group) in both situations, development by starvation and spore formation by glycerol. These two panels have to be shown side by side to provide all the information we want to show. Therefore, we have maintained panels A and B in Figure 3. Moreover, as the section about comparison between both types of spores has been moved earlier in the text, no other figure is mentioned before Figure 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>New Figure 3 should include at least some set of analyses mentioned (see above).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a new Figure (Figure 3A—figure supplement 1) to explain why we defined 10 DGs, as mentioned above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Old Figures 3 through 9 should be moved to supplementary figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree again in this point. We consider all the information we show in these figures to be relevant and therefore insist they cannot be supplemental. We have a huge amount of information and it can be handled in many different manners. We consider the one we have chosen is the best one. Therefore, we have maintained Figures 4-10, with some modifications in some of them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>New Figure 4 should have a diagram showing the interaction of genes like one in Figure 1B. The Results section must be clear regarding which genes have transcription profiles that support the authors' hypotheses and which ones don't, and the figure should also include any genes that didn't make the expression cutoff to be included in the analysis. The interaction network diagram in old Figure 1B is designed to horizontally match to the cartoon showing development in old Figure 1A – this is a good idea for new Figure 4, but the matching should be more obvious, and should include developmental stages and DG groupings as in new Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have redone Figure 1, eliminating panel B from this figure. We agree with the reviewer that this position could be premature. We have moved this panel to supplementary data as Figure 3A—figure supplement 4, to show this information closer to a new and more complex regulatory network unveiled by our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>New Figure 5 should be the comparison between starvation induced development/sporulation vs glycerol-induced sporulation transcription profiles. Emphasis should be focused on genes whose expression profiles are similar between the two data sets, and genes whose expression profiles are different. Perhaps some of the genes from new Figure 4 could be identified as involved in development, sporulation, or both. There may also need to be a new Figure 6 providing additional statistical analysis, similar to new Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Our feeling is that the reviewer overlooked the information we included as supplemental with the pie charts for this part (Figure 3B—source data 1, 2 and 3), since much of what he is asking for is already there, including the stat analysis. Nevertheless, we have rearranged the section and included a new panel as Figure 3C. We recommend to examining new Figure 3B—source data 1 and 2 and Figure 3C—source data 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
