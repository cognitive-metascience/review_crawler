However, the role of the thalamus in this process is poorly understood. To determine the thalamic contribution to non-REM oscillations (sharp-wave ripples, SWRs; slow/delta; spindles), we recorded units and local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously in the limbic thalamus, mPFC, and CA1 in rats. We report that the cycles of neocortical spindles provide a key temporal window that coordinates CA1 SWRs with sparse but consistent activation of thalamic units. Thalamic units were phase-locked to delta and spindles in mPFC, and fired at consistent lags with other thalamic units within spindles, while CA1 units that were active during spatial exploration were engaged in SWR-coupled spindles after behavior. The sparse thalamic firing could promote an incremental integration of recently acquired memory traces into neocortical schemas through the interleaved activation of thalamocortical cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>memory consolidation</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>spindles</kwd><kwd>ripples</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003403</institution-id><institution>Caja Madrid Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Convocatoria 2008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varela</surname><given-names>Carmen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varela</surname><given-names>Carmen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STC award CCF-1231216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Matthew A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TR01-GM10498</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Matthew A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sleep spindles provide a temporal framework to organize the reactivation of behaviorally relevant CA1 cells and sparsely active cells in the limbic thalamus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Two complementary learning systems acquire and process episodic memories in order to learn adaptive models of the world that generalize beyond specific experiences and continue to incorporate information through the lifetime of an animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Marr, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kumaran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). The hippocampus can form memory traces rapidly; however, over time, interactions between the hippocampus and neocortex are thought to extract statistical regularities from the organism’s experiences during wakefulness, and update neocortical models or schemas to increase their adaptive value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kumaran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morris, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Moscovitch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Stickgold and Walker, 2013</xref>). During non-REM sleep, the interactions between the hippocampal and neocortical cell ensembles that underlie these processes are reflected in nested oscillations in the local field potentials (LFPs). The up-states of the slow oscillation (1–4 Hz) provide a processing window in which faster dynamics lead to synaptic plasticity in relevant cell populations. In the neocortex, some cells are preferentially active at the start or at the end of up-states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Neske, 2015</xref>), and in the hippocampal CA1 region, sharp-wave ripple oscillations (SWRs, 100–275 Hz) occur primarily during up-states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Isomura et al., 2006</xref>). Hippocampal SWRs are brief (up to ~100 ms) oscillations that correlate with the reactivation of spatial representations by hippocampal cell ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>), which are thought to contribute the content in the consolidation of episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010</xref>). Spindle oscillations (6–14 Hz) are coordinated with the slow oscillation and with SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Peyrache et al., 2011</xref>). Spindles are generated in the thalamus when the inhibitory cells of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) evoke inhibitory post-synaptic potentials and rebound bursting in cells of the dorsal thalamus, which then entrain their postsynaptic targets in neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Steriade et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Contreras et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Steriade et al., 1985</xref>). However, the role of spindles in gating and coordinating communication between hippocampus and neocortex remains to be explored at the cellular and systems level.</p><p>The coupling between non-REM oscillations appears to be causally linked to memory consolidation, as suggested by the disruption or enhancement of memory following closed-loop manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Latchoumane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ngo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Marshall et al., 2006</xref>), and by the association of spindle dysfunction with perturbation of memory function in some neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Purcell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Manoach and Stickgold, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Winer et al., 2019</xref>). However, we are far from understanding the specific mechanisms and single-cell dynamics involved in the hippocampal-neocortical interaction. In particular, information regarding the thalamic involvement is limited. Evidence from anesthetized animals suggests a coordination of thalamic firing with both the neocortical slow oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Slezia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Contreras and Steriade, 1995</xref>) and with hippocampal SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lara-Vásquez et al., 2016</xref>), while fMRI results from studies in monkeys indicate an overall decrease in thalamic activity during SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Logothetis et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study in naturally sleeping rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), found a decrease in activity in cells of the thalamic mediodorsal (MD) nucleus at the time of CA1 SWRs, particularly during SWRs uncoupled from spindles recorded in the skull EEG. This emerging evidence emphasizes the need to study the thalamus, but we have been lacking a multi-region approach (thalamus, neocortex, hippocampus) that would compare in the same preparation the dynamics of cell activity in each region to the sleep oscillations, and that would investigate the dynamics of the thalamic contribution down to the finer timescales relevant for plasticity.</p><p>We sought to address this gap by characterizing the fine temporal correlations of thalamic cells with sleep oscillations through extracellular recordings of single units and LFPs in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampal CA1 region, and nuclei of the midline thalamus in freely behaving rats. We targeted these brain regions because of their anatomical and functional connectivity and their role in memory processes. The limbic thalamus has widespread connections with neocortical regions, and projections from the midline are particularly dense to mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Vertes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rubio-Garrido et al., 2009</xref>), a critical region for the recall of consolidated memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Maviel et al., 2004</xref>). All the recorded nuclei share circuit, physiological and molecular commonalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guillery and Sherman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Varela, 2014</xref>). The reuniens nucleus (RE) in the midline sends collaterals to CA1 and mPFC, making it a compelling candidate to coordinate mPFC-CA1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hoover and Vertes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Varela et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, although the functional association between RE and hippocampus has received a lot of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019</xref>), the hippocampus projects to rostral parts of the thalamic reticular nucleus and to prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Zikopoulos and Barbas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavdar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Swanson, 1981</xref>), which could indirectly influence nuclei other than RE. Recording from several midline nuclei, we find evidence for a dual role of the thalamus in hippocampal-neocortical sleep interactions; first, an increase in thalamic firing at the down to up-state transition, which could influence the dynamics of the slow oscillation, and second, the sparse but consistent firing of thalamic cells within individual spindles suggests an interleaved activation of thalamocortical synapses that may promote a flexible integration of recently acquired memory traces into neocortical schemas during systems consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We used tetrodes to record extracellularly (single units, LFPs) from the midline thalamus, and from areas involved in recent (CA1) and remote (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Maviel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Varela et al., 2016</xref>). During the 1–5 hr recording sessions (in freely behaving rats), the animals remained in a quiet, square-shaped enclosure where they cycled through bouts of sleep and wakefulness; in six sessions from three rats, the animals also explored a radial maze after the recording of sleep, and were brought back to the sleep area after behavior for comparison of sleep activity before and after spatial exploration. LFPs and 333 units were recorded from seven rats; sessions from an additional animal in which no units were recorded were also included for LFP analyses for a total of n = 8 rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> displays a subset of tetrode locations in brain sections from one rat; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref> document the trajectories in the brain for the electrodes and sessions used for analyses). We selected recording sessions in which there was at least one unit recorded in the thalamus and where reliable detection of sleep events could be performed (slow oscillation and spindle activity in mPFC, sharp-wave ripples, SWRs, in CA1; examples of simultaneously recorded LFP traces and units shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The majority of recordings in the thalamus were from units in the reuniens (RE), and ventromedial (VM) nuclei, and some from the mediodorsal (MD), paratenial (PT), rhomboid (RH) and centromedial (CM; detailed population numbers in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). All these nuclei are bi-directionally connected to mPFC, and are functionally related to mPFC and other higher order cognitive regions, including CA1, which also receives direct input from RE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavdar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Swanson, 1981</xref>).

Within this state, we detected reference features that reflect non-REM sleep events that are key organizers of memory consolidation: K-complexes (KCs, marked by red bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, mPFC LFP), the troughs of spindle cycles in mPFC (red dots in 1d), and SWRs in CA1 (red bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, CA1 LFP). These LFP events are markers of cell population dynamics, namely, KCs mark the down-states of the neocortical slow oscillation, while SWRs correspond to the high-frequency oscillations that reflect memory-related reactivation of ensembles of CA1 place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>). Spindles (6–14 Hz) are generated through oscillatory bursting in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which is thought to then engage cells in the dorsal thalamus and, through them, neocortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Steriade et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Steriade et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Steriade et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huguenard and McCormick, 2007</xref>). We considered that the time window of each spindle cycle has a similar duration to that of SWRs (up to ~100 ms) and sought to test if individual spindle cycles represent a window for multi-region coordination; we thus detected individual spindle cycles from the mPFC 6–14 Hz filtered LFP. The detection of individual cycles was also motivated by the occasional observation of few spindle cycles in succession (e.g. only 3–4 cycles following the second detected KC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), and by the broader variability in the morphology of the LFP trace in the spindle band compared to the more clearly discrete and consistent signatures of KCs and SWRs (examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). KCs, spindle cycles, and SWRs were detected from the mPFC and CA1 LFPs after applying an amplitude threshold to the squared, filtered trace (1–4 Hz for KCs; 6–14 Hz for spindles; 100–275 Hz for SWRs), at a level of three (spindles) and four (KCs, SWRs) standard deviations above the average LFP voltage across sleep periods in each recording session (see Materials and methods for details). Although the spindle band overlaps with the theta band, we limited the detection of spindle cycles (and KCs and SWRs) to resting states; peri-spindle spectrograms confirmed that detected spindle cycles are functionally different from theta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Peri-event histograms of the LFP and local spiking activity, triggered on the timestamps at the time of largest amplitude of the detected events (trough for KCs and spindles, peak for SWRs), confirmed that the LFP detection identified events that reflect the modulated activity of local cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Thalamic cells fire in two modes, burst and tonic, depending on the activation state of a transient conductance that relies on T-type calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Perez-Reyes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gutierrez et al., 2001</xref>). Bursts correlate with thalamic hyperpolarization, which is a pre-requisite for T-channel activation, and they can enhance transmission in thalamocortical synapses and induce synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Swadlow and Gusev, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leresche and Lambert, 2017</xref>). Therefore, analyzing burst firing can provide clues on the mechanism behind the decrease in firing rate in sleep. Bursting can be detected from extracellular recordings because of its characteristic combination of a relatively long inter-spike interval followed in rapid succession by a few spikes with brief inter-spike intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lu et al., 1992</xref>), but the relation between thalamic bursts and SWRs has not been explored.</p><p>We detected bursts in the thalamus as groups of action potentials with less than 5 ms of inter-spike interval preceded by at least 70 ms with no spikes, a criterion based on the dynamics of the T-channels underlying burst firing in the dorsal thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gutierrez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jahnsen and Llinás, 1984a</xref>). With this criterion, we found that 25% of the thalamic cells had at least 5% of their spikes in bursts during wakefulness, while 77.5% did during sleep (average percentage of spikes in bursts during wakefulness 4.60 ± 7.97%, and during sleep 18.65 ± 15.3%; p=1.8 × 10<sup>−7</sup>; Wilcoxon signed rank; n = 40 units, seven rats; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The increase in bursting was more pronounced around the time of SWRs in CA1 (25.52 ± 17.29% of spikes in bursts in a 2 s window around SWRs; p=1.8 × 10<sup>−7</sup> Kruskall-Wallis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We also estimated thalamic bursting after shifting the timestamps of each SWRs randomly by at least 2 (or 5 s) and calculated the total number of spikes and percent of burst spikes in the same 2 s window around SWRs. In both cases (&gt;2 and&gt;5 s shifts), the average number of thalamic unit spikes was significantly lower in the SWRs windows compared to the shifted timestamps (p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>), and the percent of spikes in bursts significantly higher (p=0.002 and p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup> respectively after a 2 s or 5 s shift; Wilcoxon signed rank). Because the T-channels responsible for burst firing need a sustained hyperpolarization for about 50–100 ms to be primed for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gutierrez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jahnsen and Llinás, 1984b</xref>), the increase in bursting suggests a hyperpolarization of the majority of cells in the limbic thalamus during sleep, and particularly in association with hippocampal SWRs.</p><p>Indeed, peri-SWR triggered histograms showed that SWRs occur in a background of decreased thalamic spiking. An example of a peri-SWR histogram for a unit from the RE nucleus is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, and the peri-SWR for the population of all thalamic units in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>; 55.32% of units in the thalamus showed a reduction in firing of more than two standard deviations (sd) from the null (average −4.23 ± 2.00 sd) in a 200 ms window around the time of SWRs occurrence. Instead, 90.18% of CA1 units increased their firing by 19.85 ± 18.65 sd in a 200 ms window around SWRs (4.91% of CA1 units showed an average decrease of 4.11 ± 1.59 sd), while the mPFC population included 30.95% of units showing an increase (average 6.22 ± 4.32 sd) and 40.48% a reduction in firing (average −3.22 ± 1.40 sd). The peri-SWR histograms for the population of CA1 and mPFC units are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>. A few thalamic units (14.89%) showed a pure increase in firing in the 200 ms window around CA1 SWRs; this means an increase in firing larger than two standard deviations from the null distribution and that was not associated with a post-inhibition rebound. Another four units (8.51%) had a rebound in firing (larger than 2sd) that followed soon after a strong decrease in firing (below −2sd) (as the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p>Using a complementary approach, generalized linear models (GLMs) of CA1 activity (SWRs and multi-unit firing rate) with the firing rate in thalamic units as covariate, showed that the firing in CA1 varied inversely with the firing of most thalamic units (61.7%, p&lt;0.001; only one unit in the MD nucleus had a significant positive correlation with SWR rate). For the units that negatively correlated with SWRs, the models predict an average increase of 20.74% in the rate of SWRs for every one spike/s drop in thalamic firing, suggesting anti-correlated activity in the limbic thalamus and CA1 (instead, as expected, the rate of SWRs was positively correlated with the spiking activity recorded in CA1; p value &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−189</sup> in all electrodes used for SWR detection). The decrease of spiking in thalamic units with SWRs was observed in RE and in other nuclei. Some of the strongest negative correlations with SWRs were observed in RE (unit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), and the size of the effect was marginally significant in RE compared to non-RE units (p=0.05). However, there was no difference between the proportion of SWR-correlated units in RE compared to non-RE units (p=0.159), suggesting that the decrease in thalamic firing with SWRs relates to general excitability changes in the state of thalamocortical networks in the limbic thalamus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Temporal correlation of thalamic units with mPFC delta and spindle oscillations</title><p>Although we found a decrease in average thalamic firing and an increase in bursting that suggests a hyperpolarized thalamus during SWRs, it is unclear how the remaining thalamic spikes relate to the mPFC delta (1–4 Hz) and spindle (6–14 Hz) oscillation bands, and if there are specific temporal windows with selective increase in thalamic firing. To investigate this, we used two approaches: we calculated firing rates with respect to local events detected in the mPFC LFP (KCs, spindle troughs); and we estimated the phase-preference of unit spikes to the delta and spindle-filtered mPFC LFP.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Thalamic rebound following the down-state of the mPFC slow oscillation</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> shows the peri-KC histogram for a unit recorded in the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus. Units in the thalamus often fired asymmetrically with respect to KCs, with stronger firing in the few hundreds of milliseconds after the mPFC KC compared to before KCs (average of 2.48 standard deviations at 274.76 ± 135.33 ms after KCs, compared to 1.28 standard deviations at 263.31 ± 145.31 ms before KCs; n = 31 thalamic units; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref> includes the peri-KC histograms for units in mPFC and CA1). The trough of thalamic firing occurred on average after the mPFC KCs and after the trough of mPFC unit spikes, and coinciding with the trough of SWRs in CA1, suggesting that the neocortical slow oscillation trough leads both the thalamus and CA1 (thalamic unit firing minimum at 10.56 ± 130.75 ms after KCs, n = 31; mPFC units −7.70 ± 72.3 ms, before LFP KCs, n = 46; SWRs 10.33 ± 5.88 ms after KCs).</p><p>Previous evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Neske, 2015</xref>) suggests that the thalamus may have a specific role in the initiation of cortical up-states. To assess the specificity of thalamic firing to the down to up-state transition, we compared the firing of thalamic units before and after mPFC KCs. For the population of thalamic cells, 38.71% increased their activity above two sd (from the null distribution) following KCs, that is, in the down to up-state transition, compared to 9.68% of the cells with a significant peak preceding KCs, that is, in the up to down-state transition (19.35 % units had a significant peak both before and after KCs). Instead, CA1 and mPFC activity was more similar preceding and following KCs. SWR probability increased within the 250 ms around mPFC KCs (4.65 sd at 208.15 ± 90 ms before KCs, and 3.02 sd at 266.85 ± 100 ms after KCs; n = 23 sessions). This indicates a delta modulated increase in SWR probability in CA1, with the minimum rate of ripples following briefly after the trough of neocortical activity (10.33 ± 5.88 ms). The modulation of SWRs was paralleled by a modulation of firing in CA1 units (n = 111), which increased their activity both before and after KCs (2.32 ± 1.49 sd at −233.7 ± 146 ms before KCs, and 2.35 ± 1.69 sd at 273 ± 140 ms after KCs); on average, CA1 units presented a trough of activity after KCs (19.53 ± 132 ms). Activity in mPFC (n = 46 units) was modulated in a similar way, with increases in unit firing preceding and following the down-state of the slow oscillation (2.33 standard deviations at −267.30 ± 110.40 ms, before KCs; 2.31 standard deviations at 295.20 ± 120 ms, after KCs).</p><p>In other words, while units from the three areas showed no difference in the peak of the histograms in the time window following KCs (p=0.89, Kruskal-Wallis between regions), thalamic units had significantly lower firing before KCs compared to mPFC and CA1 units (p=0.007, Kruskal-Wallis). This suggests that thalamic cells contribute spikes primarily when a new cycle of the slow oscillation starts, while mPFC and CA1 units also fire at up-to-down transitions. We used an additional metric to quantify the differential firing of units in the three brain areas with respect to the time of mPFC KCs. For all the units, we calculated the difference between the maximum firing rate in the 0.5 s windows before and after KCs, normalized to the maximum firing in the two windows. This asymmetry index ranges between −1 and 1, with negative values indicating higher firing before KCs. The distribution of this index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) was biased to positive values for thalamic units, but was uniformly distributed for mPFC and CA1 units (average 0.24 ± 0.22 in thalamus; −0.004 ± 0.47 in mPFC; −0.06 ± 0.5 in CA1), consistent with a selective rebound of thalamic firing in the time window following mPFC KCs, relative to thalamic activity preceding the down-state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Sparse thalamic firing and consistent activation of cell pairs during spindles</title><p>We then analyzed the firing at the timescale of mPFC spindles, and found the strongest modulations in the CA1 multi-unit activity (MUA, all spikes recorded by a given electrode).

The increase was less clear and consistent in individual units, even when the local MUA had a clear modulation, which suggests a functional coordination at the cell population level with sparse engagement of individual cells. Spindle oscillations can vary in frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>) and individual units may not contribute spikes in every spindle cycle, flattening the average correlograms. To investigate the oscillatory activity of thalamic units directly, we looked for peaks in the autocorrelation of single unit spikes.</p><p>The autocorrelations of thalamic units did not present strong peaks at the time intervals of spindle frequency, that is, in the time window between 50 and 150 ms, suggesting that the cells did not fire rhythmically in that frequency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> illustrates the sparsity of thalamic cell firing during mPFC spindles; the panel shows a trace of mPFC LFP with several cycles of spindle oscillation (6–14 Hz filtered trace overlaid in black); the MUA recorded by one tetrode in the thalamus is shown in orange and the spikes of a single unit in magenta. The auto-correlograms next to the raw data were calculated with the spikes fired during sleep, and show the lack of spindle rhythmicity in the single unit (also when calculated with only burst spikes), in spite of the MUA modulation (which can also be seen in the spike raster). Similar results were obtained for all thalamic units, regardless of the nucleus, and including the units that showed the strongest rebound following KCs. The observation of peaks in the autocorrelation of the MUA was not just due to a larger amount of spikes compared to individual units; calculating the MUA autocorrelation in windows with smaller numbers of spikes (equal to the median number of spikes in units) preserved the shape of the MUA autocorrelation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–e</xref>). We calculated the time at the autocorrelation maximum (after the minimum that follows lag 0) and plotted the distribution for unit spikes and for MUA (all the spikes in sleep or a subsample matching the number of spikes of the sparsest unit recorded in the same session; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>). We found that the peak of the MUA autocorrelation occurs on average at 119.30 ± 78 ms, whereas the interval is longer for the units, 223.60 ± 113.30 ms (p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney).

Thus, these analyses were more restricted to conditions in which rhythmicity in the spindle band would be expected to be strongest, and still failed to reveal evidence of sustained rhythmic firing in this sample of thalamic cells. Overall, the results suggest that most thalamic units are not strongly oscillatory and that it is the combined spikes from multiple units that underlie spindle frequency oscillations.</p><p>The reduced rhythmicity in the thalamic units compared to the modulation of the MUA, raise the possibility that different groups of thalamic cells contribute to activity in different spindle cycles. A prediction from this hypothesis is that pairs of units should be more likely to be correlated within brief timescales than individual units with themselves. We tested this by calculating cross-correlograms of sleep spikes in sessions in which we recorded more than one unit in the thalamus (n = 39 pairs, four rats); 33% of the pairs had a peak above three standard deviations from the average cross-correlogram (average peak z-score 2.40 ± 1.21 sd). An example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, which displays the cross-correlogram of two thalamic units during sleep; the plots show that the spikes of ‘unit 1’ follow reliably in a window of ~50 ms after those of ‘unit 2’ (reference), while neither of the units show a strong auto-correlogram in that period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>All the pairs that showed a peak in the sleep cross-correlograms were correlated in a time scale consistent with the duration of spindle cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref> for all pair cross-correlograms).

We compared the peri-spindle cycle modulation index for spindle cycles classified based on spindle amplitude or on ripple power (above or below the median). The absolute index values were similar in spindles classified based on spindle amplitude or ripple power (p&gt;0.3, Wilcoxon signed rank), but increased significantly from low to high amplitude spindles (p=0.005) compared to low to high ripple power spindles (p=0.25). The modulation also increased, although less, when comparing spindles with low amplitude and low ripple power to spindles with high amplitude and high ripple power (p=0.014). This suggests that the strongest firing modulation is due to changes in spindle amplitude compared to ripple power or to the combined effect, as expected from the role of thalamic cells in spindle generation (modulation index distributions for the population in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Although the modulation by ripple power is not as strong, it could provide an additional boost to the spindle related modulation. To find out if there are synergistic effects between spindle amplitude and ripple power, we detected the spindle cycles with the highest amplitude (upper 25% quartile) and compared the modulation of thalamic cells when ripple power was high or low (above or below median). We run a complementary analysis in which we detected spindle cycles with the highest ripple power (upper 25%) and compared the modulation of thalamic cells in cycles with low or high amplitude. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref> illustrates an increased modulation with ripple power in the same thalamic unit from panels 6a-c. The peri-spindle histogram for spindle cycles in the upper quartile of the distribution of peak-to-trough amplitudes is split between those that have low or high ripple power; the two groups of spindles are not significantly different in amplitude (p=0.45), yet the unit increases its firing modulation with high-ripple-power spindles (top plots); the same unit shows reduced modulation with large spindle amplitude for spindles with the highest ripple power (bottom). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> includes additional examples of units that increase and decrease their spindle modulation with ripple power and spindle amplitude. In the population of cells, we did not find evidence of a significant effect of ripple power on the modulation value of thalamic firing in high amplitude spindles (p=0.94; Wilcoxon signed rank), while higher spindle amplitude led to higher modulation values on high ripple power spindles (p=0.04). However, although the modulation values were not significantly different, a majority (61.29%) of units showed a further increase in modulation index with ripple power in high amplitude spindles (average increase 18.15 ± 21.94%); instead, 32.26% of the units increased their modulation with spindle amplitude (in the spindles with highest ripple power; average increase 30.00 ± 20.97%), suggesting that when spindle amplitude is high, ripple power can enhance the modulation of thalamic cells further. The percent change in the modulation index with ripple power and spindle amplitude were positively correlated (Spearman correlation 0.51; p=0.003).</p><p>If there is a functional relation with spindle amplitude or ripple power, spindles in the upper quartiles should lead to stronger modulation. We then calculated the fraction of thalamic units in which the increase in modulation in spindles within the upper quartile was higher than the increase observed with the median classification. The increase in modulation index was higher in the upper quartile of spindle amplitude in 29% of thalamic units and with ripple power in 22.6% units. The absolute modulation values were higher for spindle amplitude compared to ripple power and positively correlated (average of 1.16 ± 0.57 in the upper quartile of spindle amplitude compared to 0.60 ± 0.26 in the upper quartile of ripple power; p=0.04, Mann-Whitney); units with stronger modulation with spindle power had higher values of ripple modulation (Spearman coefficient &gt;0.7; p&lt;0.04). For spindle amplitude, the lower modulation values also became lower with the quartile classification, leading to a wider spread of the distribution (when spindles were classified based on quartiles compared to median; p=0.04; F-test) which was not the case with ripple power (p=0.36; F-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). These results also suggest that the strongest firing modulations in thalamic cells are related to the spindle oscillation, and that ripples in CA1 are associated with smaller changes in firing modulation in about 20% of thalamic cells.</p><p>Although we observed clear modulations of firing with spindles, the absolute number of spikes in single units did not change significantly with spindles low or high in ripple power, nor with SWRs coupled or uncoupled to spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>).</p><p>We also observed a stronger modulation with ripple power in the cross-correlograms between unit pairs. We calculated the modulation index for the cross-correlograms of thalamic pairs and found that it increased by an average of 26.64% in 48.72% of the pairs in spindle cycles with high ripple power and decreased by 20.90% in the rest of the pairs (n = 39). Altogether, the data is consistent with the hypothesis that the up and down modulation of firing of thalamic cells during spindles is dynamically regulated in conjunction with changes in ripple activity in the hippocampus. This could influence spindle-specific thalamocortical synaptic plasticity and facilitate the integration of hippocampal memory traces into neocortical networks.</p><p>At broader time scales (seconds), we had found a decrease in thalamic firing and increase in bursting with SWRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, it is possible that only spindle-nested SWRs are correlated with thalamic units. To test this possibility, we calculated the cross-correlograms of thalamic units with SWRs that occurred within the time window of detected spindle cycles, and compared them to a sample of equal number of SWRs that did not occur within spindle cycles. We compared the mean spikes/s in the 100 ms central window of these cross-correlograms between thalamic single units and SWRs within or outside of spindles. We found low firing rates but no significant difference in thalamic firing near SWRs that occurred within detected spindle cycles (mean firing 3.83 ± 3.49 spikes/s with spindle-nested SWRs, compared to 3.99 ± 3.39; p=0.18, Wilcoxon signed rank; n = 31); only when broadening the window of the cross-correlograms to at least 1 s around SWRs, did we find a slight decrease in thalamic firing with SWRs nested in spindles (mean firing 3.73 ± 3.43 spikes/s with spindle-nested SWRs, compared to 3.94 ± 3.35; p&lt;10<sup>−2</sup>, Wilcoxon signed rank; n = 31).</p><p>In mPFC, previous work had shown increased correlation between SWRs and mPFC units outside of spindles. We calculated a peri-SWR histogram of mPFC unit activity with the same parameters used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Peyrache et al., 2011</xref> (2 ms bins in a window of 400 ms before and after SWRs), and separated the peri-SWR histogram based on ripples that occurred within or outside spindle cycles (using a sample with the same number of coupled and uncoupled SWRs). We z-scored the resulting histograms to the same shuffled distribution (after randomizing all SWR timestamps). The resulting peri-SWR histograms are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3a</xref>; we found that there was no significant difference for the population of mPFC units between SWRs coupled or uncoupled to spindles (z-score 0.17 ± 1.26 for coupled-SWRs and 0.24 ± 0.86; p=0.46, Wilcoxon signed rank). However, the units with the strongest peri-SWRs correlograms (calculated with all SWRs), showed differential firing for SWRs coupled or uncoupled to spindles, such that their firing decreased with SWRs coupled to spindles (units with the strongest negative correlation had more negative values with SWRs uncoupled to spindles). We repeated the peri-SWR histograms for multi-unit spikes (all spikes recorded by one tetrode). With this analysis we found stronger correlation of mPFC spikes with SWRs coupled to spindles (z-score 0.83 ± 1.34 compared to uncoupled, 0.09 ± 1.53; p=0.002). We also found stronger correlations with CA1 firing (55.81 ± 28.40, 50.40 ± 30.51; p&lt;10–3; Wilcoxon signed rank), and no significant difference in the thalamic tetrodes (−64 ± 1.42, 0.34 ± 0.95; p=0.17). Overall we find that, at the cell population level, both CA1 and mPFC increase their firing significantly during SWRs coupled to spindles, and that some mPFC cells may be more strongly modulated (up or down) with SWRs that are not coupled to spindles. This may reflect two different dynamics in mPFC, one driven by the spindle oscillation, which may engage cell population activity in coordination with CA1, and one, outside spindles, in which certain mPFC cells present larger changes in firing rate with SWRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Multi-region correlations after spatial exploration</title><p>To explore the possibility that awake behavior influences the multi-region coordination and thalamic contribution, we analyzed six sessions in which the rats (n = 3; two sessions from each rat) explored a radial maze (a 4-arm maze in one rat, 8-arm maze in the other two). The animals explored the maze freely for 30 mins, collecting pellet rewards at the end of each arm. In these sessions, we recorded an average of 52 min of sleep before and 78 min of sleep after spatial exploration to compare the non-REM sleep events and their correlation with single units before and after spatial experience. All the sessions showed an increase in the amplitude (peak-to-trough) and rate (per second) of SWRs during sleep after the maze exploration, as well as an increase in the amplitude of KCs (p=0.03, Wilcoxon signed rank), while spindles did not change significantly in number or amplitude (p&gt;0.5). As a control for the possibility that these features change over time, we used another set of four longer recording sessions from two of the rats, in which we had recorded continuously (no maze exploration) for a similar amount of time. We compared the SWRs amplitude and rate in the first half to the second half of these sessions, finding no difference in amplitude nor rate between the first and second half of the recording (p&gt;0.2); the total amount of sleep time was also not different in the first and second half of the recording, and not different from the pre-behavior or post-behavior sleep epochs in the other sessions with ‘run’ epochs (p&gt;0.1 in all cases).</p><p>Although the number and amplitude of detected spindle cycles did not change, there was a significant increase in CA1 SWR power within spindle cycles (p=0.03, Wilcoxon signed rank), consistent with the overall enhancement of SWR activity in CA1. To find out if there is selective activation of behavior-relevant CA1 cells during spindles, we classified CA1 units recorded in these sessions (n = 42) into those that were active (n = 27) or not (n = 15) when the animal was on the maze (based on visual inspection during manual spike sorting, i.e., unit clusters present both on the maze and during sleep, or only in subsequent sleep; examples from one tetrode in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>). These two groups of CA1 units did not differ in firing rate in the sleep post-behavior (calculated as the mean number of spikes over the total sleep time, or as the reciprocal of the mean inter-spike interval; p&gt;0.1, Mann-Whitney U-test). However, we found evidence that units that were active during maze exploration are more involved in SWR-spindle oscillations, as suggested by their higher firing rate and spiking at preferential spindle phases when they participate in SWRs nested in spindles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–b</xref> shows examples of the spindle temporal and phase organization of SWR spikes for two units active and two not active in run. Units that were active during maze exploration were more likely to be active within spindle cycles with high ripple power than units not active on the maze (p=0.009, Mann-Whitney U-test for the mean number of spikes in spindle cycles and p=0.039 for the percent of spindle cycles with unit spikes; examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref> and population distributions in 7 c). A two-way ANOVA to compare the effect of the ‘RUN or not in RUN’ factor and ripple power being ‘low or high’ on the % of cycles with spikes and the mean number of spikes/spindle cycle found both factors to have a significant effect on the spike metrics (p&lt;0.007 for ‘RUN compared to not in RUN’; p&lt;0.01 for ‘low versus high ripple power’), with no interaction between the two factors (p&gt;0.15). Pairwise comparisons found that the % of spindle cycles with CA1 unit spikes and the mean number of spikes were significantly higher for the combination of units ‘in RUN’ and cycles with high ripple power, compared to all other combinations (for the % of spindle cycles with CA1 spikes, p values were = 0.0002 when compared to units not in RUN and cycles with low ripple power; p=0.001 compared to RUN with low ripple power, and p=0.028 compared to non in RUN with high ripple power; p values for mean number of spikes were p=0.0002, 0.0007, 0.017 for the respective comparisons; multiple comparison Tukey-Kramer test).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>CA1 units active during ‘run’ show stronger activation in spindles with high ripple power, and firing at preferred spindle phases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peri-spindle trough histograms of the spikes of 2 CA1 units active during exploratory behavior (left) and 2 CA1 units recorded by the same tetrode that were only active during the sleep after maze exploration (right); top plots, spindles with high ripple power; bottom plots, spindles with low ripple power (sorted clusters for these units in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This is in contrast to an increase in the spindle correlations with SWRs and with CA1 units that were active on the maze. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c–d</xref>, shows examples of peri-spindle histograms of CA1 SWRs from the same session in which the thalamic unit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref> was recorded.

On average, we observed a trend for an increase in CA1 unit involvement in spindles after maze exploration. 60% of the CA1 units fired more spikes in high-ripple power spindle cycles after exploration compared to before (p=0.12), and fired in a larger proportion of high-ripple power spindle cycles (p=0.08; Wilcoxon signed rank; distributions for all the CA1 units in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>).

During exploratory behavior, CA1 cells with neighboring place fields become active as part of theta sequences, showing strong phase-locked activation in the theta band when the animal is running (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>); these units then tend to be co-active in resting periods that follow behavior, often during SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>).

It is possible that studying a larger sample of thalamic units, or after behavioral tasks with stronger memory demands, will reveal task-specific modulations between these three brain regions. Nonetheless, these results indicate that there is a spindle related organization of the spiking of task-relevant CA1 cells in spindle-nested SWRs. This could promote CA1-driven synaptic plasticity in mPFC networks during SWR reactivation during spindles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we report on the temporal correlation between cells in the limbic thalamus and the hallmark oscillations of non-REM sleep. We recorded single units and LFPs from functionally connected regions in the mPFC, CA1, and midline nuclei of the thalamus, including RE, MD and VM nuclei. We found that thalamic cells in these nuclei often reduce their firing and are more bursty with CA1 SWRs during non-REM sleep. Although firing in the thalamus becomes sparse, spikes are correlated with those of other thalamic cells and with LFP population events in mPFC and CA1. Specifically, thalamic units were phase-locked to the delta and spindle frequency bands recorded in deep layers of mPFC, and some thalamic cells showed a strong rebound of activity following the down-state of the mPFC slow oscillation (1–4 Hz). In addition, individual thalamic cells rarely contributed spikes in consecutive cycles of the spindle oscillation, but showed consistent co-activation with other thalamic cells within the period of spindle cycles. We also found that CA1 SWRs were strongly correlated with individual cycles of mPFC spindles, a correlation that was enhanced following spatial exploration. Furthermore, CA1 units that were active during behavior were more strongly activated during SWRs compared to units not active during behavior, and including during SWRs nested in spindle cycles, when they phase-locked to the underlying spindle oscillation. The evidence raises the hypothesis that sparse synchronicity in thalamic cell ensembles facilitates CA1-mPFC consolidation processes during non-REM sleep. The enhancement of ripple-spindle correlations after exploratory behavior and preferential engagement of recently active CA1 units in SWRs and their phase-locking to spindles, further suggest that individual spindle cycles provide time windows in which the interleaved activation of thalamic cells could promote incremental synaptic plasticity and facilitate the integration of recently acquired memory traces into neocortical networks.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Thalamic inhibition during hippocampal SWRs</title><p>The hypothesis of a multi-region interaction that stabilizes and integrates recently acquired episodic memory representations into neocortical schemas is supported by a stream of reports that point to the involvement of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Peyrache et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Latchoumane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Logothetis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mölle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref>). However, the investigation of the role of thalamocortical cells in these processes has lagged behind; evidence from unit recordings in naturally sleeping animals is still limited, and we have been lacking simultaneous recordings of LFPs and single units from these brain regions to study their dynamic modulation within the same animal. Current results point to a negative correlation between thalamic activity and CA1 SWRs, which is suggested by the decrease in fMRI bold signal in the thalamus of monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Logothetis et al., 2012</xref>) and the reduction of firing in MD and RE thalamic cells with SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lara-Vásquez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Our results extend these reports with the observation of an increase in thalamic bursting, which suggests that inhibition of the thalamus (as opposed to a decrease in excitatory input) explains the negative correlations between hippocampal and thalamic activity. One possibility is that the GABAergic TRN inhibits the thalamus near the time of SWRs. It is also possible that changes in neuromodulatory tone during non-REM sleep could lead to the hyperpolarization of cells in the dorsal thalamus in coordination with a change in CA1 state that facilitates SWR occurrence. The finding that cells in all the thalamic nuclei we recorded from were coordinated with CA1 and mPFC suggests a non-specific process that may be under neuromodulatory state control, without ruling out the involvement of the TRN. Because RE projects directly to CA1 and to the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Vertes, 2015</xref>), a change in firing mode in RE cells that project to hippocampus could further influence CA1 state transitions and SWRs occurrence.</p><p>Thalamic cells with an increase in firing with SWRs were rare in our sample (~15%). A recent study reported larger ratios, finding about 40% of MD multi-unit activity increase with SWRs that were coupled to spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, spindles were detected from EEG skull screws using criteria that included at least 0.5 s of duration; spindle-coupled SWRs were then classified as those SWRs that occurred between the onset and offset of spindles. Our LFP recordings in mPFC show that time windows longer than 0.5 s are likely to encompass one or more KCs, which are correlated with SWRs and often followed by a rebound in thalamic firing. In rodents, spindles defined by a duration criterion that overlaps with the delta oscillation are likely to reflect KC correlations (in addition to thalamo-SWRs correlations), and could increase the fraction of thalamic electrodes positively modulated with SWRs. The direct recording of LFP and KCs together with the analysis of shorter, within-spindle, timescales helps disambiguate the multi-oscillation correlations.</p><p>Computationally, higher order thalamic nuclei (which include those in the midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guillery and Sherman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Varela, 2014</xref>]) have been proposed to gate communication between neocortical areas. This ‘gate’ may be implemented through direct control of cortical synchronization and effective connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Saalmann and Kastner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Saalmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jaramillo et al., 2019</xref>), and through the regulation of the signal-to-noise ratio in resting states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). The broad decrease in thalamic activity at the time of potential memory reactivation in CA1, could facilitate effective information transfer between hippocampus and neocortex by reducing interference from the main input (thalamic) to neocortical areas. The signal-to-noise ratio may be particularly favorable to the transmission of novel traces between CA1-mPFC during spindles, due to the enhanced participation of recently active CA1 cells in SWRs. The spindle oscillation may provide a protected, phase-organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>), functional window for select memory consolidation computations, for example those required to extract statistical regularities and promote synaptic plasticity. We find that there is an increase in thalamic bursting near SWRs, a firing mode that is more effective at activating post-synaptic cortical cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Swadlow and Gusev, 2001</xref>). The function of thalamic bursting is not fully understood, but this thalamic response mode promotes better detectability of stimuli during wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lesica, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alitto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ortuño et al., 2014</xref>), and has been proposed to serve as a detection signal that can facilitate plasticity and learning in thalamocortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crick, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Varela and Ahmad, 2019a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional windows for multi-region coordination in non-REM sleep</title><p>The up-states of the non-REM slow and delta oscillations are thought to provide discrete windows of hundreds of milliseconds in which hippocampal-neocortical interactions can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Destexhe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Penagos et al., 2017</xref>). Hippocampal SWRs happen mainly during up-states and nested within the cycles of spindles, and spindles are themselves largest in amplitude following the transition from the down-to-up state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Peyrache et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>). Thalamic cells often showed a rebound in firing after mPFC KCs (LFP markers of the slow oscillation trough), suggesting that SWRs that occur during the down-to-up state transition overlap in time with an increase in thalamic drive. The thalamic cells with post-KC rebound could influence CA1-mPFC interactions by influencing the dynamics within the slow oscillation up-state. Several reports have shown that subsets of neocortical and TRN cells are preferentially active at the start or at the end of neocortical slow oscillation up-states, although it is unclear what drives this differential activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Puig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fanselow and Connors, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batterink et al., 2016</xref>). Our data raise the possibility that cells in the dorsal thalamus (which can drive neocortical and TRN cells) could provide excitation early on in the slow oscillation up-state and influence the ensuing dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Neske, 2015</xref>). Cells in the thalamic nuclei that we recorded from project densely to superficial layers of the neocortex, where they can influence deeper layers through their synapses on the dendritic tufts of pyramidal cells or via layer I interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rubio-Garrido et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>At finer time scales, individual SWRs events have durations that are strikingly similar to the period of the spindle oscillation (close to 100 ms), within the temporal range of spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchanan and Mellor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sadowski et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, SWR- or spindle-like stimulation patterns induce LTP respectively in CA3-CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sadowski et al., 2016</xref>) and in neocortical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rosanova and Ulrich, 2005</xref>). These cell ensemble and circuit level oscillations and the nesting of SWRs in the spindle cycles can therefore induce the long-term synaptic remodeling behind memory consolidation. Both synaptic enhancement and weakening have been suggested to occur in non-REM sleep and contribute to consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frey and Morris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Redondo and Morris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Puentes-Mestril et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Seibt and Frank, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Tononi and Cirelli, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Langille, 2019</xref>). Although our preparation does not address the synaptic level, our results demonstrate that CA1 cells that were active during exploratory behavior have enhanced association with SWRs and are phase-locked to the mPFC spindle oscillation. An enhanced activation of task-specific cells during SWR-spindles, in temporal windows that can promote synaptic plasticity, may explain the increase in memory following spindle-like stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Latchoumane et al., 2017</xref>), and suggests that spindle oscillations provide windows for synaptic reorganization of recently acquired memories. We observed an increase in spindle-CA1 correlations after behavioral experience even in the absence of significant changes of spindle-thalamic correlations. It is possible that behavioral tasks with stronger memory demands would reveal a modulation of thalamic cells in addition to the observed CA1 modulation. Still, the differential enhancement of CA1-mPFC relative to thalamo-mPFC correlations could contribute to differential synaptic plasticity changes in these two pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Puentes-Mestril et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Tononi and Cirelli, 2020</xref>). Spindles could provide a thalamocortical phase-organizing mechanism for communication between CA1 and mPFC that could lead to modification of CA1-mPFC synapses following behavioral tagging. Similar phase-specific communication mechanisms have been proposed during awake behavior, in which the phase of the theta rhythm may help organize long-range and pathway specific exchange between hippocampus and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hasselmo, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The results suggest that the dynamics of thalamic cell activation in non-REM results from a complex interaction between spindles, SWRs, KCs and previous experience.

We find that pairs of thalamic cells are consistently phase-locked to the mPFC LFP within the period of spindle oscillations, suggesting that individual spindle cycles group and organize the activation of different thalamocortical ensembles at consistent phase lags. The repeated activation of thalamic cell ensembles through non-REM sleep could promote spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. An intriguing hypothesis is that the sparse firing at the single-cell level and phase-locked firing of groups of cells could lead to the interleaved excitation of different sets of thalamocortical synapses in subsequent spindle cycles, and in coordination with the reactivation of recently active CA1 place cells. The activation of varying combinations of thalamocortical synapses with CA1 SWRs that engage recently active cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) may promote a broad range of synaptic associations at the neocortical level, make the neocortical trace more robust to noise, and facilitate generalization. Critically, the sparse activation could prevent plasticity saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Watt and Desai, 2010</xref>) and contribute to gradual synaptic changes that would allow for extended computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Penagos et al., 2017</xref>) and facilitate continuous learning. One of the challenges in the development of artificial neural networks, has been to overcome the catastrophic interference that can occur during sequential training.

Although it has no direct projections to CA1, the MD nucleus also contributes to working memory possibly through its direct projections to mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolkan et al., 2017</xref>). These studies provide key evidence to understand the role of higher order thalamic regions in active cognitive behavior. Recordings in RE suggest that, similar to its coordinating role in wakefulness, it may contribute to coupling oscillatory activity between mPFC and CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferraris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hauer et al., 2019</xref>). Our results extend these findings and point to spindle-specific modulation of cells in RE and other limbic nuclei of the thalamus as a function of CA1 ripple activity. The observed modulations in firing in higher order thalamic nuclei could enhance synaptic plasticity and memory. In addition, a few studies point to the role of RE in extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ramanathan and Maren, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Xu and Südhof, 2013</xref>); more generally, sleep can both increase and decrease synaptic strength (and recent evidence points to a role of sleep oscillations in forgetting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Langille, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2019</xref>]). Dynamic engagement in spindle oscillations could control which cell populations undergo up- or downregulation of synaptic strength.</p><p>In certain states, such as anesthesia or epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McCormick and Huguenard, 1992</xref>), cells in the thalamus may fire at the spindle population rhythm, and sparse synchronicity in the thalamus might be a distinguishing feature of normal resting states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akeju et al., 2018</xref>). The disruption of thalamocortical oscillations has been proposed as a pathophysiological model for several neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Llinás et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fogerson and Huguenard, 2016</xref>). Oscillatory stimulation (mimicking the abnormally increased delta rhythm in schizophrenia) of thalamic projections to CA1 disrupts working memory in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duan et al., 2015</xref>), and spindle irregularities (reduced or abnormally enhanced spindles) have been observed in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gruber and Wise, 2016</xref>), in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wamsley et al., 2012</xref>), and in absence epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lüttjohann and Pape, 2019</xref>). A careful balance in the excitatory and inhibitory thalamic networks is required to generate the appropriate population level synchronicity and function. Studying spindle dynamics at the cellular and population level will thus be critical to understand the pathophysiology behind these disorders, and to design therapeutic interventions that preserve normal synchronicity in the thalamus as well as the multi-region coordination that underlies cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Manoach et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Memory consolidation promotes the stabilization and incorporation of memory traces initially stored in the hippocampus into neocortical networks, contributing to the development and training of neocortical models that allow adaptive behavior. Recording from naturally sleeping rats, we present results that suggest that the individual cycles of the spindle oscillation provide a key processing time window that combines and organizes the activation of recently active CA1 cell ensembles, as well as subsets of cells in thalamocortical networks. The rebound activation of thalamic cells following down-states could facilitate up-state dynamics. As the cycle of the slow oscillation progresses, the enhancement of spindle-CA1 activity relative to spindle-thalamic activity following spatial experience could bias transmission in CA1-mPFC compared to thalamo-mPFC pathways. Lastly, the sparse and interleaved activation of groups of thalamic cells during spindles may provide a critical mechanism to facilitate the continuous integration of novel hippocampal memories into neocortical schemas for generalization and lifelong learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We used eight male Long-Evans rats (400–500 g) in the experiments reported here (13 additional animals were implanted with multi-electrode arrays as part of the same project, but did not fulfil the criteria for inclusion in the current report due to lack of clear histological identification of electrode location in thalamus, or lack of electrophysiological signals in all three brain regions under study). Animals were housed individually, provided with food and water ad libitum, and monitored in a temperature-controlled room with a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on/off at 7:00 am/7:00 pm). These experiments were approved by the Committee on Animal Care at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and conform to US National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrode arrays, surgical implantation and electrophysiology recordings</title><p>Multielectrode arrays (microdrives) with up to 21 nichrome wire tetrodes, 18 tetrodes for recording and three references, one per brain region (individual tetrode wires were 12.5 µm in diameter). The microdrives were prepared according to standard procedures in the laboratory, and the base was modified from previous designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kloosterman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>) to target the three regions of interest. A diagram of a typical electrode configuration is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>. The tetrodes spanned the following coordinates from Bregma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Paxinos and Watson, 1986</xref>): Anterior 3.65 mm to 2.4 mm for mPFC, posterior 1.4 to 3.2 mm for the thalamus, and P3.1 to 4.4 mm for dorsal CA1. The arrays for mPFC and thalamus were positioned at 16 degrees from the vertical axis to prevent damage to the sagittal sinus. Sterile surgery procedures were performed for chronic microdrive implantation; anesthesia was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of a solution of ketamine (25 mg/kg), xylazine (3 mg/kg) and atropine (0.027 mg/kg), and maintained with 1–2% inhaled isoflurane. Up to eight bone screws were secured to the skull for support; three craniotomies were drilled over the target coordinates and the dura mater membrane was removed to allow for tetrode penetration. During surgery, the most anterior thalamic electrode was placed above P1.4 mm and lateral 1.8 mm, and the linear thalamic array was aligned parallel to the sagittal suture; this positioned the rest of the electrodes over their corresponding craniotomies. The implant was secured to the skull with dental cement after surrounding the exposed craniotomies and tetrodes with silicon grease to keep them from being fixed by the cement. Animals were preemptively injected with analgesics (Buprenorphine, 0.5–1 mg/kg, subcutaneous), and monitored by the experimenter and veterinarian staff for 3 days post-surgery.</p><p>The tetrodes were gradually advanced to the target depths over the course of 1.5–2 weeks before recordings started; the slow advancement of electrodes facilitated stable unit and local field potential (LFP) recordings over several hours. Once the target depth was reached, recordings were performed if units were present, and electrodes were lowered further in non-recording sessions to search for new units and allow for electrode drift before the next recording session. Recording sessions typically lasted at least 3 hr, during which the animal was in a quiet squared enclosure of about 50 × 50 cms, were they cycled through several bouts of sleep and wakefulness. Spikes were acquired at 32 kHz after the signal from any of the tetrode channels crossed a preset threshold. Individual units were isolated by manual clustering on peak spike waveform amplitudes across all channels using custom spike sorting software (Xclust; M.A.W.; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wilsonlab/mwsoft64/tree/master/src/xclust">https://github.com/wilsonlab/mwsoft64/tree/master/src/xclust</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Xclust, 2013</xref>). LFPs were sampled at 600 Hz after anti-aliasing filtering and downsampling from up to 3.125 kHz. Two infrared LEDs (sampled at 30 Hz) attached to the headstages of the acquisition system (Neuralynx) were used to track the rat’s position and estimate velocity. Part of this data set has been made available through the Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience data sharing website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Varela and Wilson, 2019b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Spatial exploration in the radial maze</title><p>In preparation for the six behavioral sessions, three of the implanted rats were food restricted for at least 5 days before behavior started. In each session, rats explored a radial maze (with four arms for one rat and eight arms for the other two rats) that was surrounded by consistent visual cues on the walls of the room; rats retrieved one 45 mg sucrose pellet every time the animal reached the end of the arm (provided by the experimenter). The behavioral exploration (two sessions per animal) lasted 30 min, and the recordings included at least 30 min of sleep pre- and post-behavior. All the rats had less than 7 days of experience exploring the maze at the time of these recording sessions. For one of the rats, the two behavioral sessions were days 1 and 2 of exploration (no previous maze experience before day 1), for rat 2, they were days 2 and 4, and for the last rat they were days 3 and 6. Therefore, all the recordings were performed during early experience in the mazes, when memory traces are expected to be dependent on the hippocampus for retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Varela et al., 2016</xref>). We did not observe differences between the first and second session in each rat, and the data were pooled together.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Selection of electrodes and sessions for analyses</title><p>Sessions were selected based on having at least one unit in two of the three regions of interest, clear sleep events (KCs, spindles, SWRs) in the neocortical and hippocampal LFPs, and clear histological confirmation of thalamic tetrode location. While CA1 electrode location can be confirmed via electrophysiological LFP features alone, we find that LFP signals alone do not reliably allow specific localization within the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus and histological confirmation is necessary. For arrays with independently moving tetrodes, this requires the identification of electrode lesions for all the tetrodes in the array to prevent ambiguity when matching signals to electrode position. Thus, for these experiments we only include data from rats in which we successfully confirmed the histological location of all implanted thalamic (and mPFC) tetrodes, and CA1 location was confirmed electrophysiologically. The location of electrodes used for analyses is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>. To prevent repeated counts of the same units across sessions, unit analyses include only units for which 1) the tetrode had been moved from the previous recording session at least 80 µm or 2) the amplitude projections used for spike sorting had different profiles compared to the preceding recorded session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>LFP state and event detection</title><p>For each rat, we selected one wire from one tetrode with clear sleep events (determined by visual inspection) for LFP analyses (one tetrode per brain region). To detect reference events for analyses, the three LFPs were filtered (with zero-phase distortion) in the delta (1–4 Hz), spindle (6–14 Hz), and ripple (100–275 Hz) bands using a band-pass finite impulse response filter designed with a blackman window and filter order six times the sampling rate/bandwidth ratio.</p><p>We detected reference events during states in which the power of both the delta, in the mPFC LFP, and ripple bands, in CA1, were above the mean for the session for at least two minutes; animal velocity and behavior during these time periods confirmed that the animal was immobile during detected offline states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These electrophysiological and behavioral traits are defining features of non-REM sleep. The position information to calculate velocity was obtained from the LEDs attached to the headstages; gaps in the position information (due to occlusion of the LEDs) shorter than 300 ms were linearly interpolated using nearby values; gaps longer than 300 ms were not considered for further analysis. The space derivative was used to calculate velocity and then smoothed (Gaussian kernel, 250 ms standard deviation) and linearly interpolated to up-sample and match the 600 Hz of the LFP.</p><p>Non-REM periods detected with these combined criteria of high delta and SWR power, showed large transient deflections in the mPFC LFP, or K-complexes (KCs). To detect KCs, we first rectified the filtered (1–4 Hz) LFP (positive values were made equal to 0), the resulting trace was squared and KCs detected as local maxima, when the amplitude was above the mean plus four standard deviations (mean and standard deviation calculated from the LFP in quiet states). We detected spindle troughs as local minima, three standard deviations below the mean of the spindle-band filtered LFP (6–14 Hz). The SWR detection algorithm detected times when the squared, filtered LFP (100–275 Hz) had an amplitude above the mean plus three standard deviations for at least 20 ms (mean and standard deviation calculated for the LFP when the animal was quiet). If two SWRs were closer than 20 ms they were considered a single ripple event. The SWR timestamp was selected as the time with the largest absolute value in the ripple filtered LFP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Correlation quantifications: peri-event histograms and generalized linear model</title><p>We used peri-event histograms (PETHs) to quantify the temporal association between sleep events (trough of KCs, spindles, peak of ripples) and the unit activity in each brain region. To compare across sessions and animals, we quantified the change (in units of standard deviation) of the event-triggered average with respect to a null distribution calculated through a permutation test. Specifically, we first calculated the average peri-KC, peri-spindle and peri-SWR histogram across detected events in the recording session (bin 15 ms, followed by smoothing with a Gaussian kernel with 15 ms standard deviation). All the event timestamps were then shifted by a number between 1.5 and 2.5 s (randomly chosen with uniform probability) to offset the event times with respect to the local spikes, while preserving the inter-event time intervals. The average PETH (15 ms bins, Gaussian smoothed) was calculated from the shifted event timestamps, and this procedure was repeated 100 times to generate a distribution of expected PETHs under the null hypothesis of no correlation between sleep events and local activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the relation between thalamic firing and SWR rate more precisely, we implemented generalized linear models (GLM) of CA1 spikes and SWRs as a function of thalamic spikes. Multi-unit spikes from CA1 and the thalamus, and CA1 SWRs, were binned through the non-REM sleep periods in each session (bin 250 ms). A GLM was fit in matlab (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) to estimate the log of counts of spikes or SWRs in CA1 (µ) as a linear function of the spikes in the thalamus (X), assuming a Poisson distribution.

We estimated the instantaneous phase using the Hilbert transform of the mPFC LFP filtered in the delta and spindle bands. Because asymmetry in the LFP shape can bias the phase distributions, the distribution of phases at the time of spikes or SWRs was normalized by the distribution of phases for the full delta or spindle-filtered LFP during non-REM sleep. After normalization, we used the Rayleigh test to determine if the angular phase at the spikes or LFP events timestamps were significantly different from a uniform distribution. A fit to the Von Misses distribution was then used to estimate the mean vector direction (mean preferred phase), and the degree of phase-locking from the concentration parameter <italic>kappa</italic>. The concentration parameter is a reciprocal measure of dispersion and increases as the density of values near the mean of the distribution increases. We also estimated phase based on linear interpolation between LFP peaks and troughs (arbitrarily assigned –π and π values; equivalent to the ‘extrema’ method in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>); we did not find differences in the phase-locking based on either method and the results are reported for phase estimates based on the Hilbert transform.</p><p>Other statistical comparisons were made using non-parametric tests, the Mann-Whitney U-test for unpaired data, and the Wilcoxon signed ranked test for paired data (reported in the text for each specific analysis).

The manuscript includes two major observations; (1) Spikes of thalamic neurons are phase-locked to cortical delta and spindle oscillations and are also modulated by hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs); and (2) CA1 units that were active in preceding behaviors are also more active during cortical spindles that are associated with high SWR power. Based on these observations, the authors conclude that cortical spindles provide the time window for organizing the activity of recently active CA1 ensembles as well as sparse thalamocortical ensembles. This organized activity is hypothesized to contribute to the consolidation of recently acquired memory traces in the neocortex. Although no evidence of memory consolidation is provided in the manuscript, the authors provide several lines of analysis to support the hypothesis. To obtain these results, the authors implanted up to 21 tetrodes in the three regions to record from the three regions simultaneously, which is technically challenging and impressive.</p><p>However, reviewers were unconvinced that the conclusions were well supported by the results as presently analyzed. Reviewers were particularly concerned about the low number of cells and lack of clarity about where cells were recorded. Still, after a consultation session, reviewers agreed that the authors could potentially deal with these concerns without collecting new data. It should be noted, however, that if some of the additional analyses fail to support the authors' conclusions, it may become necessary for the authors to acquire more data or to change the paper's conclusions. If this occurs, the authors may choose to withdraw the paper and resubmit at a later time, considering that <italic>eLife</italic> typically only allows a two month period for revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Hippocampal-cortical interactions during non-REM sleep have been previously studied by multiple labs, including the senior author's lab. Therefore, the most novel part of this study was viewed as the inclusion of recordings from the nucleus reuniens. However, only 23 units were recorded from reuniens (24 more units were recorded in other thalamic regions, such as mediodorsal, ventromedial, centromedial, etc. which could have distinct functions in memory). Reviewers understand that it is highly challenging to record single units from these deep brain regions, but still they were unconvinced that such a small number of recordings is sufficient to support the conclusions as written (in particular, Figures 4, 6, 10). Reviewers also agreed that it is odd to analyze all limbic thalamus neurons together when it is known that the different nuclei have different projections, inputs, and behavioral correlates. The authors should emphasize this point more strongly in the manuscript and discuss how coupling to oscillations within this circuit relates to the individual contributions of each thalamic nucleus to memory. Moreover, the analysis on thalamic neuron pairs is based on a very small sample size (n = 12 pairs). Only 6 pairs displayed co-activation and, again, it is unclear from which thalamic nucleus/nuclei these neurons were recorded. Recordings from the same or different thalamic nuclei could lead to different interpretations of coordination within or across brain regions.</p><p>2) In a previous study by Peyrache et al., 2011, it was shown that mPFC units are less responsive to SWRs during spindles compared to SWRs outside spindles, and it is unclear how to reconcile these findings with the conclusion of this manuscript that SWR-coupled spindles act as an organizer of memory consolidation. As the authors recorded from neurons in mPFC, it was suggested to check how mPFC units respond to SWRs within and outside spindles and to thoroughly discuss how these results relate to this earlier study.</p><p>3) In Figure 6, the authors claimed sparse and consistent activation of thalamic spikes, because of lack of rhythmicity in individual thalamic units in spite of clear rhythmicity in MUA. However it is possible that this is simply due to low-firing rates of individual neurons (e.g. Barry et al., Nature, 2012). Furthermore, in Supplemental Figure 5, some neurons appear to exhibit rhythmic firing. As this result forms one of the main conclusions of the manuscript, the authors should test the idea more carefully. For example, one possibility would be to implement a quantitative analysis of the degree of rhythmic firing by using curve fitting method in autocorrelation plots for individual cells (e.g. Royer et al., 2010; Brandon et al., 2013). Also, to correct the influence of the spike number, the autocorrelation of MUA should be analyzed with a reduced number of spikes, so that the number of spikes in autocorrelation plots is the same between groups. Furthermore, it would be interesting to examine whether spike cross-correlations of pairs of neurons differ within and outside spindles, to assess if the co-activity patterns are dynamic or hardwired.</p><p>4) In Figure 8, the authors claimed that the degree of rate modulation of thalamic cells during spindles increased when associated SWRs had higher power. However, is there any relationship between SWR power and spindle power? A concern was raised that the observed effect of SWR power could be an indirect effect of associated spindle power modulation. For example, high-power spindles can be detected more easily at precise timing, and consequently, the rate modulation may be observed more clearly. Also, although an enhanced coupling between thalamic neurons and high-ripple-power spindles (compared to low-ripple-power spindles) was reported in Figure 8, there was no change in thalamic neuron-SWR coupling with or without the presence of spindles, in contrast with a recent finding (Yang, Logothetis and Eschenko, 2019). Does the activity of these thalamic neurons correlate with spindle power? It is not clear how these results can be interpreted in the existing framework of the CA1-mPFC-thalamus network. Similarly, in Figure 9C, the authors should carefully check the relationship between SWR power and spindle power, and in Figure 9D, should examine the change of SWR power within and outside of spindles, to exclude the possibility of indirect influences on the main conclusions.</p><p>5) In Figure 9D, Rayleigh's z were assessed between neurons with different firing rates. However, the Rayleigh test is sensitive to the number of spikes (e.g. Sirota et al., 2008), and thus the authors should confirm the main conclusions with subsampled spikes such that the numbers of spikes are the same between groups.</p><p>6) The authors claim that there's an &quot;increase in the amplitude (peak-to-trough) and rate (per second) of SWRs during sleep after the maze exploration&quot;. Yet, appropriate statistics to support this claim were not presented. Reviewers were not convinced that there would be a significant increase in SWR amplitude or rate when compared to data from proper control experiments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for re-submitting your article &quot;mPFC spindle cycles organize sparse thalamic activation and recently active CA1 cells during non-REM sleep&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been re-reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Although many of the concerns raised in the initial review have been addressed, some of the major issues raised by the reviewers were not adequately addressed yet. The remaining concerns are detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the reviewers' major concern on the small number of thalamic units, the authors provided only justification of the small unit number, but not additional support of the main conclusions. The reviewers' concern was whether the main conclusions can be supported by the authors' data with a limited number of units, because some of their claims are too strong based on the presented data. For example, in the Abstract, the authors mentioned that &quot;Thalamic units…fired at consistent lags with other thalamic units&quot;. But from their data, convincing evidence of consistent time lags of thalamic firing in the cross-correlation analysis (only one or two examples may show a &quot;lag&quot; out of 12 pairs) is still lacking.</p><p>2) Based on the reviewers' concern on their conclusion of lack of rhythmicity in individual thalamic units, the authors provided additional analyses. However, first, the subsampling procedure performed in this revision is not satisfactory, as the spike number of MUA (12000 or 6700) is still far larger than the typical spike number of units (2000 or less?). The reviewers originally suggested to equalize the spike number between groups, which has not been performed. The authors actually confirmed that &quot;a smaller sample of spikes can reveal variations&quot;, and the subsampling procedure is meant to assess the impact of such variation due to a small sample number on the statistical test (e.g. Figure 4—figure supplement 1F).</p><p>In addition, the new analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F) indicates that many units indeed fire at the rhythm of spindle oscillations, while other units fire at longer intervals. I think that this result contradicts the authors' conclusion of &quot;the lack of rhythmicity in individual thalamic units&quot;.</p><p>On the other hand, if there is an organized (grouped) sequential reactivation as the authors suggested, the cross-correlograms should reveal both co-activation and suppression at specific intervals of the spindle cycles, which did not appear in the results. Therefore, the results only suggest that thalamic neurons fire at the spindle rhythm, but not necessarily at every spindle cycle (similar to theta-cycle-skipping cells). However, these results alone do not support organized coactivation nor sequential activation as described in the authors' claims as follows: &quot;different groups of thalamic units contribute to activity in different spindle cycles&quot; (subsection Sparse thalamic firing and consistent activation of cell pairs during spindles”); &quot;individual spindle cycles group and organize the sequential activation of thalamocortical ensembles&quot; (subsection “Sparse firing of thalamic cells during spindles and its role in systems memory consolidation”); and &quot;the sparse firing at the single-cell level will allow for the interleaved excitation of different sets of thalamocortical synapses in subsequent spindle cycles&quot; (subsection “Sparse firing of thalamic cells during spindles and its role in systems memory consolidation”).</p><p>3) In the original review, the reviewers did not ask which factor, either the spindle or ripple power, contributes to the stronger modulation of thalamic activity, but the question was whether the grouping into high and low ripple power (as in the main figures) may have associated confound of spindle power differences (e.g. one group may have a higher spindle power than the other). The authors only provided the analyses in which one variable was handled independently, but they should take into account interactions between two variables, ripple and spindle power. For example, one can use a regression model of the thalamic firing modulation with both spindle and ripple power, to assess the contribution of each factor.</p><p>4) In the original review, the question was not whether the mean of phase distributions changed or not by subsampling, but rather that Rayleigh's z values should be compared with the same number of spikes between groups (e.g. in their new Figure 7D).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48881.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Hippocampal-cortical interactions during non-REM sleep have been previously studied by multiple labs, including the senior author's lab.

While the study of specific thalamic nuclei is important, given the challenges of recording units from small thalamic nuclei in behaving rodents and simultaneously with other brain regions, we have focused here on studying shared properties as they relate to non-REM sleep. All of the nuclei we recorded are higher order thalamic nuclei, bidirectionally connected with frontal cortical areas, regulated by similar sleep-dependent neuromodulatory systems, and they share circuit, physiological and molecular properties (Varela et al., 2014; Varela, 2014; Guillery and Sherman, 2001; Phillips et al., 2019). Likewise, although reuniens has the most well-studied functional correlations with hippocampus (Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019), the hippocampus projects to rostral parts of the thalamic reticular nucleus and to medial prefrontal cortex (Cavdar et al., 2008; Zikopoulos and Barbas, 2008; Swanson, 1981), which could indirectly influence nuclei other than reuniens. In other words, the limbic and higher order thalamic nuclei are functionally related to cortical and hippocampal regions and may share important principles that motivate their study as a group. Our results suggest that at least some of the thalamic correlates of non-REM sleep can be observed across limbic thalamic nuclei. Future experiments that investigate the contributions of specific nuclei can be more interpretable in the context of the data reported in this paper.</p><p>Regarding the yield of units in thalamus, several technical factors limit the single cell yield in this multi-site preparation; as mentioned by the reviewers, targeting small deep regions like the thalamus in conjunction with distant but functionally connected regions (mPFC, CA1) is challenging. We aimed to work only with data from rats in which the electrode final location in the brain, and the track traversed during the recordings were unambiguously identified in histological sections, reported in the raw pictures of brain sections, in the supplementary material (approximately 1 in every 3 implanted rats met this criterion and had sufficient single cell and LFP data during sleep to be included in the study). In all rats, we found that the amplitude of spikes from units in the thalamus was small compared to the background spike activity, and that the unit yield was much lower compared to cortex and hippocampus (often only 1 or 2 units could be recorded in a session in the tetrodes implanted in the thalamus). Another limitation is that, in order to gather at least one hour of natural sleep, it is sometimes necessary to record for several hours (even in the light phase), and units that were not stable through the duration of sleep epochs (evaluated during manual spike sorting) were not used for analysis.</p><p>We believe that the low yield of units does not diminish the data or results, as we aimed to record the highest number of quality units (given the experimental constraints above). There are other examples in the thalamic literature with similar yields (e.g., Gardner, Hughes and Jones, 2013). Although new high-density recording probes (e.g., neuropixels) increase the unit yield in different brain regions, experiments that target functionally related and anatomically distant structures are still a challenge for these new technologies. As the techniques to increase unit yield continue to improve, our results provide valuable guidance regarding the functions of a thalamo-mPFC-CA1 network that is receiving increasing attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In a previous study by Peyrache et al., 2011, it was shown that mPFC units are less responsive to SWRs during spindles compared to SWRs outside spindles, and it is unclear how to reconcile these findings with the conclusion of this manuscript that SWR-coupled spindles act as an organizer of memory consolidation. As the authors recorded from neurons in mPFC, it was suggested to check how mPFC units respond to SWRs within and outside spindles and to thoroughly discuss how these results relate to this earlier study.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional analyses on the units and multi-unit spike data recorded from mPFC. We calculated a peri-SWR histogram of mPFC unit activity with the same parameters used in Peyrache et al., 2011 (2 ms bins in a window of 400 ms before and after SWRs), and separated the peri-SWR histogram based on ripples that occurred within or outside spindle cycles and using the same sample size (same number of coupled and uncoupled SWRs). We z-scored the resulting histograms to the same shuffled distribution (after randomizing all SWR timestamps). The resulting histograms for the mPFC units are shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 3A; the left plot in the top row shows the peri-SWR histogram calculated for SWRs uncoupled to spindles (each row is one unit), and the right plot for coupled SWRs (rows in the same order as in panel A; color code is zscore). Following the quantifications in Peyrache et al., 2011, we calculated the mean z-score in the -40 to 40 ms around SWRs; we found that on average there was no significant difference for the population of mPFC units between SWRs coupled or uncoupled to spindles (z-score 0.17 ± 1.26 for coupled-SWRs and 0.24 ± 0.86; p = 0.46, Wilcoxon signed rank). Our sample of mPFC units contained units that increased and units that decreased their firing near SWRs (left side plot on Figure 6—figure supplement 3A-iv, includes the peri-SWR histograms of mPFC unit spikes for all SWRs using Peyrache et al., 2011 parameters). Interestingly, the units with the strongest correlation calculated with all SWRs, showed differential firing for SWRs coupled or uncoupled to spindles, such that their firing decreased with SWRs coupled to spindles (units with the strongest negative correlation also had the strongest modulation with SWRs uncoupled to spindles). Although these observations are based on a low number of units, it is possible that some mPFC units have the strongest firing rate modulation (up or down) during SWRs that are not coupled to spindles (as observed by Peyrache et al., 2011).</p><p>To assess the mPFC-SWR association at the multi-cell level, we repeated the peri-SWR histograms for multi-unit spikes (all spikes recorded by one tetrode). With this analysis we found stronger correlation of mPFC spikes with SWRs coupled to spindles (z-score 0.83 ± 1.34 compared to uncoupled, 0.09 ± 1.53; p = 0.002). We also found stronger correlations with CA1 firing (55.81 ± 28.40, 50.40 ± 30.51; p &lt; 10<sup>-3</sup>; Wilcoxon signed rank), and no significant difference in the thalamic tetrodes (-64 ± 1.42, 0.34 ± 0.95; p = 0.17). Overall we find that, at the cell population level, both CA1 and mPFC increase their firing significantly during SWRs coupled to spindles, and that certain mPFC cells maybe more strongly modulated (up or down) during SWRs that are not coupled to spindles. This may reflect two different dynamics in mPFC, one driven by the spindle oscillation, which may engage cell population activity in coordination with CA1, and one, outside spindles, which is dominated by cell specific modulation during non-coupled SWRs. Experiments that record large populations of mPFC cells will provide the best design to test this hypothesis.</p><p>These results are summarized in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 6, the authors claimed sparse and consistent activation of thalamic spikes, because of lack of rhythmicity in individual thalamic units in spite of clear rhythmicity in MUA. However it is possible that this is simply due to low-firing rates of individual neurons (e.g. Barry et al., Nature, 2012). Furthermore, in Supplemental Figure 5, some neurons appear to exhibit rhythmic firing. As this result forms one of the main conclusions of the manuscript, the authors should test the idea more carefully. For example, one possibility would be to implement a quantitative analysis of the degree of rhythmic firing by using curve fitting method in autocorrelation plots for individual cells (e.g. Royer et al., 2010; Brandon et al., 2013). Also, to correct the influence of the spike number, the autocorrelation of MUA should be analyzed with a reduced number of spikes, so that the number of spikes in autocorrelation plots is the same between groups. Furthermore, it would be interesting to examine whether spike cross-correlations of pairs of neurons differ within and outside spindles, to assess if the co-activity patterns are dynamic or hardwired.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional analyses to more thoroughly investigate the possibility of rhythmic firing in thalamic units and multi-unit spikes. To address the effect of different numbers of spikes on the autocorrelations, we re-calculated the autocorrelations of multi-unit activity (MUA) with a subset of the spikes (12000 spikes, based on the median number of unit spikes) and observed similar autocorrelations as when using all the spikes. In Figure 4—figure supplement 1 we plotted the multi-unit autocorrelations with all spikes (panel A; each color one session), and the average of autocorrelations calculated in blocks of 12,000 sleep spikes through the session (panel B), as well as the autocorrelations of units (panel C; each color one unit). Panels D and E display an example from one session, the autocorrelation of the MUA spikes is shown first for all spikes (D left histogram); the autocorrelations for each block of 12,000 spikes through the recording session are shown in panel Di, while Dii displays autocorrelations in blocks of 6700 spikes –the number of spikes produced during sleep by a thalamic unit recorded by the same electrode in the same session-. The autocorrelation of the thalamic unit is shown in E for all the spikes, and in blocks of 2,000 spikes (E, bottom plot). Although using a smaller sample of spikes can reveal variations in the strength of the autocorrelations in both the multi-unit and unit, the shape of the autocorrelation was not affected by sampling.</p><p>To quantify the autocorrelations, we tried fitting the autocorrelation curves first with models such as those used by Royer et al., 2010 and Brandon et al., 2013. These models used sine and cosine functions to capture the oscillatory activity of hippocampal neurons during hippocampal theta (they also used decaying exponentials to account for the time course of the autocorrelation at short and longer lags). These models were not a good fit to our thalamic data (an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, for one thalamic unit fitted using the same model as in Brandon et al., 2013), and we opted to use spline interpolation to smooth the autocorrelation curves before quantification (blue thick curves in the autocorrelation histograms of Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We calculated the time at the autocorrelation maximum (after the minimum that follows lag 0) and plotted the distribution for MUA and unit spikes (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F). Although not significantly different between units and MUA, we found that the peak of the MUA autocorrelation occurs on average at 88.00 ± 62.58 ms (91.60 ± 59.49 ms, when using a fraction of the spikes), whereas the interval is longer for the units, 160.65 ± 118.07 ms, suggesting faster firing for MUA compared to the units (p = 0.07, Kruskal-Wallis). We further inspected all unit autocorrelations and plotted the only single unit that had a strong indication of oscillatory activity (Figure 4—figure supplement 1H); the peak of the autocorrelation plot for this unit occurs at 140 ms, or ~7 Hz, on the lowest range of the spindle band. Figure 4—figure supplement 1G, shows the autocorrelation of units in which the maximum autocorrelation value falls within the lags that correspond to the spindle band (6-14 Hz); although these units (n = 7 or 22.6 % of the sample) have their strongest autocorrelation within the spindle band, their values were low (0.055 ± 0.013) and not different from other units (p = 0.31).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Example of cosine fit (as in Brandon et al., 2013) to the autocorrelation of a thalamic unit.

However, is there any relationship between SWR power and spindle power? A concern was raised that the observed effect of SWR power could be an indirect effect of associated spindle power modulation. For example, high-power spindles can be detected more easily at precise timing, and consequently, the rate modulation may be observed more clearly. Also, although an enhanced coupling between thalamic neurons and high-ripple-power spindles (compared to low-ripple-power spindles) was reported in Figure 8, there was no change in thalamic neuron-SWR coupling with or without the presence of spindles, in contrast with a recent finding (Yang, Logothetis and Eschenko 2019). Does the activity of these thalamic neurons correlate with spindle power? It is not clear how these results can be interpreted in the existing framework of the CA1-mPFC-thalamus network. Similarly, in Figure 9C, the authors should carefully check the relationship between SWR power and spindle power, and in Figure 9D, should examine the change of SWR power within and outside of spindles, to exclude the possibility of indirect influences on the main conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Spindle and ripple power are indeed associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> shows the covariance of the ripple-filtered CA1 LFP and spindle-filtered prefrontal LFP in all sessions). To disentangle the modulation of thalamic activity due to increased ripple power and to increased spindle amplitude associated with ripple power, we compared the peri-spindle cycle modulation index of thalamic spikes for spindle cycles classified based on amplitude or on ripple power (above or below the median). The modulation index values were similar in spindles classified based on median amplitude or ripple power (p &gt; 0.3, Wilcoxon signed rank), but increased significantly from low to high amplitude spindles (p = 0.005) compared to low to high ripple power spindles (p = 0.25), suggesting a stronger modulation by spindle amplitude compared to ripple power, as expected from the role of thalamic cells in spindle generation (modulation index distribution for the population in Figure 6D). If there is a functional relation with spindle amplitude or ripple power, spindles in the upper quartiles should lead to stronger modulation. We then calculated the fraction of thalamic units in which the increase in modulation in spindles within the upper quartile was higher than the increase observed with the median classification. The increase in modulation index was higher in the upper quartile of spindle amplitude in 29 % of thalamic units and with ripple power in 22.6 % units. The modulation values were higher for spindle amplitude compared to ripple power and positively correlated (average of 1.16 ± 0.57 in the upper quartile of spindle amplitude compared to 0.60 ± 0.26 in the upper quartile of ripple power; p = 0.04, Mann-Whitney); units with stronger modulation with spindle power had higher values of ripple modulation (Spearman coefficient &gt; 0.7; p &lt; 0.04). For spindle amplitude, the lower modulation values also became lower with the quartile classification, leading to a wider spread of the distribution (when spindles were classified based on quartiles compared to median; p = 0.04; F-test) which was not the case with ripple power (p = 0.36; F-test; Figure 6E). These results suggest that the strongest firing modulations in thalamic cells are related to the spindle oscillation, and that ripples in CA1 are associated with smaller changes in firing modulation in about 20 % of thalamic cells.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Cross covariance of spindle and ripple envelope for all sessions.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48881-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To find out if there are synergistic effects between spindle amplitude and ripple power, we then detected the spindle cycles with the highest amplitude (upper quartile of the distribution) and compared the modulation of thalamic cells when ripple power was high or low (above or below median). We run a complementary analysis in which we detected spindle cycles with the highest ripple power (upper 25 %) and compared the modulation of thalamic cells in cycles with low or high amplitude. For the population of cells we did not find evidence of a significant effect of ripple power on the modulation value of thalamic firing in high amplitude spindles (p = 0.94; Wilcoxon signed rank), while higher spindle amplitude led to higher modulation values on high ripple power spindles (p = 0.04). However, although the modulation values were not significantly different, a majority (61.29 %) of units showed a further increase in modulation index with ripple power (average increase 18.15 ± 21.94 %); instead, 32.26 % of the units increased their modulation with spindle amplitude (in the spindles with highest ripple power; average increase 30.00 ± 20.97 %). The percent change in the modulation index with ripple power and spindle amplitude were correlated (Spearman correlation 0.51; p = 0.003).</p><p>Altogether, the data is consistent with the hypothesis that spindle-related firing in thalamic cells is regulated in conjunction with changes in ripple activity in the hippocampus, and this process may dynamically engage specific subsets of cells in the midline thalamus. Figure 6 (previous Figure 8) has been modified extensively to incorporate this extension of the results. Figure 6F illustrates an increased modulation with ripple power in the same thalamic unit from Figure 6A-C. The peri-spindle histogram for spindle cycles in the upper quartile of the distribution of peak-to-trough amplitudes is split between those that have low or high ripple power; the two groups of spindles are not significantly different in amplitude (p = 0.45), yet the unit increases its firing modulation with highripple-power spindles (top plots); instead, the same unit shows reduced modulation with spindle amplitude for spindles with the highest ripple power (bottom). Figure 6—figure supplement 2 includes additional examples of units that increase and decrease their spindle modulation with ripple power and spindle amplitude. Although we observed clear modulations of firing with spindles, the absolute number of spikes for single units did not change significantly with spindles low/high in ripple power and neither with SWRs coupled/uncoupled to spindles (Figure 6G).</p><p>Regarding the Yang et al., 2019 study, the main difference between our results and those of Yang et al., 2019 is that they found a large proportion of neural activity in the MD nucleus positively correlated with spindle-coupled SWRs. In our sample, we found that 7 units (14.89 % of the 47 that were analyzed with SWRs) showed a pure increase in firing in the 200ms window around CA1 SWRs; this means an increase in firing larger than 2 standard deviations from the null distribution and that was not associated with a post-inhibition rebound. Another 4 units (8.51 %) had a large rebound (larger than 2sd) that followed soon after a strong decrease in firing (below -2sd) (an example is shown in Figure 3B); 3 of these units with rebound were recorded in the reuniens nucleus and 1 in the ventromedial. Unfortunately, we only have 4 units recorded in MD and we cannot directly compare our results to those of Yang et al., 2019; however, our results extend theirs to suggest that some thalamic units increase their firing rate with SWRs, and this often takes the form of a rebound from decreased firing. Although we have not seen specific increases in absolute firing rate with spindle-coupled SWRs, we have seen that some cells increase their firing modulation (up and downregulation) with high-ripple power spindles; Yang et al., 2019 describe relying on multi-unit neural activity for some of their analyses, and it is possible that their MUA recordings in MD reflect pooled increased modulation in certain cell populations. Our results suggest that individual cells may not display and absolute increase in firing with spindle-coupled spindles, instead, when hippocampus ripple activity is highest, the firing of some thalamic cells will both increase and decrease following the dynamics of the ongoing spindle cycles, suggesting phasespecific effects in thalamocortical synapses that could serve a function in facilitating the consolidation of hippocampus to neocortical traces.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Example of peri-event histogram smoothing based on moving average (red, “new” curve), and on Gaussian smoothing (blue, “old”), used prior to calculating unit modulation index.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48881-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>It is also worth noting a difference with the spindle detection in our study; in the Yang et al. study, spindles were detected from EEG skull screws using criteria that included at least 0.5s of duration; spindle-coupled SWRs were then classified as those SWRs that occurred between the onset and offset of spindles. Our LFP recordings in mPFC show that time windows longer than 0.5s can encompass one or more KCs, which are correlated with SWRs and spindles, and can be followed by a thalamic rebound of firing. Spindles defined by this duration criterion could partly reflect KC-thalamic firing and increase the fraction of thalamic electrodes positively modulated with SWRs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 9D, Rayleigh's z were assessed between neurons with different firing rates. However, the Rayleigh test is sensitive to the number of spikes (e.g. Sirota et al., 2008), and thus the authors should confirm the main conclusions with subsampled spikes such that the numbers of spikes are the same between groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated the phase locking analysis of thalamic units to the spindle and delta filtered mPFC LFP with a random subset of 10 % of the spikes. We find that the circular mean of the newly calculated phase distributions does not change significantly (p = 0.68 for spindle and 0.07 for delta); the phase distributions with less spikes do have significantly different Z-values and modulation values (except kappa for delta, which is not significantly different).

Yet, appropriate statistics to support this claim were not presented. Reviewers were not convinced that there would be a significant increase in SWR amplitude or rate when compared to data from proper control experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-examined this result with a larger dataset and added control analyses. We had previously used 6 sessions from 3 rats to address the question of potential changes in SWR power and rate before and after spatial exploration. These recording sessions had been selected based on the presence of stable units in CA1 during run (and in the before and after run sleep recordings). To these recordings, we now added two more sessions from a different rat and two additional sessions from two of the previous rats, for a total of 10 sessions from 4 rats. We still find that the peak-totrough amplitude and the rate per second of detected SWRs is larger after run compared to before run (p = 0.027 and p = 0.019; Mann-Whitney test), even though the recording before and after run did not differ in total sleep time (p = 0.076). As a control for the possibility that these features change over time, we used another set of 4 longer recording sessions from two of the rats, in which we had recorded continuously (no maze exploration) for a similar overall amount of time. We compared the SWRs amplitude and rate in the first half to the second half of these sessions, finding no difference in amplitude nor rate between the first and second half of the recording (p &gt; 0.2); the overall amount of sleep time was also not different in the first and second half of the recording, and not different from the pre-behavior or post-behavior sleep epochs in the other sessions with “run” epochs (p &gt; 0.1 in all cases).This more thorough examination points to an enhancement of CA1 SWR activity immediately after spatial behavior, which may be related to the reactivation of the recently acquired episodic memory traces during rest.</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48881-resp-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the reviewers' major concern on the small number of thalamic units, the authors provided only justification of the small unit number, but not additional support of the main conclusions. The reviewers' concern was whether the main conclusions can be supported by the authors' data with a limited number of units, because some of their claims are too strong based on the presented data. For example, in the Abstract, the authors mentioned that &quot;Thalamic units…fired at consistent lags with other thalamic units&quot;. But from their data, convincing evidence of consistent time lags of thalamic firing in the cross-correlation analysis (only one or two examples may show a &quot;lag&quot; out of 12 pairs) is still lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the sample size for the pair analyses by adding 16 new units, for a total of 39 pairs (3.25 times more than in the previous version of the manuscript). These additional units had not initially been identified during manual clustering, which aimed to sort units in the three brain regions; the added units were detected (in 5 additional sessions from 4 of the rats) after revising the raw data looking for multiple units recorded simultaneously within the thalamus. The additional sessions allowed us to review pair correlations in a larger population of thalamic cells. The results and conclusions are still supported by the additional data. 33 % of the pairs had a peak above 3 standard deviations from the average cross-correlogram (average peak z-score 2.40 ± 1.21 sd, n = 39 pairs). We repeated the analyses of firing consistency between pairs with the added data, we calculated the smallest difference between the phase of the spikes in spindle cycles (Figure 1). The standard deviation of the distribution of phase lags was significantly lower for units with high spike correlations during sleep (pair cross-correlograms &gt; 3 sd) compared to the units that were not temporally correlated. The standard deviation was significantly lower for correlated pairs compared to uncorrelated pairs (2.15 compared to 2.50; p &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test). These results have been updated in the text and in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1; the table with total unit numbers has been updated. We also updated the analysis of cross-correlation of unit pairs in low and high ripple power spindles. With the increased number of pairs, we found that the modulation of thalamic spindle firing with SWR power was stronger in half of the unit pairs; we calculated the modulation index for the cross-correlograms of thalamic pairs and found that it increased by an average of 26.64 % in 48.72% of the pairs in spindle cycles with high ripple power and decreased by 20.90 % in the rest of the pairs (n = 39).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Based on the reviewers' concern on their conclusion of lack of rhythmicity in individual thalamic units, the authors provided additional analyses. However, first, the subsampling procedure performed in this revision is not satisfactory, as the spike number of MUA (12000 or 6700) is still far larger than the typical spike number of units (2000 or less?). The reviewers originally suggested to equalize the spike number between groups, which has not been performed. The authors actually confirmed that &quot;a smaller sample of spikes can reveal variations&quot;, and the subsampling procedure is meant to assess the impact of such variation due to a small sample number on the statistical test (e.g. Figure 4—figure supplement 1F).</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated the calculation of the autocorrelations with the subsampling procedure suggested by the reviewers: we equalized the MUA spike numbers to the number of spikes fired by the thalamic unit with the least number of spikes recorded in the same session. The autocorrelations of MUA spikes calculated with subsampling to the sparsest unit in each session still show a peak in the lags of the spindle frequency, and the maximum of the autocorrelation function (after removing lag 0) was on average at 119.3 ms for MUA, significantly lower than for units (average 223.6 ms; p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney). Figure 4—figure supplement 1 has been updated.</p><p>Regarding the observation that the small sample of spikes can reveal variations in the autocorrelations, we noticed variations in the strength of the autocorrelation when we calculated it in blocks of spikes through the length recording session, but not in its lag dependency. This may reflect that autocorrelations are stronger when the rats start to sleep and may decrease in strength over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the new analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F) indicates that many units indeed fire at the rhythm of spindle oscillations, while other units fire at longer intervals. I think that this result contradicts the authors' conclusion of &quot;the lack of rhythmicity in individual thalamic units&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this statement and added the new sorted thalamic units to extend and strengthen the unit analyses. We find that the peak of the autocorrelation occurred within the spindle band in 63.3 % of the curves calculated with MUA (with subsampled spikes, number matched to the units) and in 17.02 % of the units (Figure 4—figure supplement 1G shows the autocorrelation of units in which the maximum autocorrelation value falls within the spindle band lags). The autocorrelations with peak values within the spindle band had significantly higher average correlation values for MUA spikes compared to units (MUA: 0.24 ± 0.20; units: 0.05 ± 0.01; p = 0.0038, Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney). We conclude that these results suggest that most thalamic units are not strongly oscillatory and that it is the combined spikes from multiple units that underlie spindle frequency oscillations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, if there is an organized (grouped) sequential reactivation as the authors suggested, the cross-correlograms should reveal both co-activation and suppression at specific intervals of the spindle cycles, which did not appear in the results. Therefore, the results only suggest that thalamic neurons fire at the spindle rhythm, but not necessarily at every spindle cycle (similar to theta-cycle-skipping cells). However, these results alone do not support organized coactivation nor sequential activation as described in the authors' claims as follows: &quot;different groups of thalamic units contribute to activity in different spindle cycles&quot; (subsection Sparse thalamic firing and consistent activation of cell pairs during spindles”); &quot;individual spindle cycles group and organize the sequential activation of thalamocortical ensembles&quot; (subsection “Sparse firing of thalamic cells during spindles and its role in systems memory consolidation”); and &quot;the sparse firing at the single-cell level will allow for the interleaved excitation of different sets of thalamocortical synapses in subsequent spindle cycles&quot; (subsection “Sparse firing of thalamic cells during spindles and its role in systems memory consolidation”).</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed by the reviewer, the modulation is indeed both upward and downward, although the downward modulation tends to be smaller (maybe due to a floor effect and suppression of already low firing rates). This can be observed more clearly before normalizing by the standard deviation to obtain z-scores, as in the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref>, which shows the cross-correlograms after mean subtraction. The downward modulation is stronger for pairs that show stronger increased modulation and flat for pairs that do not show strong upward cross-correlation.</p><fig id="sa2fig6"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Cross-correlograms between spindle spikes of simultaneously recorded units in thalamus.</title><p>Y-axis indicates pair ID (each row one pair).

This is supported by the analyses of phase-difference with the added pairs of thalamic cells. We also modified the text to raise the hypothesis that the sparse firing at the single cell level could lead to the interleaved excitation of different sets of thalamocortical synapses in subsequent spindle cycles, something that can promote synaptic plasticity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the original review, the reviewers did not ask which factor, either the spindle or ripple power, contributes to the stronger modulation of thalamic activity, but the question was whether the grouping into high and low ripple power (as in the main figures) may have associated confound of spindle power differences (e.g. one group may have a higher spindle power than the other). The authors only provided the analyses in which one variable was handled independently, but they should take into account interactions between two variables, ripple and spindle power. For example, one can use a regression model of the thalamic firing modulation with both spindle and ripple power, to assess the contribution of each factor.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this comment by analyzing the modulation of thalamic cells in spindles classified based on both ripple and spindle power (results included in the text and modified panels in Figure 6E, F), and by implementing a regression model (results below). We found that the modulation of thalamic unit firing increased in spindles with high amplitude <italic>and</italic> high ripple power compared to spindles with low amplitude <italic>and</italic> low ripple power (p = 0.014, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Together with our previous analyses, the results indicate that the strongest firing modulation of thalamic units occurs with spindle amplitude alone (the largest increase in spike modulation index occurred from low to high amplitude spindles), followed by the combined effect of large spindle and ripple power, and by ripple power alone; although we did not find evidence of a significant effect of ripple power on the modulation of thalamic firing, a majority (61.29 %) of units showed a further increase in modulation index with ripple power in high amplitude spindles (average increase 18.15 ± 21.94 %), suggesting that ripple power in CA1 provides an additional boost to the spindle related modulation. We have reorganized the paragraphs in section “Spindle activation of thalamic units modulated with CA1 SWRs” for clarity and edited Figure 6 accordingly.</p><p>We used a generalized linear model (Equation 1) to regress the spikes from the thalamic units (Y; binned in 0.5s windows during sleep) on the average ripple (X<sub>1</sub>) and spindle (Χ<sub>2</sub>) power and on their multiplicative interaction (X<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub>) in the same time windows. With this implementation, the ripple power parameter was significant in 87.10 % of the units, the spindle power in 90.32 % and the interaction parameter in 83.87 % (n = 31 units; significance level at 0.05, Wald test). In this model, the strength of the effect of each factor (ripple, spindle power) was stronger than their interaction; the model predicted an average 5 % decrease in thalamic spikes per unit change in ripple power, an average decrease of 2.3 % per unit of spindle power, and a weaker modulation (average 0.11 %) for the combined interaction term (an example for one thalamic unit is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig7">Author response image 7</xref>). Although these models address the reviewer’s comment, they also suggest that there are additional considerations to develop valid and interpretable models. For example, the model indicates an overall decrease in firing with both ripples and spindles but does not capture the increased modulations seen in some units with peri-event histograms of detected spindles. One reason could be that the down states (K-complexes) modulate firing rate more strongly than the modulations observed within spindle cycles (Figure 3 in the manuscript). K-complexes are also associated with a rebound of activity in some thalamic units, which may confound the model further. An additional factor is that although the overall firing rate in the thalamus decreases in sleep and in association with SWRs, thalamic cells become more bursty, and modeling bursts requires the incorporation of a history dependence parameter. We think that the investigation of the interaction between sleep oscillations and thalamic firing using regressive models is an excellent continuation to the work presented here, and that it requires a dedicated project to adequately incorporate the variables we noted. The results presented in this manuscript provide helpful directions, suggesting that modeling approaches to study thalamic firing modulation in non-REM sleep should take into account ripple and spindle power as well as down-states and thalamic bursts.
