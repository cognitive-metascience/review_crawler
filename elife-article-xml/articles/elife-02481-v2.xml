Essential for disaggregation, the ClpB middle domain (MD) is a coiled-coil propeller that binds Hsp70. Although the ClpB subunit structure is known, positioning of the MD in the hexamer and its mechanism of action are unclear. We obtained electron microscopy (EM) structures of the BAP variant of ClpB that binds the protease ClpP, clearly revealing MD density on the surface of the ClpB ring. Mutant analysis and asymmetric reconstructions show that MDs adopt diverse positions in a single ClpB hexamer. Adjacent, horizontally oriented MDs form head-to-tail contacts and repress ClpB activity by preventing Hsp70 interaction. Tilting of the MD breaks this contact, allowing Hsp70 binding, and releasing the contact in adjacent subunits. Our data suggest a wavelike activation of ClpB subunits around the ring.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02481.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02481.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02481.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are long chain-like molecules that twist and fold into complex three-dimensional shapes in order to carry out their functions. High temperatures or other types of stress can cause proteins to fold incorrectly, and misfolded proteins can form clumps (or aggregates) that are harmful to cells. Additional proteins called chaperones are therefore used by cells to help proteins to fold correctly, or to refold poorly folded proteins.</p><p>ClpB proteins (and related proteins) are chaperones found in bacteria, fungi and plants; these proteins co-operate with other chaperones to rescue misfolded proteins that have aggregated—an activity that helps cells to survive heat shock and other stresses. Six ClpB proteins work together to form a ring-shaped complex, and the misfolded protein is unfolded by threading it through the centre of this ring. Each ClpB protein also has a middle domain that acts to switch the complex on and off as needed.</p><p>The middle domains are known to form coiled-coils, with protein helices coiled together like the strands of a rope. However, previous efforts to work out the structure of the ClpB complex did not clearly establish where these coiled-coils were positioned relative to the rest of the ring.</p><p>Now Carroni et al. have used image processing to overcome these problems and reveal that the middle domains are wrapped around the outer edge of the ring complex. Analysis of ClpB mutants that lock the complex in either an off or on state revealed that the middle domains are linked head-to tail to encircle the ring when the complex is off. However, when the complex switches on, the middle domains let go of each other and tilt, allowing the ring to change shape. Carroni et al. suggest that the exposed ends of the middle domains are free to bind to other chaperones (those that work to refold the unfolded proteins), thereby activating the complex.</p><p>Although Carroni et al. have revealed how the ClpB ring complex is activated, further work is needed to understand exactly how the unlocked ring works to rescue misfolded proteins from aggregates within cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02481.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02481.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>single particle EM</kwd><kwd>ClpB/Hsp104</kwd><kwd>protein unfolding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>089050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saibil</surname><given-names>Helen R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>079605</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saibil</surname><given-names>Helen R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hartmut Hoffmann-Berling International graduate school</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kummer</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Humboldt fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oguchi</surname><given-names>Yuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Overcoming image-processing problems in the analysis of the ClpB chaperone provides a new structural model and regulatory mechanism, based on clear density for the coiled-coil domain and supported by various biochemical data.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular machinery has evolved to prevent or reverse protein misfolding and aggregation, which are damaging to cells and tissues. Bacterial ClpB and its yeast counterpart Hsp104 are members of the Clp/Hsp100 family and function in disaggregation and refolding of protein aggregates together with Hsp70 and its co-chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goloubinoff et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Motohashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zolkiewski, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doyle and Wickner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haslberger et al., 2010</xref>). ClpB/Hsp104 are conserved in bacteria, fungi, plants and mitochondria and are essential for recovery of cells from heat shock and other proteotoxic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parsell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mogk et al., 1999</xref>). The oligomeric ring Hsp100 proteins thread substrates through a central channel, via binding to conserved tyrosine residues on flexible loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weber-Ban et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weibezahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haslberger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tessarz et al., 2008</xref>). They belong to the AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) superfamily of ATPases, with characteristic α and β subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ogura and Wilkinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>). ATP binds between the two subdomains and at the subunit interface of adjacent monomers, with a catalytic Arg-finger provided by the neighbouring subunit.</p><p>While some other members of the Hsp100 family have been crystallised in their oligomeric form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bochtler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glynn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), the atomic structure of ClpB is known only for the monomer (<italic>T. thermophilus</italic>). ClpB is composed of a N-terminal domain (ND) followed by two AAA+ domains (AAA-1 and AAA-2). An 85 Å long coil-coiled propeller, the middle domain (MD), is inserted into the small subdomain of AAA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). It has two blades with mutationally sensitive sites at either end, termed motif 1 and motif 2. Cryo-EM reconstructions of <italic>Tth</italic>ClpB hexamers show a two-tiered molecule accounting for the AAA+ rings, but lack density for the ND. On the other hand, various cryo-EM studies of Hsp104 revealed the presence of an ND ring on top of the AAA+ ones. Although the overall shape and dimensions of the ClpB and Hsp104 hexamers are comparable in the various cryo-EM studies, there are substantial differences in the channel width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wendler et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Observation of narrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2010</xref>) (15–30 Å) vs expanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wendler et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2009</xref>) (30–80 Å) cavities has led to different pseudo-atomic models of the hexamers. In one model, the AAA+ rings are compact, as in the crystal structures of other AAA+ hexamers such as p97, HslU or SV40 LTag, with the Arg-finger contacting the neighbouring subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bochtler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huyton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gai et al., 2004</xref>). In the EM maps used to build this compact model there is little or no density for the MD and it was assumed to extend radially outwards from the ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2010</xref>). In the expanded model, the AAA+ domains are more widely separated with the MD intercalated between them, preventing the canonical Arg-finger contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wendler et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2009</xref>). An attempt to localize the Hsp104 MD by genetically inserting a lysozyme resulted in a cryo-EM reconstruction of this chimera with visible density for the lysozyme, but not for the MD itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Since none of the existing cryo-EM structures allows an unambiguous localization of the MD, its position is still a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Desantis and Shorter, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The MD confers unique disaggregase ability to ClpB/Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kedzierska et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mogk et al., 2003</xref>) and is required for species-specific cooperation with the DnaK-DnaJ(DnaKJ)/Hsp70-Hsp40 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sielaff and Tsai, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>). A direct interaction between the ClpB MD and DnaK has been shown by NMR spectroscopy and site-specific crosslinking and involves the motif 2 tip of the MD and the ATPase domain of DnaK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosenzweig et al., 2013</xref>). The MD acts to repress ClpB disaggregase activity, and DnaK binding relieves this repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>). Point mutations in the MD show that interactions between motif 2 and AAA-1 are critical for regulating ATPase and disaggregase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haslberger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lipinska et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the MD plays an essential role in coupling Hsp70 interaction to ATPase regulation and substrate disaggregation in ClpB/Hsp104. It is therefore important to understand its structural role in ClpB/Hsp104 hexamers and in the context of the ClpB-DnaKJ bi-chaperone machinery.</p><p>To address the ambiguities in domain arrangement and to elucidate the working principle of the MD, we performed single particle EM studies of ClpB under conditions where its orientation could be determined more reliably than in previous studies. We used BAP (ClpB with the ClpA tripeptide for ClpP binding), a chimera engineered to bind the ClpP protease via the replacement of a C-terminal ClpB segment with the ClpP binding region of ClpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weibezahn et al., 2004</xref>). This construct has been extensively used to study the ClpB disaggregation mechanism by monitoring substrate proteolysis after delivery to ClpP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weibezahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haslberger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tessarz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mizuno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosenzweig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, BAP is suitable for structural studies and has allowed us to obtain maps with visible MD densities that shed light on its regulatory mechanisms.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02481.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>3D structure of the symmetrised BAP-ClpP complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the complex showing the threading of a polypeptide.

Side views of the elongated BAP-ClpP complex are easily recognisable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) whereas in 2D projections of ClpB alone, which has a globular shape, it is hard to distinguish side from tilted views. By restricting the dataset to side views the angle assignment is more reliable, and these views are sufficient to generate the full 3D structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Using H/D exchange experiments, which report on the solvent accessibility and structural flexibility of amide hydrogens, we found that BAP, either alone or bound to ClpP, displays the same protection pattern as ClpB, implying the same MD conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The BAP-ClpP complexes formed by mixing BAP and ClpP at a 1:1 molar ratio of hexamer to heptamer in the presence of ATPγS were stained with uranyl acetate. Complexes containing two BAP hexamers per ClpP double-heptamer were picked for single particle analysis and separated into halves for processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Effantin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Initial analysis revealed the presence of four layers corresponding to the ND, AAA-1, AAA-2 and ClpP rings. Class averages and eigenimage analysis indicate that the ND is extremely mobile in the BAP hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with crystallographic data on monomeric <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> ClpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). The ND layer was therefore excluded during later stages of image alignment. Similarly, the region corresponding to ClpP, very useful for the initial analysis, was not included in the refinement because of its symmetry mismatch with ClpB. Using ∼12,000 particles, we obtained a 3D map by refining the alignment of the two AAA+ rings only, but then including the whole molecule in the reconstruction, which was at ∼17 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In order to simplify the problems of alignment and reconstruction, we initially imposed sixfold symmetry, which blurs the features of the heptameric ClpP ring. Similarly, the mobile ClpB ND is blurred into a solid disc.</p><p>The BAP hexamer has overall outer dimensions of ∼150 × 100 Å, similar to previous structures of ClpB/Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parsell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wendler et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

In the reconstruction it is possible to identify regions accounting for all the domains, such as L-shaped densities for the AAA+ domains and a rod-like density for the coiled-coil MD.</p><p>To interpret the domain interactions, we fitted ClpB atomic coordinates into the EM density. We determined the crystal structure of an ND truncation of <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpB (residues 159 to 858; E279A/E432A/E678A mutation; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The subunit structure is very similar to that of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> ClpB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Since none of the available crystal structure conformations fit in the EM map, domains were fitted as separate rigid bodies connected at hinge regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For the AAA-1 ring, it was possible to build a hexamer model based on the crystal structure of hexameric ClpC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2011</xref>) (PDB code 3PXG), a homologue that also displays disaggregation activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schlothauer et al., 2003</xref>). The resulting ClpB AAA-1 hexamer model was automatically docked into the AAA-1 layer as a rigid body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This strategy was chosen over the fitting of a single subunit followed by hexamerisation because it is expected to provide a more accurate picture of the subunit interface, which is difficult to determine at the resolution of our EM map. However, this approach did not work for the AAA-2 layer since the ClpB AAA-2 hexamer based on the ClpC crystal structure was not compatible with the density. In this case a ∼40° tilt of the monomers into the plane of the ring was required to obtain the optimal fit, which resembles the pseudo-atomic model of the homologue ClpA AAA-2 ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Effantin et al., 2010</xref>). Coordinates of the <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpB ND (residues 1 to 148) were obtained from the PDB (1KHY). A single N domain was fitted manually, maintaining the connection to AAA-1, and then hexamerised by applying symmetry in Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02481.008</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>X-ray data collection and refinement statistics</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02481.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02481.008</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Protein</td><td>ClpB E279A/E432A/E678A (SeMet) + ATP</td></tr><tr><td>Wavelength (Å)</td><td>0.9794</td></tr><tr><td>Space group</td><td>P6<sub>5</sub></td></tr><tr><td>Unit cell (Å,°)</td><td>127.34, 127.34, 119.86, 90, 90, 120</td></tr><tr><td>Molecules</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution (Å)</td><td>81.15–3.50 (3.69–3.50)</td></tr><tr><td>Reflections measured</td><td>202965</td></tr><tr><td>Unique reflections</td><td>14024</td></tr><tr><td>Rmerge</td><td>8.8 (53.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Rpim</td><td>3.0 (14.9)</td></tr><tr><td>I/σI</td><td>16.8 (5.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Completeness (%)</td><td>99.9 (100)</td></tr><tr><td>Redundancy</td><td>14.5 (14.8)</td></tr><tr><td>Rwork/Rfree (%)</td><td>22.5/24.5</td></tr><tr><td>Protein residues</td><td>657 (5257 atoms)</td></tr><tr><td>ADP</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Rmsd bond lengths (Å)</td><td>0.004</td></tr><tr><td>Rmsd bond angles (°)</td><td>0.94</td></tr><tr><td>Average B-Factor Protein</td><td>99.6</td></tr><tr><td>Average B-Factor ADP</td><td>87.7</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Ramachandran plot statistics</td></tr><tr><td> Favored (%)</td><td>95.5</td></tr><tr><td> Allowed (%)</td><td>4.1</td></tr><tr><td> Generous (%)</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td> Disallowed (%)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td> PDB entry code</td><td>4CIU</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>The AAA+ rings have a central opening of ∼30 Å and therefore are not as compact as in one of the previous models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2010</xref>), but not as expanded as in the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wendler et al., 2007</xref>).

Eventually, ∼4500 particles were collected and the same processing strategy was used as for the negative stain data.

Moreover, a very similar intersubunit motif 1-motif 2 contact is seen in all the ClpB crystal structures, in which ClpB monomers are arranged in a spiral assembly (<italic>Tth</italic>ClpB, 1QVR, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <italic>Eco</italic>ClpB current study) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In the Y503D hyperactive form there is density for motif 1 in a more tilted orientation, but there is no density visible for motif 2, suggesting that this region becomes either disordered or highly mobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). This finding is in accordance with H/D exchange data showing deprotection of this region in the BAP-Y503D mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>). We conclude that, in the Y503D hyperactive form, the motif 1 arm of the MD is tilted downwards so that it can no longer contact motif 2 of the adjacent MD, and binds to a lower region of the neighbouring AAA-1 domain. Motif 2 is mobile and solvent exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).</p><p>Alignment of AAA-1 domains of wild type, repressed and hyperactive forms of ClpB/BAP confirms that the MD rotates ∼30° from a tilted orientation in the hyperactive state, to a horizontal one in the repressed state, with the wild type occupying an intermediate orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In this movement motif 1 switches from being protected against AAA-1 to engaging motif 2 in trans. These different orientations of the MD have opposite consequences for DnaK binding. The horizontal MD position, with motif 1 contacting motif 2 of the neighbouring subunit, is incompatible with DnaK binding at the tip of motif 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosenzweig et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, tilting of the MD exposes motif 2 for DnaK interaction.</p><p>To confirm the close proximity of motif 1 and motif 2 of neighbouring MDs we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments using Q427W (motif 1) as FRET donor and IAEDANS labeled Q502C (motif 2) as FRET acceptor. The FRET pair (Förster radius of 22 Å) has a distance of 19.1 Å in the wild type model and was introduced into the tryptophan-free ClpB-W462Y/W543L variant. In addition we coupled the FRET pair to E432A and Y503D mutations, to monitor the consequences of repressed and hyperactive states on FRET efficiency. The distance between the FRET partners is either reduced (11.3 Å) or increased (35.9 Å) in models of the repressed and hyperactive variants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). All ClpB variants were IAEDANS labeled with similar efficiencies (70–80%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). High IAEDANS fluorescence and thus FRET efficiency was observed for wild type ClpB and E432A upon ClpB oligomerization. Increase in acceptor fluorescence in general correlated with reduced tryptophan emission except for ClpB wild type upon oligomerization. In contrast, IAEDANS fluorescence remained low under all conditions tested when the FRET pair was linked to Y503D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, to test for direct interaction between motif 1 and motif 2, we introduced cysteine residues into motif 1 (K431C) and motif 2 (S499C) and analyzed whether intermolecular crosslinks form under oxidizing conditions. Low Cu-Phenanthrolin concentrations (25 μM) yielded a ladder of crosslink products from ClpB dimers to hexamers. Although non-specific dimer formation was observed in single cysteine variants, higher oligomers were only found in double cysteine variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Introducing the activating (Y503D) mutation to ClpB-K431C/S499C decreased but did not abolish crosslink formation, suggesting rapid fluctuation of MDs between different conformations even in the hyperactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These findings support the interaction of MD motifs 1 and 2 from adjacent subunits as observed in the EM reconstructions and strengthening or loosening of the contact in repressed and hyperactive states, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Motif 1 is essential for keeping ClpB in the repressed state</title><p>Mutating MD motif 1 can impair Hsp70 interaction and consequently protein disaggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>).

This rotational variability may explain the apparent ∼15° rotation of the AAA-2 wild-type ring relative to the mutants observed in the symmetrised reconstructions. As expected from the eigenimage analysis, the ND ring is not very well defined and the density does not account for all six NDs. Therefore, we did not attempt any atomic structure fitting into this region. Docking of the atomic structures of AAA-1, AAA-2 and MD was performed as follows.</p><p>Structures of AAA+ proteins crystallised in their hexameric assemblies show that the large and small subdomains of the AAA fold assume a range of conformations that can be clustered into open or closed forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cho and Vale, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stinson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The closed conformation is ATP-binding competent and there are intermediate forms that might also represent weak binding states. Using a gallery of available AAA+ crystal structures we modelled open, closed and intermediate conformations of ClpB AAA-1 and AAA-2. We also created AAA+ dimers of adjacent ClpB subunits based on ClpX pseudo-hexameric crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glynn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stinson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) that were fitted as rigid bodies into the asymmetric reconstructions. Crystallographic dimers are likely to provide more realistic models of subunit interfaces than can be deduced by fitting individual subunits into low-resolution maps.</p><p>The AAA-2 ring density could be almost entirely interpreted using this approach and the fit suggests that 3 to 5 subunits are sufficiently closed to bind ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We analyzed nucleotide (ADP) binding to wild type ClpB by isothermal calorimetry (ITC) revealing a binding stoichiometry of 7.5 ± 0.1 ADP per hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). ITC experiments using ClpB-K212A, which is deficient in nucleotide binding in AAA-1, allowed us to determine a binding stoichiometry of 3.7 ± 0.3 ADP in AAA-2 of the mutant hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). The same ADP binding stoichiometry was also found for the repressed and hyperactive variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). The deduced stoichiometries are in good agreement with the distinct AAA-2 conformations observed in the asymmetric EM reconstructions. Similar calculations have been reported for the AAA+ proteins MCM, ClpX and HslU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yakamavich et al., 2008</xref>). The AAA-1 ring is more asymmetric than AAA-2 and it is not easily interpretable by fitting crystallographic dimer models. There is sufficient density to guide rigid body fitting of all AAA-1 domains, but this fitting does not allow deductions of nucleotide occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Asymmetric reconstructions of both wild-type BAP and repressed mutant display clear densities accounting for the MDs that lie outside the AAA-1 ring and assume different orientations similar to those observed in the symmetrised maps of wild type and mutants. In the wild-type asymmetric reconstruction, the MD orientation ranges from horizontal as in the repressed state to highly tilted, similar to the hyperactive state, passing through the intermediate wild type-like state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In one subunit, motif 1 contacts AAA-2 of the same subunit, suggesting a route of allosteric communication between AAA-1 and AAA-2. Additionally, this contact is compatible with recently reported engineered disulphide bonds between motif 1 residues and AAA-2 in Hsp104 and ClpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desantis et al., 2014</xref>). The tilted MDs are clustered together, consistent with the release of motif 1-motif 2 contacts freeing adjacent subunits.</p><p>In the asymmetric reconstruction of the repressed state, five MDs are found in the horizontal orientation, followed by a sixth for which there is no clear density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the wild type two MDs can make the motif 1 to motif 2 contact, while in the repressed state up to five MDs are compatible with this contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Conversely, in the wild type at least two MDs exist in a clearly activated state but in the repressed state none of the MDs are visible in the tilted, hyperactive conformation. As a consequence, the MD conformations in BAP-E432A do not support Hsp70 binding and ATPase activation, in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>). However, ClpB wild type hexamers harbour two MDs that favour Hsp70 recruitment, potentially priming the ClpB ring for further activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The BAP construct of ClpB complexed with ClpP, combined with a conservative approach of using only clearly identifiable side views and basing the analysis mainly on negative stain images (with independent confirmation from cryo EM) enabled us to unambiguously locate all subunit domains in the oligomer, including the coiled-coil MD propeller. Although the quoted resolutions for some previous structures of ClpB and Hsp104 were better, the globular shape, flexibility and asymmetry of these hexamers reduce the reliability of orientation assignment. Moreover, previous published structures of ClpB/Hsp104 were obtained by cryo EM only, which provides a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than negative stain data.</p><p>Rigid body fitting of <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpB atomic coordinates (PDB code 4CIU) into our new maps reveals that the MD is not projecting outwards from the hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2010</xref>) nor intercalated between subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wendler et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2009</xref>), but is instead lying on the surface of the ClpB hexameric ring with a variable degree of tilt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). A similar position of the MD is seen for Hsp104, underlining the conserved activity and mechanism of these disaggregases. This new MD arrangement is in excellent agreement with recent, extensive biochemical analysis of the MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>). It was proposed that the MD works as a molecular toggle switching from a repressed state in which both motif 1 and 2 ends of the propeller are protected, to an active state where motif 2 is deprotected, exposing the binding site for DnaK/Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosenzweig et al., 2013</xref>). Our EM reconstructions of repressed, hyperactive and wild type ClpB reveal a lever-like movement of the MD that switches from the repressed state with head-to-tail motif 1-motif 2 binding between adjacent subunits, to a mobile, activated state with motif 2 free and available for binding to DnaK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Moreover, our maps suggest that motif 1, through its contacts with either the adjacent motif 2 or AAA-1, plays a key role in direct communication between neighbouring subunits, which must therefore act in a coordinated manner.</p><p>It has become clear that AAA+ proteins are highly dynamic molecular motors unlikely to exist in a homogeneous structural state. Therefore we generated asymmetric reconstructions of ClpB. Although the resolution of the asymmetric structures is not sufficient to support a detailed mechanistic model, these reconstructions provide the first visualization of the MD conformational flexibility that was inferred from biochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haslberger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oguchi et al., 2012</xref>). The asymmetric structures show that the MD orientation varies around the ring occupying the repressed, wild type-like and hyperactive positions described by the symmetrised averages. The variable tilts of MDs observed around the ring suggest that 2 to 4 adjacent subunits are available for DnaK binding in the wild-type vs only 1 in the repressed mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). This is consistent with the estimated stoichiometry of 2–5 molecules of DnaK per ClpB hexamer required for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desantis et al., 2014</xref>). It also suggests that at least four subunits must have detached MDs to allow activity, perhaps through movements of the AAA+ domains, in agreement with the number of ClpX subunits that hydrolyze ATP in a coordinated manner to unfold GFP in single molecule experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sen et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, we calculated an ADP binding stoichiometry of 4 for both wild type and mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), which indicates that although ATP hydrolysis is strongly affected, detachment of the MD does not change the nucleotide binding.</p><p>The cryo EM reconstruction of wild-type ClpB suggests that the various MD conformations exist only transiently, poised between hyperactive and repressed states, with the balance shifted slightly towards repressive motif 1-motif 2 contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). DnaK binding to an accessible motif 2 stabilizes the MD in a tilted conformation, thereby in turn breaking the repressive contacts with MDs in neighbouring subunits. Thus, an initial encounter of DnaK will facilitate DnaK binding in the neighbouring MDs. In this model, breakage or formation of motif 1-motif 2 contacts provides a mechanistic basis for signalling DnaK binding or dissociation in a wavelike manner around the ClpB ring. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The model predicts spatial proximity of multiple DnaK molecules, which is the case for aggregated but not soluble DnaK substrates, directing ClpB activity specifically to protein aggregates. Moreover, the activation of ClpB by DnaK binding, combined with movements of the highly mobile N domain, might act to deliver the substrate to the channel entrance, where it would be engaged for threading, unfolding and consequent extraction from the aggregate.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, plasmids and proteins</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strains used were derivatives of MC4100.

Proteins were applied to glow-discharged carbon coated grids (EM sciences), previously coated with 5 kDa poly-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) to positively charge the surface. Samples were stained with 2% uranyl acetate.</p><p>For cryo-EM imaging, BAPtrap-ClpP was applied to holey carbon grids coated with a thin carbon film and pretreated with poly-lysine while ClpB specimens were loaded onto lacey carbon grids. Cryo-EM specimens were vitrified in a Vitrobot (FEI, UK). Images were recorded on a 4k Gatan (UK) CCD camera at a magnification of 50,000Χ for negatively stained specimens (pixel size 2.2 Ε; underfocus range: 0.5–1.2 μm) and of 80,000 × for cryo specimens (pixel size 1.4 Å; underfocus range: 1.5 µM–4 μm). All data were collected on a Tecnai F20 FEG operated at 200 kV under low dose conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single particle processing</title><p>The contrast transfer function (CTF) for each CCD frame was determined with CTFFIND3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003</xref>) and corrected by phase flipping using Bshow1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heymann and Belnap, 2007</xref>). Side views of BAP-ClpP 2:2 complexes were manually picked using Boxer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ludtke et al., 1999</xref>) and extracted into 256 × 256 boxes. The boxed particles were band-pass filtered between 300 and 10 Å for the negative stain dataset and between 300 and 5 Å for the cryo dataset. They were then normalized to the same mean and standard deviation. Particles were initially aligned to the total sum of 10–20 vertically oriented particles using SPIDER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frank et al., 1996</xref>). Individual 1:1 BAP-ClpP complexes were extracted with circular masks and classified by MSA in IMAGIC-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Heel et al., 1996</xref>) to remove images that did not represent BAP-ClpP, yielding 17,470 particles of wild type BAP-ClpP, 12,588 of BAP-E432A-ClpP, 9436 of BAP-Y503D-ClpP and 12,568 of HAP-ClpP. The BAPtrap-ClpP cryo dataset included 4592 particles. At this stage, particles were high-pass filtered to 160 Å and initial class averages of 20–30 images each were obtained by MSA. All alignments of 1:1 BAP-ClpP complexes were done limiting the in-plane rotation to ±20°. Upon further classification, 5–10 good classes were used to generate a starting model by angular reconstitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Heel et al., 2000</xref>). Alternative starting models were also created by applying sixfold symmetry to single classes and then using the resultant 3D map, generally composed of three discs corresponding to the three layers of the molecule, to generate an anchor set for Euler angle assignment. A low-resolution density map was independently created for each dataset by angular reconstitution with sixfold symmetry. Particle orientations were refined in multiple cycles of AP SHC alignment in SPIDER, MSA and angular reconstitution in IMAGIC and the resulting 3D reconstruction, filtered to 30 Å, was used as an initial model for projection matching in SPIDER. By applying a rectangular mask, only the AAA+ layers were refined. After 8–10 cycles of projection matching, using progressively smaller angular sampling steps (4°–1°) and filtering the 3D to the estimated resolution at each cycle, final structures were generated of the whole complex and their resolution was estimated by Fourier shell correlation with a 0.5 correlation cutoff. Based on cross correlation coefficient, around 70–80% of each dataset was included in the final reconstruction.</p><p>The differences between the mutant structures were tested by refining with interchanged starting models. In both cases, the original mutant structure was recovered despite the use of the other map as a starting model for projection matching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>For cryo EM of ClpB alone, the views were randomly oriented and the initial strategy was to extract clearly identifiable side views by MSA and classification. 7606 side views were used to generate a starting model by angular reconstitution, which was refined to 29 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) by projection matching.</p><p>For the reconstructions without imposed symmetry, particle orientations were determined using either the sixfold symmetrised map filtered to 50 Å or a sphere obtained from the average of all particles as a starting model. Subsequently, particle orientations were refined with ∼10 cycles of projection matching without imposed symmetry. The particle orientations were well distributed around the BAP-ClpP central axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The resolution was estimated by Fourier shell correlation (FSC) at 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Atomic structure fitting</title><p>Docking was done using the crystal structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpB-E432A (current study, PDB code: 4CIU) and <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpB ND (PDB code 1KHY).

The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of ClpB variant harbouring a single tryptophan (ClpB*-Q427CW, 1 μM each) was measured on a Perkin-Elmer (Germany) LS50B spectrofluorimeter at 25°C in low salt buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT). Tryptophan and IAEDANS emission spectra of labeled ClpB variants were recorded in high and low salt buffer A (supplemented with 400 mM KCl or 20 mM KCl, respectively) in the absence or presence of 2 mM nucleotide between 300 and 550 nm at a fixed excitation wavelength of 290 nm. The Förster radius of the Trp-IAEDANS FRET pair was calculated as 22 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeganathan et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>For formation of disulfide bridges ClpB cysteine variants were first dialyzed to remove DTT. Cysteine oxidation was achieved by adding 25 μM Cu-Phenanthroline to 4 μM ClpB and incubating the mixture for 1 min at room temperature.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Andreas Martin served as a Guest Editor. All reviewers agreed that this is a beautiful paper that addresses an important question in the Clp/Hsp100 field and combines expertly performed EM with elegant biochemical experiments.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andy Martin (Guest Editor); Gabriel Lander (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Guest Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Guest Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>AAA+ chaperones of the Clp/Hsp100 family play a major role in removing aggregated proteins in prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic cells, but their detailed mechanisms remain still largely unknown. The M-domain of ClpB has been revealed to have a crucial regulatory function through direct interactions with DnaK/Hsp70, but its location has never been clearly defined in an oligomeric assembly of ClpB or the related Hsp104.</p><p>In this manuscript, Saibil et al. used single particle EM to reconstruct the structure of BAP-ClpP with better definition than before, taking advantage of the side-view orientations of the complex. The image analysis was performed expertly, and the authors took care not to introduce model bias or over-refine their data. This allowed a clear distinction of the M-domain and consequently provided the first structural insight into the location, adopted orientations, and the dynamics of the M-domain in the ClpB hexamer. It is shown that the M-domain position at the periphery of the hexamer affects the availability of its motif 2 for interaction with DnaK/Hsp70. Based on asymmetric reconstructions, the authors found that the M-domains around the ring of the wild-type enzyme adopt differential orientations, ranging from a horizontal position with head-to-tail contacts between neighboring M-domains to a highly tilted position that allows Hsp70 binding. M-domain-dependent activation of the ClpB ATPase thus seems to occur in a coordinated wave-like fashion, and this manuscript presents an exciting new structural framework for the correlated regulation of ATP hydrolysis and DnaK-mediated substrate delivery to the ClpB disaggregase. Furthermore, the presented EM structural work is nicely complemented by elegant in-vitro biochemical experiments that analyze the spatial separation between motifs 1 and 2 for different M-domain conformations by means of FRET and characterize the roles of these motifs in regulating ATP hydrolysis and substrate processing.</p><p>In summary, this manuscript significantly furthers our mechanistic understanding of the M-domain's role in regulating the Hsp100 ATPase activity and the cooperation with Hsp70 for protein disaggregation, and it is well suited for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>None of the points below are major or would, if not addressed, jeopardize the acceptance of this manuscript for publication. Nevertheless, the authors should try to address them in order to make the paper even stronger than it already is.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the authors present the measurements of FRET between an engineered Trp in motif 1 and a Cys-linked AEDANS label in motif 2 for wild-type and mutant ClpB. Overall, the data convincingly show that there is a difference in the spatial separation of motifs 1 and 2 for the repressed versus active conformation of MD. The only surprising observation for ClpB-WT is that the 50% increase in acceptor fluorescence upon oligomerization is not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in donor fluorescence. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>, there is no change (increase) in the Trp donor fluorescence upon oligomerization, so it remains unclear why the acceptor fluorescence can double while the donor fluorescence stays unchanged. The authors should briefly discuss this point to strengthen the presented FRET data further.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> the authors present results of disulfide crosslinking between motifs 1 and 2 of neighboring MD domains. The hyperactive Y503D mutant with tilted MD also showed crosslinked multimers, albeit at lower concentrations, which the authors interpret as an indication for rapid MD fluctuations between the different conformations even in the hyperactive state. However, mutants with just a single Cys in either motif 1 or motif 2 also showed significant (presumably non-specific) crosslinking to form dimers (1st and 2nd lane). It is thus possible that the weaker crosslinking observed for the double Cys mutant of Y503D originates to a significant extent from such non-specific crosslinking rather than specific interactions of MDs that fluctuate between different conformations. The authors should therefore consider this background of non-specific crosslinking in their discussion.</p><p>3) Asymmetric reconstructions allowed the authors to reveal heterogeneity in the hexameric ring, with only 3 to 5 subunits in an ATP-binding competent conformation. This is a very exciting finding and consistent with studies on other AAA+ ATPases, showing that only a subset of the 6 subunits has nucleotide bound at any given time. To biochemically confirm their structural data, the authors analyzed nucleotide occupancy by measuring ADP binding in ITC experiments. However, it is unclear to me why they used ADP and not ATPγS, or ATP in combination with a hydrolysis-deficient Walker-B mutant of AAA-2. As the authors well know, ADP is not able to induce an active ring conformation that can bind substrate or the ClpP peptidase. The conformation of an ADP-bound subunit is likely more similar to an empty state than to an ATP-bound state. Therefore, the overall ring-conformation probed in the ITC experiment with ADP probably differs significantly from the hexamer state observed by EM in the presence of ATP, and it is questionable whether an ADP titration experiment indeed provides the right answer regarding the nucleotide occupancy. The authors should consider repeating the ITC experiment for instance with ATP and a Walker-B mutant AAA-2 that is deficient in hydrolysis but can adopt all possible conformations depending on its occupancy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02481.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>, the authors present the measurements of FRET between an engineered Trp in motif 1 and a Cys-linked AEDANS label in motif 2 for wild-type and mutant ClpB.

Higher crosslink products (trimers-hexamers) are, however, much more abundant than controls, supporting the original suggestion of rapid fluctuations in M-domain conformations, which can be captured by crosslinking.</p><p><italic>3) Asymmetric reconstructions allowed the authors to reveal heterogeneity in the hexameric ring, with only 3 to 5 subunits in an ATP-binding competent conformation.

We indeed performed such experiment but in repeated experiments the quality of the obtained ITC curves was not sufficient. We do not know the reason for this problem. We calculated the nucleotide occupancy, but these values are ambiguous because of the poor data quality and we prefer not to show these results. We therefore employed ADP, which provided much better results and allowed an accurate determination of the number of bound nucleotides.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Instrumental responses of successive injections of ATP (4.9 mM or 5.51 mM) into a solution of 380 μM or 496 μM ClpB-E279A/E678A.

Our calculated stoichiometries are in good agreement with numbers obtained for ClpX [Hersch, GL, et al, Cell, 2005], as each AAA domain of ClpB can bind four nucleotides.</p><p>We disagree that an ADP-bound subunit is more similar to an empty state than to an ATP-bound one. HX experiments of ClpB did not reveal differences in protection patterns in ADP and ATPγS, arguing that the conformations are similar [Oguchi, Y, et al, Nat Struct Mol Biol, 2012]. Importantly, both ADP and ATPγS binding led to substantial increase in HX protection compared to nucleotide-free ClpB oligomers, including Walker A motif regions. These data indicate that the overall conformational state of ADP-bound ClpB is more similar to the ATP-bound state than to the empty one.</p><p>It is true that the ADP conformation does not support substrate and ClpP interaction. Both interactions are mediated by flexible loop structures located either at the central channel or at the bottom of the ClpB ring. Nucleotide-driven conformational changes of these mobile elements do not however necessarily reflect substantial conformational changes within the bulk of the AAA+ domains. In fact, soaking of ClpX crystals with either ATPγS, ATP or ADP led to comparable structural changes and ADP, presumably generated by residual hydrolysis, fits best the electron density of an ATPγS-soaked crystal [Glynn, SE, et al, Cell, 2009]. Notably, soaking of ClpX with nucleotides led to asymmetric binding, supporting a model in which ADP also binds asymmetrically to ClpB hexamers. Similarly, binding of either ATP, ATPγS or ADP to ClpX led to the same degree of FRET changes in an experimental setup monitoring the formation of “L” subunits, which show tighter interaction between the large and small subunit of the AAA domain [Stinson, BM, et al, Cell, 2013]. Together these data indicate that nucleotides, irrespective of their identity, cause similar overall structural changes in AAA+ domains.</p></body></sub-article></article>
