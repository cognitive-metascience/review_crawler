However, during starvation-induced stress, COPII vesicles have been implicated as a membrane source for autophagosomes, distinct organelles that engulf cellular components for degradation by macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy). How cells regulate core trafficking machinery to fulfill dramatically different cellular roles in response to environmental cues is unknown. Here we show that phosphorylation of conserved amino acids on the membrane-distal surface of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> COPII cargo adaptor, Sec24, reprograms COPII vesicles for autophagy. We also show casein kinase 1 (Hrr25) is a key kinase that phosphorylates this regulatory surface. During autophagy, Sec24 phosphorylation regulates autophagosome number and its interaction with the C-terminus of Atg9, a component of the autophagy machinery required for autophagosome initiation. We propose that the acute need to produce autophagosomes during starvation drives the interaction of Sec24 with Atg9 to increase autophagosome abundance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21167.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21167.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21167.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When cells experience stressful conditions, such as a shortage of nutrients, they can digest their own material via a ‘self-eating’ process called autophagy and then recycle the products for further use. When autophagy is triggered, a new membrane structure called the autophagosome forms within the cell as it engulfs the material that is to be digested. The autophagosome delivers these materials to a compartment where they are broken down into smaller parts and the resulting raw materials are reused as needed.</p><p>The membranes that make up the autophagosome are derived from other membranes within the cell. These include small membrane-bound compartments called vesicles, which carry proteins from one part of the cell to another, or to the outside of the cell. COPII vesicles, for example, carry out the first transport step in the pathway that leads out of the cell – the so-called secretory pathway. Recently it was found that, when cells are starving, COPII vesicles can be diverted to the autophagy pathway and provide a source of membrane to build the autophagosome. However, it was not understood how the membrane of a COPII vesicle is reprogrammed so that it can interact with the cellular machinery that builds autophagosomes.</p><p>Using genetic and biochemical methods, Davis et al. have now teased apart the distinct roles of COPII vesicles in autophagy and the secretory pathway in budding yeast. The results show that a protein called Sec24, a component of the coat on the vesicles, interacts with another protein called Atg9, which is needed for the first steps of autophagosome formation. Davis et al. observed that Sec24 could be modified by the attachment of phosphate groups at a distinct site on the surface of Sec24. This modification promotes Sec24 to interact with Atg9 and increases the number of autophagosomes that form when cells are starving. Davis et al. also found that the enzyme casein kinase 1 is one of the enzymes responsible for attaching phosphate groups to Sec24.</p><p>Following on from this work, it will be important to test whether modification of vesicle coat proteins is a widespread mechanism for reprogramming membranes for different uses in other situations as well.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21167.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21167.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Autophagy</kwd><kwd>COPII vesicles</kwd><kwd>Secretory pathway</kwd><kwd>Hrr25</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM114111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Saralin</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferro-Novick</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA169186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM085089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stahmer</surname><given-names>Kyle</given-names></name><name><surname>Lakshminarayan</surname><given-names>Ramya</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM115422</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Saralin</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferro-Novick</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UP_1201/10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphorylation of a core trafficking component, the COPII coat subunit Sec24, regulates cross-talk between the secretory and autophagy machinery during starvation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process that uses membrane traffic to target proteins and organelles for degradation. Basal levels of autophagy continuously replenish the cellular pool of amino acids and other metabolites to maintain homeostasis. However, when cells are starved for nutrients, autophagy is quickly upregulated. This upregulation leads to a dramatic intracellular reorganization to meet the high demand for membrane required to form autophagosomes, distinct organelles that target cellular components for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</xref>). Induction of autophagy leads to the formation of a double-membrane structure, called the isolation membrane, that forms adjacent to a pre-autophagosome structure (PAS) where autophagy related proteins (Atg) are recruited in a hierarchical manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</xref>). As the isolation membrane expands, it engulfs cytoplasmic proteins and organelles targeted for degradation before it seals to form an autophagosome. The autophagosome then fuses with the vacuole/lysosome, releasing its contents for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lamb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</xref>). Although the assembly pathway of the Atg proteins is known, the mechanism by which membranes are directed to the autophagy pathway remains a central unanswered question in the field.</p><p>Autophagosome biogenesis has been linked to COPII vesicles and an ER subdomain called the ER exit sites (ERES) where COPII vesicles are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graef et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemus et al., 2016</xref>). How COPII vesicles, which are faithfully targeted to the Golgi, can be reprogrammed to function on an alternate trafficking pathway during nutrient deprivation remains enigmatic. COPII coated vesicle formation is initiated at the ER with the recruitment of an inner coat layer comprising the Sec23/Sec24 complex. Coat polymerization and vesicle budding occur when Sec23/Sec24 recruits a second complex (Sec13/Sec31) that forms the outer shell of the coat. Sec24, the major cargo adaptor of the COPII coat, recruits biosynthetic cargo and SNAREs (which mediate vesicle fusion) into vesicles that are delivered to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lord et al., 2013</xref>). After vesicle fission, the coat lingers on the vesicle to facilitate vesicle targeting to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lord et al., 2011</xref>). COPII vesicle budding mutants, as well as other mutants that disrupt ER-Golgi traffic, also disrupt autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamasaki et al., 2003</xref>). However, a direct functional link between COPII vesicles, the COPII coat and autophagy has been difficult to demonstrate.</p><p>Multiple COPII coat subunits, including Sec23 and Sec24, are phosphorylated by Hrr25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhandari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lord et al., 2011</xref>), a kinase required for ER-Golgi traffic and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lord et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murakami et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yu and Roth, 2002</xref>). Previously, we showed coat phosphorylation is required for COPII vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lord et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Given the recently identified role of COPII vesicles in autophagosome formation, and the observation that Hrr25 is required for autophagy, we asked if coat phosphorylation also functions to regulate vesicle traffic during autophagy. Here we find that phosphorylation of the membrane distal surface of Sec24 promotes the interaction of Sec24 with the C-terminus of Atg9, which is needed for autophagy. Failure to phosphorylate this Sec24 site leads to a decrease in autophagosome number, but not autophagosome expansion. This phosphorylation event is independent of the assembly of the Atg machinery at the PAS. Together these studies reveal a surprising role for coat phosphorylation in reprogramming core trafficking machinery to fulfill a separate function during starvation induced stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Sec24 phosphorylation sites</title><p>To address whether coat phosphorylation allows COPII vesicles to function in autophagy versus ER-Golgi traffic, we purified the COPII inner coat from yeast cells induced for autophagy. Our analysis initially focused on Sec24 as it is the major COPII cargo adaptor. Using mass spectrometry, we identified 27 high confidence Sec24 phosphorylation sites in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and subsequently tested if they specifically affect autophagy but not ER-Golgi traffic. Many of the identified Sec24 phosphosites were conserved in the closely related paralog Iss1, which is also a cargo adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kurihara et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Two of the conserved Sec24 phosphosites (S730 and S735) map to a region of the protein that comprises one of the four well-characterized yeast cargo-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pagant et al., 2015</xref>). The so-called A-site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) packages a SNARE, Sed5, needed for ER-Golgi traffic and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mossessova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tan et al., 2013</xref>), marking these residues as candidate regulatory sites. COPII vesicles formed in vitro with Sec24-S730A/S735A showed normal capture of Sed5 and other cargo, whereas those formed with Sec24-S730D/S735D contained reduced amounts of Sed5 and were modestly impaired in their fusion efficiency with the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Additionally, a strain harboring the Sec24-S730D/S735D mutations had reduced autophagic activity, whereas the Sec24-S730A/S735A mutation had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Because the Sec24-S730D/S735D mutations had effects on both ER-Golgi traffic and autophagy, these sites are unlikely to specify the pathway the vesicle takes and instead highlight the importance of Sed5 packaging into COPII vesicles in both pathways. A second set of conserved phosphosites, S645/S678, located near a known cargo binding site in mammalian Sec24 (mSec24) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), did not disrupt the packaging of any cargo tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21167.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of Sec24 phosphorylation sites required for autophagy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon diagram of Sec23 (lime) and Sec24 (lavender) with groups of key Sec24 phosphorylation sites (green, pink, and teal).

The effects of mutations in these sites on autophagy were monitored in a <italic>sec24Δiss1Δ</italic> double mutant background by assaying Pho8Δ60 activity. Pho8Δ60 is a cytosolic form of vacuolar alkaline phosphatase that is delivered to and activated in the vacuole when autophagy is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klionsky, 2007</xref>). Only combinations of T324A, T325A and T328A were defective in autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, red box). These three sites form a patch located on the membrane distal surface of Sec24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), making them unlikely to regulate cargo packaging. None of the additional 13 phosphosites tested showed autophagy defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>When we dissected the role of individual residues on this membrane distal surface of Sec24, single and double mutant combinations of T324A/T325A/T328A showed a range of defects in Pho8Δ60 activity, with the triple alanine mutant showing the most dramatic defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We were unable to test the full range of phosphomimetic combinations, as some caused lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, none of the viable phosphomimetic mutants showed a defect in autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Sec24-T324A/T325A/T328A (hereafter referred to as Sec24-3A) was further characterized because it had the most dramatic defect in Pho8Δ60 activity. To confirm that phosphorylation of the Sec24 membrane distal surface is required for autophagy, we examined a second autophagy marker, Atg8. Cytosolic GFP-Atg8 is lipidated and incorporated into membrane at the PAS before being delivered to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klionsky et al., 2007</xref>). Translocation of GFP-Atg8 to the vacuole, following nitrogen starvation, was significantly reduced in a strain expressing Sec24-3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This defect was confirmed using western blot analysis by monitoring the cleavage of GFP-Atg8 to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The GFP-Atg8 translocation defect was less severe in the presence of Iss1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right), suggesting functional complementation by the paralogous protein.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21167.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of T324/T325/T328 in Sec24 is required for autophagy, but not ER-Golgi transport.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Vacuolar alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed in lysates prepared from a <italic>sec24∆iss1∆</italic> deletion strain harboring <italic>sec24</italic> alanine mutations.

When autophagy is induced, Atg9 vesicles traffic from the late Golgi to the PAS and localize adjacent to the ER exit sites that produce COPII vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graef et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamamoto et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, similar to our observations with Sec24, Atg9 was recently shown to regulate autophagosome number, but not size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jin et al., 2014</xref>). Proteomics also revealed an interaction between multiple COPII coat subunits and Atg9 in detergent lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graef et al., 2013</xref>). However, it remained unclear from these studies which coat subunit mediated this interaction and whether it was required for autophagy. Therefore, we first confirmed that Sec24 co-precipitates with Atg9 and tested whether this interaction is regulated by starvation. Sec24 was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing Atg9-13myc that were grown in nutrient rich conditions (SMD) or starved for nitrogen (SD-N), and the precipitate was then blotted with anti-myc antibody. Atg9-13myc co-immunoprecipitated with Sec24, but not the pre-immune control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, approximately 2.5-fold more Atg9-13myc co-immunoprecipitated with Sec24 from lysates prepared from nitrogen starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), demonstrating that this interaction is upregulated during starvation.</p><p>Atg9 is a six transmembrane protein with N-terminal, C-terminal and core or middle (M) cytoplasmic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). While the middle and C-terminal domains are present in mammalian cells, the N-terminus is largely absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Young et al., 2006</xref>). In order to determine which domain of Atg9 interacts with Sec24, the cytoplasmic domains of Atg9 were fused to GST and the purified fusion proteins were incubated in vitro with purified Sec23/Sec24 complex. The Sec23/Sec24 complex was used for these studies, since Sec24-His<sub>6</sub> is unstable in the absence of Sec23. Sec24 was predominantly unphosphorylated, as it was purified without phosphatase inhibitors and stored in the freezer following purification. A GST fusion to a Sec31 fragment (aa878-1114), which was previously shown to interact with the Sec23/Sec24 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bi et al., 2007</xref>), served as a positive control. The C-terminus of Atg9 bound to Sec23/Sec24, while the N-terminal and middle hydrophilic Atg9 domains did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, binding of Sec23/Sec24 to the C-terminus increased with increasing concentrations of the Sec23/Sec24 complex and appeared to be saturable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This interaction was also dependent on Sec24, as Sec23 alone did not interact with GST-Atg9C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As the crystal structure of Sec23 and Sec24 are identical whether they are in a complex or not, allosteric effects are unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Next we used the phosphomimetic mutations to ask if the interaction between Sec24 and Atg9 is enhanced by phosphorylation of the membrane distal sites.

Therefore, to cover all three phosphosites of interest in our binding studies, we used Sec23/Sec24-T325E and Sec23/Sec24-T324E/T328E. Consistent with the notion that phosphorylation enhances the Sec24-Atg9 interaction, both T325E and T324E/T328E increased the interaction of Sec24 with GST-Atg9C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the Sec24-Atg9 interaction is regulated by phosphorylation in vivo, wild-type or mutant <italic>sec24</italic> cells co-expressing Atg9-13myc were starved for nitrogen and Sec24 was immunoprecipitated in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors.

Recent studies, however, have suggested Hrr25 has an additional role in autophagy, upstream of COPII vesicle fusion at the PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, we found that while COPII vesicles accumulate at the PAS in some mutants that disrupt autophagy, they failed to accumulate in the <italic>hrr25-5</italic> mutant.

To determine if Hrr25 regulates the Sec24-Atg9 interaction via Sec24 phosphorylation, we asked whether the Sec24 phosphomimetic mutations could rescue the Sec24-Atg9 interaction defect in <italic>hrr25</italic>-5. Sec24 T325/T328 was chosen for this analysis as it contains T328, which is phosphorylated by Hrr25.

Additionally, Sec24 T325E/T328E alleviated the autophagy defect in <italic>hrr25-5</italic> as the vacuolar localization of GFP-Atg8 induced by starvation was partially rescued by Sec24 T325E/T328E, but not Sec24 T325A/T328A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Here we show that phosphorylation of a conserved regulatory domain of the major COPII cargo adaptor Sec24 reprograms the function of COPII vesicles by modulating its interaction with the C-terminus of Atg9, a key component of the autophagy machinery. The C-terminus of Atg9 is present in vertebrates and is essential for autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Young et al., 2006</xref>).

Similarly, failure to phosphorylate the Sec24 regulatory sites, which disrupts the Sec24-Atg9 interaction, specifically affects autophagosome number.

However, given that these sites are only required for autophagosome formation during starvation-induced autophagy, and both phosphorylation and autophagy enhance the Sec24-Atg9 interaction, it seems likely the membrane distal Sec24 surface is specifically phosphorylated when autophagy is induced. As autophagosomes form in proximity to each other in nutrient rich and starved cells, the regulated phosphorylation of Sec24 would prevent the inappropriate fusion of COPII vesicles with Atg9 membranes during constitutive growth.</p><p>Phosphorylation of the Sec24 membrane distal surface is regulated at least in part by Hrr25. We have shown Hrr25 is required for autophagy and functions upstream of COPII vesicle delivery to the PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), but how Hrr25 regulates COPII vesicles on this pathway has been unclear. The findings we present here show that, during autophagy, Hrr25 acts through Sec24 by regulating its interaction with Atg9. As Hrr25 has been linked to the TOR network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breitkreutz et al., 2010</xref>), a key negative regulator of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that Hrr25 works with one or more kinases that act downstream of Tor during nutrient deprivation. We propose that the heightened need to rapidly produce autophagosomes during starvation leads to phosphorylation of the Sec24 membrane distal surface, which enhances the Sec24-Atg9 interaction, resulting in an increase in autophagy to maintain homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These events are independent of the assembly of the Atg hierarchy that occurs when autophagy is induced.</p><p>Previous work has established that ERES and COPII vesicles are required for autophagy in both yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graef et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). However, because it has been difficult to fully tease apart the function of COPII vesicles on the secretory pathway from their role in autophagy, their contribution to autophagy has been problematic to address. Our finding that phosphorylation of a novel conserved regulatory surface of Sec24 is specifically required for autophagy and not ER-Golgi transport conclusively demonstrates that COPII vesicles play a direct role in autophagy, rather than an indirect role in maintaining the trafficking of autophagy machinery through the secretory pathway. Additionally, we can now ascribe an autophagy-specific role to COPII vesicles in enhancing autophagosome number during nutrient deprivation, which is likely to be conserved.</p><p>In mammalian cells, nucleation of autophagosomes occurs in the vicinity of the ER and the Atg9 compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karanasios et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, membrane fractionation identified the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), which resides adjacent to the ER, as the site of lipidation of the Atg8 homologue LC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ge et al., 2014</xref>). During starvation, the ERES were found to translocate to the ERGIC fraction, and although the ERGIC is typically a location of COPI vesicle budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lorente-Rodríguez and Barlowe, 2011</xref>), COPII vesicle budding from this ERGIC fraction was shown to be required for LC3 lipidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ge et al., 2014</xref>). These observations suggested that, in higher eukaryotes, the COPII vesicles used in autophagy are spatially separated from those that traffic to the Golgi. The findings we report here could explain how these spatially segregated COPII vesicles engage the Atg machinery.</p><p>Other components of the secretory pathway have also been implicated in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nair et al., 2011</xref>). It remains to be seen whether these components directly contribute membrane for autophagosome formation or if they only affect the trafficking of autophagy machinery, such as Atg9, to sites of autophagosome formation. It is known that another component of the autophagy machinery, Atg8, controls autophagosome size, but not number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xie et al., 2008</xref>). However, it is unclear if Atg8 is sufficient to drive autophagosome expansion or if additional membranes are required for this event.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings highlight an unexpected role for phosphorylation in regulating the reorganization of membrane trafficking pathways during starvation and demonstrate that the COPII coat is a key target of this regulation. The findings we present here ascribe a new role for Sec24 and the COPII coat, and provide a possible explanation for why the coat is retained on the vesicle subsequent to vesicle scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lord et al., 2011</xref>). Identification of a cellular mechanism that redirects the flow of membrane during autophagy makes it possible to now study how these complex membrane rearrangement events culminate in the formation of a distinct organelle, the autophagosome. Future work will be needed to determine if the diverted COPII vesicles contain autophagy-specific cargo, or if the role of these vesicles in autophagy is solely to bring certain lipids and SNAREs to this pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Media, growth conditions and yeast strains</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

To immunoprecipitate Sec24, 2 mg of lysate was incubated with 10 µl of Sec24 antibody (rabbit polyclonal prepared against GST-Sec24) or 10 µl of pre-immune serum for 2 hr at 4°C with rotation. 50 µl of 50% protein A-sepharose was added and incubated for 45 min at 4°C with rotation. The protein-A beads were pre-incubated with 1 mg/ml BSA for 30 min at 4°C before they were added to the sample to reduce background. The beads were then washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100 and heated in 40 µl of 3x sample buffer for 5 min at 95°C. Note that similar amounts of Atg9-13myc co-immunoprecipitated with Sec24 without the use of crosslinker.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Purification of fusion proteins from bacteria for in vitro binding studies</title><p>To induce expression of GST fusion proteins, bacterial cells were incubated overnight at 18°C with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside.

To devise assays/methods to address this issue is likely to take more than a couple of months which is why my enthusiasm was moderate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic> </p><p>The membrane supplying autophagosome biogenesis has been difficult to clarify. Recent evidence in yeast and mammals indicate the involvement of COPII vesicles as a contribution to the autophagic membrane. However, how COPII vesicles are diverted from ER-Golgi trafficking to support autophagosome biogenesis was not clear. Some previous evidence shed light on the possible mechanism. For example, the Ge L et al. indicated a spatial regulation by generating the COPII from the ERGIC to separate from the COPII for trafficking which is from the ERES (Ge L et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2014) in mammalian cells. Yeast cells lack a special ERGIC. Nonetheless, COPII is still essential for autophagosome biogenesis as shown by the last author's work as well as the Ohsumi group. Since there is no obvious solution to spatially separate the autophagic COPII from the ER-Golgi trafficking COPII in yeast, different mechanisms should be involved. Based on the authors' previous work, they hypothesized that phosphorylation of COPII components should be a reasonable mechanism accounting for the diversion of COPII to autophagy. In the current study, the authors analyzed the phosphorylation of Sec24 because Graef et al. found an association between Sec24 and Atg9 in a previous large scale proteomic analysis (Graef et al. MBoC 2013). They identified the phosphorylation sites of Sec24 and created different loss or gain of function mutations. They found that three membrane distal phosphorylation sites are required for the number of autophagosomes formed during starvation possibly due to their association with Atg9. The Hrr25 is the kinase required for Sec24 phosphorylation and the proposed process shown in the final model. In general, the story is a nice extension of their previous studies. The new advance is to employ the phosphorylation to explain the selection of COPII function. More experiments are necessary to validate the process.</p><p>1) It is not clear at which stage does the Sec24 phosphorylated COPII act. Although the authors showed no effect on Atg9 on PAS, other marker should also be tested such as Atg14, Atg1, Atg17, Atg2, Atg18 and Atg5. Also, it is not shown if Sec24 mutations, such as the 3A or 3E that affects autophagy, also influence the localization of Sec24 on the PAS.</p><p>2) The binding between Sec24 and Atg9 is weak. And the consequence of the interaction is not clear without more biochemical data and interaction site information. The author should find the cytosolic domain of Atg9 that associates with Sec24 and validate with in vitro pull down. Based on this notion, single mutation of this Atg9 domain should also achieve a similar effect of abolishment of Sec24 phosphorylation. Or, the author could express a peptide either from Atg9 or Sec24 to compete off the interaction to further confirm.</p><p>3) Although the model of COPII-Atg9 vesicle fusion looks reasonable and has appeared many times in many of their previous papers, it is not supported by any direct evidence. in vitro fusion should be performed or the fusion should be analyzed in vivo by live cell imaging. The Sec24 mutants should be employed as negative controls.</p><p>From the consultation session:</p><p>The work is preliminary although has some interesting points. Considering their previous work about the negative effect of SEC23 phosphorylation on autophagy (Wang J et al. JCB 2005) while here it is positive effect of SEC24 phosphorylation on autophagy, the role of COPII phosphorylation and how Hrr25 regulates the specific phosphorylation of SEC23 and SEC24 on different sites and different conditions is really complicated. Although it may take more than 2 months to address these concerns, I believe the authors should be able to address the major concerns of the reviewers to improve the current work. In addition, the mechanism of how Hrr25 selects SEC23 and SEC24 as well as specific phosphorylation sites on SEC24 that specifically affect autophagy pathway and ATG9 association is very important and will increase the impact of the study.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Sec24 phosphorylation regulates autophagosome abundance during nutrient deprivation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This group previously reported that Hrr25 is required for autophagy, but what this kinase phosphorylates and how it contributes to autophagosome formation have been unknown. In this study, the authors report that phosphorylation of T324, T325, and T328 of the COPII subunit Sec24 is required for autophagy. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of these residues promotes the interaction between the C-terminus of Atg9 and Sec24, which is important for the increase in the number rather than the size of autophagosomes. Based on these results, the authors propose that COPII vesicles are reprogrammed to be used for autophagosome formation by Hrr25-mediated Sec24 phosphorylation in response to nitrogen starvation.</p><p>This is a resubmitted version and the manuscript has been significantly improved. In particular, the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> showing that the interaction of phosphomimic Sec24 (T324E/T328E) with Atg9 is stronger than that of non-phosphorylated Sec24 and those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> using T325E/T328E in hrr25-5 mutant cells have strengthened the authors' conclusion that Hrr25-mediated phosphorylation of Sec24 is important for binding with Atg9 and autophagy. However, there are several points that need to be addressed, some of which were raised by a new reviewer.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. It is hard to tell that the GFP-Atg8 structures indeed represent autophagosomes rather than precursor structures (phagophores) and the PAS. The size of phagophores and the PAS are smaller than that of closed autophagosomes. It would be ideal to measure the size of GFP-Atg8 structures in ypt7Δ cells, in which closed autophagosomes should accumulate.</p><p>2) Related to the above criticism, it is also difficult to distinguish small autophagosomes from the PAS under nutrient-rich conditions. The presence of small GFP-Atg8 puncta does not necessarily mean that Cvt vesicles are normally formed because they may merely represent the PAS. Thus, the authors' proposal that COPII vesicles contribute to autophagosome formation under starvation but not nutrient-rich conditions (Cvt vesicle formation) should be carefully reevaluated. In fact, it was reported that COPII mutants are defective in the Cvt pathway (Reggiori et al. Mol Biol Cell 15, 2189, 2004). The Cvt pathway should be directly examined by seeing the maturation of Ape1 in the 3A mutant.</p><p>3) It is difficult to conclude that COPII vesicles localize to the PAS by simply observing Sec13 puncta, most of which likely represent ER exit sites. It would be difficult to distinguish the ERESs and COPII vesicles by fluorescence microscopy. Other groups concluded that the PAS forms in the vicinity of the ER exit site based on results of similar experiments.</p><p>4) The title and/or Abstract should provide a clear indication of the biological system under investigation (i.e., species name or broader taxonomic group, if appropriate). Please revise your title and/or abstract with this advice in mind.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21167.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic> </p><p><italic>The first part that describe the identification of Sec24 phosphorylation sites (T324/T325/T328) specifically important for autophagy is clear.

It is also unclear how the Sec24-Atg9 interaction regulates the number, rather than the size, of the autophagosome.</italic> </p><p>We agree that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not entirely central to the final conclusions of our study and have moved these data to the supplement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Speaking to the novelty of the Atg9/Sec24 interaction, we note that although an earlier proteomics study linked Atg9 to multiple COPII coat subunits, it was not shown which COPII coat subunit drives this interaction. Furthermore, and most importantly, the significance of this interaction was not explored in the earlier study. Specifically, it was not demonstrated that the COPII-Atg9 interaction is required for autophagy. We now provide additional data that supports a role for Hrr25 in modulating autophagy via the Sec24 phosphosites (i.e. the suppression of Hrr25 autophagy defects by the Sec24 phosphomimetic mutations). Thus, our data shows the Atg9-COPII interaction is mediated by Sec24, regulated by the CK1 kinase Hrr25, and used as a mechanism to commit a COPII vesicle to the macroautophagy pathway. This is a novel discovery that contributes to our understanding of how membrane traffic is regulated during autophagy.</p><p><italic>1) It is unclear how Sec24 phosphorylation regulates the COPII-Atg9 vesicle interaction as shown in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. To examine the requirement of the Sec24-Atg9 binding in autophagosome biogenesis, it is important to identify the binding sites in both Sec24 and Atg9 and generate binding-deficient mutants.</italic> </p><p>We have now performed in vitro binding experiments with His-tagged Sec24 and Sec23 using fragments of Atg9 fused to GST. Monomeric Sec24 is unstable in the absence of Sec23, so we used purified Sec23/Sec24 complex to demonstrate a direct interaction between Atg9 and Sec23/Sec24. Additionally, using bacterially-expressed monomeric Sec23, to rule out an interaction between Atg9 and Sec23, allows us to conclude that the Atg9-COPII coat interaction requires Sec24. We note that the crystal structure of Sec23 and Sec24 are identical whether they are in complex with each other or not, making allosteric effects entirely unlikely. We further defined the site of interaction with Atg9 by domain dissection. Atg9 is a multi-spanning transmembrane protein that contains cytoplasmic N-(Atg9N; aa 2-318) and C- (Atg9C; aa 747- 997) termini. The middle of the protein is membrane-bound with a small domain (Atg9M; aa 395-534) that faces the cytosol. We fused the three cytoplasmic domains of Atg9 to GST, purified them from bacteria and performed in vitro binding experiments with purified Sec23/Sec24 complex. We found that the Sec23/Sec24 complex bound in vitro to GST-Atg9C. Importantly, binding is specific, appears to be saturable and dependent on the presence of Sec24 in the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-F</xref>). We also showed Sec24 phosphorylation enhances the interaction of the Sec23/Sec24 complex with Atg9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Therefore, our data implies the <italic>sec24</italic> triple alanine and double alanine mutants are binding deficient mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, 5C</xref>).</p><p>We also made truncations of the N and C terminal domains of Atg9, as well as portions of the core middle domain, to examine the interaction of Sec24 with Atg9 in vivo. Unfortunately, truncated Atg9 rapidly degraded during the cell lysis procedure used for immunoprecipitation. We encountered similar problems when we expressed fragments of Sec24 in yeast. Nonetheless, the sum total of our findings show that phosphorylation of the conserved membrane distal α helix of Sec24 increases the binding affinity of the Sec23/Sec24 complex with the C-terminus of Atg9 in vitro and in vivo.</p><p><italic>2) The association of the COPII vesicles and Atg9 vesicles should be extensively investigated using biochemical methods and dependency on the Sec24 phosphorylation and the Sec24-Atg9 binding should also be tested.</italic> </p><p>We agree that understanding the association of Atg9 vesicles with COPII vesicles is an important question. We have now extensively studied the interaction of Sec24 with domains of Atg9 (described in Point 1 above, also see new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref> and the corresponding supplemental data). We initially attempted to form Atg9 vesicles in vitro and monitor their fusion with COPII vesicles. However, the yield of Atg9 vesicles formed in vitro was very low, and the Atg8 lipidation reaction is not very efficient in yeast, leading us to abandon this approach. More recently, in collaboration with Thomas Wollert’s lab, we have been examining the interaction of COPII-coated liposomes with liposomes containing Atg9. Consistent with our in vitro binding data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), preliminary experiments using the Atg9 core incorporated into liposomes (aa 281-779 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) showed no specific interaction with coated vesicles containing Sec24. These experiments were complicated by the lipid composition used in the Atg9 vesicle preparation, and the affinity of each component for lipids. We are thus continuing to collaborate with Thomas’s lab to better dissect the membrane-related effects of Sec24 and Atg9, but this avenue goes beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>: Showing autophagy-dependent cleavage of GFP-Atg8 by immunoblotting will complement the results.</italic> </p><p>We now include a gel to show the cleavage of GFP-Atg8 in the s<italic>ec24</italic> triple alanine mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) It is not clear whether Hrr25 contributes to autophagy indeed through Sec24 phosphorylation. This can be tested by expression of the phosphomimetic Sec24 SE mutant in hrr25-5 mutant cells. The binding between Sec24 SE and Atg9 should be tested in hrr25 mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</italic> </p><p>This was an excellent suggestion. We now show that Sec24 T325E/T328E, but not Sec24 T325A/T328A, partially restores the interaction of Sec24 with Atg9 in the <italic>hrr25-5</italic> mutant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Furthermore, since demonstrating that Hrr25 contributes to autophagy through Sec24 phosphorylation is a key point in the manuscript, we have also added additional data that strengthen this point. We now show that Sec24 T325E/T328E, but not Sec24 T325A/T328A, largely restores the autophagy defect in the <italic>hrr25-5</italic> mutant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). We demonstrate this in two ways: by analyzing the translocation of GFP-Atg8 to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and by examining the cleavage of GFP-Atg8 in the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we measured the accumulation of autophagic bodies in the <italic>hrr25-5</italic> mutant by transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). This analysis revealed that like the <italic>sec24</italic> triple alanine mutant, the <italic>hrr25-5</italic> mutant accumulates less autophagic bodies than wild- type, indicating that there is a reduction in the number of autophagosomes that form in the absence of Hrr25 kinase activity. Furthermore, as we found with the <italic>sec24</italic> triple alanine mutant, the loss of Hrr25 activity does not affect autophagosome size.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic> </p><p><italic>My opinion is mixed.

We also show Sec24 phosphorylation and Hrr25 do not indirectly disrupt autophagy by blocking the assembly of the Atg machinery at the PAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, we now demonstrate that Sec24 phosphorylation directly regulates the interaction of the Sec23/Sec24 complex with Atg9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and this interaction is needed for autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our results indicate Sec24 interacts with Atg9 after Atg9 traffics to the PAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Absent from a complete in vitro reconstitution, we believe our efforts to place these regulatory events in context are extensive, and are consistent with the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic> </p><p><italic>The membrane supplying autophagosome biogenesis has been difficult to clarify. Recent evidence in yeast and mammals indicate the involvement of COPII vesicles as a contribution to the autophagic membrane. However, how COPII vesicles are diverted from ER-Golgi trafficking to support autophagosome biogenesis was not clear. Some previous evidence shed light on the possible mechanism. For example, the Ge L et al. indicated a spatial regulation by generating the COPII from the ERGIC to separate from the COPII for trafficking which is from the ERES (Ge L et al. eLife 2014) in mammalian cells. Yeast cells lack a special ERGIC. Nonetheless, COPII is still essential for autophagosome biogenesis as shown by the last author's work as well as the Ohsumi group. Since there is no obvious solution to spatially separate the autophagic COPII from the ER-Golgi trafficking COPII in yeast, different mechanisms should be involved. Based on the authors' previous work, they hypothesized that phosphorylation of COPII components should be a reasonable mechanism accounting for the diversion of COPII to autophagy. In the current study, the authors analyzed the phosphorylation of Sec24 because Graef et al. found an association between Sec24 and Atg9 in a previous large scale proteomic analysis (Graef et al. MBoC 2013). They identified the phosphorylation sites of Sec24 and created different loss or gain of function mutations. They found that three membrane distal phosphorylation sites are required for the number of autophagosomes formed during starvation possibly due to their association with Atg9. The Hrr25 is the kinase required for Sec24 phosphorylation and the proposed process shown in the final model. In general, the story is a nice extension of their previous studies. The new advance is to employ the phosphorylation to explain the selection of COPII function. More experiments are necessary to validate the process.</italic> </p><p>We would like to clarify that our motivation for studying Sec24 phosphorylation predates the proteomics study that linked multiple COPII coat subunits to Atg9. Since we first reported the COPII coat has targeting functions (Cai et al., 2007 Nature vol445: 941-944), we have been trying to understand the targeting function of the coat. Our interest in understanding the role of coat phosphorylation began when we reported that Sec23 and Sec24 are phosphorylated by Hrr25 (Lord et al., 2011 Nature vol 473:181-186). We began analyzing the role of Sec24 and Sec23 phosphosites in autophagy when we found Hrr25 acts in macroautophagy (Wang et al. 2015 J Cell Biol vol 210:273-285).</p><p>Furthermore, we believe the mechanism we describe here is likely to be conserved from yeast to higher eukaryotes. The phosphosites in Sec24 are conserved and Sec24 binds to the C- terminus of Atg9, which is conserved in vertebrates. It is also well known that the functions of Hrr25 are conserved from yeast to man. Our studies differ from the Ge et al. work in that they describe a molecular mechanism by which COPII vesicles recognize the Atg machinery. Even if the COPII vesicles used in autophagosome formation are spatially separated from the vesicles that traffic between the ER and Golgi in mammals, the vesicles used in autophagy have to recognize the Atg machinery. We have added a new section in the Discussion to address how our work relates to Ge et al. 2014.</p><p><italic>1) It is not clear at which stage does the Sec24 phosphorylated COPII act. Although the authors showed no effect on Atg9 on PAS, other marker should also be tested such as Atg14, Atg1, Atg17, Atg2, Atg18 and Atg5. Also, it is not shown if Sec24 mutations, such as the 3A or 3E that affects autophagy, also influence the localization of Sec24 on the PAS.</italic> </p><p>As described above in the response to reviewer #2, our data now show that Sec24 (see new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) and Hrr25 (see new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) are not required for the assembly of the Atg machinery. To show this, we tested a member of each of the groups in the Atg hierarchy (see asterisk in each group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and demonstrated they are all recruited normally to the PAS in the <italic>sec24</italic> triple alanine and <italic>hrr25-5</italic> mutants. We also found that the recruitment of Atg14 and Atg2 are normal in the <italic>sec12-4</italic> mutant at its restrictive temperature of 37oC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Therefore, our data with the <italic>sec12</italic> mutant are consistent with the data we obtained with the <italic>sec24</italic> triple alanine and <italic>hrr25-5</italic> mutants.</p><p>With regard to the second part of this concern (i.e. Also, it is not shown if Sec24 mutations, such as the 3A or 3E that affects autophagy, also influence the localization of Sec24 on the PAS), as we previously reported for <italic>hrr25-5</italic>, we did not see an effect on the localization of COPII vesicles at the PAS with Sec24-3A. But to properly interpret this experiment, we need to do an epistasis experiment in the <italic>sec24Δiss1Δ</italic> strain background with an <italic>atg</italic> mutant that disrupts localization (see Figure Supplement 5 in Wang et al. 2015 J Cell Biol vol 210:273-285). Despite our continued efforts, we have been unable to make this mutant. However, we now show that ERES are not disrupted in the <italic>sec24</italic> triple alanine mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The ERES were marked by Sec13, not Sec24, for this experiment as it simplified the experiment (i.e. simpler than adding the triple alanine mutations on Sec24-3X-GFP and integrating tagged Sec24 into the genome). ERES in the triple <italic>sec24</italic> phosphomimetic mutant could not be examined as this strain is inviable.</p><p><italic>2) The binding between Sec24 and Atg9 is weak. And the consequence of the interaction is not clear without more biochemical data and interaction site information. The author should find the cytosolic domain of Atg9 that associates with Sec24 and validate with</italic> in vitro <italic>pull down. Based on this notion, single mutation of this Atg9 domain should also achieve a similar effect of abolishment of Sec24 phosphorylation. Or, the author could express a peptide either from Atg9 or Sec24 to compete off the interaction to further confirm.</italic> </p><p>As described in detail above to reviewer #1 (see comment #1), we now map the domain in Atg9 that interacts with Sec24.</p><p><italic>3) Although the model of COPII-Atg9 vesicle fusion looks reasonable and has appeared many times in many of their previous papers, it is not supported by any direct evidence.</italic> in vitro <italic>fusion should be performed or the fusion should be analyzed</italic> in vivo <italic>by live cell imaging. The Sec24 mutants should be employed as negative controls.</italic> </p><p>We agree that examination of the interaction between COPII vesicles and Atg9 vesicles is a next key question. However, as described above (see comment #2 to Reviewer #1), this is a complex problem to dissect and remains beyond the scope of the current study. Please note that we provide support for the proposal that COPII vesicles fuse with Atg9 vesicles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and paragraph #1 in the Discussion. While this experiment does not provide direct proof for our model, it does support our model as only some mutants that disrupt autophagy lead to the accumulation of COPII vesicles at the PAS when autophagy is blocked (also see the last section of the Results entitled “Hrr25 regulates autophagy via Sec24”). Live cell imaging experiments are unlikely to be productive in yeast given their small size and the difficulty in tracking puncta that change composition over time. However, we are currently doing experiments with mammalian cells to support our model and these experiments may be feasible in the future, but are currently beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>From the consultation session:</italic> </p><p><italic>The work is preliminary although has some interesting points. Considering their previous work about the negative effect of SEC23 phosphorylation on autophagy (Wang J et al. JCB 2005) while here it is positive effect of SEC24 phosphorylation on autophagy, the role of COPII phosphorylation and how Hrr25 regulates the specific phosphorylation of SEC23 and SEC24 on different sites and different conditions is really complicated. Although it may take more than 2 months to address these concerns, I believe the authors should be able to address the major concerns of the reviewers to improve the current work. In addition, the mechanism of how Hrr25 selects SEC23 and SEC24 as well as specific phosphorylation sites on SEC24 that specifically affect autophagy pathway and ATG9 association is very important and will increase the impact of the study.</italic> </p><p>We agree that understanding how Hrr25 specifically interacts with Sec23 and Sec24 is a key question. We now use complementation experiments to provide additional evidence that Hrr25 acts in autophagy via phosphorylation of the Sec24 membrane distal regulatory surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results clarify our earlier finding that Hrr25 is a positive regulator of autophagy (Wang et al. 2015 J Cell Biol vol 210:273-28).</p><p>We previously reported that phosphomimetic (but not alanine) mutations at two sites (S742 and T747) in Sec23 disrupt ER-Golgi traffic and autophagy (Lord et al., 2011 Nature vol 473:181-186; Wang et al. 2015 J Cell Biol vol 210:273-28). These phosphomimetic mutations were shown to interfere with the binding of TRAPP (Ypt1/Rab1 GEF) to Sec23 (Lord et al., 2011 Nature vol 473:181-186). Technically, these previous data showed that dephosphorylation (not phosphorylation) of Sec23 is required for both autophagy and ER-Golgi traffic.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. It is hard to tell that the GFP-Atg8 structures indeed represent autophagosomes rather than precursor structures (phagophores) and the PAS. The size of phagophores and the PAS are smaller than that of closed autophagosomes. It would be ideal to measure the size of GFP-Atg8 structures in ypt7Δ cells, in which closed autophagosomes should accumulate.</italic> </p><p>In response to this point, I wrote to the editorial office stating “we believe we already addressed concern #1 by the EM analysis we performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F, G</xref>).” We received a positive response (below) that we have addressed by changes to the figures and text. We hope this clarifies our conclusions.</p><p><italic>Response from editors:</italic></p><p><italic>&quot;We understand that the EM data convincingly show the decrease in the number not size of autophagic bodies in sec24 triple alanine mutant cells. However, the fluorescence data do not support this conclusion as explained in the previous comments. If the authors wish to retain the fluorescence data, it is important to state that the GFP-Atg8 structures represent either the PAS, phagophore, or autophagosome, and it is difficult to conclude that the size of autophagosome is not affected. For example, the Y-axis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref> cannot be &quot;autophagosome number/diameter&quot;. These should be &quot;GFP-Atg8 puncta number/diameter (/cell)&quot;.</italic></p><p>We believe the SIM data contributes to our study, so we have retained the data, but we have changed the Y-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> to &quot;GFP-Atg8 puncta number/diameter (/cell)&quot;. The text and legends have been changed accordingly. We now make it clear that the GFP-Atg8 puncta could represent either the PAS, phagophores or autophagosomes.</p><p><italic>2) Related to the above criticism, it is also difficult to distinguish small autophagosomes from the PAS under nutrient-rich conditions. The presence of small GFP-Atg8 puncta does not necessarily mean that Cvt vesicles are normally formed because they may merely represent the PAS. Thus, the authors' proposal that COPII vesicles contribute to autophagosome formation under starvation but not nutrient-rich conditions (Cvt vesicle formation) should be carefully reevaluated. In fact, it was reported that COPII mutants are defective in the Cvt pathway (Reggiori et al. Mol Biol Cell 15, 2189, 2004). The Cvt pathway should be directly examined by seeing the maturation of Ape1 in the 3A mutant.</italic> </p><p>We have directly examined the Cvt pathway, by examining Ape1 maturation, and now show there is no processing defect in the <italic>sec24</italic> alanine mutants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the isogenic wild-type strain we use, Ape1 is partially processed. Nonetheless, it is clear that the <italic>sec24</italic> alanine mutants process Ape1 as well as wild-type. We also note that, while Reggioro et al. 2004 (MBoC 15, 2189) concluded that COPII vesicles are required on the Cvt pathway, Ishihara et al. 2001 (MBoC 12, 3690) disagree. Their EM analysis showed Cvt vesicle formation occurs normally in a <italic>sec12</italic> mutant. This is consistent with our observations.</p><p><italic>3) It is difficult to conclude that COPII vesicles localize to the PAS by simply observing Sec13 puncta, most of which likely represent ER exit sites. It would be difficult to distinguish the ERESs and COPII vesicles by fluorescence microscopy. Other groups concluded that the PAS forms in the vicinity of the ER exit site based on results of similar experiments.</italic> </p><p>This is a good point and we should have been more careful with our phrasing. We now refer to Sec13 puncta as COPII coated structures, which includes ERES and COPII vesicles (see first paragraph in the Discussion).</p><p><italic>4) The title and/or Abstract should provide a clear indication of the biological system under investigation (i.e., species name or broader taxonomic group, if appropriate).
