This is due to the fact that female cells inactivate one X in a process known as X chromosome inactivation (XCI), to correct for male/female (F/M) gene dosage imbalances caused by the presence of two X chromosomes. In addition, to adjust for X/autosomal (X/A) imbalances arising from transcription of both autosomal copies of most genes, it is thought that male and female cells upregulate gene expression from the single active X two-fold.</p><p>Beginning at the 4-cell stage in female mouse embryos, imprinted XCI (iXCI) exclusively silences the paternally inherited X (Xp), and this pattern of XCI is maintained in extraembryonic trophoblast cells. In contrast, epiblast cells in the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts that will give rise to the embryo reactivate the Xp and undergo a random form of XCI (rXCI) around implantation (E5-E5.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Disteche, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Payer and Lee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galupa and Heard, 2015</xref>). During XCI the long non-coding RNA <italic>Xist</italic> progressively paints the X chromosome from which it is synthesized, thereby triggering repressive histone modifications including H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Plath et al., 2003</xref>) and transcriptional silencing of X-linked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Disteche, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Payer and Lee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galupa and Heard, 2015</xref>). <italic>Xist</italic> is required both for iXCI and rXCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marahrens et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Penny et al., 1996</xref>). The X-linked gene <italic>Rlim</italic> encodes a ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ostendorff et al., 2002</xref>) that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiao et al., 2013</xref>) and modulates transcription via regulating nuclear multiprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Güngör et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Rlim</italic> promotes the formation of <italic>Xist</italic> clouds both during iXCI in female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) and in female embryonic stem cells (ESCs) undergoing rXCI in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Bemmel et al., 2016</xref>). In mice, however, <italic>Rlim</italic> is dispensable for rXCI in epiblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shin et al., 2014</xref>). While both <italic>Rlim</italic> and <italic>Xist</italic> play essential roles during iXCI in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marahrens et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), questions remain with regards to their functions on the general kinetics of X-linked gene expression, their functional interconnection and the contribution of maternally vs embryonically expressed RLIM for iXCI. Moreover, while evidence for X/A upregulation was observed not only in adult mouse tissues but also in mouse ES cells and epiblast cells at blastocyst stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2007</xref>), details on the developmental X upregulation are lacking.</p><p>We have carried out RNA-seq on single mouse embryos to investigate the regulation of X-linked gene expression during pre- and peri-implantation development by <italic>Rlim</italic>. Analyses of WT, <italic>Rlim-</italic>knockout (KO) or <italic>Xist-</italic>KO embryos reveal that <italic>Rlim</italic> is required for maintenance of <italic>Xist</italic> clouds and iXCI in female embryos at blastocyst stages. In addition, our data uncover that X dosage compensation via iXCI in female mice occurs concurrently with a general X/A upregulation in both male and female preimplantation embryos. These results represent a comprehensive view on the regulation of X-linked gene expression during early mouse embryogenesis by <italic>Rlim</italic> and <italic>Xist</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Elucidation of the mouse preimplantation transcriptome by single embryo RNA-seq</title><p>Several studies have investigated the dynamics of XCI and X-silencing in female ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marks et al., 2015</xref>) or trophoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calabrese et al., 2012</xref>) using RNA-seq. To assess the general dynamics of X-linked gene expression and iXCI in vivo, we have adapted single cell RNA-seq technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shalek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jaitin et al., 2014</xref>) to elucidate the pre- and peri-implantation transcriptome using single mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). This is a valid strategy because (1) early embryos consist of a limited number of cell types: essentially one totipotent cell type up to E3, and three cell types at blastocyst stages - epiblast, trophoblast and primitive endoderm cells - that express known marker genes (2) cells of preimplantation embryos undergo iXCI that exclusively silences the Xp and (3) in mice there is only a relatively small number of genes that escape XCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finn et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, using RNA-seq we examined embryos at the 4- and 8-cell stages, early and late morula (E2.5 and E3.0), and blastocyst stages (E3.5, E4.0 and E4.5), comparing global changes in gene expression. We also included trophoblasts isolated from blastocyst outgrowths of cultured E4.0 embryos in our analyses. In contrast to previous studies on single cells of preimplantation embryos that were performed in a mixed genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2014</xref>), embryos were generated in a C57BL/6 background to exclude potential background influences on the general kinetics of iXCI and/or X upregulation. Moreover, because the known functions of <italic>Rlim</italic> during mouse embryogenesis are restricted to XCI in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2014</xref>), RNA-seq experiments were performed on WT and <italic>Rlim</italic>KO embryos. Based on a mouse model allowing a conditional KO (cKO) of the <italic>Rlim</italic> gene, we have previously generated females carrying a maternally transmitted <italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre-mediated cKO allele and a paternally transmitted germline KO allele (<italic>Rlim<sup>cKOm/Δp-SC</sup></italic>). These females appear healthy, fertile and lack RLIM in all somatic tissues as well as their germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shin et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, to efficiently generate male and female germline <italic>Rlim</italic> KO embryos (<italic>Δ/Y</italic>, <italic>Δ/Δ</italic>) and to eliminate potential influences of maternal RLIM in oocytes on the iXCI process, all <italic>Rlim</italic> KO embryos were generated by crossing <italic>Rlim<sup>cKOm/Δp-SC</sup></italic> females with germline KO males (<italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Y</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). RNA was prepared and barcoded RNA-seq libraries were constructed from 187 samples that were distributed between two 96-well plates, each with similar numbers of embryos from each stage and mating. Libraries were pooled and sequenced to an average read depth of 2.95 million reads. This read depth lies within the range typically obtained by using single-cell technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shalek et al., 2013</xref>). The gender of each embryo was determined by assessing expression of Y-linked genes, which occurs only in male embryos, and <italic>Xist</italic>, which is expressed only in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). 12 samples for which gender could not be assigned or displayed less than 280,000 total reads were removed, leaving 175 samples for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Mapping reads from WT and KO embryos to the <italic>Rlim</italic> locus showed that the deleted region in KO embryos was not represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; data not shown), validating both the mating strategy and the specificity of the data obtained via whole embryo RNA-seq. Because of expected differences in expression of X-linked genes during preimplantation development between genders and between females WT and KO for <italic>Rlim</italic>, each library was normalized to its total autosomal gene expression rather than expression of all genes on chromosomes. As expected, comparing Log2-transformed data of 10552 annotated genes that are expressed at all examined developmental stages revealed no significant differences in gene expression at the chromosome level between Rlim<sup>Δ/Y</sup> and WT/Y males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), consistent with the finding that male mice lacking <italic>Rlim</italic> develop normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). Analyses of WT embryos (pooled male and female embryos for each stage), showed that the developmental transcript profiles matched well with expression of epiblast markers <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (Oct4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schöler et al., 1990</xref>) and <italic>Nanog</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitsui et al., 2003</xref>) and trophoblast marker <italic>Krt8</italic> (Troma1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brûlet and Jacob, 1982</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The observed variations between replicates were well within margins previously observed for single cell RNA-seq technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jaitin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shalek et al., 2013</xref>), and comparison of expression levels of these cell markers between <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> and WT/WT females suggested that the general cell type specification events that occur at blastocyst stages were similar in embryos of both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Because <italic>Rlim</italic> is X-linked and its functions appear restricted to females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiao et al., 2012</xref>), expression of this gene was evaluated in female WT/WT embryos only. <italic>Rlim</italic> RNA levels decreased from the 4-cell to the 8-cell stage, possibly due to depletion of maternal pools, then gradually increased up to E3.5, and decreased thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Because the <italic>Xist</italic> gene is located within the <italic>Tsix</italic> gene, which is transcribed in the antisense orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Lu, 1999</xref>), we examined the locations of reads mapping to this locus. We detected a high read density located precisely within the <italic>Xist</italic> transcription unit (&gt;90% of reads) and very few reads in introns or exons specific to <italic>Tsix</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that the detected reads mostly correspond to <italic>Xist</italic> RNA. <italic>Xist</italic> levels in WT female embryos increased dramatically from the 4-cell to the 8-cell stages and peaked around E3.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with the detection of <italic>Xist</italic> transcription foci in early <italic>Rlim</italic> KO female embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), the developmental onset of <italic>Xist</italic> was similar in <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> females, but significantly lower levels of <italic>Xist</italic> were measured only after E3.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Random subsampling of libraries to 200,000 reads per embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robinson and Storey, 2014</xref>) showed a similar <italic>Xist</italic> expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, strand-specific RT-qPCR confirmed that <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> females expressed similar levels of <italic>Xist</italic> when compared to WT/WT at E2.5, but much lower levels at E3.5 and thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results prompted us to examine <italic>Xist</italic> clouds in females at E2.5 morula and E3.5 blastocyst stages, comparing <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> with WT/WT embryos. This was done via RNA FISH, co-staining with probes against <italic>Rlim,</italic> which recognizes both the WT and KO transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), and <italic>Xist</italic>. As expected, <italic>Xist</italic> clouds were detected in WT embryos of both embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). In these female embryos most/all cells exhibited clouds except those undergoing mitosis. <italic>Xist</italic> clouds were also detected in a significant number of <italic>Rlim</italic> KO embryos at both developmental stages. In contrast to WT/WT, however, in <italic>Xist</italic> cloud-positive <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> embryos at E2.5, the number of cells displaying clouds was highly variable, ranging between 1 cell to most cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). As few cells of 8-cell staged female embryos lacking RLIM display <italic>Xist</italic> clouds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), these results indicate that <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> females develop <italic>Xist</italic> clouds at morula stages, but likely with a slower kinetics when compared to WT/WT females.

In female WT/WT embryos the gene dosage was close to two-fold that of males at early developmental stages (likely due to two active X chromosomes) and then, starting at morula stages, gradually decreased to a gene dosage similar to that of males by late blastocyst stages, consistent with Xp silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results are in agreement with recent data obtained from allele-specific RNA-seq on single cells both from early mouse preimplantation embryos with a mixed genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>) and human preimplantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petropoulos et al., 2016</xref>).

Considering an estimated average half-life of around 10 hr for mRNAs in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2003</xref>) including mouse preimplantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kidder and Pedersen, 1982</xref>), the detection of initial X-silencing at late morula/early blastocyst stages via RNA-seq on whole embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) fits well with published data obtained by RNA FISH that show diminished transcription foci of X-linked protein-encoding genes generally starting between the 8-cell and morula stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Patrat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Namekawa et al., 2010</xref>).

Comparing the developmental expression pattern between female <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> and male embryos revealed very few changes in autosomal gene expression due to the <italic>Rlim</italic> mutation, suggesting that the main function of <italic>Rlim</italic> in early embryonic gene regulation is in X-silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Indeed, examination of the silencing pattern of 351 annotated X-linked genes in WT females showed that gene silencing occurs within most regions on the X chromosome both during the early (8-cell to E3) and late phase (E3 to E4.5) of iXCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, expression of several genes located in a region on the XqE3/F1 border is notably higher at early preimplantation stages in females WT and KO for <italic>Rlim</italic> when compared to males. Interestingly, this region overlaps a 1.1 Mb region that has been involved with meiotic regulation during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, levels of genes known to escape X-silencing during rXCI including <italic>Kdm6a</italic> and <italic>Kdm5c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berletch et al., 2010</xref>) were also not significantly down-regulated during iXCI (not shown). As we are not able to distinguish mRNAs transcribed from the Xm or Xp, we cannot exclude the contribution of developmental transcriptional regulation and/or effects of differential parental imprinting in these regions. To further examine X expression profiles in females, we compared the distributions of female E3/8-cell and E4.5/8-cell expression ratios of 755 X-linked genes that are expressed in at least 3 embryos. Results showed that there are little differences in expression profiles between E3/8-cell ratios of WT/WT and <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), whereas E4.5/8-cell ratios in <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> females are generally two-fold higher when compared to WT/WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To verify global Xp silencing we performed an independent RNA-seq experiment on 3 male and 3 female WT embryos with a heterozygous C57Bl/6 (B6) and castaneus/Eij (CAST) background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) allowing a direct comparison of data processed via F/M or by an allele-specific analysis. We chose embryos at E3.5 because at this stage about half of the X is silenced in female embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Indeed, in B6<sub>m</sub>/CAST<sub>p</sub> embryos we measured only around 50% of X-linked CAST transcripts when compared to transcripts originating from the B6 X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These results provide independent confirmation that the decline in F/M values of X-linked transcripts in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is due to X<sub>p</sub>-silencing. These data corroborate our previous results and are consistent with (1) partial silencing of overall X-linked genes in female E3 embryos of both genotypes, and (2) the general silencing of one X chromosome in E4.5 WT/WT but not <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> females. Thus, our combined results distinguish an early <italic>Rlim</italic>-independent phase of iXCI in totipotent cells up to around E3 that leads to partial Xp-silencing, and a late phase after E3 that is <italic>Rlim</italic>-dependent and leads to robust Xp-silencing. These data further confirm that the process of iXCI progressively adjusts the X-linked gene dosage from the 8-cell stage to E4.5 during early female development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Embryonic <italic>Rlim</italic> is required for iXCI in female mice</title><p>Because RLIM protein is rapidly turned-over during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ostendorff et al., 2002</xref>), if RLIM is required for X-silencing only after E3, this predicts that maternal stores of RLIM will not be sufficient for iXCI but that RLIM synthesized by the embryo is required for later stages of the iXCI process. To confirm that embryonic RLIM plays a crucial role for iXCI after E3 we targeted the maternally transmitted conditional <italic>Rlim</italic> allele via a paternally transmitted <italic>Rosa26</italic>-Cre (R26C) transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soriano, 1999</xref>), from which Cre is induced after zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Indeed, an R26C-mediated deletion of the <italic>Rlim</italic> allele on the Xm led to embryonic lethality in a female-specific parent-of-origin effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), similar to the germline <italic>Rlim</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>).

Consistent with the fact that the floxed region in these mice encompasses parts of the promoter, reads in <italic>Xist</italic> were low in all embryos of all developmental stages (not shown). Therefore, the gender of each embryo was determined by assessing expression of Y-linked genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Indeed, male mouse ES cells and epiblast cells in blastocysts display X/A values of around 0.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2007</xref>). While these results indicate incomplete X upregulation they nonetheless suggest that this upregulation might be initiated during preimplantation development. To assess alterations in the X/A ratio during preimplantation development we calculated the average total expression (FPKM) of X-linked versus total autosomal genes within each embryo. This approach removes the possibility that low expressing genes, which are more frequent on the X chromosome when compared to autosomes and vary in different cell types, influence or bias the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2011</xref>). Because of XCI in females, this analysis was first carried out on males. Our results revealed gradually increasing levels of transcription from the X relative to autosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and the total increase between the 4-cell stage to E4.5 was 1.58 fold (P&lt;10–11; Students t-test). Calculating X/A values using a previously published RNA-seq dataset (GSE45719 in GEO repository) on single mouse preimplantation cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2014</xref>), generally confirms these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). When we examined average expression from single chromosomes (normalized against 4-cell stage levels) we observed that, among all chromosomes, gene expression from the X displayed the highest increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Next, we compared the contribution of chromosomes towards total gene expression in males of each developmental stage by taking into account the numbers of annotated genes located on each chromosome. These analyses showed that, consistent with the presence of one X chromosome, at the earliest time point measured, the contribution of the X was much lower than that of any autosome, only around 0.5 fold of the average autosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This contribution gradually increased to around 0.77 fold measured at E4.5, which was the 14<sup>th</sup> most highly expressed of the 20 chromosomes. These results are in general agreement with X/A levels previously measured in male murine ES cells as well as epiblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2007</xref>), and indicate that X upregulation is initiated during preimplantation development. Including female embryos in these analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), our data reveal that X/A upregulation is initiated both during male and female preimplantation development, as female <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> and <italic>Xist<sup>WT/Δp</sup></italic> embryos, which are defective in iXCI, display high E4.5/4-cell ratios of 1.58 and 1.75, respectively, similar to those of males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Upon examination of early developmental stages, we found that all females start out with high X/A ratios compared to those measured in males (between 1.58–1.87 at the 4-cell stage; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, by E4.5, whereas X/A ratios of <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> and <italic>Xist<sup>WT/Δp</sup></italic> females are still high compared to males (around 1.8 fold), those of WT/WT females have decreased to levels close to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Combined, these results indicate that X upregulation occurs during preimplantation development in males and females. In WT/WT females, X upregulation takes place concurrently with iXCI that compensates the general X gene dosage to that of males.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19127.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of X-linked gene expression in preimplantation embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) X/A expression profile in males.

(2) The developmental expression profiles of single genes correspond to those published in the literature. This is true for cell markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) as well as for <italic>Xist</italic> that is highly expressed in females but not males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Analyzing chromosome-wide gene expression of WT mouse embryos reveals that the X dosage in females is around two-fold that of males at early embryonic stages and is subsequently adjusted to those in males at late stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), in agreement with recent findings in mouse and human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petropoulos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Analysis of XistKO females that cannot undergo iXCI shows, as expected, around two-fold higher X-linked gene dosages when compared to males throughout preimplantation development. These data combined with results obtained by subsampling of library sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) and direct comparisons of various genotypes (WT vs RlimKO; female and male; e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1C, D; 2</xref>; not shown) confirm the high overall robustness and accuracy of our RNA-seq data. However, likely reflecting technical variability of single-embryo RNA-seq, variations of single gene expression levels among replicates were generally higher when compared to those of chromosome/genome-wide data, where hundreds/thousands of genes are averaged.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Chromosome-wide X-linked gene expression</title><p>While crucial functions of <italic>Rlim</italic> and <italic>Xist</italic> for iXCI in mice are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marahrens et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), the influence of both genes on the general kinetics of X-linked gene expression are not. To study iXCI, X upregulation and the effects of <italic>Xist</italic> and <italic>Rlim</italic> on X-linked gene expression we have used embryos with congenic genetic background because this approach allows for simpler mouse genetics and excludes influences of the genetic background on X-linked gene expression. The facts that (1) females have two and males have one X chromosome and (2) <italic>Xist</italic> is crucial for iXCI, comparing females to males combined with the inclusion of the XistKO mouse model allows for an overall chromosome-wide assessment of the dynamics of X-linked gene expression via comparisons of gene expression profiles between the genders and/or between females with different genotypes. This is because XistKO female embryos display around two-fold higher F/M levels throughout early development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), thereby providing genetic evidence that the global X profile differences between XistKO and WT/WT females is the direct consequence of iXCI and that there is no other, major female-specific mechanism in preimplantation embryos that significantly influences the global X-linked gene dosage. Concerning allele-specific X-chromosome-wide gene expression, as males have a single maternally inherited X combined with the fact that iXCI in females silences exclusively the Xp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2014</xref>), indicates that the steady decline in F/M values seen in WT/WT females is mostly due to decreased Xp expression levels, and using B6<sub>m</sub>/CAST<sub>p</sub> hybrid embryos we have confirmed this for stage E3.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, in contrast to chromosome-wide X-linked gene expression, at the gene level we cannot resolve the parental origin of single RNAs, as our RNA-seq data do not reveal an allele-specific resolution.</p><p>In agreement with published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marks et al., 2015</xref>), we show that silencing of X-linked genes in females occurs across the entire X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Such spatial concordance of silencing is consistent with studies in ESCs which show that <italic>Xist</italic> does not spread linearly along the X chromosome, but rather spreads to multiple loci on the X simultaneously, due to the three dimensional folding of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engreitz et al., 2013</xref>). The finding that the average F/M ratios of females of all genotypes (WT/WT, <italic>Rlim<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> and <italic>Xist<sup>WT/Δp</sup></italic>) remained below 2 even at early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A; 5C</xref>) is likely explained by a previously reported <italic>Xist</italic>-independent partial silencing of some X-linked transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalantry et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, by integrating X upregulation and iXCI, our results represent a comprehensive view on X-linked gene expression in early mouse embryos, and its regulation by <italic>Rlim</italic> and <italic>Xist</italic>.</p><p>Our results reveal that the general pre/peri-implantation profile of X dosage compensation between genders as observed in WT female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is remarkably similar to that measured in early female human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petropoulos et al., 2016</xref>), even though mice but not humans undergo iXCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okamoto et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests strong evolutionary pressure on X dosage compensation before implantation. It is thus surprising that unlike in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) there is no sign of X upregulation in human preimplantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petropoulos et al., 2016</xref>) (not shown). Because X/A values in adult human somatic tissues are close to 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2011</xref>), this suggests that X-linked gene expression is upregulated at post-implantation stages.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Regulation of iXCI by <italic>Rlim</italic></title><p>Our analyses of global gene expression profiles in females shows that the KO of <italic>Rlim</italic> or <italic>Xist</italic> affects global expression levels of X-linked transcripts but not those expressed from autosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B; 5B</xref>). This combined with the fact that males lacking either <italic>Xist</italic> or <italic>Rlim</italic> appear healthy and are fertile indicates that crucial roles for both genes are restricted to X dosage compensation in females. Indeed, our results reveal that high levels of <italic>Xist</italic>, the maintenance of <italic>Xist</italic> clouds and X-dosage compensation in female blastocysts depend on <italic>Rlim</italic>. Combined, these results imply that RLIM’s function on iXCI is exerted through regulation of <italic>Xist</italic>. Moreover, because only iXCI globally and significantly influences X-linked gene expression specifically in females, the development of temporary <italic>Xist</italic> clouds in RlimKO females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and a similar silencing pattern at E3 between WT/WT and RlimKO females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) suggests that initiation of the iXCI process might occur normally at early stages in RlimKO females. However, at blastocyst stages X-silencing and iXCI cannot be maintained leading to a failure in X dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This is further corroborated by our results targeting the <italic>Rlim</italic> cKO via Rosa26-Cre early during female embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), confirming crucial roles for the maintenance of iXCI in blastocyst-staged female embryos. In this context, it is important to note that RLIM protein levels are down-regulated specifically in epiblast cells of E4.5 blastocyst embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shin et al., 2014</xref>), at a time point when these cells start to reactivate the Xp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Okamoto et al., 2004</xref>) before undergoing rXCI. Thus, because RLIM is crucial for the maintenance of iXCI at peri-implantation stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), this down-regulation provides an attractive molecular mechanism for triggering the Xp reactivation process.</p><p>In summary, by elucidating the mouse pre- and peri-implantation transcriptome, this study provides a comprehensive view on X linked gene expression during early mouse development.

In females X upregulation occurs concomitant with iXCI, which progressively leads to X gene dosage compensation between genders in an <italic>Rlim</italic> and <italic>Xist</italic>-dependent manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice used in this study and genotyping have been described; <italic>Rlim fl/fl</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Xist fl/fl</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Csankovszki et al., 1999</xref>), <italic>Sox2-</italic>Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shin et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>Rosa26-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soriano, 1999</xref>). The <italic>Xist<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mouse strain 129-Xisttm2Jae/Mmnc, identification number 29172-UNC, was obtained from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center, a NIH funded strain repository, and was donated to the MMRRC by Rudolf Jaenisch, Ph.D., Whitehead Institute.

Whole embryos were dissected at the indicated time points and the correct stage was verified under the binocular. Single-Embryo RNA-seq was essentially performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, single embryos/trophoblast cells were placed in 10ul TCL Buffer (Qiagen) supplemented with 1% BME, and snap frozen. A total of 187 samples representing WT and <italic>Rlim</italic>KO embryos were distributed on two 96-well plates (plus 5 mock wells) and thawed at RT for 10 min prior to RNA purification using Ampure RNA beads (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA). RNA samples were resuspended in solution containing 3’ RT primer (5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACT(30)VN-3’) and dNTPs. Reverse transcription was performed with SSII (Life Technologies), whose terminal transferase activity allows incorporation of a PCR binding site at the 3’ end of the cDNA using a template-switching oligonucleotide (5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACATrGrG G-3’; custom synthesized from Exiqon) as a template. Subsequently, cDNA was amplified using 12 cycles of PCR, followed by tagmentation with Nextera kit (Illumina). Final libraries were amplified by 12 cycles of PCR (5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3’) and sequenced on a NextSeq 500. Single-embryo RNA-seq of <italic>Xist</italic>KO or B6/CAST hybrid embryos was performed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA-seq data analyses</title><p>Reads (paired end 35 bp) were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using TopHat (version 2.0.12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>), with default setting except set parameter read-mismatches to 2, followed by running HTSeq (version 0.6.1p1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2015</xref>), Bioconductor packages edgeR (version 3.10.0 ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson and Smyth, 2007</xref>) and ChIPpeakAnno (version 3.2.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2010</xref>) for transcriptome quantification, differential gene expression analysis, and annotation. For edgeR, we followed the workflow as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2013</xref>), except that the library size of each embryo was set as the total number of the effective counts of the autosomal genes. Specifically, edgeR was used for the removal of the unmapped, ambiguous, and not annotated reads as well as reads in rRNA and the filtering out of low expression genes after regrouping samples according to developmental stage, as the X chromosome contains many reproduction-related genes that are not expressed in somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khil et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mueller et al., 2008</xref>) and genes with no or low expression may influence the X/A expression ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, genes that were not expressed or lowly expressed genes as determined for embryos at each stage were filtered out before normalization, via removal of genes without at least 1 read per million in n of the samples, where n is the size of the smallest group of biological replicates within each developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2013</xref>). The library size was then reset as the total number of the effective counts of autosomal genes. The TMM method (Trimmed Mean of M-value) was used to calculate normalization factors between samples of the same stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robinson and Oshlack, 2010</xref>). Fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped (FPKM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">2</xref>) and LogFC were calculated using edgeR. For gender assessment counts per million (cpm) of mapped reads in <italic>Xist</italic> and the seven Y-linked genes <italic>Ddx3y, Eif2s3y, Kdm5d, Usp9y, Uty, Zfy1</italic> and <italic>Zfy2</italic> were evaluated. 12 samples out of 187 sequenced in the combined <italic>Rlim</italic>KO/WT RNA-seq experiment, and 33 samples out of 174 sequenced in the <italic>Xist</italic>KO RNA-seq experiment were disregarded due to low reads or because gender could not be clearly determined. Random subsampling of library sizes to 200.000 reads per embryo was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robinson and Storey, 2014</xref>). Analyses of the subsampled datasets were carried out as described above. F/M analyses were carried out by averaging ratios per gene within each developmental stage using females of defined genotype and pooled males (WT and KO). For calculations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>, 755 X-linked genes with cpms&gt;1 (before normalization) in at least three embryos at each stage were included. The dataset was then normalized against autosomal gene expression and Log2 fold change was calculated using edgeR. For the allele-specific expression analysis of X-linked transcripts in B6/CAST heterozygous females, the SNPs were called with mpileup and bcftools in the SAMtools package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li, 2011</xref>) using the aligned BAM files. A python program allelecounter was used to obtain the allele counts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/secastel/allelecounter">https://github.com/secastel/allelecounter</ext-link>).

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dynamics of X-linked gene expression during early mouse development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor and the Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper uses RNA-seq on single mouse embryos to elucidate thepre/peri-implantation transcriptome. It shows that iXCI in females globally compensates the X gene dosage with crucial roles of Rlim for increased Xist levels and maintenance of iXCI at blastocyst stages and that X/A upregulation is initiated in early male and female embryos.</p><p>The reviewers were very favorable about the RLIM part of the work and believe that this should be the focus of the paper. They appreciated the RNA-seq experiments on embryos as opposed to what has been done previously in ES cells. However, they felt that single-cell RNA-seq analysis of embryos was critical for making conclusions about the dynamics of X-linked expression. Without this, the results on embryos were viewed as only an incremental advance over published work. In particular Chen et al. (Genome Research online) &quot;Single-cell analyses of X Chromosome inactivation dynamics and pluripotency during differentiation&quot; follow up on the Deng et al. (Science, 2014 &quot;Single-cell RNA-seq reveals dynamic, random monoallelic gene expression in mammalian cells) study, so single cell early development RNA-seq exists for mouse (as well as human – Petropoulos).</p><p>Thus, a revised manuscript would be accepted if it were significantly rewritten to focus on RLIM, including changes in the title, Abstract, and throughout the text. Single-cell RNA-seq experiments on embryos are not required. However, if they are not done (and presumably this would take considerable time), the &quot;dynamics&quot; aspect of the work must be considerably downplayed including citing all the relevant work on the subject and placing the current results into that context. To put it simply, the RLIM aspect of the work is of sufficient interest for <italic>eLife</italic>, whereas the dynamics aspect is not. The original reviews are included below, but the summary above comes from considerable discussion among the reviewers and BRE.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Wang et al. report a survey of the pre- and peri-implantation transcriptome using RNA-seq for single mouse embryos to compare wild-type and knock-outs for the Rlim and Xist genes. These genes have been previously implicated in the process of X inactivation. The mammalian X chromosome is regulated by two major mechanisms that evolved due to the fundamental difference between males (XY) and females (XX). These mechanisms restore a balanced expression between X and autosomes (X upregulation) and between the sexes (X inactivation).</p><p>The data obtained here, combined with RNA-FISH, provide a comprehensive view of the dynamics of X-linked gene expression during early embryo development and elucidates a crucial role for the maternal and embryonic RLIM protein in upregulation/maintenance of Xist expression, which is essential for the completion of imprinted X inactivation. This study also clearly shows that X upregulation initiates in both male and female mouse preimplantation embryos, supporting the idea of X upregulation occurs in both sexes to balance expression between the single active X and the autosomes present in two copies.
