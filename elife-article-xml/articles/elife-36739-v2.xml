In the adult small intestine, cells from a common progenitor intermix with other lineages, whereas cell progeny in many other epithelia form contiguous patches. The mechanisms that generate these distinct patterns of progeny are poorly understood. Using light sheet and confocal imaging of intestinal organoids, we show that lineages intersperse during cytokinesis, when elongated interphase cells insert between apically displaced daughters. Reducing the cellular aspect ratio to minimize the height difference between interphase and mitotic cells disrupts interspersion, producing contiguous patches. Cellular aspect ratio is similarly a key parameter for division-coupled interspersion in the early mouse embryo, suggesting that this physical mechanism for patterning progeny may pertain to many mammalian epithelia. Our results reveal that the process of cytokinesis in elongated mammalian epithelia allows lineages to intermix and that cellular aspect ratio is a critical modulator of the progeny pattern.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36739.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The body has an impressive ability to renew itself by replacing old and damaged cells with new ones. This can happen rapidly; for example, the lining of the intestine renews itself approximately every five days. The lining contains many different cell types, which exchange important signals with their neighbors. This means that the new cells need to occupy similar positions to the ones they are replacing to keep the intestine working.</p><p>New cells form when existing cells double their contents and divide. In many tissues the resulting cells sit side-by-side. But when cells in the intestine divide, the new cells often separate, ending up on either side of a cell that did not divide.</p><p>To investigate how this happens, McKinley et al. used live microscopy techniques to watch in real time as new cells divide and position themselves in mouse intestinal organoids â miniature versions of organs that can be grown outside the body. This revealed that the shape of intestinal cells explains why the newly formed cells become separated. Intestinal cells are taller than they are wide, and divide near their top edge. This enables a neighboring cell to squeeze between the new cells as they divide.</p><p>Further experiments showed that tall cells in other mouse tissues also become separated after division. The process of new cells interspersing with their neighbors due to their height is therefore not unique to the intestine. It may also be common in other mammalian tissues. There is great potential for investigating this further because labs can now grow many types of organoids, representing different organs. Using live microscopy to examine them could reveal more about how various tissues grow.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>organoid</kwd><kwd>light sheet microscopy</kwd><kwd>epithelium</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>intestine</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKinley</surname><given-names>Kara L</given-names></name><name><surname>Stuurman</surname><given-names>Nico</given-names></name><name><surname>Vale</surname><given-names>Ronald D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01DK103147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKinley</surname><given-names>Kara L</given-names></name><name><surname>Castillo-Azofeifa</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>Ophir D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Biohub</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royer</surname><given-names>Loic A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2282â17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKinley</surname><given-names>Kara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003390</institution-id><institution>Fritz Thyssen Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schartner</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name><name><surname>Delling</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The process of cytokinesis can allow cell lineages to intermix in mammalian epithelia, and cellular aspect ratio is a critical modulator of this behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelia are sheets of polarized cells that function as barriers between compartments of multicellular organisms and between the organism and the external environment. In addition to providing a physical barrier, specialized epithelial cell types provide functions including sensation, absorption and secretion, and contribute to the identities of nearby cells through cell-cell signaling. Proper epithelial function requires that these diverse cell types are positioned appropriately within the tissue and that this distribution is maintained as new cells are added through cell division.</p><p>The adult mammalian small intestine is a prime example of an epithelium that contains many cell types and maintains a high degree of spatial organization during rapid turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barker, 2014</xref>). In the small intestine, divisions of stem cells in the crypts of LieberkÃ¼hn replenish the stem cell pool and generate absorptive and secretory progenitor cells in the crypt, which in turn produce differentiated cells that carry out the absorptive and protective functions of the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gracz and Magness, 2014</xref>). Throughout the epithelium, cells derived from a given progenitor intersperse with other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carroll et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, lineage tracing in fixed tissues has established that cells derived from secretory progenitors intermix with cells derived from absorptive progenitors along the crypt and villus length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2001</xref>). At the crypt base, stem cells are interspersed with Paneth cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farin et al., 2016</xref>). Interspersion of cell lineages plays important roles in determining local signaling environments required for intestinal homeostasis. For example, intestinal stem cells receive signals critical to their identity from neighboring Paneth cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sato et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, direct contact between stem and Paneth cells supports stem cell maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farin et al., 2016</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the intermixing of lineages are poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we use light sheet and confocal imaging of live murineÂ small intestinal organoids to define the mechanisms of cell interspersion. We find that rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton displace mitotic cells along the apical-basal axis, such that cell division occurs at the apical surface. Interspersion arises when elongated interphase neighboring cells wedge between apically dividing daughters during cytokinesis. We find that the propensity to intersperse during division requires an elongated shape of cells in the epithelium; reducing the cellular aspect ratio (height: width) in organoids disrupts interspersion, resulting in outgrowth of lineage patches. Consistent with our data indicating that the physical parameters of the tissue are a critical determinant of interspersion during division, we demonstrate that the elongated epiblast/primitive ectoderm of post-implantation (E7.5) mouse embryos, but not the short visceral endoderm, also undergoes division-coupled cell interspersion. Thus, tissues of distinct developmental context from the adult small intestine exhibit similar mechanisms for patterning cellular progeny according to cellular dimensions. Together, our data indicate that cell shape differences between interphase and mitotic cells in elongated mammalian epithelia can allow a neighboring cell to insert between nascent daughter cells during cytokinesis and drive interspersion of cellular progeny.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cells of different lineages intersperse during cell division in the intestinal epithelium</title><p>To identify the basis for cell interspersion, we performed time-lapse imaging of adult murine small intestinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kretzschmar and Clevers, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sato et al., 2009</xref>) by confocal and light sheet microscopy (single plane illumination microscopy - SPIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To visualize cell lineages, we first used organoids in which the cytoplasm of cells of the secretory lineage was labeled with RFP (<italic>Atoh1<sup>CreER</sup>; R26<sup>RFP</sup></italic>). Strikingly, we observed that daughter cells separated from one another in approximately half of divisions (31/50 divisions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; also see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carroll et al., 2017</xref>]). We observed that Atoh1-expressing secretory daughters along the crypt length separated from one another, mixing with unlabeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). 3D SPIM data confirmed that cells were fully separated on their basal surface, although they maintained a minimal contact on the apical surface, creating a V-shaped geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref>, 9/16 daughter pairs). When daughters did not separate during the division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top panels, 7/16 daughter pairs), these daughters either became separated at later time points by division of a neighboring cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom panels and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1âvideo 2</xref>), or remained as neighbors for the duration of imaging. These data indicate that separation of nascent daughter cells during cell division makes substantial contributions to the relative positioning of cell types within the intestinal epithelium.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36739.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Separation of dividing daughter cells during apical cytokinesis underlies intermingling of cell lineages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â Left: Cartoon depicting organoid derivation.

Therefore, we tested the contributions of the actin cytoskeleton for basal reinsertion. As actin disruption blocks the initial displacement of mitotic cells to the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>), determining the requirements for actin in basal reinsertion required that mitotic cells be positioned on the apical surface before disrupting actin. To achieve this, we first blocked cells on the apical surface by arresting them in mitosis with the mitotic kinesin (Eg5) inhibitor S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC). Cells arrested in mitosis did not reinsert unless mitotic exit was induced by inhibition of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC; Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146) or cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK; RO-3306) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video11">Figure 2âvideo 11</xref>).

Pioneering work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner and Cockroft (1998)</xref> revealed that cells injected intoÂ mouse blastocysts to generate chimeras become dispersed throughout the epiblast and primitive ectoderm of the post-implantation embryo.

Therefore, we tested this prediction by performing time-lapse SPIM imaging of E7.5 (late streak-early bud) mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), in which the epiblast/primitive ectoderm was mosaically labeled (<italic>CAGGS<sup>CreER</sup>; R26<sup>Brainbow2.1</sup></italic>). We imaged cell divisions in these embryos for at least 3 hr and observed that divisions proceeded in a similar manner to the intestinal epithelium, with mitotic cells displacing to the apical surface as they rounded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3FâG</xref>).

As these cell types are replenished as the organ renews, they must be positioned appropriately within the tissue. In some mammalian epithelia, such as the small intestine, daughter cells derived from a common progenitor disperse throughout the tissue and intermingle with cells of other lineages, a process that plays an important role in determining local signaling environments. Previous studies have reported that intermingling of cells can occur during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carroll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Firmino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner and Cockroft, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Higashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Packard et al., 2013</xref>) but the mechanism by which this occurs has not been clear. Here, we show that intermixing arises when a neighboring cell inserts between apicallyÂ displaced daughter cells during cytokinesis.</p><p>The process of intermixing requires that the neighboring cell and dividing cell are positioned in such a way that the neighbor can occupy the wedge between the daughters generated by the ingressing furrow. Our data support a model in which the neighboring cell can become opportunely positioned for invasion into the cytokinetic furrow as a consequence of the cell shape changes associated with vertebrate mitosis in tissues comprised of cells with a high aspect ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In cells with a high aspect ratio, the actin-driven cell shape changes required for mitosis (rounding and subsequent elongation) displace the dividing cell along the apical-basal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As a result, an elongated interphase neighboring cell can surround the dividing cell both basally and laterally, allowing it to follow the path of the ingressing furrow between the daughters. Consistent with a key role for cell aspect ratio in interspersion behavior, reducing the aspect ratio in organoids generates patches. Live imaging of cell division in the two epithelial layers of the peri-gastrulation mouse embryo further supports a model in which cell aspect ratio is a critical parameter for determining whether cellular progeny intersperse, raising the intriguing possibility that the patterning principles that we define in the intestine may be a common feature of many mammalian epithelia.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36739.031</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Model for cell progeny patterning in mammalian epithelia.</title><p>Top: Cartoon of the influence of cell height on the relative positioning of cells derived from a given progenitor (magenta cells).

First, daughter separation is observed throughout the intestinal crypt for all progenitor cell identities: stem cells, Notch-expressing absorptive progenitors and Atoh1-expressing secretory progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>,Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). However, importantly, daughter separation is a frequent but not universal event, occurring in approximately half of the divisions observed, including when observing cells of a specific lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>,Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Additionally, altering cell fates, for example by inhibiting Notch signaling to cause an expansion of secretory cells, does not alter the frequency of this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C,D</xref>). In contrast, altering epithelial geometry in culture disrupts interspersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Since our data indicate that interspersion can arise from the execution of planar cell division coupled with the physical parameters of the tissue, it raises the possibility that the mechanisms of interspersion that we define for the intestinal epithelium may be generalizable to other vertebrate tissues with similar physical parameters. Consistent with this notion, we observed similar interspersion in the high aspect ratio epithelium of the early mouse embryo, while the surrounding low aspect ratio epithelium did not exhibit division-coupled interspersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Several tissues across vertebrates with a high aspect ratio have also been reported to exhibit division-coupled interspersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carroll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Firmino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner and Cockroft, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Higashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Packard et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, in numerous tissues in which cells have a low aspect ratio, progeny remain adjacent and form contiguous patches, includingÂ the interfollicular epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ouspenskaia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rompolas et al., 2016</xref>), MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reinsch and Karsenti, 1994</xref>), and alveolar epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Desai et al., 2014</xref>). Our model raises the possibility that isolated reports of division-coupled interspersion in diverse vertebrates including frog, chick and mouse may be unified by a common physical mechanism arising from the aspect ratio of the tissue and the mechanics of cell division.</p><p>While our data indicate that cellular aspect ratio is an important parameter for interspersion, the mechanics and geometry of cytokinesis also appear to play a central role. In vertebrates, the mechanism of furrow ingression minimizes the contact between the daughters and progresses until a single apex physically connects the two cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Higashi et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). An important component of our model is that the development of the furrow creates a position, both basally and laterally, for neighboring cells to invade and occupy. However, in contrast, during cytokinesis in Drosophila, the two daughters form a long adhesive contact between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), dependent on myosin II accumulation in the neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herszterg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>). In this regard, it is interesting to note that Drosophila epithelia exhibit a high aspect ratio, apical mitosis and non-concentric cytokinesis, yet do not exhibit cell interspersion and form contiguous patches of progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bryant, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bryant and Schneiderman, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Founounou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guillot and Lecuit, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herszterg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morais-de-SÃ¡ and Sunkel, 2013</xref>). We speculate that the extended cell-cell contactÂ formed between daughter cells in Drosophila would oppose the invasion of a neighboring cell. In the future, it will be interesting to attempt to modify the extent of interactions between daughter cells either in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or vertebrate epithelia and determine the effects on progeny patterning.</p><p>Broadly, since our data suggest that cell interspersion requires a set of criteria that are satisfied by many vertebrate epithelia, it is unlikely to be unique to those tissues in which it has been reported. Although our work has focused on the columnar epithelium of the small intestine, in which mitotic cell shape changes are sufficient to displace dividing cells relative to their neighbors, the numerous elongated pseudostratified epithelia that undergo apical mitosis due to interkinetic nuclear migration (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Norden, 2017</xref>]) are particularly attractive candidates for division-coupled interspersion. Together, our model suggests that interspersion during cell division may be widespread across elongated vertebrate epithelia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>R26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic></td><td valign="bottom">Jackson Labs, <break/>PMID: 17868096</td><td valign="bottom">MGI: 3716464</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>Vil1<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup></italic></td><td>Averil Ma lab, <break/>PMID: 15282745</td><td valign="bottom">MGI: 3053826</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>Atoh1<sup>CreERT</sup></italic></td><td valign="bottom">Jackson labs, <break/>PMID: 16958097</td><td valign="bottom">MGI: 3686985</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>R26<sup>RFP</sup></italic></td><td valign="bottom">Jackson Labs, <break/>PMID: 20023653</td><td valign="bottom">MGI: 3809524</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>Lgr5<sup>DTR-GFP</sup></italic></td><td valign="bottom">de Sauvage Lab <break/>(Genentech), <break/>PMID: 21927002</td><td>MGI: 5294798</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">C57BL/6J</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>R26<sup>Brainbow2.1</sup></italic></td><td valign="bottom">Jackson Labs, <break/>PMID: 20887898</td><td valign="bottom">MGI: 164644</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">H2B-GFP</td><td valign="bottom">Jackson Labs, <break/>PMID:15619330</td><td>MGI: 109836</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>Notch1<sup>CreERT2(SAT)</sup></italic></td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 21991352</td><td valign="bottom">MGI: 5304912</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="bottom">Rabbit anti-ZO-1</td><td valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2533456">AB_2533456</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">Alexa 488-Phalloidin</td><td valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="bottom">A12379</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">Hoechst 33342</td><td valign="bottom">Molecular Probes</td><td valign="bottom">H3570</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">See Table 1 for <break/>pharmacological inhibitors</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">MicroManager</td><td valign="bottom">Open Imaging, <break/>PMID: 20890901</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains and lines</title><p>Adult mice of the following lines were used to generate organoids.</p><p><italic>R26<sup>mTmG/mTmG</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>) (female)</p><p><italic>Vil1<sup>Cre-ERT2/+</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">el Marjou et al., 2004</xref>);

For immunofluorescence, organoids were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 1 hr before blocking in 3% BSA, TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100. Primary antibody was incubated overnight at four degrees and secondary antibody was incubated forÂ &gt;2 hr at RT. Reagents used for immunofluorescence were as follows: rabbit anti-ZO-1 antibody (Thermo Fisher), Alexa488-Phalloidin (Thermo Fisher # A12379), Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes H3570).</p><p>For organoid dissociation, organoids in one well of a 24 well plate were washed once in PBS before Matrigel was manually disrupted by pipetting in TrypLE Select (Life Technologies) in the well. The plate was then incubated at 37Â°C for 7â8 min before additional disruption with a P200 pipette. The cell suspension was centrifuged in mediumÂ +5% fetal bovine serum at 1000 x g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in Matrigel, allowed to polymerize for 10 min and covered with ENR medium and immediately transferred to the microscope for imaging for 45 min â 1 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Tissue preparation for clone tracing</title><p>Animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 250 mg/kg of body weight avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Dissected tissues were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 3 hr at 4Â°C and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 1Â ÃÂ PBS overnight at 4Â°C. For whole mount tissue, the external smooth muscle and fat of the most proximal 3 cm of the small intestine was removed and epithelial tissue was coverslipped with ProLong Gold Antifade (P36930, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For tissue sections, tissue was embedded in OCT compound (4583, Sakura), frozen and stored at â80Â°C. Small intestine swiss rolls were cryosectioned at 50 Âµm and coverslipped with ProLong Gold Antifade. Whole mount tissue and sections were counterstained with DAPI (1:10000; D9542, Sigma) for 45 min or 15 min, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Microscopy</title><p>For spinning disc confocal imaging, images were acquired on a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal attached to an inverted Nikon TI microscope, an Andor iXon Ultra 897 EM-CCD camera, using Micro-Manager software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>). Imaging of 12 Ã 1 Âµm z-stacks was performed either at 4 min time intervals with a 40 Ã 1.30 NA Plan Fluor oil objective or a 20 Ã 0.75 NA objective, or at 20 s time intervals with a 60XA 1.20 NA Plan Apo water immersion objective. Maximum intensity projections of 1â5 Z-stacks are shown unless otherwise noted. Point-scanning confocal imaging of intact intestines was performed using a Leica TCS SP8 X confocal microscope, with HyD and LAS X software. 0.76 Î¼m optical sections were acquired sequentially with a 63 Ã 1.40 HC PL APO CS2 oil objective.</p><p>4-dimensional imaging was performed on an ASI diSPIM microscope equipped with 40 Ã 0.80W NA NIR-Apo water dipping objectives, Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 cameras, and 488 nm and 561 nm solid state lasers from Vortran, using a nightly build of the Micro-Manager software. The structure of the environmental control chamber is described in detail at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/~nstuurman/protocols/diSPIMIncubator/.">https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/~nstuurman/protocols/diSPIMIncubator/.</ext-link> Temperature was maintained using 3 Ã 50 ohm resistors attached to the stainless steel incubation chamber holding the coverslip and medium, a 10 kOhm thermistor inserted in the medium and a temperature controller (TE Technology, Inc. TC-48â20). O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> tensions in the medium were kept constant by flowing humidified gas underneath the sample chamber. To allow gas exchange, the sample was placed on a sandwich of 2 Ã 24Â Ã50 mm coverslip glasses in which 2Â ~Â 12Ã12 mm windows had been laser-cut and between which a piece ofÂ ~37.5 Âµm thick Teflon AF-2400 (a gift from BioGeneral, Inc.) was placed. Evaporation was minimized by layering mineral oil (Howard) over the sample. Organoids were imaged in ENR medium; embryos were imaged in DMEMÂ +25% rat serum (Rockland, Inc.). 3D reconstructions were generated using a Micro-Manager plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nicost/MMClearVolumePlugin">https://github.com/nicost/MMClearVolumePlugin</ext-link>) that uses the ClearVolume library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Royer et al., 2015</xref>). 3D reconstructions are scaled with gamma adjustment. All imaging experiments were performed at 37Â°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 20% O<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Small molecules</title><p>Small molecule concentrations are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jody Rosenblatt as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. All the reviewers found the study interesting and compelling in its nature, given that this is an important, fundamental finding that is not well understood. However, there was general concern that the conclusions were oversold regarding the idea that tall epithelia intrinsically drive interspersion of cells. The results presented did not provide a clear mechanism for how the interdispersion takes place following cytokinesis, given that interspersion does not take place in other tall epithelia. The height of epithelia seemed correlative, using a small n for different types of epithelia or whether other epithelial cell types in the same organoid also disperse. Moreover, other in vivo components may contribute to dispersion that are lacking in the organoids; for instance the crypt curvature, which is not as well maintained in organoids, may contribute to the essential architecture required for interspersion. If so, the authors may gain more insight by filming divisions in ex vivo gut slices as well.</p><p>Because we felt that better supporting the claims stated in the title would take longer than the typical revision period of two months, the reviewers decided that it would be best turn down this manuscript. While I have summarized the main critiques of the paper, below, we include the full reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This beautifully written paper by McKinley and others reveals a new mechanism for how two daughter cells become interspersed through an epithelium. They show that interspersion occurs by cytokinesis at the apex of the epithelium and then re-attachment of two daughter cells basally to the matrix after they straddle a cell between them. They show that this mechanism is dependent on having a taller epithelium and that it also requires actin post-cytokinesis for cells to straddle and stretch down basally. I recommend publication of this manuscript that provides mechanistic insight to a long-observed puzzle in epithelial morphology, which is how do certain types of cells become interspersed throughout a particular epithelium. I have only a small number of questions that would be good to address:</p><p>1) The correlation between columnar epithelial height and the propensity to cause interspersion of daughter cells looks compelling but lack graphical analysis. It seems like a perfect place to include this would be in Figure 3C. Here, they could show a graphical correlation on cell height with wnt-treated organoids and the number of interspersed divisions or cells. It may be in the text but is not easy to see graphically and such a graph could make the point very clearly.</p><p>2) One thing that was not clear is whether all the cells within intestinal epithelia are interspersing or is it just the secretory lineage. This is important once we later find that the interspersion is linked to cell height. If so, we would expect all cells within the intestinal epithelium to intersperse. This would also predict that mitotic forces expected to drive cell migration up the villus will be dispersed, I expect.</p><p>3) Did the flatter visceral endoderm not intersperse in your videos? This would also lend more credence to the height as a controller.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript examines how cell-types become interspersed during the development of intestinal organoids and presents evidence that this occurs as cells undergo cytokinesis at the apical surface and are then displaced from their siblings as they reintegrate towards the basal surface. This is an interesting question that takes advantage of the tractability of organoids for cell biological and live imaging approaches. While the manuscript is a useful contribution, I am not convinced that the data fully justify their conclusions. Most of the behaviours they observe, such as the apical movement and rounding of mitotic cells and planar spindle orientation have been well documented in a variety of other columnar or pseudostratified epithelia, so the main novelty lies in the mechanism of cell separation at cytokinesis. While their description is presumably accurate, it falls short of a mechanistic explanation and fails to consider the roles of the non-dividing basal neighbours or how cell junctions are remodelled during this process. As pointed out in the Discussion, divisions in the pseudostratified epithelia of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs share all of the features of the divisions in adult-derived intestinal organoids, including the polarised ingression of the cleavage furrow from basal to apical, yet the daughter cells are only very rarely separated during this process. Thus, any valid mechanistic model of cell dispersal in the intestine should be able to explain the <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal disc is different and the data as presented do not show any significant differences. The difference may lie in the behaviours of the neighbouring cells, as recent work has shown that the neighbours in the disc activate myosin contractility to pull on the apical junctions of the dividing cell during cytokinesis, which ensures that a new cell-cell junction forms between the newly-born daughters (Pinhiero et al., 2017). I therefore think that these results, useful though they are, have not really solved the question of cell dispersal and the conclusions are over-interpreted. The results are a valuable contribution to the field, and this might be publishable if the conclusions were less over-blown. For example, they could concentrate on their observations that the apical-basal height of the epithelium is a key parameter for allowing dispersal.</p><p>The authors claim that cell-cell junctions on the apical surface promote the polarized, asymmetric mitotic cell-shape changes (Subsection âCells intersperse during cytokinesis as part of a suite of cell shape changes restricted to the basolateral surface by cell-cell contactâ/Figure 2B/Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A-E). For this, they measure the positioning of cortical bleb formation in mitotic cells within the tissue context and after dissociation into single cells. They show that blebbing occurs only basally in the tissue (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A) and argue that this is inhibited on the apical side by cell-cell contacts (&quot;â¦cell-cell junctions on the apical surfaceâ¦oppose mitotic shape changes on the apical surface&quot;), as blebbing occurs symmetrically in dissociated cells. However, in my opinion, the proposed mechanistic link between cell-cell junction and asymmetric cell shape changes are insufficiently addressed by means of these experiments. For instance, if cell-cell junctions on the apical side have an inhibitory effect on bleb formation, why is blebbing constrained to the basal surface (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A) and does not occur on the lateral sides? Is it possible that the &quot;fine membranous processes that tether the cell to the basal surface&quot; (subsection âRearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton during cell division displace dividing cells along the apical-basal axisâ, first paragraph and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G-H) have never detached from the basement membrane when the cell body moved apically.</p><p>The dotted round cell outlines in Figures 2D, 2H, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1L are confusing. It would be better to draw the outline of the cells based on the actual cell shape shown in the membrane signal.</p><p>Figure 2B and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E: It is not clear why the authors suddenly switch to a cell line with MT +end marker when they analyze membrane blebbing in dissociated cells? Why not stick to the cell line with a membrane marker as in previous experiments?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The overarching question addressed in this study is that of how cells become interspersed within epithelia. This is a really interesting and universal open question with important implications. I was therefore really excited to get to read this paper, and unfortunately I need to admit I got a bit disappointed.

The two main findings are that 1) daughter cell separation occurs at the point of cytokinesis (which differs from other thoughts in the field), and 2) that a difference in the cell aspect ratio between interphase and mitotic cells impacts whether daughters disperse or remain together to form clonal patches. More importantly, in the intervening time since the paper was submitted, we have performed experiments that we believe squarely address the main criticisms that emerged in the decision letter, as well as extensively revising the text in response to the feedback received.</p><p>Point 1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All the reviewers found the study interesting and compelling in its nature, given that this is an important, fundamental finding that is not well understood. However, there was general concern that the conclusions were oversold regarding the idea that tall epithelia intrinsically drive interspersion of cells. The results presented did not provide a clear mechanism for how the interdispersion takes place following cytokinesis, given that interspersion does not take place in other tall epithelia.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed below in point 2c, we have extensively revised the manuscript to temper our statements regarding the pertinence of our model to other mammalian systems that we have not tested.</p><p>The comment also centers around the fact that tall <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia have not been reported to exhibit interspersion. This is an important consideration that we did not address sufficiently in our original manuscript. Addressing this point has allowed us to add depth and precision to our model for interspersion, and we are grateful for the encouragement to make these changes. Our data indicate that interspersion arises from a neighboring cell invading between the daughters during cytokinesis. This invasion depends on the process of cytokinesis generating a position between the daughter cells for the neighbor to occupy. Thus, our model suggests that the creation of a minimal contact between the daughters is central to the interspersion behavior; extensive contact/adhesions between the daughters during cytokinesis would oppose the invasion of the neighbor. Importantly, extensive literature has demonstrated that <italic>Drosophila</italic> cytokinesis generates a long adhesive contact between the daughters (Gibson, Patel, Nagpal, and Perrimon, 2006; Herszterg, Leibfried, Bosveld, Martin, and Bellaiche, 2013; Pinheiro et al., 2017). By our observations and model, one would expect this geometry to oppose neighbor cell invasion. In contrast, a minimal vertex connection is created between daughters during cytokinesis in our system and broadly in vertebrates (analyzed carefully in (Higashi, Arnold, Stephenson, Dinshaw, and Miller, 2016), please also see our new figures â Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E). Thus, the neighboring cell can wedge between the daughters.</p><p>We apologize for our superficial discussion of this important consideration in the previous draft, and we appreciate the opportunity to include these important refinements of our model, now included in several points in the text, and addressed carefully in the second to last paragraph in the Discussion. Naturally, the differences between cell interspersion in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates begs for further experiments to test our hypothesis. This would be best accomplished by somehow modifying the extent of contact between daughters during cytokinesis. We describe this possibility in the paper as a possible future direction in the Discussion. However, this is clearly beyond the scope of our current study, both because of the complexity of the experiment and time to pioneer a completely new study of comparing and manipulating vertebrate and invertebrate systems.</p><p>Point 2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The height of epithelia seemed correlative, using a small n for different types of epithelia or whether other epithelial cell types in the same organoid also disperse.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed the additional experiments requested by the reviewers to further support our model for the role of cell height, as well as rewriting the text to focus on the specific epithelia we have analyzed. Our paper now analyzes both epithelia of the embryo, all cell lineages in the organoid, as well as several alternative organoid systems (adult versus fetal, low and high Wnt conditions). The new additions are as follows:</p><p>a) Reviewers 1 and 3 suggested that we examine the visceral endoderm of the embryo. We have examined cell divisions in the visceral endoderm of the embryo using embryos in which the DNA is labeled with H2B-GFP. In contrast to the elongated epiblast/primitive ectoderm, the endodermal cells do not intersperse during division in this low aspect ratio tissue. The new figure 3âfigure supplement 1B, and is accompanied by a new video (Figure 3âvideo 3).</p><p>b) We have now demonstrated that all cell lineages in the intestinal crypt exhibit interspersion, as expected based on our model indicating that aspect ratio, rather than e.g. cell identity, is a key parameter for this behavior. Previously, we only analyzed interspersion in the stem cell lineage (Lgr5-expressing) and the secretory (Atoh1-expressing) lineage. We have now analyzed Notch1-expressing cells, which represents all non-secretory cell populations, and found that these cells also intersperse at a similar frequency to secretory cells. Together, these reporters cover all cell lineages in the crypt epithelium. (New Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A).</p><p>c) We have been careful to rewrite the text to state conclusions based on the subset of mammalian epithelia that we have directly tested. We have tempered our conclusions with regard to breadth in the title, abstract and throughout the text to make it clear that the principles that we have uncovered may pertain to several (not necessarily all) mammalian epithelia.</p><p>Point 3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, other in vivo components may contribute to dispersion that are lacking in the organoids; for instance the crypt curvature, which is not as well maintained in organoids, may contribute to the essential architecture required for interspersion. If so, the authors may gain more insight by filming divisions in ex vivo gut slices as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We now demonstrate in vivo relevance of interspersion in the intestine. Following reviewer 3âs suggestion, we analyzed fixed intestines labeled for three days with the stochastic multicolor reporter (often referred to as confetti/Brainbow) to determine if interspersion of progeny is occurring in vivo. We found that cells derived from a given progenitor also intersperse with other cells in vivo (new Figure 1E). Live cell imaging of explant cultures of the intact intestine is not robust for our long-term imaging experiments at this point in time. In our own experience using the most recent protocols from the literature, intestinal explant cultures do not remain healthy for more than a few hours, and we do not wish to report results from less-than-healthy tissue. Therefore, we chose to do the experiment in the setting of the intact animal, where the continued health of the tissue is ensured. We appreciate the opportunity to include these data, as we think it is powerful to demonstrate that interspersion is relevant in vivo, and also that interspersion can be isolated from the chemical, mechanical and electrical cues present in vivo by using the minimal organoid system.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] 1) The correlation between columnar epithelial height and the propensity to cause interspersion of daughter cells looks compelling but lack graphical analysis. It seems like a perfect place to include this would be in Figure 3C. Here, they could show a graphical correlation on cell height with wnt-treated organoids and the number of interspersed divisions or cells. It may be in the text but is not easy to see graphically and such a graph could make the point very clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now added these data as Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One thing that was not clear is whether all the cells within intestinal epithelia are interspersing or is it just the secretory lineage. This is important once we later find that the interspersion is linked to cell height. If so, we would expect all cells within the intestinal epithelium to intersperse. This would also predict that mitotic forces expected to drive cell migration up the villus will be dispersed, I expect.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now included these data as Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A. Please see point 2b in the response to the editorial summary, above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Did the flatter visceral endoderm not intersperse in your videos? This would also lend more credence to the height as a controller.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now included these data as Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B. Please see point 2a in the response to the editorial summary, above.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscript examines how cell-types become interspersed during the development of intestinal organoids and presents evidence that this occurs as cells undergo cytokinesis at the apical surface and are then displaced from their siblings as they reintegrate towards the basal surface. This is an interesting question that takes advantage of the tractability of organoids for cell biological and live imaging approaches. While the manuscript is a useful contribution, I am not convinced that the data fully justify their conclusions. Most of the behaviours they observe, such as the apical movement and rounding of mitotic cells and planar spindle orientation have been well documented in a variety of other columnar or pseudostratified epithelia, so the main novelty lies in the mechanism of cell separation at cytokinesis. While their description is presumably accurate, it falls short of a mechanistic explanation and fails to consider the roles of the non-dividing basal neighbours or how cell junctions are remodelled during this process. As pointed out in the Discussion, divisions in the pseudostratified epithelia of the Drosophila imaginal discs share all of the features of the divisions in adult-derived intestinal organoids, including the polarised ingression of the cleavage furrow from basal to apical, yet the daughter cells are only very rarely separated during this process. Thus, any valid mechanistic model of cell dispersal in the intestine should be able to explain the Drosophila imaginal disc is different and the data as presented do not show any significant differences. The difference may lie in the behaviours of the neighbouring cells, as recent work has shown that the neighbours in the disc activate myosin contractility to pull on the apical junctions of the dividing cell during cytokinesis, which ensures that a new cell-cell junction forms between the newly-born daughters (Pinhiero et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now significantly rewritten the text and added new figures to address these important points (see also our response to point 1 in the editorial summary). Thanks to the reviewerâs comment, we realize that we over-emphasized cell aspect ratio and underplayed the central role that the geometry of cytokinesis plays in this process. In particular, a cornerstone of our paper is that a neighboring cell invades basally and laterally between the nascent daughters during cytokinesis. This can occur because the process of cytokinesis creates a minimal contact between the daughters, which allows an elongated neighboring cell to position between the daughters and displace them from one another. Thus, significant contact between daughter cells would be expected to prevent such intercalation. As the reviewer points out, extensive work in the literature has demonstrated that, during <italic>Drosophila</italic> cytokinesis, a long new adhesive contact forms between nascent daughters. This contrasts with the vertex contact between daughters in our system, and broadly observed during cytokinesis in vertebrate systems. The zippering of daughter cells together in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system would be expected to represent a significant obstacle to invasion of a neighboring cell.</p><p>We realize, like any study, that this difference opens up questions for further experimentation. Probably the most relevant experiments would be to modify the degree of interaction between the daughter cells (decreasing it in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or increasing in the intestinal epithelium) as this would allow predictions of this model to be tested. However, we believe that strategies for manipulating cytokinesis in this manner are not entirely evident and overall this work is beyond the scope of this particular paper. However, we do now raise this possibility in the Discussion of this article.</p><p>We are grateful for the reviewerâs comment, which encouraged us to discuss the nature of the invasion mechanism in greater detail, helping us to hone in on the importance of cytokinesis geometry and minimal daughter-daughter contact in allowing interspersion to occur. We recognize that our discussion of the comparison with <italic>Drosophila</italic> in the previous draft was superficial and deserved more careful consideration, which we have now tried to do. We appreciate the opportunity to expand this discussion, which presented an opportunity to add more depth to our model. Indeed, the reviewerâs comment and the comparison with <italic>Drosophila</italic> has led us to re-craft the text and present our model more precisely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I therefore think that these results, useful though they are, have not really solved the question of cell dispersal and the conclusions are over-interpreted. The results are a valuable contribution to the field, and this might be publishable if the conclusions were less over-blown. For example, they could concentrate on their observations that the apical-basal height of the epithelium is a key parameter for allowing dispersal.</p></disp-quote><p>Overall, in addition to addressing the important considerations of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system as described above, we have now extensively revised the text to temper our conclusions and to focus throughout the paper on the mammalian systems for which we have direct data. As the reviewer suggests, we have focused the revised manuscript on our observations that the height of the epithelium is a key parameter for allowing dispersal, as well as incorporating discussion of the geometry of cytokinesis as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that cell-cell junctions on the apical surface promote the polarized, asymmetric mitotic cell-shape changes (Subsection âCells intersperse during cytokinesis as part of a suite of cell shape changes restricted to the basolateral surface by cell-cell contactâ/Figure 2B/Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A-E). For this, they measure the positioning of cortical bleb formation in mitotic cells within the tissue context and after dissociation into single cells. They show that blebbing occurs only basally in the tissue (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A) and argue that this is inhibited on the apical side by cell-cell contacts (&quot;â¦cell-cell junctions on the apical surfaceâ¦oppose mitotic shape changes on the apical surface&quot;), as blebbing occurs symmetrically in dissociated cells. However, in my opinion, the proposed mechanistic link between cell-cell junction and asymmetric cell shape changes are insufficiently addressed by means of these experiments. For instance, if cell-cell junctions on the apical side have an inhibitory effect on bleb formation, why is blebbing constrained to the basal surface (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A) and does not occur on the lateral sides? Is it possible that the &quot;fine membranous processes that tether the cell to the basal surface&quot; (subsection âRearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton during cell division displace dividing cells along the apical-basal axisâ, first paragraph and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G-H) have never detached from the basement membrane when the cell body moved apically.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these points.

EB3-GFP organoids were used to facilitate identification of organoids in mitosis after dissociation, when they cannot be identified by membrane morphology as all dissociated cells are spherical.
