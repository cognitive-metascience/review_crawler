remains a key challenge for gene therapy based on lentiviral vector technologies. Engineering of next-generation lentiviral vectors targeting safe genomic harbors for insertion is therefore of high relevance. In a previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cai et al., 2014a</xref>), we showed the use of integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) as carriers of complete gene repair kits consisting of zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) proteins and repair sequences, allowing gene correction by homologous recombination (HR). Here, we follow this strategy to engineer ZFN-loaded IDLVs that insert transgenes by a homology-driven mechanism into safe loci. This insertion mechanism is driven by time-restricted exposure of treated cells to ZFNs. We show targeted gene integration in human stem cells, including CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Notably, targeted insertions are identified in 89% of transduced iPSCs. Our findings demonstrate the applicability of nuclease-loaded ‘all-in-one’ IDLVs for site-directed gene insertion in stem cell-based gene therapies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12213.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12213.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>protein transduction</kwd><kwd>zinc-finger nucleases</kwd><kwd>iPSC</kwd><kwd>CD34+ cells</kwd><kwd>lentiviral vector</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Danish Council for Independent Research, DFF Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFF-4004-00220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mikkelsen</surname><given-names>Jacob Giehm</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Hørslev Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mikkelsen</surname><given-names>Jacob Giehm</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006576</institution-id><institution>Civilingeniør Frode V.

Lentiviral vectors offer an effective gene delivery route, but also suffer from prevalent gene insertion into transcriptionally active regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schröder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Modlich et al., 2009</xref>). Novel strategies to attain targeted gene integration (TGI) into predetermined genomic loci are highly warranted. TGI using lentiviral vectors can be achieved by delivering donor sequences for insertion by homologous recombination (HR) into double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by tailored endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lombardo et al., 2011</xref>). Development of programmable nucleases, ZFNs, TALENs, and now CRISPR/Cas9, has made effective gene disruption feasible, even in stem cells, but genetic operations involving TGI in stem cells are still challenged by low membrane permeability, low HR efficiency, and high sensitivity to external manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Genovese et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hockemeyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hendel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tiyaboonchai et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We previously established genomic editing in cells treated with ‘all-in-one’ lentiviral particles loaded with locus-targeted ZFN proteins and a donor sequence flanked by homology arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cai et al., 2014a</xref>). Here, building on these findings, we report a simple method for establishing TGI by treating cells with integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) packaged with both the transgene-containing donor template and ZFN proteins fused to the N-terminus of lentiviral Gag and GagPol polypeptides. Locus-directed cleavage and TGI is evident in cell lines, CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) upon transduction with ZFN-loaded vectors. Notably, the prevalence of TGI in two safe harbors in the human genome, the <italic>CCR5</italic> and <italic>AAVS1</italic> loci, is high in iPSCs treated with ZFN-loaded lentiviral vectors, resulting in non-mosaic clones harboring a site-directed gene insertion and no additional cutting at top-ranked off-target sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>IDLVs harboring both ZFN protein and vector RNA with the transgene flanked by homology arms are here designated ‘IDLV-ZFN(locus)/<italic>gene</italic>’, where ‘<italic>gene</italic>’ refers to the transgene cassette flanked by homology arms and transferred by the vector. Principles of production, transduction, and integration of such vectors are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Together with a dimer of lentiviral vector RNAs, approximately 5000 copies of Gag and GagPol polypeptides (of which about half carry a ZFN fused to the matrix protein) form the capsid, which is wrapped in a segment of the membrane during budding from the producer cells. ZFNs are released from Gag and GagPol upon cleavage by the viral protease during maturation of the virus particle. The mature virus particles contain two types of ZFNs, left and right, which upon DNA binding in the target cell form a catalytically active dimer. After viral entry in the target cells and endosomal escape, vector RNA is reverse transcribed to DNA, which can serve as donor for homology-directed insertion at targeted breakage sites generated by the co-delivered ZFNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lower panel).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12213.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Proof-of-efficacy studies and characterization of ZFN-loaded IDLVs carrying a transgene flanked by homology arms facilitating insertion by homologous recombination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the production, transduction and integration of IDLVs carrying ZFNs and transgene. Enrichment of ZFN-fused viral polypeptides and donor-carried viral RNAs at the cell membrane leads to assembly of ZFN-containing virions. During virus maturation, the polypeptides are cleaved into enzymatic and structural proteins by HIV protease.

By staining with an antibody specific for the tag, we found that the ZFNs were highly enriched at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then visualized the lentiviral particles (designated LPs since the vector was not included) and found for both LP-HA-ZFN(gfp) and LP-eGFP co-localization of the fusion protein with viral p24 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), suggesting that ZFN (or eGFP) proteins were indeed packaged into the LPs. To measure the lifespan of LP-delivered ZFNs in transduced cells, HEK293 cells were synchronized at 4°C for 60 min before fixation at different time points (1, 12, 24, and 48 hr, respectively) after transduction with ZFN-loaded LPs. Already within the first hour after exposure to LP-HA-ZFN(gfp), the ZFNs were easily detectable inside the cells, whereas after 24 hr essentially all ZFNs had been degraded or diluted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These findings showed that nucleases delivered by LPs were immediately available after transduction and that the time of action was restricted due to decay of the proteins.</p><p>We then performed proof-of-efficacy studies by transducing HEK293T cells with IDLVs (500 ng p24), with or without <italic>AAVS1</italic>-directed ZFNs, carrying an eGFP expression cassette (IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>egfp</italic>). Initially, three days post-transduction, a higher frequency of eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells was observed among cells transduced with IDLV/<italic>egfp</italic> than for cells transduced with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>egfp</italic> (59.1% versus 44.7%), indicating that the overall transduction potential was higher for IDLVs that did not carry ZFNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and 1E</xref>). Nevertheless, at later time points 2.5% of the cells were eGFP<sup>+</sup> after treatment with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>egfp</italic>, whereas the percentage dropped to below 1% in IDLV/<italic>egfp</italic>-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). PCR amplification and sequencing of the 5’ and 3’ junction sites including part of the donor sequence and the regions flanking the inserted transgene cassette showed that events of correct integration into <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus were evident after treatment with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>egfp</italic>, whereas PCR products indicative of site-directed insertion did not appear for IDLV/<italic>egfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, DSBs were not repaired by HR only, and mismatches introduced by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) were detected in 5% of the <italic>AAVS1</italic> alleles, as measured by Surveyor nuclease assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To evaluate the levels of TGI with another reporter gene, we treated HEK293T cells with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>fluc</italic> carrying <italic>AAVS1</italic>-targeted ZFNs and a <italic>firefly luciferase (fluc</italic>) expression cassette. Indeed, <italic>fluc</italic> gene expression was maintained for up to 18 days after transduction with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>fluc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), although the levels dropped from the initial 3-day time point, where episomal forms were still likely to support expression. For IDLV/<italic>fluc</italic>, in contrast, luminescence dropped to almost undetectable levels. TGI of the <italic>fluc</italic> gene into the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus was verified by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and the rate of NHEJ estimated to be 8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p><p>Next, we created ZFN-loaded IDLVs carrying the puromycin resistance gene (IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>puro</italic>) allowing us to easily isolate single puromycin-resistant clones and further scrutinize <italic>AAVS1</italic>-targeted integration events by Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Among 16 clones generated with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>puro</italic>, a 2.2-kb fragment, indicative of precise TGI by HR, was detected in 11 clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Other types of integrations, resulting in lower-mobility bands, were evident in the five remaining clones. Notably, two clones (clone 5 and clone 13) showed a 3.7-kb band, and these clones therefore were among clones that were analyzed by Southern blotting using another restriction enzyme and an <italic>AAVS1</italic>-specific probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and 1G</xref>). A common 6.4-kb band was observed for clones 5 and 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), suggesting that the full-length lentiviral DNA in these two cases was captured and inserted by chance into the ZFN-induced DSB at the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus. These findings demonstrated that site-directed gene insertion into ZFN-generated DSBs also occurred, although less frequently, in an HR-independent fashion.</p><p>We analyzed 15 additional puromycin-resistant clones by PCR and found that 13 out of these clones yielded PCR products indicative of TGI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). In total, 84% (26/31) of the analyzed clones contained a targeted insertion of the <italic>puro</italic> gene in the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus. In contrast, the fragments detected by Southern blot analysis of IDLV/<italic>puro</italic>-treated clones had variable sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>), indicating that the integrations were random events that occurred at different genomic locations.</p><p>To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in stem cells, we isolated CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells from human cord blood and focused initially on optimizing lentiviral transduction rates for optimal ZFN delivery. We first verified that ZFN-loaded VSV-G-pseudotyped LPs loaded with <italic>AAVS1</italic>-directed ZFNs resulted in targeted cleavage upon transduction of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. Hence, indels introduced through repair by NHEJ were found in 5% of the alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we compared the capacity of recombinant human fibronectin (RetroNectin) and EF–C peptides, the latter recently discovered artificial peptide nanofibrils, to support virus entry to CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yolamanova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lump et al., 2015</xref>). In our setting, the presence of EF-C allowed transduction of 85.1% of the cells with a standard eGFP-encoding lentiviral vector, whereas between 27.5 and 30.8% of the cells were transduced in the presence of RetroNectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, we chose to include EF-C for targeted integration in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><p>In the first of two protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, orange labeling), we transduced CD34<sup>+</sup> cells derived from two different donors with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>egfp</italic> or IDLV/<italic>egfp</italic> (MOI = 5) and analyzed for eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells 9 days post-transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). On average, treatment with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>egfp</italic> resulted in (0.49 ± 0.14)% eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells, which was significantly higher than the percentage of eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells (0.07 ± 0.03)% measured after transduction with the IDLV/<italic>egfp</italic> control without ZFNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). PCR analyses confirmed events of TGI by IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>egfp</italic>, but not by IDLV/<italic>egfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Notably, IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>egfp</italic> transduction only slightly affected the cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and cell proliferation was not disturbed by the virus treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Encouraged by this, we reasoned that the efficiency could be further increased (i) by using higher MOIs, (ii) by pretreating CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with Vpx-loaded lentiviral particles (to degrade the reverse transcription inhibitor SAMHD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Laguette et al., 2011</xref>]), and (iii) by treating the cells with an extra dose of ZFNs delivered by LP-ZFNs. Indeed, using this improved protocol 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, green labeling), we were able to increase the percentage of eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells to (0.98 ± 0.13)% after transduction with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>egfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Also based on this protocol, TGI in the bulk was confirmed by PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Notably, IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>egfp</italic> treatment did not compromise the colony-forming capacity of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

To establish TGI in iPSCs using lentiviral protein transduction, we first evaluated the permissiveness of iPSCs to LPs loaded with ZFNs targeting the <italic>AAVS1</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic> loci, respectively. LP-ZFN(AAVS1) and LP-ZFN(CCR5) disrupted 4% and 8%, respectively, of the targeted alleles in iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>We then transduced iPSCs with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>puro</italic>. Of the approximately 500 puromycin-resistant clones formed from 50,000 transduced iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), we initially randomly picked, isolated and expanded eight clones (clones 1–8) for further analysis. From a subsequent experiment we picked 15 additional clones (clones 9–23). PCR amplification of the 5’ and 3’ junction sites showed that TGI had occurred in 19 out of the 23 clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Findings based on Southern blot analysis of clones 9–23 were consistent with the PCR analysis and confirmed that 11 of these 15 clones contained an <italic>AAVS1</italic>-directed insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Eight out of the 11 clones harbored a precise, homology-directed transgene insertion, whereas only one of the two junction sites in the remaining 3 clones (clones 9, 17, and 18) was intact. Hence, the 5’ junction site was intact in clone 17, whereas clones 9 and 18 contained an intact 3’ junction site, indicating that site-directed insertion in these cases involved both HR and NHEJ. Sequence analysis of the 5’ and 3’ junction sites amplified from clones 1–8 showed junctions sequences indicative of precise, homology-driven insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). For one particular clone, clone 7, we were not able to amplify the 469-bp <italic>AAVS1</italic> fragment, suggesting that both alleles in this clone contained a TGI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, sequencing of the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus provided evidence of biallelic cleavage in at least one of the clones (clone 5), resulting in a 1-bp insertion in the allele that did not contain the transgene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Stemness of TGI-modified iPSCs was verified by characterization of a single representative clone using alkaline phosphatase (AP) and the TRA-1-60 pluripotency marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Also, genomic integrity was confirmed by karyotyping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>To detect potential off-target cleavage by the virus-delivered ZFNs, we first sequenced the three top-ranked off-target sites in clones 1–8, but did not identify indels in any of these loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). We then isolated genomic DNA from a pool of more than 100 puromycin-resistant iPSC clones and confirmed by PCR analysis the presence of TGI events in the pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, insert). Then, next-generation sequencing was performed on PCR amplicons representing the on-target <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus as well as seven top-ranked off-target sites. Among this pool of clones, most of which carry an <italic>AAVS1</italic>-directed gene insertion, we were not able to detect indels at off-target positions, whereas 3% of the <italic>AAVS1</italic> alleles that were not already targeted by transgene insertion contained indels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Altogether, our findings demonstrated high levels of ZFN specificity and precise TGI in the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus in iPSCs treated with IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>puro</italic> vectors, resulting in at least one TGI event in 19 of 23 analyzed iPSC clones.</p><p>To demonstrate that such features of the ‘all-in-one’ gene delivery system was not limited to insertion into the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus, we produced IDLVs (designated IDLV-ZFN(CCR5)/<italic>puro</italic>) carrying ZFNs targeting the human <italic>CCR5</italic> locus as well as vector RNA carrying the PGK-<italic>puro</italic> cassette flanked by homology arms matching the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus. Transduction of iPSCs with IDLV-ZFN(CCR5)/<italic>puro</italic> resulted in effective colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Among the puromycin-resistant clones, we randomly picked, isolated and expanded 15 clones (clones 1–15) and showed by PCR analysis of each of these colonies that the transgene cassette in all 15 clones (100%) had been inserted site-specifically into the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). For a single representative clone, stemness was verified using alkaline phosphatase (AP) and the TRA-1-60 pluripotency marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Once again, we pooled more than 100 puromycin-resistant iPSC clones and performed next-generation sequencing on PCR amplicons amplified from the on-target locus and nine high-ranked off-target sites in the pooled DNA sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, we identified an indel in approximately 19% of the <italic>CCR5</italic> alleles that did not already carry a TGI, demonstrating that the second <italic>CCR5</italic> allele was cleaved by ZFNs in approximately one of every five clones harboring a <italic>CCR5</italic>-directed insertion. Importantly, off-target cleavage and indel formation by NHEJ was not evident in any of the nine analyzed off-target candidate loci. Hence, not even the <italic>CCR2</italic> locus (off-target 3), which is highly homologous to the <italic>CCR5</italic> site and a known off-target cleavage site for <italic>CCR5</italic>-targeted ZFNs, harbored detectable levels of indels.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12213.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Targeted gene integration in iPSCs by IDLV-ZFN(AAVS1)/<italic>puro</italic> and IDLV-ZFN(CCR5)/<italic>puro</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gene disruption mediated by transduction of LP-ZFN(AAVS1) and LP-ZFN(CCR5) in iPSCs.

It is still unclear to which extent this biased integration pattern induces toxicity due to insertional mutagenesis, but new approaches to alter the integration properties of lentiviral vectors remain attractive. Different strategies have been employed to reprogram the integration machinery of lentiviral vectors including (i) addition of a DNA-binding zinc-finger protein to the integrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bushman and Miller, 1997</xref>), (ii) fusion of a chromosomal binding domain to LEDGF, a cellular co-factor of the integrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gijsbers et al., 2010</xref>), and (iii) insertion of lentiviral DNA intermediates by transposases and recombinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vink et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Staunstrup et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moldt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai et al., 2014b</xref>). These approaches successfully alter the integration preference, but do not allow site-specific insertion into a preferred locus. Here, we present an alternative homology-directed insertion strategy facilitated by nuclease-directed DNA cleavage. By co-packaging designer nucleases and donor sequences into lentiviral vectors and utilizing cellular HR repair pathways to integrate the transgene, we can guide lentiviral cargo toward a safe harbor in up to 84% of HEK293T cells and 89% of iPSCs that were transduced with the ‘all-in-one’ vector system. The efficiency may likely be further improved by exploiting heterodimer-forming rather than homodimer-forming FokI domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doyon et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>TGI into the <italic>AAVS1</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic> loci of stem cells has previously been achieved using HR-based strategies exploiting two- or three-component systems based on delivery of plasmids, IDLVs, and baculovirus vectors as well as combinations of mRNA encoding ZFNs and IDLVs serving as the HR donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lombardo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Genovese et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tiyaboonchai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hockemeyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lei et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the potential of genetic therapies based on TGI in stem cells, like CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and iPSCs, existing technologies remain insufficient and highly toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Genovese et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hoban et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Merling et al., 2015</xref>). Exploiting the capacity of lentiviruses to co-deliver nucleases and a transgene cassette, we showed TGI in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells transduced with ZFN-loaded IDLVs without affecting the viability, proliferation, or colony-forming capacity of the cells. However, the efficiency was only modest, suggesting that a selective growth advantage of the TGI-engineered cells, as in SCID-X1, would be required for successful engraftment. Possibly, efficacy could be boosted by combining virus treatment with exposure to chemicals enhancing stem cell self-renewal, by supplying NHEJ inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chu et al., 2015</xref>), or by manipulating cell cycle conditions in favor of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Marniemi et al., 1975</xref>).</p><p>Stable transduction rates with ZFN-loaded IDLVs leading to TGI are undoubtedly reduced relative to conventional lentiviral gene delivery strategies. In iPSCs, however, transduction with IDLVs carrying ZFNs targeting either the <italic>AAVS1</italic> or the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus generated a high number of puromycin-resistant clones. Remarkably, 34 out of a total of 38 analyzed clones contained the transgene expression cassette inserted precisely into the locus targeted by the ZFNs. Also, as typically observed in relation to the standard use of IDLVs, we found that a few clones contained an additional, randomly inserted transgene cassette, which could be of relevance for potential future therapeutic use. Importantly, however, we found that lentiviral ZFN protein delivery did not lead to detectable off-target cleavage. Hence, cleavage in a total of 16 predicted off-target loci (7 for <italic>AAVS1</italic> and 9 for <italic>CCR5</italic>) did not appear as analyzed by deep sequencing of large pools of clones carrying the transgene cassette. If desired, this approach can be combined with removal of the selection marker by seamless excision, exploiting for example lentiviral protein transduction of <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai et al., 2014b</xref>). Remarkably, in a large pool of iPSCs, most if not all carrying a site-targeted gene insertion in the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus, off-target cleavage and indel formation at the neighboring <italic>CCR2</italic> locus was not evident after deep sequencing analysis. This is in contrast to higher levels of <italic>CCR2</italic> targeting reported in previous studies using other delivery strategies based on adenoviral vectors, plasmid transfection, or administration of recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gaj et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that lentiviral delivery of site-targeted endonucleases supports safer engineering of the genome. Together, our findings demonstrate that lentivirus particles can ferry programmable nucleases, facilitating homology-driven, site-directed genomic insertion of a co-delivered transgene. Such co-delivery ensures time-limited exposure of the treated cell to nucleases and, yet, results in frequent TGI with particular applicability in iPSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>To construct pLV/AAVS1-donor-fluc-PGK and pLV/AAVS1-donor-egfp-PGK, inserts were amplified from pLV/fluc-PGK-PBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai et al., 2014b</xref>) and pLV/egfp-PGK-PBT (cloned similarly as pLV/fluc-PGK-PBT), respectively, using primer sets YJ219F-YJ210R (primers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2A</xref>).

Previously, this group demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in human cell lines, and has now extended this work into human cord blood and human iPS cells. In general, I found the study very well described, however there is some lack of clarity in experimental descriptions, figure legends and methods.</p><p>1) It is unclear to me whether the study demonstrates replication at a second independent target site from <italic>AAVS1</italic>. I cannot find in the text nor the legend which site they are targeting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> They compared EF-C and RetroNectin using the <italic>AAVS1</italic> target, but the PCR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and 2G</xref> shows CCR5 this the target? I see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> that <italic>CCR5</italic> is amplified in 1F and 1I, why would you not assay <italic>AAVS1</italic> to see if the target site is intact? This lack of clarity and description is a problem throughout the text and figures as the authors have oversimplified the reagent descriptions. For example, instead of just saying IDLV-ZFN/<italic>egfp</italic>, it should read IDLV-CCR5/<italic>egfp</italic> or IDLV-AAVS1/<italic>egfp</italic> in each part, or something similar. The manuscript needs a thorough review in this regard and Figures and legends should be described and labeled accordingly. If <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is also showing targeting <italic>AAVS1</italic>, then it seems they have the tools available to attempt the TGI into the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus in either the CD34<sup>+</sup> or iPS cells.</p><p>2) I am not familiar with RetroNectin or EF-C. Please define and reference these approaches.</p><p>3) In the last paragraph of the Results, it is unclear what is meant by sequencing the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus.

How long are they? I also cannot seem to discern the actual target sequences for the ZFN reagents for <italic>AAVS1</italic> or <italic>CCR5</italic>. Are the constructs used in this study available upon request?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref> – is there some explanation of the varying intensity of the TGI band on the Southern? Is it possible that some TGI clones have more than 1 copy inserted? I am not clear if the restriction site chosen would distinguish whether multiple tandem head-to-tail copies are inserted in some clones.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> </p><p>It would be great if the authors could provide full sequence maps of these vectors, they are likely to be widely sought after and it would facilitate others trying to replicate this and similar approaches.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript entitled, &quot;Targeted, homology-driven gene insertion into stem cells by ZFN-loaded 'all-in-one' lentiviral vectors&quot; by Cai et al. describes the use of homology-directed integration of transgenes into the 'safe-harbor' <italic>AAVSI</italic> locus by integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) that are co-packaged with zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) proteins and a transgene-containing donor template. The authors demonstrate the specificity of targeting to the <italic>AAVSI</italic> locus in HEK293 cells by conventional PCR and Southern blot analyses. They show that greater long-term transgene expression (eGFP, Luciferase, or puromycin) is achieved when cells are transduced with IDLV packaged with ZFN (targeted integration, 2.5%) than without (random integration, &gt;1%). Interestingly, the authors note that integrations were not wholly by homologous recombination (HR), but a few events were due to non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). They further apply the strategy in CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells and iPSCs, and show successful transgene integration into the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus. Finally, the authors argue that treatment with IDLV-ZFN/<italic>puro</italic> vectors do not alter the integrity of iPSC stemness evidenced by stem cell marker expression and karyotyping.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and clearly presented. The experimental objectives and methods are well described, and the key findings should benefit those interested in similar therapeutic gene-delivery strategies. However, there are a few key points that impact the novelty of the results. Furthermore, some of the finding implications would challenge ZFN-loaded 'all-in-one' vectors as an efficient method for targeted gene integration (TGI). These concepts are addressed below.</p><p>As pointed out in the text, the work described in the manuscript is a follow-up study to the paper in <italic>eLife</italic> (2014) entitled: &quot;Targeted genome editing by lentiviral protein transduction of zinc-finger and TAL-effector nucleases&quot; by the same group. In this previous work, the authors described the use of similar 'all-in-one' lentiviral vectors co-packaged with ZFN or TALEN proteins to promote HR-mediated gene editing at the <italic>CCN5</italic> and <italic>AAVS1</italic> loci. The two main differences between the previous work, and the current one is that, 1) the authors attempt to explore in depth, the specificity and efficacy by which 'all-in-one' lentiviral vectors can promote TGI; and 2), the authors describe a protocol for TGI in hematopoietic stem cells and iPSCs.</p><p>1) There are a handful of published reports that have explored the insertion of transgenes (including ZNFs, albeit in a two-vector strategy) into the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus in ES cells and iPSCs and these should be cited:</p><p>Select publications:</p><p>Tay FC, et al., Targeted transgene insertion into the AAVS1 locus driven by baculoviral vector-mediated zinc finger nuclease expression in human-induced pluripotent stem cells. J Gene Med. 2013 Oct; 15(10):384-95. doi: 10.1002/jgm.2745.</p><p>Tiyaboonchai, A et al., Utilization of the AAVS1 safe harbor locus for hematopoietic specific transgene expression and gene knockdown in human ES cells. Stem Cell Res. 2014 May; 12(3):630-7. doi: 10.1016/j.scr.2014.02.004. Epub 2014 Feb 21.</p><p>2) The authors do a satisfactory job describing the insertion events occurring at the <italic>AAVS1</italic> site. However, their evidence of site-specific integration falls short. As the authors have illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, low frequency, off-target integration events do occur. However, it is in this reviewer's opinion that conventional PCR and Southern blot analysis are limited in their ability to detect the prevalence of additional off-target events. Although the authors do query 5 top off-target sites, these are only predicted sites that are based on the designed ZFN's position weight matrix using the PROGNOS tool. They do not consider off-target integration events at hotspots that are independent of ZFN activity. For instance, the use of genome-wide approaches have found that translocations via non-specific NHEJ events due to CRISPR/Cas9- or TALEN-mediated gene editing are numerous:</p><p>Frock RL et al., Genome-wide detection of DNA double-stranded breaks induced by engineered nucleases. Nat Biotechnol. 2015 Feb;33(2):179-86. doi: 10.1038/nbt.3101. Epub 2014 Dec 15.</p><p>This is especially critical when the authors demonstrate that 5-8% of the insertions are due to NHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G and 1J</xref>). Therefore, the frequency by which delivered ZFNs will promote non-specific NHEJ events on a genome-wide scale is unclear. The authors do attempt to address whether lentiviral treatment can cause genomic instability by demonstrating stem-cell integrity and karyotyping in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. However, only a single-representative clone was analyzed as described in the last paragraph of the Results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E and 3F</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> is of low quality and karyotyping to assess translocation events should be performed using spectral-karyotyping, on more than one clone.</p><p>3) In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, lane 9 suggests that the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus has been successfully targeted by IDLV-ZFN/<italic>puro</italic>, however a second integration event is detectable. This observation suggests that the methodology can lead to multiple integration events in the genome, within single clones. If this is indeed the case, the authors need to discuss how this can impact the efficacy of TGI via IDLV-ZFN/transgene vectors in therapeutic settings.</p><p>In conclusion, since the study appears to parallel many aspects of the research group's previous work, the unique findings are limited in range, and may not be highly influential to the field, this reviewer cannot recommend the manuscript by Cai et al. to be accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Targeted, homology-driven gene insertion in stem cells by ZFN-loaded 'all-in-one' lentiviral vectors&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Hence, focusing on targeted gene insertion in iPSCs, we generated ZFN-loaded ‘all-in-one’ lentiviral vectors targeting a second locus (the human <italic>CCR5</italic> locus) and verified site-directed gene insertion also into this locus. Notably, in all of 15 analyzed iPSC clones the transgene cassette was inserted into the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus. Also, in the revision we are the including the analysis of 15 additional iPSC clones treated with AAVS1-directed ‘all-in-one’ vectors bringing the total number of analyzed <italic>AAVS1</italic> clones up to 23. Of these 23 clones, 19 harbored an inserted transgene in the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus. Moreover, to address the second point, we have now markedly improved our analysis of specificity and potential off-target cleavage. Hence, we performed next-generation sequencing on pools of iPSC clones appearing after treatment with <italic>AAVS1</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic>-directed ‘all-in-one’ vectors. Importantly, deep sequencing of panels of top-ranked off-target gave no indication of cleavage at off-target sites. Encouragingly, our analysis also showed that targeted gene insertion into the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus by lentiviral ZFN protein delivery was not accompanied by cleavage and indel formation in the <italic>CCR2</italic> locus, a well-known off-target locus, which is known from the literature to be frequently targeted when other delivery approaches are utilized.</p><p><italic>We also request that you address the additional issues surrounding methodology and data presentation that are raised by both referees.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript by Cai and colleagues presents a method for targeted gene integration (TGI) into human cells via an all-in-one integration defective lentiviral system coupled with ZFN protein and donor template delivery.

In general, I found the study very well described, however there is some lack of clarity in experimental descriptions, figure legends and methods.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It is unclear to me whether the study demonstrates replication at a second independent target site from AAVS1. I cannot find in the text nor the legend which site they are targeting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> They compared EF-C and RetroNectin using the AAVS1 target, but the PCR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and 2G</xref> shows CCR5 this the target? I see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> that CCR5 is amplified in 1F and 1I, why would you not assay AAVS1 to see if the target site is intact? This lack of clarity and description is a problem throughout the text and figures as the authors have oversimplified the reagent descriptions. For example, instead of just saying IDLV-ZFN/egfp, it should read IDLV-CCR5/egfp or IDLV-AAVS1/egfp in each part, or something similar. The manuscript needs a thorough review in this regard and Figures and legends should be described and labeled accordingly. If <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is also showing targeting AAVS1, then it seems they have the tools available to attempt the TGI into the CCR5 locus in either the CD34<sup>+</sup> or iPS cells.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the names and descriptions of the reagents were perhaps oversimplified in the original submission. In the original manuscript we only targeted the<italic>AAVS1</italic> locus, and this is why we decided to simplify names of lentiviral particles and viral vectors. PCR amplification of the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus was only occasionally used as a control, and this clearly led to some confusion. Things are different in the revised manuscript, as we have now included vectors that target the human <italic>CCR5</italic> locus. This also means that the nomenclature has been changed (and improved). Throughout the text, we now use the format ‘LP-ZFN(locus)’ to describe lentiviral particles loaded with ZFNs targeting the mentioned locus and ‘IDLV-ZFN(locus)/<italic>gene</italic>’ to describe IDLVs loaded with locus-directed ZFNs and carrying a specific transgene (<italic>egfp, fluc</italic> or <italic>puro</italic>). The nomenclature is explained where relevant (e.g. Results, first paragraph) and is used throughout the manuscript and in figures.</p><p><italic>2) I am not familiar with RetroNectin or EF-C. Please define and reference these approaches.</italic></p><p>We have revised the text (Results, sixth paragraph), which now includes further information on both RetroNectin and EF-C.</p><p><italic>3) In the last paragraph of the Results, it is unclear what is meant by sequencing the AAVS1 locus. Do the authors mean sequencing the non-modified allele?</italic> </p><p>This part of the manuscript has been substantially revised, and the particular sentence, which now appears in the ninth paragraph of the Results, has been changed. The reviewer is correct that we sequenced the <italic>AAVS1</italic> site to search for modifications in the allele without the insertion. To clarify this point the wording is now as follows: “Interestingly, sequencing of the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus provided evidence of biallelic cleavage in at least one of the clones (clone 5), resulting in a 1-bp insertion in the allele that did not contain the transgene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).”</p><p><italic>4) Please describe the methods used to identify the off target sites reported. Was off target analysis performed with CCR5, such as looking at CCR2 in targeted clones?</italic></p><p>Originally, we only looked for off-target cleavage in the three top-ranked off-target sites in the 8 iPSC clones carrying an insertion in the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus. We did not address <italic>CCR5</italic>-directed insertion in the original manuscript and therefore did not get into the issue of off-target insertion in the <italic>CCR2</italic> locus. However, as mentioned, we have extended the analysis now to include lentiviral vectors loaded with <italic>CCR5</italic>-targeting ZFNs and verify the use of such IDLVs for prominent site-directed transgene insertion into the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus. Notably, all clones generated by this approach harbored the site-directed gene insertion (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). We obviously agree with both reviewers that a NGS-based approach was required to strengthen the analysis. This analysis has now been carried out on lentivirally transduced iPSCs harboring insertions in either the <italic>AAVS1</italic> or the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus. Hence, the analysis focuses on identifying cleavage leading to indels in the non-modified on-target allele or in panels of top-ranked off-target sites, including in the case of <italic>CCR5</italic> the <italic>CCR2</italic> locus (off-target 3). NGS data showing on-target cleavage in both the <italic>AAVS1</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic> loci (3 and 19%, respectively) do not provide evidence of any off-target cleavage in any of the predicted sites (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3H and 3L</xref>). Interestingly, targeting of the <italic>CCR2</italic> after delivery of CCR5-directed ZFN proteins is at the background level, indicating that cells harboring an on-target <italic>CCR5</italic> insertion do not have indels in the most prominent and well-known off-target locus. Hence, in comparison to other delivery methods protein delivery using lentiviral vectors seems gentler on the off-target loci even in cells where the nucleases are cutting both on-target alleles.</p><p>As noted above, we have also extended the analysis of <italic>AAVS1</italic>-targeted IDLVs including now more a thorough analysis of a total of 23 iPSC clones. Southern blot data on 15 of these clones have now been added. As a result, this part of the manuscript has been fully revised. The description of <italic>AAVS1</italic>-directed gene insertion in iPSCs is now in the ninth and tenth paragraphs of the Results. Following this section, we have included new work related to targeting of the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus (Results, eleventh paragraph). Both these sections include data based on NGS.

In accordance with other Southern data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we believe that the varying band intensities represent differences in the amounts of DNA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> </p><p><italic>It would be great if the authors could provide full sequence maps of these vectors, they are likely to be widely sought after and it would facilitate others trying to replicate this and similar approaches.</italic> </p><p>Sequences of the relevant parts of all donor constructs (homology arms, promoter, gene) are now available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>.

The experimental objectives and methods are well described, and the key findings should benefit those interested in similar therapeutic gene-delivery strategies. However, there are a few key points that impact the novelty of the results. Furthermore, some of the finding implications would challenge ZFN-loaded 'all-in-one' vectors as an efficient method for targeted gene integration (TGI). These concepts are addressed below.</italic></p><p>As pointed out in the text, the work described in the manuscript is a follow-up study to the paper in eLife (2014) entitled: &quot;Targeted genome editing by lentiviral protein transduction of zinc-finger and TAL-effector nucleases&quot; by the same group. In this previous work, the authors described the use of similar 'all-in-one' lentiviral vectors co-packaged with ZFN or TALEN proteins to promote HR-mediated gene editing at the CCN5 and AAVS1 loci. The two main differences between the previous work, and the current one is that, 1) the authors attempt to explore in depth, the specificity and efficacy by which 'all-in-one' lentiviral vectors can promote TGI; and 2), the authors describe a protocol for TGI in hematopoietic stem cells and iPSCs.</p><p><italic>1) There are a handful of published reports that have explored the insertion of transgenes (including ZNFs, albeit in a two-vector strategy) into the AAVS1 locus in ES cells and iPSCs and these should be cited:</italic></p><p><italic>Select publications:</italic></p><p><italic>Tay FC, et al., Targeted transgene insertion into the AAVS1 locus driven by baculoviral vector-mediated zinc finger nuclease expression in human-induced pluripotent stem cells.

However, their evidence of site-specific integration falls short. As the authors have illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, low frequency, off-target integration events do occur. However, it is in this reviewer's opinion that conventional PCR and Southern blot analysis are limited in their ability to detect the prevalence of additional off-target events. Although the authors do query 5 top off-target sites, these are only predicted sites that are based on the designed ZFN's position weight matrix using the PROGNOS tool. They do not consider off-target integration events at hotspots that are independent of ZFN activity. For instance, the use of genome-wide approaches have found that translocations via non-specific NHEJ events due to CRISPR/Cas9- or TALEN-mediated gene editing are numerous:</italic></p><p><italic>Frock RL et al., Genome-wide detection of DNA double-stranded breaks induced by engineered nucleases. Nat Biotechnol. 2015 Feb;33(2):179-86. doi: 10.1038/nbt.3101. Epub 2014 Dec 15.</italic></p><p><italic>This is especially critical when the authors demonstrate that 5-8% of the insertions are due to NHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G and 1J</xref>). Therefore, the frequency by which delivered ZFNs will promote non-specific NHEJ events on a genome-wide scale is unclear. The authors do attempt to address whether lentiviral treatment can cause genomic instability by demonstrating stem-cell integrity and karyotyping in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. However, only a single-representative clone was analyzed as described in the last paragraph of the Results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E and 3F</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> is of low quality and karyotyping to assess translocation events should be performed using spectral-karyotyping, on more than one clone.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the evidence of site-directed gene insertion should not fall short. We acknowledge the point that more information on insertion patterns (than we originally provided) would support the claims made in the original submission. We chose to focus our additional analyses on iPSCs, in which we find frequent site-directed gene insertion using the ‘all-in-one’ gene delivery system. We carried out PCR of 5’ and 3’ junction sites as well as Southern blot analysis on 15 additional clones generated with <italic>AAVS1</italic>-directed vectors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, the PCR data were in complete accordance with the Southern data clearly identifying clones that contained a site-directed gene insertion. Obviously, Southern blotting additionally provides information on the appearance of additional insertions in specific clones. One example is clone 22 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Hence, in this context Southern blotting is sufficient to identify events of randomly inserted lentiviral vectors. It is well known from the literature that even IDLVs (integrase-defective lentiviral vectors) may occasionally insert into the genome, and this is obviously confirmed by our data. However, it would not be relevant here to carry out genome-wide studies to identify such off-target random insertion sites that are not necessarily related to ZFN function. Although it cannot be excluded that such events may occur, it is much more relevant, as noted by the reviewer, to focus on the analysis on indel formation in off-target recognition sites. One can argue that a complete genome-wide analysis would be relevant for this matter (also to detect translocations), but we believe that an extensive, NGS-based analysis of an extended panel of predicted off-target loci was sufficient to demonstrate the specificity of the approach. In addition to work involving <italic>AAVS1</italic>-targeted vector, we also (as mentioned) included a whole new series of experiments including <italic>CCR5</italic>-targeted vectors. Here, we confirmed site-directed insertion by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>) and concentrated on the NGS analysis of ZFN activity at a panel of 9 off-target loci including the <italic>CCR2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). The lack of detectable cleavage in the <italic>CCR2</italic> locus (as shown by the lack of indel formation in this locus in a large pool of clones with ZFN-induced <italic>CCR5</italic>-directed insertions and evidence of substantial biallelic cleavage) is to us a strong indication that this ZFN delivery approach – possibly due to the strongly time-restricted presence of ZFNs – has unprecedented specificity and is safe. Overall, we believe that we have carefully addressed key issues related to achieving site-directed gene insertion. We acknowledge the importance of the genomic integrity and long-term potential of ZFN-engineered iPSCs, but also feel that such studies belong in a future report that may not fit in this ‘Research Advances’ format.</p><p>The reviewer alludes to experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and 1J</xref>, arguing that between 5 and 8% of the insertions are due to NHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G and 1J</xref>). It should be pointed out that the mentioned assays indicate rates of imprecise repair by NHEJ in non-targeted alleles and, thus, do not quantify insertions involving NHEJ.</p><p><italic>3) In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, lane 9 suggests that the AAVS1 locus has been successfully targeted by IDLV-ZFN/puro, however a second integration event is detectable. This observation suggests that the methodology can lead to multiple integration events in the genome, within single clones. If this is indeed the case, the authors need to discuss how this can impact the efficacy of TGI via IDLV-ZFN/transgene vectors in therapeutic settings.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is correct; transduction with IDLVs may potentially lead to insertion, and this is an often-overlooked fact in the literature. Even with a relatively potent site-directed gene insertion strategy (as the one we demonstrate here), we occasionally observed such secondary events, which may potentially affect potential therapeutic use. To stress that such events occur and may be of relevance also for therapeutic applications, we have added a single sentence in the Discussion: “Also, as typically observed in relation to the standard use of IDLVs, we found that a few clones contained an additional, randomly inserted transgene cassette, which could be of relevance for potential future therapeutic use.”</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are two remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Please acknowledge any published reports that have explored the insertion of transgenes into the AAVS1 locus in ES cells and iPSCs using ZNFs using 2-vector systems, per the comment below:</italic></p><p><italic>&quot;It should again be noted that the study's results expand upon the group's previous innovation, and a handful of published reports have already explored the insertion of transgenes into the AAVS1 locus in ES cells and iPSCs using ZNFs (but using 2-vector systems).&quot;</italic></p><p>We certainly agree that our work expands upon our previous findings and the attempts and success of other groups to target gene insertion using nuclease-based strategies. To acknowledge these previous reports, we have added the following to the Discussion: “TGI into the <italic>AAVS1</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic> loci of stem cells has previously been achieved using HR-based strategies exploiting two- or three component systems based on delivery of plasmids, IDLVs, and baculovirus vectors as well as combinations of mRNA encoding ZFNs and IDLVs serving as the HR donor 3, 4, 7, 8, 21, 22.”</p><p><italic>2) Please address the concern raised about the quality of the blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, as discussed below:</italic></p><p><italic>&quot;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref> blot is now of very low quality.

Please ensure that this is fixed.&quot;</italic></p><p>It is correct that the quality of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref> in the previous submission was suboptimal. However, the resolution of the figure that we originally uploaded was good, and the figure was somehow formatted during the submission process (apparently during formation of the manuscript PDF). We are uploading the original figure again and are hoping, thus, that the problem is fixed. We checked the separate figure file (from our last submission) and found that this figure was OK, so we expect this to be a formatting problem, which is now hopefully fixed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
