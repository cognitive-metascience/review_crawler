defining the complex mechanisms of aging and longevity. Zebrafish, while a prominent model for vertebrate development, have not been used systematically to address questions of how and why we age. In a mutagenesis screen focusing on late developmental phenotypes, we identified a new mutant that displays aging phenotypes at young adult stages. We find that the phenotypes are due to loss-of-function in the non-classical cadherin <italic>celsr1a</italic>. The premature aging is not associated with increased cellular senescence or telomere length but is a result of a failure to maintain progenitor cell populations. We show that <italic>celsr1a</italic> is essential for maintenance of stem cell progenitors in late stages. Caloric restriction can ameliorate <italic>celsr1a</italic> aging phenotypes. These data suggest that <italic>celsr1a</italic> function helps to mediate stem cell maintenance during maturation and homeostasis of tissues and thus regulates the onset or expressivity of aging phenotypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>progeria</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2R01DE019837-09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The use of forward genetic screens in zebrafish identifies a new model of vertebrate aging, defining the regulating of the onset of aging phenotypes through maintenance of progenitor cell populations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging can be viewed as the progressive degeneration of tissue and physiological homeostasis through time. The regulation of aging is complex as it integrates environment, lifestyle, and genetic architecture to maintain homeostasis. In contrast, aging has a clear phylogenetic basis both in the maximum lifespan as well as the expressivity of aging traits. Evolution has shaped the manifestation of aging in different animals as is reflected in shared characteristics and mechanisms even between humans and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kenyon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vijg and Suh, 2005</xref>). These common foundations have allowed the use of experimental laboratory and natural populations to investigate how and why we age. Unbiased genetic screens in Baker’s yeast <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>, the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and the fruitfly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have been instrumental in illuminating the genetic and biochemical aspects of aging of vertebrates. Similar unbiased approaches in the mouse have been limited, in part because of the restricted number of progeny produced as well as the fact that mice have relatively long lifespans, which restricts a systematic analysis of the mechanisms of aging from forward genetic approaches. Through the direct analysis of pathways identified in invertebrate and yeast models, however, the mouse has functioned as a key experimental system to identify shared aspects of aging and to understand modifiers of aging mechanisms through both environmental and genetic perturbations. Identification of alternative vertebrate models that can leverage the tools of forward genetics would be valuable to identify vertebrate specific regulators of this process.</p><p>Fish have long been important models in the study of aging and lifespan. In particular, guppies (<italic>Poecilia reticulata</italic>) have served as a natural and laboratory accessible model to address the causes and evolutionary shaping of senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bronikowski and Promislow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reznick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reznick et al., 2004</xref>). Guppies, however, are not well suited for forward genetic approaches leading to the need for other models for use in the laboratory. Recently, the killifish, <italic>Nothobranchius furzeri,</italic> has become an often used research organism to understand the causes of vertebrate aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Genade et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu and Brunet, 2018</xref>). The utility of this fish model has been due in part to their short lifespan, but like other teleost fish laboratory models they share experimental accessibility, allowing study of gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Valenzano et al., 2011</xref>). Although within strain variation in longevity and aging phenotypes are being addressed through genetic mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kirschner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Terzibasi et al., 2007</xref>), to date this model has not been used in broader forward genetic approaches that have been the strength of prior work in other species to uncover how aging and longevity is encoded and can vary.</p><p>Zebrafish and medaka have been workhorse models for developmental genetics, however the use of these species to address aging has been limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Keller and Murtha, 2004</xref>). Through reverse genetic approaches, studies have shown that zebrafish share telomere-mediated senescent programs and phenotypes of aging similar to that seen in other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anchelin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carneiro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henriques et al., 2013</xref>). The phenotypic spectrum includes loss of tissue homeostasis, reduction in fecundity and fertility, arched spine or kyphosis, and shortened lifespan. Specific <italic>lamin A</italic> variants associated with aging-like phenotypes in Hutchinson Gilford progeria have been specifically tested in zebrafish and show analogous progeric aging phenotypes to human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Koshimizu et al., 2011</xref>). Similar loss-of-function experiments on medaka have not been carried out, although telomerase has been shown to be associated with senescent phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hatakeyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hatakeyama et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that this fish can support genetic analysis of senescence as well. These papers set the foundation for use of small laboratory fishes to study the genetic regulation of aging as they demonstrate shared phenotypic outcomes of known genetic regulators of aging. However, unlike invertebrate genetic models of aging, zebrafish and medaka are not particularly short lived, limiting efficient analysis of lifespan-extending changes. Leveraging the ability to process large numbers of larval zebrafish, Kishi et al. performed one of the first unbiased screens in zebrafish to identify genes associated with senescence using expression of Senescence-associate beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) as a biomarker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kishi et al., 2008</xref>). This study is unique in approach, though specifically targets defects in tissue integrity observed in early larvae. As such, it remains unclear if these mutants are representative of the loci regulating normal aging.</p><p>Here, we report on a novel zebrafish mutant identified through a forward genetic screen for adult phenotypes that exhibits traits in early adulthood that closely resemble those associated with normal aging. The mutant does not show evidence of increased age-associated cellular senescence, but rather is deficient in maintaining tissue integrity through support of stem cell maintenance and proliferation. The phenotype is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the non-classical cadherin, <italic>cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1a</italic> (<italic>celsr1a)</italic>. We observe a general loss of proliferative phenotypes in tissues suggesting that the progeric defect seen in mutants is associated with loss of homeostasis in adult tissues. Following we find that the function of <italic>celsr1a</italic> is necessary for the expression of stem cell factors in different tissues. These results suggest that <italic>celsr1a</italic> is linked to stem cell maintenance and/or proliferation and that disruption of its function leads to premature aging phenotypes in zebrafish. Affirming the role of <italic>celsr1a</italic> in aging programs, we show that caloric restriction can alleviate reduced viability and tissue level pathologies associated with <italic>celsr1a</italic> loss, in part through upregulation of <italic>celsr1</italic> paralogues. The identification of a zebrafish model for regulation of stem cell maintenance in aging opens up new avenues for aging research using zebrafish as a genetic tool for discovery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The identification of an adult zebrafish mutant with precocious geriatric phenotypes</title><p>In a large-scale screen for mutations affecting late development of the zebrafish, we isolated a class of mutants having altered scale patterning phenotypes and kyphosis in 10–12 week old adults (wpf, weeks post fertilization). These mutants displayed a broad collection of phenotypes that became more severe with age and resembled normal aging in zebrafish arising in our facilities in fish greater than 18 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The mutant phenotype was detected in both male and female fish. We focused on one of these mutants, named <italic>fruehrentner (frnt)</italic>, or ‘early retiree’ in German. The cumulative phenotypic effects from the <italic>frnt</italic> mutation lead to a progressive decrease in lifespan, with about half of mutant progeny dying before 9–10 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Fish living beyond this point showed progressive deterioration of their appearance and manifestation of sensorial neural defects causing them to swim erratically and in circles when presented with an acoustic stimulus (Suppl. <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Broadly these phenotypes resembled normal aging in wild-type zebrafish, however were apparent during early adult stages. Importantly, the <italic>frnt</italic> mutant exhibited no apparent outward morphological phenotypes as larvae or in juvenile stages. Instead, the observed phenotypes were acquired and only appear in early adult fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of a zebrafish mutant, <italic>fruehrentner</italic> (<italic>frnt</italic>), exhibiting late phenotypes that resemble normal aging.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Aging phenotypes of young <italic>frnt</italic> mutant and old wild-type (wt) zebrafish.

In zebrafish, muscle fiber type is segregated in the trunk into a peripheral domain of slow muscle overlying fast muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). In <italic>frnt</italic>, the fibers of the slow muscle are severely affected and have smaller fiber size and hyperproliferation of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), many of which are degenerating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). Fast muscle fibers were not obviously affected in the mutant (data not shown). Histological analysis of aged wild-type fish shows comparable thinning of slow muscle fiber thickness as well as fibrosis of the surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The <italic>frnt</italic> mutant also shows striking defects in the structure of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). The epidermis of the adult zebrafish integument is a stratified epithelium with prominent cuboidal basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). <italic>frnt</italic> mutants of comparable age show a drastic thinning of the epidermis with fewer basal cells and lengthened squamous cells overlying a thickened dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). A similar epidermal thinning and cellular structure is observed in old wild-type zebrafish (&gt;2.5 years; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results suggest that the <italic>frnt</italic> mutant affects tissues with high metabolic activity, such as the skin and slow muscle, and is reminiscent of phenotypes observed during normal aging in zebrafish.</p><p>The histological characteristics, such as sarcopenia and diminished basal cells of the epidermis, suggest that progenitor cell deficiencies may underlie these pathologies. Supporting this hypothesis, we found that expression of <italic>pax7a</italic>, a marker for muscle satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berberoglu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Seale et al., 2000</xref>), was decreased in <italic>frnt</italic> slow muscle whereas analysis of a more general cell proliferation marker, <italic>cdnk1a</italic>/<italic>p21,</italic> did not show significant changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). Following, we also assessed expression of <italic>ΔNp63</italic>, which marks potential stem cells of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guzman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Keyes et al., 2005</xref>), as well as the epidermal tight junction marker <italic>claudin-b</italic> as a control in epidermis. We observed a similar decrease in expression in the <italic>frnt</italic> mutant specifically for <italic>ΔNp63</italic> but not <italic>claudin-b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J,K</xref>). Thus, the acquired senescent phenotypes observed in the <italic>frnt</italic> mutant coincide with a decrease in progenitor cell markers in these tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The effect of <italic>frnt</italic> manifests late in development</title><p>We extended our analysis of the <italic>frnt</italic> mutant phenotype to ask when in development we were able to detect the onset of phenotypes observed in mature fish. Through histological analysis, we measured the development and maintenance of slow muscle through juvenile development. At 3 weeks of age, both <italic>frnt</italic> mutants and siblings have comparable slow muscle fiber diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). However, at 3 and 9 months of development, fiber size in <italic>frnt</italic> mutants is substantially smaller than in their wild-type siblings. This size difference is due to the decreased capacity of fibers to increase in size after 3 weeks of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Additionally, we used histological analysis of DAPI stained sections to identify changes in basal cell number in the developing zebrafish epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L–N</xref>). At 3 months of age there is little difference in basal cell number between <italic>frnt</italic> mutant and wild-type sibling controls. However, at 9 months <italic>frnt</italic> is deficient in the number of basal cells compared with age matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Thus, similar to slow muscle fibers, the <italic>frnt</italic> phenotype in skin is associated with a failure to increase in cell number. These results suggest that the <italic>frnt</italic> phenotypes manifest during late development, increase in severity with progressive age and affect proliferative/growth potential of maturing tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The <italic>frnt</italic> phenotype does not stem from increased senescence</title><p>Cellular senescence is thought to be one factor regulating homeostasis and onset of aging within tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Collado et al., 2007</xref>). Hallmark phenotypes of senescence are loss of telomere length as well as activity of lysosomal β -galactosidase, commonly referred to as senescence-associated β- galactosidase (SA-β-gal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dimri et al., 1995</xref>). Telomeres act as essential regulators of genomic stability that allow for fidelity in genome replication. In each replication of chromosomes, telomere length is maintained by a specialized molecular complex, shelterin, through action of the <italic>tert</italic> gene product.</p><p>To understand if senescence was an underlying basis of the <italic>frnt</italic> phenotype, we first looked at total telomere length in mutant zebrafish tissue by Southern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For a positive control, we analyzed telomere length in first generation <italic>tert</italic> homozygous mutants, as these mutants have been shown to exhibit late age-related phenotypes and accumulation of senescent biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anchelin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henriques et al., 2013</xref>). Southern blots from 1 year-old <italic>tert</italic> mutant tissues show a distinct reduction of average telomere length. In contrast, age matched <italic>frnt</italic> mutants do not show an appreciable change compared to wild-type fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We further analyzed the activity of SA-β-gal in histological sections of <italic>frnt</italic>, <italic>tert</italic> mutants and age-matched wild-type tissues as a measure of senescence. Compared to heterozygous siblings, <italic>tert</italic> homozygous mutants show considerable activity of SA-β-gal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). In contrast, we saw no discernable difference between <italic>frnt</italic> homozygous mutants and wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>).

Initial mapping showed tight linkage to chromosome 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Efforts to refine the map interval using polymorphic markers was limited as the linked region fell within a large chromosomal interval showing low heterozygosity and limited recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). As we had genomic sequence of the whole interval, we were able to define several missense mutations as potential candidate mutations for causing the <italic>frnt</italic> mutant phenotype, however, there were too many mutations to functionally address. Thus, we performed a non-complementation screen to identify further alleles of <italic>frnt</italic> to define the affected gene. First, using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) induced mutagenesis of wild-type zebrafish, we identified a mutant (<italic>mh36</italic>) within progeny from crosses to <italic>frnt</italic> homozygous fish that failed to complement <italic>frnt.</italic> Sequencing the exome of homozygous <italic>mh36</italic> led to the identification of a nonsense mutation (C1693X) in the gene <italic>celsr1a</italic> within the linked interval of <italic>frnt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As chemical mutagenesis can lead to many mutations and the mapping interval was large, we extended this approach by making targeted deletions using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing in the <italic>frnt</italic> heterozygous background. We were successful in identifying mutants that exhibited the <italic>frnt</italic> aging phenotype having insertion/deletions predicted to lead to premature truncation of the <italic>celsr1a</italic> gene product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Following these non-complementation approaches, we reassessed our mapping in the original <italic>frnt</italic> mutant. In depth analysis of the whole genome sequence data of <italic>frnt</italic> mutants at the <italic>celsr1a</italic> gene locus uncovered a unique transposon insertion of approximately 3.5 kb into exon 1 of the <italic>celsr1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The effect of this insertion is predicted to lead to an early truncation of the protein. The identification of a transposon as a cause of the <italic>frnt</italic> phenotype, suggested that the allele was present in the background founders used in the screen. Supporting this conclusion, we found that several isolated families having this phenotype were derived from the same original male founders. Thus, through our mapping of <italic>frnt</italic> and non-complementation analysis, we have identified that the <italic>frnt</italic> phenotype is due to a disruption of <italic>celsr1a</italic> function.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Identification of altered <italic>celsr1a</italic> function underlying the <italic>frnt</italic> phenotype.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mapping by homozygosity-by-descent indicates linkage of <italic>frnt</italic> to chromosome 4.

In contrast to hair, which is primarily an ectodermal derivative, scales in fishes are primarily mesodermal, comprising components of the dermal skeleton. However, scale development is dependent on the formation of an ectodermal placode, a structure homologous to the placodes necessary for other integumentary structures such as hair and feathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harris et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, early aspects of formation and patterning are conserved between divergent structures of scales and hair, and it has recently been shown that further downstream pattering is similar as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aman et al., 2018</xref>). Scales form ordered arrays of overlapping surface skeletal elements across the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Within each scale there is an internal polarity, biasing the growth to the caudal aspect of the scale from an initial osteogenic focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>); this polarized accretionary growth leads to the formation of overlapping arrays of scales along the flank of the fish. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Iwasaki et al.

Caloric and dietary restriction are two commonly used strategies that have been shown across animals to have a consistent protective effect on the manifestation of aging phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fontana and Partridge, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Speakman and Mitchell, 2011</xref>). The regulation of these effects on reducing aging phenotypes is thought to be in part through the action of the Sirtuin family of acetyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guarente, 2013</xref>), mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blagosklonny, 2010</xref>) and Insulin receptor/Foxo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mouchiroud et al., 2013</xref>).

In order to avoid malnutrition, we designed unique feeds that limit the total caloric content of the food without reducing the lipid and vitamins/minerals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Observations showed that adult fish actively fed on all experimental feeds. Two separate replicate experiments were set up. In each, an equal number of young adult fish of particular genotypes were grouped into common feeding populations. In the first experiment, wild-type fish were compared to homozygous mutants (n = 17), whereas in the second experiment <italic>frnt</italic> siblings (i.e. +/+ and +/-) were compared (n = 30). Over the course of the experiment, there was no significant reduction in weight in the different feeding groups, however there was a marked lack of an increase in body mass in the 50% restricted feeding group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Zebrafish fed with control feed followed the general expectation for the zebrafish lifespan, with greater than 70% survival over a 5 month period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). <italic>Frnt</italic> sibling controls (wild-type and heterozygous mutants) however, provided with the same feed showed a considerable shift in viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), suggesting a potential dominant effect of <italic>celsr1a</italic> on long-term viability. In both experiments, 25% reduction in calories did not show any significant effect on viability in wild-type, sibling controls or <italic>frnt</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). However, in 50% calorie reduced groups, both homozygous <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutants as well as control groups showed a significant shift in lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). As viability is a broad assessment of potential changes in aging, we looked closely at changes in phenotypes associated with loss of <italic>celsr1a</italic> function in mutants fed different diets. As feeding regimens were initiated in 3 month-old fish sorted by their integumentary phenotypes, scale phenotypes were found in all treated fish as they were already present at the start of feeding. Therefore, this phenotype cannot be used to assess response to caloric restriction (CR). We used behavior as an overt measure of change in aging-related degenerative phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, Suppl. <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>).

As other planar cell polarity regulators are associated with neural tube defects and have been shown to genetically interact with Celsr1 to increase the severity of the pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murdoch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), planar cell polarity most likely plays a key role in the etiology of these disorders. We do not see neural tube defects arising in the <italic>frnt</italic> mutants nor do we observe reduced numbers of juvenile <italic>celsr1a</italic> homozygous mutants as would be expected from early lethality. Zebrafish have two paralogues of many genes as a result of an ancestral whole genome duplication. Retention of paralogues can provide redundancy and buffering of essential functions, allowing for resolution of functions later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kassahn et al., 2009</xref>). Although we have not specifically investigated the overlapping function of <italic>celsr1</italic> paralogues, such redundancy could underlie the lack of early neurulation phenotypes in the <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutants. Another hypothesis for the lack of neural tube deficiencies in the zebrafish <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutants is simply that, as teleosts form the neural tube by cavitation of the neural keel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Papan and Campos-Ortega, 1994</xref>) and not intercalation of neural folds as in amniotes, <italic>celsr1a</italic> and/or PCP is not essential for this developmental mechanism.

We see an analogous phenotype of integumentary phenotypes in the patterning and loss of asymmetry in scales of the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Integumentary appendages, while structurally diverse, all share a common early patterning placodal stage, suggesting this may be a point at which pattering is determined by Celsr1. <italic>Celsr1</italic> mutants in the mouse have been found to have a dominant effect on vestibular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Curtin et al., 2003</xref>).

Recent work has implicated a population of non-proliferative sensory cells that are notch-responsive in the regulation of the stem cell niche during zebrafish intestinal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2019a</xref>). In <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutants, we see a definitive switch of vacuolated EEC phenotypes and general differentiation of the intestinal epithelium, particularly in the posterior region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such qualitative shift in differentiation suggests that the decrease in proliferative capacity may be due to abnormal differentiation of progenitor cells in the mutant. This shift leads from a deficiency in signaling from a <italic>celsr1a</italic> labeled cell populations. Although there is a mechanistic link between PCP and notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Le Garrec and Kerszberg, 2008</xref>), it has not been clarified if a similar relationship exists in the zebrafish intestine. Interestingly, the cells closely resemble a conserved type of vacuolated EEC recently described as Lysosome Rich Enterocytes (LREs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Park et al., 2019</xref>]) that are essential for nutrient uptake and transcellular transport of cargos, however specific characterization of lysosomes within <italic>celsr1a</italic> positive cells remains to be determined.</p><p>The role of <italic>celsr1a</italic> in regulation of adult stem cells may be shared in various tissues. <italic>Celsr1</italic> mRNA is found to be expressed in zones of neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation in the mouse and abates postnatally in parallel to decreasing numbers of NSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goffinet and Tissir, 2017</xref>).

Thus, the effects of <italic>celsr1a</italic> deficiency we observe in the intestine, skin and muscle may have broader implications to stem cell regulation in other tissues, consistent with the degenerative, acquired phenotypes we observe in the <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutants. We observe an association of <italic>celsr1a</italic> effects to highly metabolically active tissues such as the slow muscle, epidermis, and intestinal epithelium. The contrast of the pathologies observed in slow muscle (mitochondrial rich red fibers) compared to fast muscle (white fibers) in <italic>frnt</italic> mutants clearly states this differential. This is consistent with the spectrum of affected tissues in mouse mutants affecting telomere maintenance suggestive of a role in stem cell maintenance as a potential cause of the phenotypes observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carneiro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 1998</xref>). We favor hypotheses of a tissue specific role for <italic>celsr1a</italic> in the regulation of aging phenotypes, however given the role of EECs in hormonal regulation, it remains a possibility that the compound effects and acquired aging phenotypes observed across several tissues in the <italic>frnt</italic> mutant are mediated through systemic/hormonal signaling from the intestine. Such transcellular signaling of EEC cells could foster endocrine signaling that would affect regulation of proliferation and stem cell regulation in other tissues. This hypothesis for intestinal dependence of the senescent phenotypes will require further analysis of tissue specific loss-of-function of <italic>celsr1a</italic> and analysis of maintenance of homeostasis in adults.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A zebrafish model of stem cell regulation and aging</title><p>Phenotypes resembling aging can be influenced by metabolism, activation/alleviation of senescent cell influences, epigenetic regulation such as methylation and acetylation, and general loss of fidelity in transcriptional regulation.

Using an unbiased genetic screen in the zebrafish, we identified a progeric mutant showing broad tissue level deterioration and loss of proliferative capacity of tissues. Our data suggest that the phenotypes are due to specific loss of progenitor cells in tissues and correlate with loss of expression of stem cell markers such as <italic>dNp63</italic> in the epidermis, <italic>pax7a</italic> in slow muscle, as well as known mammalian markers, <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>olfm4,</italic> in the zebrafish intestinal epithelium.

Shifting to a restricted diet in late development showed to be quite efficacious in extending the viability of the mutant, as well as heterozygous siblings specifically in 50% caloric reduced feeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Caloric restriction also resulted in decreased manifestation of aging phenotypes in <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutants including behavioral deficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–E</xref>) as well as an upregulation of markers consistent with metabolic regulation of aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F–H</xref>). Interestingly, the effect of caloric restriction led to upregulation of <italic>celsr</italic> paralogues, suggesting that alteration of <italic>celsr</italic> function can compensate in part for <italic>celsr1a</italic> deficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). The reduced expressivity of the mutant phenotype by caloric restriction supports that the alterations in the <italic>frnt</italic> mutant cause changes that are normally modulated by pathways associated with normal aging.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Through use of genetic screens in zebrafish, we have identified a novel role of <italic>celsr1a</italic> in stem cell function, maintenance and/or proliferation and that disruption of this regulation leads to premature aging of zebrafish. Importantly, the phenotypes detailed occur late in development and affect the early onset or expressivity of aging phenotypes. Although zebrafish are not well suited for systematic analysis of longevity due to their relatively long normal lifespan, one promising aspect of defined mutants having premature aging is their use in screens for genes or specific alleles that can specifically abrogate effects on aging or lifespan phenotypes. Such modifier screens remain a viable future research strategy and tool for discovery using this model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Husbandry</title><p>A complete description of the husbandry and environmental conditions in housing for the fish used in these experiments is available as a collection in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__protocols.io&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=qS4goWBT7poplM69zy_3xhKwEW14JZMSdioCoppxeFU&amp;r=qpKjmFLwB96B1ZnYo0eY_7b79jh9C0Jmi299EiN1PwUj2sf91ZjFfGlQ6zJndPu0&amp;m=Ucw_XwQ3HjH0KPda7DfLeGcGaa97AphdAPS2OLYiDnY&amp;s=HV0secdQm8cP3Xq5g3PZYLpZ4cNbAoLWUg68AsPR0WI&amp;e=">protocols.io dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.mrjc54n</ext-link>.

DNA from 20 homozygous F2 from <italic>frnt/+</italic> incrosses was isolated and pooled for DNA library construction. Whole-genome sequencing was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq2000, using 100 bp single-end sequencing. Linkage was confirmed and an interval was narrowed down by analysis of recombinants using microsatellites and SNP markers. To further refine candidate genes, the ENU generated allele (<italic>mh36</italic>) that failed to complement <italic>frnt</italic> was sequenced. DNA was isolated from two homozygous individuals and whole-exome sequencing was carried out using 50 bp paired-end sequencing.

We then used CAP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang and Madan, 1999</xref>) to perform a de novo contig assembly on the identified reads. We were unable to assemble a single contig containing the entire insert, suggesting this insert spanned a greater length than could be contained in a single 100 bp sequencing read. To identify the identity of the insert, we then performed BLAT on Ensembl against the zebrafish genome on the non-<italic>celsr1a</italic> portion of each contig.

Albino fish were present to serve as a balance for fish density and buffer in the case of reduced viability in the study due to the mutant genotype. Two separate experiments were carried out, one with wildtype fish and the other with siblings as controls. Fish were sorted by phenotype at juvenile stages and placed on the experimental diets starting at 5 month and 3.5 months old, respectively. The caloric restriction feed was synthesized by reducing carbohydrate and proteins but maintaining the lipid and vitamins/mineral constant to avoid malnutrition. Feed was produced in the laboratory using defined ingredients. Each diet was prepared by mixing ingredients with reverse osmosis (RO) water until a homogeneous batter was formed. The batter was then spread into a thin sheet and baked at ~212 °F until dry (~1.5 hr) in a commercial convection oven. The diet was then cooled to room temperature, crushed into pieces and ground into crumble form using a bur grinder. Crumbles were then sieved into two size ranges: 100–200 micron for juvenile and 200–300 micron for adult life stages. The ingredient and constitution of the feed is shown in <bold>Suppl.

demonstrates how forward genetic approaches in the zebrafish can be applied to discover genetic regulators of aging. While prior work has looked at larval stress as a proxy, this is the first use of zebrafish genetics to screen for factors controlling aging. This innovative approach reveals a surprising role for <italic>celsr1a</italic>, a non-classical cadherin associated with planar cell polarity, in stem/progenitor cell maintenance. This is supported by premature aging phenotypes in muscle, intestine, skin, and scales, as well as behavioral deficits that emerge during young adult stages in <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutants. These data provide support for hypotheses that stem cell dynamics control the onset and expressivity of aging. Overall, this mutant phenotype is quite interesting, in particular the ability of caloric restricted diets to partially rescue the phenotype. Such dietary modulation of aging phenotypes is a first for zebrafish. This work will be of interest to readers in the fields of developmental biology, stem cell biology, and aging, and provides a framework for cross-disciplinary analysis of aging and its regulation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Celsr1a is essential for tissue homeostasis and onset of aging phenotypes in the zebrafish&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>All reviewers appreciate the innovation of this work identifying new and very interesting aging-related phenotypes in this Cels1ra mutant, but have concerns that the analysis remains fragmented in terms of delving deeply into any particular mechanism in any particular tissue. The reviewers have identified several major concerns that could be addressed to more fully validate some of the major conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting and well-written paper describing a detailed phenotypic characterization of the a novel premature aging mutant in zebrafish. This is the first such mutant to arise from forward genetic screens in zebrafish. The manuscript includes analysis of a number of interesting phenotypes in these mutants including muscle, intestine, skin, scale, and behavioral deficits that emerge during young adult stages. Overall, this mutant phenotype is quite interesting, in particular the ability of the caloric restriction treatment to partially rescue the phenotype, and a useful contribution to the ageing field. However, the complex multi-tissue phenotypic analysis of these mutants results in a fairly fragmented picture of the associated pathology that develops in this mutant. The reader is left unsure which tissues and cells actually require the <italic>ceslr1a</italic> gene to promote normal ageing (as expression of <italic>ceslr1a</italic> is quite widespread), though it's clear that progenitor/stem populations in the above tissues are affected directly or indirectly. Below I list several concerns and potential approaches to improve the clarity and impact of this innovative work.</p><p>1) Figure 7—figure supplement 1E-H and associated text: Please clarify what region of the intestine was used to generate these images. These single images are not sufficient to support the claim in the first paragraph of the subsection “<italic>celsr1a</italic> is required for proliferative capacity and maintenance of intestinal progenitor cells” that there are more goblet cells in the mutant. That would need to be quantified across multiple animals, with clarity on what intestinal regions were assessed. Indeed, when I look at other rugae in panels E and G, it looks like mutants may have <italic>less</italic> goblet cells, so this definitely needs to be more rigorously quantified if the data is to stay in this paper. Also of potential interest, it appears (again, from just these single images) that the mutant intestinal epithelium has aberrant structure beyond goblet cells. To me it looks like there may be an enrichment of lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs) which were very recently described by Michel Bagnat's group (Park et al., 2019). If the authors are indeed able to bring in quantitation from other animals to look at goblet cell number, please also keep an eye on those LRE-like cells to see if that is consistent too. When these edits are made, please also adjust the Discussion text reviewing these data.</p><p>2) Subsection “Role of <italic>celsr1a</italic> in regulating progenitor cell populations”, first paragraph: Figure 7K shows colocalization of <italic>neurod1<sup>+</sup></italic> gut epithelial cells (presumably enteroendocrine cells) with <italic>ceslr1a<sup>GFP</sup></italic> at 4dpf – this alone is not enough to posit here that enteroendocrine cells are contributing to a gut pathology that doesn't emerge until months later. I think the authors would need to evaluate that colocalization at the later adult stages in order to sufficiently strengthen that claim. It would also be helpful if the authors could quantify this colocalization rather than just providing a single image. Similarly, the lack of BrdU incorporation at this early 4dpf stage doesn't have strong relevance for how those cells might behave in adult stages. So, again, I think this would need to be repeated in (young?) adult intestine. As mentioned elsewhere in this review, this recent paper from Ken Wallace's lab (Li et al., 2019a) might be relevant here, as it reports a population of non-proliferating secretory cells in the zebrafish larval intestine that might regulate development of the intestinal stem cell niche. Could these be the same <italic>neurod1<sup>+</sup>/celsr1a<sup>+</sup></italic> cells reported here?</p><p>3) Figure 8E, F: The behavioral phenotype in control diet mutants appears to be driven by just 1-2 animals, with no similar outliers appear in the 25% or 50% CR diet mutants. This seems like a borderline phenotype that may not be worth reporting here. What about some of the other phenotypes reported earlier in the paper, in the muscle and intestine for example? Are they rescued by the 50% CR? As a side note, the behavioral phenotype is interesting, but the absence of any pathological insight there leaves it dangling awkwardly in the narrative. Are there any CNS or vestibular defects apparent by histology or TEM?</p><p>4) Figure 9: The authors claim in the text that this shows compensatory upregulation of <italic>celsr</italic> homologs in <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutants, but none of these paralogs show statistically significant upregulation by 50% CR in the mutant (whereas they are all robustly induced in WT animals). Therefore there's certainly no sign of &quot;compensation&quot; in the mutant, and the overall claim that <italic>celsr</italic> homologs might be functionally compensating for <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutation seems inadequately supported here. I recommend removing these data from the paper, or at least relegating them to the supplementary section and a more minor point in the text. Please also remove/adjust the associated claim in the Discussion on this point.</p><p>5) Considering the fragmented/multi-tissue nature of the mutant phenotypic analysis reported in the earlier part of the paper, the inclusion of the caloric restriction experiment at the end was quite exciting, as it seems to provide an opportunity to see how each affected tissue responds, potentially helping to prioritize future studies. However, the CR fish were only assessed for behavioral and gross anatomical phenotypes. I agree that scale phenotypes may take a while to recover, but why not also look at intestinal or muscle histology (which were deeply phenotyped earlier in the paper under normal feeding conditions)?

This is the first such mutant to arise from forward genetic screens in zebrafish. The manuscript includes analysis of a number of interesting phenotypes in these mutants including muscle, intestine, skin, scale, and behavioral deficits that emerge during young adult stages. Overall, this mutant phenotype is quite interesting, in particular the ability of the caloric restriction treatment to partially rescue the phenotype, and a useful contribution to the ageing field. However, the complex multi-tissue phenotypic analysis of these mutants results in a fairly fragmented picture of the associated pathology that develops in this mutant. The reader is left unsure which tissues and cells actually require the ceslr1a gene to promote normal ageing (as expression of ceslr1a is quite widespread), though it's clear that progenitor/stem populations in the above tissues are affected directly or indirectly. Below I list several concerns and potential approaches to improve the clarity and impact of this innovative work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the interest in our findings and their insight in to how to improve the data. In response to the discussion concerning scope of the characterization, I would refer to the response above concerning our decision on why we chose a broader description of aging phenotypes in the mutant. We agree a deep-dive on a particular tissue would be insightful, but we first have to show plausible mechanism of aging. Once the broad phenotype is presented and accepted by the field as resembling aging, individual organ systems can be studied in depth for effect of loss of <italic>celsr1a</italic> in local context.</p><p>In this work, we were successful in identifying the maintenance of stem cells and markers as key factor that is shared among tissues as a potential cause of the aging phenotype. We have not done experiments to test loss of <italic>celsr1a</italic> only in one tissue (e.g. loss in endothelium of gut only) to assess the essential function of that tissue to maintain normal (non-aging) phenotype. Beyond the technical complexity of this approach, it is not clear if there will be a central cause or additive causes that contribute to aging phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Figure 7—figure supplement 1E-H and associated text: Please clarify what region of the intestine was used to generate these images.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added position in this supplementary figure as well as throughout text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These single images are not sufficient to support the claim in the first paragraph of the subsection “celsr1a is required for proliferative capacity and maintenance of intestinal progenitor cells” that there are more goblet cells in the mutant. That would need to be quantified across multiple animals, with clarity on what intestinal regions were assessed. Indeed, when I look at other rugae in panels E and G, it looks like mutants may have less goblet cells, so this definitely needs to be more rigorously quantified if the data is to stay in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer statement. We have quantitated this phenotype (now added to Figure 9) and the initial observation of increased numbers of goblet cells was in fact not specific rather a general trend. However, in work provided in review, we find that alteration by 50% CR caused regional increase in goblet cell number suggesting a shift in intestinal response in the treatment. As a general description, the vacuolated cell phenotype is qualitatively distinct, just very difficult to quantify without different specific staining methods. We have changed the text to reflect these new data and implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also of potential interest, it appears (again, from just these single images) that the mutant intestinal epithelium has aberrant structure beyond goblet cells. To me it looks like there may be an enrichment of lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs) which were very recently described by Michel Bagnat's group (Park et al., 2019). If the authors are indeed able to bring in quantitation from other animals to look at goblet cell number, please also keep an eye on those LRE-like cells to see if that is consistent too. When these edits are made, please also adjust the Discussion text reviewing these data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree entirely. The <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutant causes major shifts in posterior intestinal vacuolated cell populations as noted by the reviewer. The pictures while of a single individual are representative of the overall phenotype of the mutant. We were not able to devise a robust means to quantitate these phenotypes. We looked at goblet cell # (now in Figure 9) both in the mutant and in CR treated fish. But the boundaries of vacuolated cells were hard to pin down with histology alone. We had not seen the work on LREs prior to submitting our manuscript. We have gone back to add appropriate citation of this work in our description of the phenotype. We have also noted the transcellular signaling function of these cells in potential models of regulation of broader stem cell function in other tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Role of celsr1a in regulating progenitor cell populations”, first paragraph: Figure 7K shows colocalization of neurod1<sup>+</sup> gut epithelial cells (presumably enteroendocrine cells) with ceslr1a<sup>GFP</sup> at 4dpf – this alone is not enough to posit here that enteroendocrine cells are contributing to a gut pathology that doesn't emerge until months later. I think the authors would need to evaluate that colocalization at the later adult stages in order to sufficiently strengthen that claim. It would also be helpful if the authors could quantify this colocalization rather than just providing a single image.</p></disp-quote><p>We have confirmed that we can see colocalization of <italic>neurod1</italic> and <italic>celsr1a:GFP</italic> in adult intestinal epithelia. We have added both pictures and quantitation of colocalization in adults in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the lack of BrdU incorporation at this early 4dpf stage doesn't have strong relevance for how those cells might behave in adult stages. So, again, I think this would need to be repeated in (young?) adult intestine.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated BrdU incorporation in adult <italic>celsr1a:GFP</italic> fish to look at the retention in the intestine and its association with Celsr1 expression. Unfortunately, due to increased autofluorescence in the fixed adult tissue, the results were inconclusive and could not be added to the manuscript. We appreciate the reviewers statement that early developmental associations do not necessarily reflect those occurring in later stages and or in homeostasis. We maintain that the result in the larvae are meaningful, however we have qualified the description in the text to reflect the early developmental stage of these observations. It now reads:</p><p>“BrdU incorporation in intestinal epithelium of larvae in which <italic>celsr1a</italic> cells are marked with GFP (<italic>celsr1a<sup>GFP</sup></italic>) shows restricted incorporation of BrdU in <italic>celsr1a<sup>+</sup></italic> cells during growth (Figure 7J). This suggests that <italic>celsr1a-</italic>expressing cells in the larval intestine are not actively cycling”</p><p>We do not think this passage overstates the findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As mentioned elsewhere in this review, this recent paper from Ken Wallace's lab (Li et al., 2019a) might be relevant here, as it reports a population of non-proliferating secretory cells in the zebrafish larval intestine that might regulate development of the intestinal stem cell niche. Could these be the same neurod1<sup>+</sup>/celsr1a<sup>+</sup> cells reported here?</p></disp-quote><p>The papers from the Wallace lab that were published in the last few months are very interesting. The antibody as described in the manuscript is broad in its detection of different sensory types, such that many EEC cell types all are antibody 2F11 positive. Further selection showed nkx2.2 expression further subdivides these lineages. We were unable to fully define the overlap of <italic>celsr1a<sup>+</sup></italic> cells with the notch responsive lineage. This would be best done with the conditional transgene described in Li et al., 2019. It is a very provocative hypothesis, however beyond the <italic>neurod1:celsr1a</italic> overlap, which is partial, we were unable to dissociate these cells further. Single cell data of zebrafish intestinal cells would be intriguing, however, in cursory analysis of datasets (such as Lickwar et al., 2017) showed <italic>celsr1a</italic> to be lowly expressed, and therefore underpowered to partition into differential EEC subtypes. FACS sorted <italic>celsr1<sup>+</sup></italic> intestines and bulk mRNAseq could approach this question in future work. Importantly, we provide the models, transgenic line, and context in which to follow these questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 8E, F: The behavioral phenotype in control diet mutants appears to be driven by just 1-2 animals, with no similar outliers appear in the 25% or 50% CR diet mutants. This seems like a borderline phenotype that may not be worth reporting here. What about some of the other phenotypes reported earlier in the paper, in the muscle and intestine for example? Are they rescued by the 50% CR? As a side note, the behavioral phenotype is interesting, but the absence of any pathological insight there leaves it dangling awkwardly in the narrative. Are there any CNS or vestibular defects apparent by histology or TEM?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and agree that further investigation into the other tissues was warranted. We now include analysis of effect of CR on slow muscle and intestinal phenotypes observed in the <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutant and have integrated these new data with the qPCR analyses of the same tissue. The results clearly show restoration of the sarcopenia phenotype in both siblings and mutants by 50% CR treatment. Additionally, we show distinct shift in regional differentiation of goblet cells (AB+) in the intestine. These data are now included in a new Figure 9 in the revision.</p><p>The behavioral difference is actually quite robust driven by broad shift in the mean of the whole population in case of ‘turns per second’ and reduction by most of the broader “swirling” behaviors observed in the mutant. Behavior is one of the primary outward phenotypes of the fish (a consistent means of screening adults is to tap on the tank) and thus we feel it is important to include this in the CR analysis. This is nicely paired with specific changes in expression of known metabolic regulators associated with aging in other vertebrates in brain tissue of 50% CR treated and control fish.</p><p>We have previously looked for CNS and vestibular defects in the <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutant fish through our own analyses as well as sharing the mutants with laboratories that specialize in inner ear and neural function. No obvious pathologies were noted. TEM may reveal more nuanced age-dependent pathologies associated with inner ear, however the extensive work required to test the presence of subtle cilial defects in the mutant and their progressive deterioration is a substantial undertaking and outside the realm of this initial description.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 9: The authors claim in the text that this shows compensatory upregulation of celsr homologs in celsr1a mutants, but none of these paralogs show statistically significant upregulation by 50% CR in the mutant (whereas they are all robustly induced in WT animals). Therefore there's certainly no sign of &quot;compensation&quot; in the mutant, and the overall claim that celsr homologs might be functionally compensating for celsr1a mutation seems inadequately supported here. I recommend removing these data from the paper, or at least relegating them to the supplementary section and a more minor point in the text. Please also remove/adjust the associated claim in the Discussion on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment on the measure of change seen in expression of <italic>celsr</italic> paralogues in the CR treated fish. We agree that the effect was modest, but the fold change was consistent between siblings and mutants for each gene. For cases that fell ‘below’ significance, the value was p&lt;0.057. It is hard to argue that the 0.007 difference is enough to warrant removal of the data. In response to reviewers concern, we have moved the data to a supplementary figure (Figure 9—figure supplement 3) and have worked to shape conclusions present in the manuscript including choice of wording apart from ‘compensation’ as this seems to have other baggage these days.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Considering the fragmented/multi-tissue nature of the mutant phenotypic analysis reported in the earlier part of the paper, the inclusion of the caloric restriction experiment at the end was quite exciting, as it seems to provide an opportunity to see how each affected tissue responds, potentially helping to prioritize future studies. However, the CR fish were only assessed for behavioral and gross anatomical phenotypes. I agree that scale phenotypes may take a while to recover, but why not also look at intestinal or muscle histology (which were deeply phenotyped earlier in the paper under normal feeding conditions)?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in response to question #3 above, we have added more data on slow muscle phenotypes in the CR treated fish. We’ve added slow muscle/sarcopenia and intestinal differentiation effects to CR treatment which support rescue/compensational ability of 50% CR on age-related pathologies of the <italic>celsr1a</italic> fish. As this paper is the first to use CR on zebrafish (not dietary restriction) we remain excited about the level of characterization we provide and the evidence of rescue/abrogation of the aging phenotypes in the <italic>celsr1a</italic> mutant fish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, if you have a sense of whether there are vestibular defects, those could be inspected more thoroughly in CR too. Some sort of further phenotypic assessment of this CR rescue would significantly increase the impact of this article.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of a vestibular phenotype in the mutant involving gross anatomical structure. Cilia phenotypes unfortunately would require new samples as fixation is a problem with the samples we have. Such samples would require greater than a year to procure. In response to our review plan, it was stated that this was not necessary for this particular review. We have established a broader long-term collaboration to look at this phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5: The authors' argument that these data support that celsr1a expression is reduced during aging, perhaps lingering in select cells, is not sufficiently supported by the data here.

As stated in the general response to review (above) this is the nature of establishing a broad phenotype such as aging which affects many tissues. The aging field has spent decades trying to pin point a mechanistic regulation of even the ‘big hitter’ genes such as Sirt or FoxO with new mechanisms appearing almost daily. We go to extended lengths to parse out early versus later effects in manifestation of the aging phenotype of a novel zebrafish model to look at resident stem cell maintenance. These findings, through characterization of this new mutant, provide the foundations for extended analysis on detailed cell behavior regulating aging of these tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In &quot;Celsr1a is essential for tissue homeostasis and onset of aging phenotypes in the zebrafish&quot; by Li and colleagues, the authors undertake a genetic screen to identify new mutants exhibiting features of premature aging and identify such a phenotype caused by mutations in the gene celsr1a.

We do appreciate the need to ‘dive-deep’ in mechanisms. As addressed in the more global response above, this paper was to define the novelty of the use of forward genetics to address aging in zebrafish – something not shown previously. By necessity, the manuscript was framed to address if this mutant is reflecting aging phenotypes, and if so, general models of aging that it might be working through. As such, we touched on a wide array of metabolically active tissues and the effect on their maintenance. Of these, the intestine was best suited for analysis of cell type and stem cell populations. But as stated by reviewer 1, even there the markers and prior evidence from the zebrafish gut are not as robust as in the mouse. Our data pushed quite far given these limitations, but this was not intended to be a paper on intestine and the specifics of signaling between different cell populations in development, homeostasis and aging. Further analyses on aging in particular tissues are currently ongoing not only in my lab but several others in the community to assess tissue level detail with specialized tools that these labs have generated. It is precisely the aim of the paper and research agenda overall to establish a zebrafish aging model that can foster such future work. I think we have done well in our design of the approach and present extremely novel data both for the aging field and zebrafish modeling of clinically important phenotypes. Thus, while we feel that the diversity of characterization is essential, in response to the reviewer’s comments we have worked to providing contextual statements as to why.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other major points include:</p><p>1) How are the authors normalizing expression data to show decreased ΔNp63 and pax7a?

This is comparable to published in situs and also that found on ZFIN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The use of label retention as a functional read-out for stem/progenitor cells in the gut is interesting, but why are Anterior BrdU cells/rugae increased at 48 hours of chase in frnt mutants relative to earlier time points? Even with decreased proliferation in the frnt mutants, should not all label-retaining populations stay constant or decreased over time? There may be variability in the degree of baseline labeling for different fish/replicates, but otherwise seems pretty consistent in other regions of the gut and at other time points in other conditions. A comment is sufficient in the Results/Discussion explaining the changes in label retention over time between the earliest and 48 hour time point for the mutant group. How is there increase in label retaining cells over time from 5 to 48 hours in the anterior segment in the cels1ra group? Technical issue? Perhaps different regions were assessed at the different time point?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this is a technical issue and thank the reviewer for their insight in seeing this. In review of the data stemming from the reviewer comment, we noticed that the 48 hour time point may have fewer rugae than other time points. This seems to be limited to only that group as all the other controls were comparable. We revisited means of normalizing between individuals that may compensate for this, however analysis using both BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells per/ total DAPI positive cells as well as overall area, and have found that Rugae is the most robust means of normalizing the data – as total cell # as well as area was too variable within a sample. This is probably due to proliferating cells being concentrated at the valleys between rugae. We will note the potential confounding effect of low rugae # in interpreting the data. This is now found in Materials and methods and in the legend of Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In response to reviewer 1's concern 1, you added new data on intestinal goblet cell number (Figure 9K, L). The new data shows that the frnt genotype does not alter the observed increase in goblet cell number that occurs with CR. This is useful new data, but there appears to be no statistical analysis to support the claim that CR increases goblet cell number (for either genotype or intestinal region). Please add analysis of statistical significance to support this claim, or state in the legend that those differences did not reach statistical significance. Also, there is no panel M in this figure anymore, so please edit the figure legend accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added statistical analysis showing significant difference in goblet cell number after CR treatment in both middle and posterior regions. We have added notation of significance and added details to the figure legend. We thank the editor in noticing the leftover text from process of review and we have deleted the citation of panel M.</p></body></sub-article></article>
