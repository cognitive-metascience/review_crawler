them with resistance to standard therapy. Using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, we here confirm an MMR-deficient mutation signature that is distinct from other tumor genomes, but surprisingly similar to germ-line DNA, indicating that a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises through mutations escaping MMR. Moreover, we identify a large set of recurrent indels that may serve to detect microsatellite instability (MSI). Indeed, using endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, we optimize a novel marker set capable of detecting MSI and show it to have greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. Additionally, we show that recurrent indels are enriched for the ‘DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination’ pathway. Consequently, DSB repair is reduced in MMR-deficient tumors, triggering a dose-dependent sensitivity of MMR-deficient tumor cultures to DSB inducers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02725.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02725.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02725.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before a cell divides, it must first copy all of its genetic material. Any mistakes that are made during this process are called mutations. Mutations can give rise to new traits but are mostly harmful to the cells, or cause cancer; therefore, cells have evolved tools that can efficiently spot these mistakes and repair them. One of the main tools is called mismatch repair (MMR).</p><p>Defects in the cell's mismatch repair tools can wreak havoc as this allows many mutations to accumulate. Zhao et al. looked at the genomes of tumors where mismatch repair was not working properly to see what makes these ‘MMR-deficient tumors’ different from other tumors. This revealed that MMR-deficient tumors have similar patterns of mutations to those seen in egg and sperm cells. This was unexpected and suggests that mutations that are not corrected by mismatch repair are an important source of the genetic differences found between different humans, and between humans and their ancestors.</p><p>Identifying cancerous tumors that are MMR-deficient is vital, as these tumors tend not to respond to commonly used cancer treatments. However, current clinical methods to identify MMR-deficient tumors often fail or produce results that are difficult to interpret. MMR-deficient tumors commonly contain mutations called indels, where short fragments of DNA are inserted or deleted into longer DNA sequences. Zhao et al. have found 59 indels that can be used to detect MMR-deficient tumors, where each indel had been identified in several tumors taken from different tissues. This new approach allowed MMR-deficiency to be identified in several types of tumor, including colon and ovarian cancers, with greater sensitivity and accuracy than the existing methods.</p><p>Zhao et al. also found that the indels in MMR-deficient tumors reduce the ability of the tumors to repair a type of DNA damage called double-strand breaks. In these, both strands of DNA that make up the double helix are broken and the DNA chain is severed. As this kind of damage is very harmful to a cell, making more double-strand breaks could therefore form part of a more effective treatment against MMR-deficient tumors; further research is needed to investigate this possibility.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02725.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02725.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

Lynch syndrome, which is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder of cancer susceptibility triggered by loss-of-function mutations in MMR genes (<italic>MLH1</italic>, <italic>MSH2</italic>, or <italic>MSH6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiricny, 2006</xref>). Lynch syndrome is responsible for 2–5% of endometrial (EM) or colorectal (CRC) tumors. Additionally, epigenetic silencing of <italic>MLH1</italic> contributes to another 15–28% of these tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parsons et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peltomaki, 2014</xref>). Deficiency of the MMR machinery leads to DNA replication errors in the tumor tissue, but not the normal surrounding tissue. In particular, errors often accumulate as indel mutations in mono- and di-nucleotide repeats—a phenomenon referred to as microsatellite instability (MSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pinol et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>MMR-deficient tumors exhibit a different prognosis and therapeutic outcome after standard chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ng and Schrag, 2010</xref>). Untreated CRC patients with MMR-deficient tumors have a modestly better prognosis, but do not seem to benefit from 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy, which is the first-choice chemotherapy for CRC. In particular, in MMR-deficient tumors, mismatches induced by 5-fluorouracil are tolerated, leading to failure to induce cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fischer et al., 2007</xref>). MMR-deficient tumors are also resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin, which are frequently used chemotherapies in EM cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hewish et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, MMR-deficient tumors can be resistant to targeted therapies, because they acquire secondary mutations in genes that activate alternative or downstream signaling pathways (e.g., <italic>PIK3CA</italic>). Another possibility is that epigenetic silencing of <italic>MLH1</italic> coincides with particular mutations, such as the <italic>BRAF</italic> V600E mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donehower et al., 2013</xref>), which represents an established negative predictor of response to targeted anti-EGFR therapies in advanced CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richman et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Efforts to individualize the treatment of MMR-deficient tumors have focused on identifying synthetic lethal interactions within the MMR pathway. In particular, increased oxidative damage (by methotrexate exposure or <italic>PINK1</italic> silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2011</xref>]) and interference with the base excision repair (BER) pathway (by DNA polymerase γ or β inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin et al., 2010</xref>]) can sensitize MMR-deficient tumors. Until now, these findings failed, however, to translate into clinically effective treatment options. Alternatively, as highlighted above, secondary mutations occurring because of MMR-deficiency may also critically determine therapeutic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorard et al., 2011</xref>). These secondary mutation spectra have, however, been poorly characterized, mainly because studies often focused at one or a few reporter loci, or exclusively on mutations at known hotspot sequences. More recently, the first whole-exome sequencing of MMR-deficient tumors was performed, highlighting the clearly distinct mutational landscape of these tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">TCGA, 2012</xref>), whereas at the whole-genome level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al. (2013)</xref> revealed overrepresentation of MSI in euchromatic and intronic regions compared to heterochromatic and intergenic regions.</p><p>To generate a more comprehensive picture of the mutation spectra arising in MMR-deficient tumors, and in particular, to interpret their clinical relevance with respect to diagnostically assessing MSI and therapeutically targeting MMR-deficient tumors, we sequenced another comprehensive set of MMR-deficient tumors. In particular, whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing was applied to 5 and 28 tumor–normal pairs, of which respectively 3 and 22 were MMR-deficient.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Whole-genome sequencing of MMR-deficient tumors</title><p>To select MMR-deficient tumors for whole-genome sequencing, standard diagnostic tests were used, including immunohistochemistry of MMR proteins (MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6), assessment of MSI using the extended Bethesda panel and methylation profiling of the <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter. Three chemo-naive EM tumors, either deficient for MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 and thus covering the full spectrum of MMR-deficiency, as well as two MMR-proficient EM tumors were selected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Different sequencing technologies were leveraged to avoid potential technology biases in assessing mutation patterns in MMR-deficient tumor genomes, that is, Complete Genomics (CG) and Illumina short-read sequencing. We obtained high coverage sequencing data (30–120x) for tumor and matched normal samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Application of a standard annotation and filtering pipeline, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reumers et al., 2011</xref>), revealed that each MMR-deficient tumor exhibited a clear hypermutator phenotype, containing on average 50 times more novel somatic mutations than MMR-proficient tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Orthogonal technologies validated 98% of substitutions and 88% of indels in the three MMR-deficient tumors, while only 62% of substitutions and 11% of indels were validated in the two MMR-proficient tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). This difference in validation rates between MMR-deficient and MMR-proficient tumors is probably due to the fact that in normal genomes, as well as MMR-proficient tumor genomes, the number of true-positive indels is low in comparison to the number of false-positive indels. However, in MMR-deficient tumors, due to their specific hypermutator phenotype, the number of true-positive indels is vastly increased, thereby rendering the false positive fraction proportionally much smaller.

At the small-scale level, when assessing the effect of flanking nucleotides on substitution frequencies, the patterns of all four sets of germ-line genetic variants were highly correlated to MMR-deficient tumors (average <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.77), but less to the four other cancer genomes (average <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.45; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), providing further support for our hypothesis. On a large-scale context, the number of intergenic substitutions per 1 Mb in germ-line genetic variability databases was similarly highly correlated to those in MMR-deficient genomes (average <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.67), but not to those in other cancer genomes (average <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.42; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This suggests that also on a large scale, substitutions are comparably distributed in MMR-deficient tumor genomes as in germ-line genomes. At the large-scale level, nine genomic features are linked with genetic variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hodgkinson and Eyre-Walker, 2011</xref>). Each of these features correlated significantly with substitution frequencies in MMR-deficient tumors and germ-line genomes. Linear modeling revealed that six of these independently correlated with substitution rates in MMR-deficient tumors as well as with germ-line substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Overall, the types as well as the narrow and broad context-dependencies of substitutions thus appear to be largely shared between germ-line and MMR-deficient genomes, suggesting that a considerable fraction of human genetic diversity arises through mismatches escaping MMR.</p><p>Since MMR-proficient tumors carried 50 times fewer substitutions and displayed more disparate substitution patterns than MMR-proficient tumors, the observed correlations can almost exclusively be attributed to the MMR-deficient phenotype of these tumors. As such, these correlations also provide novel insights into the functioning of the MMR system. First, replication timing correlated with transitions but not transversions in all three MMR-deficient tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This contrasts with the increase in late S phase transversions observed in all other genomes studied here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), as well as in lymphoblastoid cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koren et al., 2012</xref>). The increase in MMR-proficient but not MMR-deficient cells suggests a reduced fidelity of DNA repair in late S phase, leading to an increase in transversions. Potential causes include a decreased MMR-activity in late S phase, or a longer window of time available for the repair of early vs late transversions in MMR-proficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hombauer et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, DNA repair fidelity in MMR-deficient cells is invariably low and therefore not affected by replication time. Secondly, a positive association with simple repeat content was noted. Indeed, a 1.6-fold increase in substitutions at bases immediately flanking simple repeats was noted, with a threefold increase next to homopolymers and a 1.3-fold increase next to microsatellites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These substitutions for the vast majority converted the base flanking the repeat, to the base constituting the repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). They are thus probably the result of polymerase slippage events, following a mechanism akin to the previously described bacterial dislocation mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kunkel and Soni, 1988</xref>). Thirdly, G:C&gt;A:T transitions in CpG sites strongly depend on CpG content, but are inversely correlated with the fraction of CpG islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Spontaneous, replication-independent deaminations of methyl-C to T underlie such transitions. Here, the much larger increase in CG&gt;TG transitions observed in MMR-deficient compared to MMR-proficient tumors (3449 vs 145) demonstrates that replication-independent MMR, recently described at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pena-Diaz et al., 2012</xref>), is also involved in deamination repair in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, overall substitution frequencies correlated inversely with CpG islands. Indeed, irrespective of dinucleotide context, bases outside CpG islands were nearly two times more likely to undergo mutation than those inside CpG islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). As CpG islands are generally unmethylated, DNA methylation thus appears to contribute to the mutagenic process. Explanations for this observation include the polymerase stalling that DNA methylation may induce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2012</xref>), and the repair of spontaneously deaminated methyl-Cs, which is error-prone and thus mutagenic on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Somatic indels in MMR-deficient hypermutators</title><p>We also evaluated somatic indel patterns in MMR-deficient tumors. As expected, since the majority of indels was located in homopolymers, a strong correlation between simple repeats and indel frequency was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Furthermore, 34 and 10 homopolymers were affected in ≥6 or ≥8 tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>). In contrast, only 55 substitutions were recurrent, three of which were found in ≥2 tumors (i.e., two substitutions affecting <italic>KRAS</italic> codon 12 and 13 were found in three and four tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tie et al., 2011</xref>], whereas a substitution in <italic>ZNF648</italic> affected three tumors). When comparing homopolymer content of coding regions vs UTRs, long homopolymers (&gt;10 bps) were more frequent in UTRs than in coding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Because these long homopolymers were also more frequently affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), the overall indel rate in coding regions was lower than in UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As a consequence of this difference, recurrent indels also occurred more frequently in UTRs than coding regions (31,438 vs 1337; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>). Remarkably, however, recurrent indels were more frequently observed than expected based on indel frequency in short, but not in long homopolymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). This suggests that features other than homopolymer length underlie indel recurrence rates. Positive clonal selection of indels affecting short homopolymers, which are predominant in coding regions, represents a possible explanation. Very similar results were obtained when the analysis was repeated only on the 13 whole-exomes, indicating that exonic mutations identified from whole-genome sequences did not introduce any bias.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Recurrent indels reliably detect MSI in various cancer types</title><p>The extended Bethesda panel, which consists of eight microsatellite and two homopolymer markers, is currently used to diagnostically assess MSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pinol et al., 2005</xref>). This panel was historically compiled from a limited set of markers known to be variable. Due to their length and variability, these markers are notoriously difficult to analyze and interpret. As a consequence, the Bethesda panel has reduced sensitivity to detect MSI. In an effort to improve MSI testing, we randomly selected 59 recurrent indels affecting ≥6 out of 16 tumors; 50 markers were in 5′ or 3′UTRs and 9 were in coding regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Furthermore, each of the markers was detected in both MMR-deficient EM and CRC. To facilitate high-throughput genotyping, the maximal length of affected homopolymers was restricted to 12 bps. First, we applied these 59 markers to a discovery set of 236 EM tumors for which MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) data were available. This allowed us to determine three positive markers as the threshold with the best Matthew correlation coefficient to detect MMR-deficiency based on IHC and thus to define MSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). At this threshold, our markers detected 40 out of 41 tumors MMR-deficient on IHC (sensitivity ∼98%), while only 1 out of 184 MMR-normal tumors on IHC were identified as MSI (specificity &gt; 99%). Notably, the latter patient had a familial history of cancer within the Lynch spectrum, suggesting that the tumor indeed exhibited MSI. Secondly, after having optimized the marker threshold, a head-to-head comparison against Bethesda panel was performed in 114 independent EM tumors as a validation. When observing discordances, we assessed MMR-deficiency using IHC to address which of both MSI panels was correct. Briefly, each MSI tumor on Bethesda (&gt;2 markers positive) was also MSI with the 59-marker panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, 12 tumors were positive in the 59-marker panel, but negative in Bethesda. IHC on the nine discordant tumors for which a paraffin block was available confirmed that each of them was MMR-deficient either for MLH1 or MSH2, indicating that the 59-marker panel has a higher sensitivity compared to Bethesda.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02725.028</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The 56-marker panel for MSI testing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Receiver–operator curve assessing the impact of the number of positive homopolymer markers (out of 59) on the sensitivity and specificity of MSI testing, based on a panel of 236 EM tumors immunohistochemically characterized for their MMR status.

For endometrial tumors, 71 tumors (62%) were defined as MSS/MSI-L and 43 tumors (38%) as MSI-H by the 59-marker panel. Out of these 43 MSI-H tumors, Bethesda identified 32 tumors as MSI-H (&gt;2 markers positive), 7 tumors as MSI-L, and 5 tumors as MSS. Vice versa, Bethesda did not identify any MSI-H tumor that was not identified by our panel. For colorectal tumors, there were 97 MSS tumors in our 59-marker panel that were concordantly called MSS or MSI-L by the Bethesda panel. The remaining 29 samples were detected as MSI in the 59-marker panel. 28 of these were also called MSI-H by the Bethesda panel, whereas one was called MSS by the Bethesda panel.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02725.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02725.028</ext-link></p><p><supplementary-material id="SD7-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02725.029</object-id><label>Figure 5—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Recurrent indels selected for the 59-marker MSI panel and the results of a logistic regression analysis to detect differences between MSI-H and MSI-L/MSS tumors.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02725.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02725.029</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-02725-fig5-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="SD8-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02725.030</object-id><label>Figure 5—source data 2.</label><caption><title>Clinical information, MMR-mutation status and sequencing statistics for ovarian tumors and leukemias.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02725.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02725.030</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-02725-fig5-data2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02725-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Likewise, we assessed MSI in 126 stage II or III CRC tumors.

On average, each MMR-deficient tumor contained 472 such indels, 59 of which were recurrent indels. Pathway analyses using IPA of all genes affected by a somatic indel, excluding the core MMR genes, ranked the ‘<italic>Role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response’</italic> as the top enriched pathway. IPA analysis of genes affected by recurrent indels moreover revealed that the ‘<italic>Double-strand break repair by homologous recombination</italic>’ pathway (<italic>DSBR by HR</italic>) ranked top (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We also performed pathway analyses using the more advanced GenomeMuSiC, which takes background mutation rates into account and assigns weights depending on the number of tumors and genes affected in a given pathway.

Having established that MMR-deficient tumors are enriched in heterozygous frameshift mutations in the <italic>DSBR by HR</italic> pathway, we investigated the functional impact of these events. First, we confirmed that indels affecting the <italic>DSBR by HR</italic> pathway were located in the major tumor subclone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Table 2—source data 1</xref>). Then, we analyzed HR in seven MMR-deficient and four MMR-proficient patient-derived primary tumor cultures. We exposed these cultures to the PARP inhibitor olaparib, which induces DSBs upon DNA replication through single-strand break repair inhibition, and to mitomycin C, which induces DSBs through DNA cross-links and replication fork collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bunting et al., 2012</xref>). We then quantified the relative number of cells with γH2AX- and RAD51-positive foci, respectively, as a measure of induced DSBs and ongoing HR. Exposure to olaparib or mitomycin C triggered an increase in γH2AX-foci in all tumor cultures, regardless of MMR status. In contrast, although RAD51 foci formation was evident in MMR-deficient and MMR-proficient cultures, the increase was far less pronounced in MMR-deficient cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), and this for both olaparib (p = 0.021) and mitomycin C (p = 0.006) exposure. The reduction in RAD51 foci could not be ascribed to differences in RAD51 protein expression or differences in cell cycle between MMR-deficient and -proficient cells, as these were similar between both sets of cultures, under both treated and untreated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s2 fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplements 1–3</xref>).

First, since PARP inhibitors are already used in clinical practice, all seven MMR-deficient and four MMR-proficient cultures were dose-dependently exposed to olaparib. This revealed that MMR-deficient cultures exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation upon exposure to olaparib, whereas MMR-proficient cultures were only affected at higher concentrations. Likewise, cell cytotoxicity assays revealed a dose-dependent sensitivity of MMR-deficient cells to olaparib that was more pronounced than in MMR-proficient cells (50% growth inhibition [GI50]) was reached at 26 µM vs 129 µM, respectively, p = 0.0064 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATR expression was dose-dependently reduced using siRNAs in the MMR- and HR-proficient cell line, MCF7. A growth inhibition of 50% was reached in MCF7 cells when applying 5.9 nM ATR, 0.88 nM BRCA1 or 0.41 nM BRCA2 siRNA, corresponding respectively to a reduction in expression of 69.5 ± 1.1%, 76.1 ± 4.4%, and 80.0 ± 2.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These data thus suggest that the loss of <italic>DSBR by HR</italic> activity in MMR-deficient tumors corresponds to a loss of about 75–80% BRCA1 or BRCA2 expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we surveyed whole-genomes of MMR-deficient tumors to provide a comprehensive picture of the mutations associated with human MMR-deficiency. With respect to somatic substitutions, we observed that the majority represented transitions and not transversions, and that adjacent nucleotides and various genomic features had an important context-dependent effect on determining which nucleotides were affected. Remarkably, the observed substitution pattern, in particular how it was impacted by small and large-scale contexts, was very similar to that in the germ-line at different time scales: for germ-line substitutions as they currently arise (de novo), as they have accumulated in the human population or as they served as a substrate for human-chimpanzee divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hodgkinson and Eyre-Walker, 2011</xref>). Our observations thus suggest that, similar to bacterial populations and other lower organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saint-Ruf and Matic, 2006</xref>), incomplete mismatch repair in humans contributes significantly to genetic variability and probably also to natural selection through genetic adaptation. Additionally, our data provide fundamental insights into the function of the MMR machinery. We observed, for instance, a higher number of substitutions in methylated CpG sequences, implicating MMR in the repair of methylated cytosine deamination and demonstrating that MMR disconnected from the replication fork is also critical to maintain genomic integrity.</p><p>At the whole-genome level, ∼80% of somatic mutations represented indels. Although indel detection using high-throughput sequencing is burdened with high false-positive rates, 88.0% of the indels identified here validated favorably using orthogonal technologies. When focusing on the clinical relevance of indel mutation patterns to diagnose MSI, we observed that indels specifically affected homopolymer stretches, which is relevant as the extended Bethesda panel consists of eight microsatellite and only two homopolymer markers and possibly therefore has only limited sensitivity relative to IHC (∼75% for both EM and CRC tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hampel et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2008</xref>]). Our 59-marker panel consisting only of markers in homopolymers was clearly more sensitive than Bethesda, yielding sensitivity rates of 87% relative to IHC. This was not due to the fact that we genotyped more markers than Bethesda, as restricting our panel to 10 markers still resulted in a sensitivity rate of 85% (data not shown). Furthermore, since our panel was based on recurrent mutations present in both CRC and EM, and since 50 out of 59 markers were located in UTRs, which are less likely to drive clonal selection and thus to represent tissue-specific events, it could be used to detect MSI in cancers affecting various tissues. Finally, since all markers were located in homopolymers ≤12 bps in length, they are, in contrast to the 25 or 26 bps markers from Bethesda, compatible with various low- to high-throughput genotyping technologies, thereby greatly facilitating their clinical adoption. For instance, we were able to multiplex all 59 markers in just five PCR amplification reactions compatible with Sequenom MassArray genotyping.</p><p>Pathway analyses on all genes affected by exonic indels further revealed that the <italic>DSBR by HR</italic> pathway was enriched for somatic indels. Although mutations in genes involved in this pathway, such as <italic>MRE11A</italic> or <italic>RAD50</italic>, have previously been reported in MMR-deficient tumors, these studies focused on specific mutations in individual genes rather than on pathways, and for this reason could establish that only a fraction of MMR-deficient tumors was affected by mutations in these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miquel et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, our study identified that every MMR-deficient tumors was affected by on average 3.3 somatic indels in the <italic>DSBR by HR</italic> pathway. Furthermore, although it is well established that cells deficient in BRCA1, BRCA2, Fanconi anemia, or other HR-related genes are hypersensitive to DSB inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murai et al., 2012</xref>), as for instance, synthetic lethality in BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient tumors through PARP inhibition is already approved as therapy in breast and ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Metzger-Filho et al., 2012</xref>), data demonstrating sensitivity of MMR-deficient cells to DSB inducers have not been conclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vilar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, although there are some reports highlighting the sensitivity of MSH3-deficient cell lines to DSB inducers, this appeared to occur through a non-canonical MMR pathway, as MLH1 was not involved in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the only clinical study set-up so far to explore efficacy of PARP inhibitors as a single-agent therapy in previously treated patients with metastatic CRC stratified by MSI status, was unfortunately delayed due to patient accrual issues.</p><p>Our hypothesis-free discovery that <italic>DSBR by HR</italic> is the top pathway affected by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in MMR-deficient tumors, both in our own data set and TCGA, also suggests that mutations in <italic>DSBR by HR</italic> genes converge in an oligogenic model, wherein the number of indels dose-dependently decreases <italic>DSBR by HR</italic> activity, thereby rendering them gradually more sensitive to DSB inducers. As a result of this double-hit, our ex vivo culture experiments are, however, difficult to compare to experiments relying on genotype-matched cells that have a single hit in the MMR or HR pathway. In addition, since <italic>MMR</italic> and <italic>DSB by HR</italic> pathway activities are not characterized in a clinical setting, it is difficult to relate our data to clinical studies assessing the outcome of therapeutics such as cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil, which have potential opposing activities on MMR- and HR-deficient tumors.</p><p>Clinical studies are therefore needed to assess whether DSB inducers, such as PARP inhibitors, are indeed also effective in MSI tumors. In particular, since on average 3.3 heterozygous loss-of-function mutations only partially inactivate the DSB repair by HR pathway (∼80% inactivation), it remains to be seen whether, compared to BRCA1 or BRCA2-deficient tumors, in which the HR pathway is completely inactivated, clinically relevant benefits are also achievable in MSI tumors. Possibly, only those MMR-deficient tumors containing large numbers of indels (≥5) in the <italic>DSBR by HR</italic> pathway will show a significant response. Nevertheless, there is a great clinical need for novel treatment options in MSI tumors. Indeed, although stage II or III CRC tumors with MSI are characterized by a modestly improved prognosis, MSI tumors in the advanced setting are generally associated with a more peritoneal metastasis and a worse overall survival independent of the chemotherapy regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). Our observations thus clearly warrant novel clinical studies assessing the therapeutic efficacy of DSB inducers in MMR-deficient tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Standard diagnostic tests for MMR-deficiency</title><p>To assess MLH1-, MSH2-, and MSH6-deficiency immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against MLH1 (clone ES05; DAKO, Heverlee, Belgium), MSH2 (clone G219-1129; BD Pharmagen, Erembodegem, Belgium), and MSH6 (clone EP49; Epitomics, Burlingame, USA) were applied.

To assess negative selection in the exome, we checked whether (i) there was a lower mutation frequency in the exome relative to the whole-genome, and whether (ii) the frequency of somatic mutations was more prominently decreased in the exome. As homopolymers in exomes have characteristics that differ from those in the rest of the genome in terms of number, base composition and length, we corrected indel frequencies for these confounding factors.

Analysis, annotation, and validation were performed similarly as for whole-genome sequencing. On average, the coverage was 44.5× and 95.1% of bases were called in the captured regions, yielding 51,782 substitutions and 30,290 indels per sample.

Random selection and validation of 24 indels occurring in 6 or more samples revealed a validation rate of 100%. Given the high validation rate for somatic indels per se, and the even higher rate for recurrent indels, we considered all recurrent indels as true-positives. Subsequent analyses were limited to indels recurrently affecting homopolymer regions, that is, 29,663 Illumina TruSeq-captured exonic homopolymers. Details of recurrent mutations in these homopolymers are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>.

IHC analyses of these tumors were independently performed at the Molecular Cancer Epidemiology Laboratory in Brisbane, Australia as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). 11 out of 236 tumors were excluded for the 59-marker panel due to their low tumor percentage (≤10%). By varying the marker threshold, we calculated the number of true-positives and false-positives identified by our MSI panel relative to the IHC data. A ROC curve was constructed based on these values. The Matthew Correlation Coefficient of the ROC curve was calculated for each threshold. Tumors were considered MSI when they had three markers positive. We did not distinguish between MSI-low and microsatellite stable (MSS), as this is currently not clinically relevant. All tumors with less than three positive markers were thus considered MSS/MSI-L. For the Bethesda panel, we defined three categories as follows: microsatellite stable (MSS, 0 out of 10 markers), low microsatellite instability (MSI-L, 1–2 out of 10 markers), and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H, 3 or more out of 10 markers). Two sets of data (114 EM tumors and 97 CRC tumors) were used for the comparison.

We first selected all genes with somatic exonic indels, and then extended our mutation calling to indels occurring 25 bp up or down-stream of each exon. Mutation calling and filtering for the later set of mutations was done as described above. In total, 1989 additional indels in exon/intron boundaries were detected. These were combined with the previously described indels in exonic regions, which—after the removal of indels in MMR genes—yielded 7546 indels in 4116 genes. As a validation, we selected 27 CRC and 65 EM tumors with MSI sequenced by The Cancer Genome Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">TCGA, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kandoth et al., 2013</xref>).

Indeed, different sequencing platforms are each characterized by their specific false-positive and false-negative variant detection rates. For example, 10.5% of indels was false-positive in Complete Genomics (CG) datasets, whereas 27.7% of indels was missed (false-negatives), as discussed by Zook et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiricny, 2006</xref>). For Illumina genomes, 6.9% of indels were false-positive and 0.5% of indels were false-negative.</p><p>First, to address the issue of false-positives (type 1 error), we expanded the number of randomly selected indels from the CG-sequenced MMR-deficient tumor (MMR-1) and Illumina-sequenced MMR-deficient tumor (MMR-2), respectively. We chose an orthogonal validation technology, i.e., Sequenom MassARRAY, to validate a total number of 391 indels. The overall validation rate that we obtained for indels was 90.3% in CG genomes and 85.9% in Illumina -sequenced genomes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref> below and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). These validation rates are thus very similar between both platforms. The validation rates are also much higher than those that we observed for indels in MMR-proficient tumors and those the reviewer is correctly referring to in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parsons et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peltomaki, 2014</xref>). The low validation rates for indels in the MMR-proficient whole-genome tumors most probably reflect the fact that in germ-line genomes, as well as MMR -proficient tumor genomes, the number of true-positive indels is low in comparison to the number of false-positive indels that are detected. However, in MMR-deficient tumors, due to their specific hypermutator phenotype, the number of true-positive indels is vastly increased, thereby rendering the false positive fraction proportionally much smaller. In the revised manuscript, we have therefore highlighted the possibility of having false-positive and false-negative findings in the whole-genomes and indicate that this may affect observed indel rates. We also discuss that validation rates in MMR-deficient tumors are much higher than in the MMR-proficient tumors and explain the reasons for this. As highlighted by the reviewer, sequence reads containing both indels and substitutions (i.e., reads with a relatively high percentage of mismatches) are more prone to mismapping than sequence reads containing only substitutions or indels. We acknowledge this issue, and have in response deleted the paragraph describing that somatic indels and substitutions are often located close to each other in the 3 MMR-deficient tumors that were whole-genome sequenced. Indeed, such observations are prone to contamination by false-positives.</p><p><table-wrap id="tbl3" position="anchor"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Validation rate of somatic indels detected upon whole-genome sequencing.

In particular, we repeated all analyses with only the 13 genomes subjected to Illumina exome-sequencing. We observed that in coding regions, 1.4% of homopolymers were affected at least once (i.e. in 2073 homopolymers out of a total of 29,663), whereas 414 were affected at least twice. Furthermore, 47 homopolymers were affected in ≥5 samples. In 3’UTR and 5’UTRs, 2296 and 105 homopolymers were affected in ≥5 samples respectively. When randomly selecting recurrent indels to design a panel of recurrent markers capable of assessing MSI, 54 out of the 59 originally selected markers were still selected, as they affected ≥5 out of 13 tumors (compared to 59 recurrent indels affecting ≥6 out of 16 tumors). Of these 54 markers, 45 markers were in UTRs and 9 were in coding regions. Applying the 54-marker panel on the same discovery set of 236 EM tumors as described in the original manuscript, we also found 3 positive markers as the threshold with the best Matthew Correlation Coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1A and 1B</xref>).</p><p>When comparing our 54 markers against the Bethesda panel, we equally found that the 54-maker panel had a higher sensitivity compared to Bethesda. Specifically, we applied the 54 -marker panel to a set of 114 endometrial tumors and a set of 126 colorectal tumors as described in the original manuscript. For the EM tumors, 73 tumors (64%) were defined as MSS/MSI-L and 41 tumors (36%) as MSI-H. Out of these 41 MSI-H tumors, Bethesda identified 29 tumors as MSI-H (&gt;2 markers positive), 7 tumors as MSI-L and 5 tumors as MSS. Vice versa, Bethesda did not identify any MSI-H tumor that was not identified by our novel MSI panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1C</xref>). IHC on 9 out of 12 discordant samples confirmed that each of these samples was deficient either for MLH1 or MSH2, and thus MMR-deficient. No tumor slides were available for the remaining 3 samples. The 9 discordant samples, we had access to, were confirmed as true positives by IHC. For CRC tumors, there were 97 MSS tumors in our 54-marker panel that were concordantly called MSS or MSI-L by the Bethesda panel. The remaining 29 samples were detected as MSI in the 54-marker panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1D</xref>). 28 of these were also called MSI-H by the Bethesda panel, whereas one was called MSS by the Bethesda panel. It had a <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation and was <italic>MLH1</italic> hypermethylated, thereby confirming MMR-deficiency and correct classification by the 54-marker panel.</p><p>Finally, we also repeated our pathway analyses on the genes affected by indels in the 13 exomes, rather than on the whole set of 16 exomes, 3 of which were generated by whole-genome sequencing. Pathway analyses on the 3856 genes affected by a somatic indel using IPA<sup>®</sup> revealed that the “<italic>Role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response</italic>” was the top enriched pathway (<italic>P</italic>=4.2E-04). IPA<sup>®</sup> analysis of 1302 genes affected by recurrent indels revealed that the <italic>“DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by Homologous Recombination (HR)”</italic> was the top enriched pathways (<italic>P</italic>=4.7E-03). Pathway analyses of 6736 indels in MMR-deficient tumors using GenomeMuSiC revealed that the “<italic>ATR/BRCA pathway</italic>”, “<italic>Homologous recombination repair</italic>” and “<italic>DNA repair</italic>” pathways were ranked highest in BioCarta, DNARepairDB and Reactome databases respectively (<italic>P</italic>=4.9E-13, <italic>P</italic>=1.8E-03and<italic>P</italic>=5.7E-08, respectively). Overall, these results are nearly identical to the data generated on the 16 exomes, as presented in the original manuscript.</p><p>In conclusion, since our data were not significantly affected or did not change any of our conclusions, depending on whether we analyzed 13 or 16 genomes, we chose to present the data of the 16 exomes as the main analysis. However, in the revised manuscript, we have now added a sentence highlighting that data and conclusions did not change when the analysis was limited to the 13 exomes generated by Illumina exome-sequencing only. Furthermore, since the response to this comment will be published in parallel to the manuscript, a critical reader will be able to assess in full detail that data did not change after removing the 3 whole-genomes from the analysis.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>The 54-marker panel generated from 13 Illumina-sequenced exomes for MSI testing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02725-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) The sample set is heterogeneous in terms of cancer of origin and derivation from primary cancers and cultures that are likely to have been subjected to considerable</italic> in vitro <italic>selection pressure and/or founder effects</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is important to consider the heterogeneity of the tumors in terms of cancer of origin or derivation procedure. We have therefore performed a clustering analysis of all MMR-deficient tumors that we sequenced for the genes affected by either a somatic substitution or indel in the coding region. As can be appreciated from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref> below, no obvious subgroup in terms of cancer of origin was observed. In the revised manuscript, this figure has also been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>Clustering analysis of all samples based on the genes carrying somatic mutations in their coding regions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02725-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>The figure also shows that there is no distinct difference between primary tumors and data generated on the primary cell cultures. As mentioned in the revised manuscript, we specifically chose to use primary tumor cultures of low passage rather than tumor cell lines, because the latter have been subject to much more selective pressure as primary tumor cultures of low passage. In addition to the above cluster analysis, we also performed pathway analysis on the 10 primary tumor tissues only. Pathway analyses of all genes affected by a somatic indel using IPA<sup>®</sup> revealed that the “<italic>Role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response</italic>” and “<italic>DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by Homologous Recombination (HR)</italic>” were the top enriched pathways (<italic>P</italic>=6.5E-03 and <italic>P</italic>=1.1E −02, respectively). IPA<sup>®</sup> analysis of genes affected by recurrent indels revealed that the “<italic>Role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response</italic>” was also enriched (p = 2.0E-03). Pathway analyses of all indels in MMR-deficient tumors using GenomeMuSiC revealed that the “<italic>ATR/BRCA pathway</italic>”, “<italic>Homologous recombination repair</italic>” and “<italic>DNA repair</italic>” pathways were ranked highest in BioCarta, DNARepairDB and Reactome databases respectively (<italic>P</italic>=1.0E -09, <italic>P</italic>=0.4E-02and <italic>P=</italic>3.4E-06, respectively). The results derived only from the primary tumors suggest that MMR-deficient tumors are indeed enriched in indels affecting the DSB repair pathway. Data are thus highly concordant with the results shown in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) The similarity between germline and somatic mutation spectra might, in part be caused by many somatic mutations occurring in normal progenitors prior to loss of MMR. Is there a way of investigating this in comparison with non-MMR tumors (e.g</italic>. <italic>examining effects of age)?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful hypothesis. However, we found no correlation between age at diagnosis and the number of mutations detectable (<italic>P</italic>=0.86). Moreover, although the age at diagnosis of patients with MMR-proficient and MMR-deficient tumors was very comparable (67 and 62 years respectively), MMR-deficient tumors carried &gt;55 times more mutations than MMR-proficient tumors. When compared to MMR- deficient tumors, MMR-proficient somatic mutations thus comprise at most only 2% of all mutations in MMR-deficient tumors, a fraction that is unlikely to contribute significantly to the similarity in patterns between MMR -deficient and germline mutation patterns.</p><p>Finally, as described in the original manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> in the original manuscript), no extensive similarity was noted between MMR-proficient and germline mutation patterns. Consequently, even if somatic mutations (as reflected in MMR-proficient mutations) would contribute significantly to MMR-deficient mutation patterns, they would not display extensive similarity to germline variation patterns and could therefore not be responsible for the patterns observed in MMR - deficient tumors. In the revised manuscript, we have indicated this.</p><p><italic>4) The 59-marker exomic MSI panel is useful, especially for Lynch syndrome, and appears to perform well</italic>.</p><p>We are happy to read that the reviewers appreciate our work.</p><p><italic>5) The pathway analysis presumably incorporated all detected variants.

Moreover, the burden of mutations in these pathways might relate to redundant function – noting that MSI + cancers are usually near-diploid - rather than positive selection</italic>. <italic>This may or may not matter for therapeutic purposes, but can it be checked in some way?</italic></p><p>We apologize for not more clearly explaining our pathway analyses in the original manuscript. We described two types of pathway analyses: the first involved somatic frameshift indels in exons, the second involved somatic indels both in exons and exon/intron boundaries. We thus already restricted the presented pathway analyses to variants with strong evidence of functionality. Indeed, in the first analysis each of the selected somatic indels in exons already represented an out-of-frame mutation, thus conferring a heterozygous loss-of function mutation on the gene affected in the tumor.</p><p>In an effort to further enrich for mutations with a functional effect in the tumor, we additionally restricted our pathway analyses to genes expressed in endometrial or colorectal normal tissue. RNA-sequencing data generated on normal endometrium and colon tissue were downloaded from TCGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pinol et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ng et al., 2010</xref>). For both EM and CRC datasets, we calculated the mean normalized read count for each gene in 12 normal endometrial samples and 40 normal colorectal samples respectively. Transcripts with over 10 reads per kb and per million reads were considered expressed. This resulted in 12,851 and 12,293 genes that were expressed in endometrial and colorectal tissues respectively. We then limited the pathway analyses to indels affecting genes expressed either in normal endometrium or in normal colon tissue. Pathway analysis using IPA<sup>®</sup> of 2,126 expressed genes affected by a somatic indel ranked the “<italic>Role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response</italic>” as the top enriched pathway. IPA<sup>®</sup> analysis of 851 expressed genes affected by recurrent indels revealed that the “<italic>Double-strand break repair by homologous recombination</italic>” pathway ranked top. GenomeMuSiC ranked “<italic>ATR/BRCA pathway</italic>”, “<italic>DNA repair</italic>” and “<italic>Homologous recombination</italic>” pathways as the top pathways for BioCarta, Reactome and DNARepair DB respectively. By restricting ourselves to frameshift indels affecting genes that are expressed in endometrial tissue, similar results were thus obtained.</p><p>In order not to burden the reader with too many pathway analyses, we have chosen not to present these data in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, since the response to this comment will be published online, critical readers will be able to appreciate in detail that the outcome was not altered by removing genes that are affected by indels but not expressed in the normal corresponding tissue.</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>1.
