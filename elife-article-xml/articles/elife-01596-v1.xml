How the activity of these motors is regulated during cargo sorting is poorly understood. In this study, we address this issue using a novel in vitro assay for the motility of localising <italic>Drosophila</italic> mRNAs bound to native dynein-dynactin complexes. High precision tracking reveals that individual RNPs within a population undergo either diffusive, or highly processive, minus end-directed movements along microtubules. RNA localisation signals stimulate the processive movements, with regulation of dynein-dynactin’s activity rather than its total copy number per RNP, responsible for this effect. Our data support a novel mechanism for multi-motor translocation based on the regulation of dynein processivity by discrete cargo-associated features. Studying the in vitro responses of RNPs to microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and microtubule ends provides insights into how an RNA population could navigate the cytoskeletal network and become anchored at its destination in cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01596.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01596.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01596.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For a cell to do its job, the different components inside it need to be moved to different locations. This is achieved by an elaborate cellular transport system. To move a component to where it needs to be, motor proteins bind to it, often with the assistance of other ‘accessory’ proteins. This cargo-motor complex then moves along a network of tracks within the cell. Viruses also exploit this transport system in order to be trafficked to specific parts of the cell during their life cycles.</p><p>Many cargos are moved along microtubule tracks. Multiple microtubule motor proteins often attach to the same cargo, but it is unclear how they work together during transport. Previous studies have attempted to address this issue by attaching motor proteins to artificial cargoes, such as synthetic beads. However, these experiments did not include some of the accessory proteins that are thought to play a role during transport within the living cell.</p><p>Soundararajan and Bullock have now examined how complexes containing multiple motors bound to accessory proteins move molecules of messenger RNA to specific sites within cells. By visualising fruit fly mRNA moving along microtubules attached to a glass surface, the transport process can be studied in detail. It appears that the complexes travel using one of two methods: they either diffuse along the microtubules, which they can do in either direction, or they power themselves along the microtubules, which they can only do in one direction. Although previous experiments with artificial cargos suggested that the number of motors in the complex determines the likelihood of one-way traffic, it appears that one or more accessory proteins are actually in control during mRNA transport.</p><p>Soundararajan and Bullock also documented how the mRNA-motor complexes react to roadblocks and dead-ends on the microtubule highway. Rather than letting go of the microtubule upon such an encounter, the complexes can reverse back down the track. This behaviour may help them to find a new route to their destination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01596.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01596.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>molecular motor</kwd><kwd>mRNA localisation</kwd><kwd>in vitro transport</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U105178790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soundararajan</surname><given-names>Harish Chandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Bullock</surname><given-names>Simon L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001255</institution-id><institution>Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bullock</surname><given-names>Simon L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vitro reconstitution of mRNA motility reveals the basis of directionally biased motion by groups of motors, their response to potential obstacles, and the consequences of reaching microtubule ends.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubule-based motility plays a major role in the distribution and sorting of organelles, vesicles, and macromolecules within cells. The significance of this process is underscored by the association of mutations in microtubule motor proteins and their co-factors with several neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirokawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schiavo et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, many pathogens exploit cellular microtubule motors during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grieshaber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greber and Way, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramsden et al., 2007</xref>). Despite the fundamental importance of the process, the mechanisms by which cargos are trafficked along microtubules are poorly understood.</p><p>There is substantial evidence that individual cargos simultaneously associate with multiple microtubule motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 2007</xref>). Not only can a single cargo associate with several copies of the same kind of motor (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leopold et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Welte et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hendricks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Encalada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rai et al., 2013</xref>), but opposite polarity motors are often stably bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pilling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shubeita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soppina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hendricks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Encalada et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, in order to understand cargo trafficking in vivo it is essential to learn how the activity of multiple motors is orchestrated.</p><p>The mechanisms governing translocation of cargos by teams of microtubule motors have predominantly been tackled in two ways. One set of studies has analysed motility of cargo populations within cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kural et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shubeita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rai et al., 2013</xref>). Although physiologically relevant, the mechanistic insights that can be derived from this approach are limited by the complex in vivo environment. The second set of studies have analysed the in vitro behaviours of artificial cargos, such as beads or DNA origami, coupled to isolated motor proteins or motor domains (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vale et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Block et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mallik et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diehl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ross et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vershinin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furuta et al., 2013</xref>). These in vitro studies have provided evidence that small increases in the number of purified motors of the same polarity strongly augment the average travel distance in that direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Block et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mallik et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vershinin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furuta et al., 2013</xref>). However, these experiments did not include potential regulatory co-factors that associate with motors in vivo. Thus, substantial debate persists over whether net movement of physiological cargo-motor complexes is dominated by motor copy number or by higher order mechanisms that regulate motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kural et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shubeita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elting and Spudich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reis et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Another important unresolved issue is how, when navigating to their destination in vivo, cargo-motor complexes cope with other proteins that decorate microtubules. In vitro experiments have shown that the plus end-directed kinesin-1 motor frequently detaches when encountering microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vershinin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Telley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McVicker et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, upon such an obstacle encounter, individual bidirectional dynein-dynactins often remain attached to a microtubule and undergo a reversal in travel direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>). It remains to be tested in a defined system how intact transport complexes, containing cargo, multiple motors, and potential regulatory proteins, react to obstacles on their tracks. It is also not known how these complexes respond when they reach the ends of the microtubules.</p><p>Each of these problems is exemplified by the trafficking of developmentally important mRNAs in the syncytial <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. Cytoplasmic injection of in vitro synthesised fluorescent transcripts has shed light on the mechanisms governing RNA sorting in this system. These experiments have provided evidence that apical mRNA localisation is achieved by a bidirectional translocation process in which, on average, minus end-directed transport by the multi-subunit dynein motor and its large accessory complex dynactin predominates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wilkie and Davis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vendra et al., 2007</xref>). Upon reaching the apical cytoplasm, the ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) are statically anchored by an unknown, dynein-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delanoue and Davis, 2005</xref>). mRNAs that are uniformly distributed also move bidirectionally, but with little net directional bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amrute-Nayak and Bullock, 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, dynein-dynactin is required for both plus end- and minus end-directed motion of the localising and uniformly distributed RNPs formed upon injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vendra et al., 2007</xref>)<bold>.</bold> Dynein is also needed for efficient spreading of uniformly distributed endogenous RNAs from the perinuclear region, supporting a physiological requirement for the motor complex in bidirectional RNA motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>). These findings, together with the failure to detect functional evidence for the involvement of a kinesin motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vendra et al., 2007</xref>), suggest that plus end movements of RNPs are driven by dynein moving in this direction, a property that has been documented in several in vitro studies of the motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schliwa et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang and Sheetz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mallik et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ross et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walter et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Net minus end transport of apical transcripts is dependent on RNA localisation signals, which are comprised of specialised stem-loops that recruit additional dynein-dynactin complexes to RNPs through the Egalitarian (Egl) and Bicaudal-D (BicD) adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amrute-Nayak and Bullock, 2012</xref>). Egl binds directly to the localisation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>) and the light chain subunit of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Navarro et al., 2004</xref>), whereas BicD interacts simultaneously with Egl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Navarro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>) and multiple sites in the dynein-dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>). Egl and BicD do not appear to contribute to the binding of the dynein-dynactin complex to RNA at sites other than localisation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dix et al., 2013</xref>), and the RNA features and protein factors that fulfil this task have not been identified.</p><p>Recent proteomic work by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dix et al., 2013</xref>) has shown that Lissencephaly-1 (Lis1) is also a component of dynein-dynactin complexes associated with localising and uniformly distributed RNAs. Lis1 promotes the recruitment of dynein-dynactin to RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dix et al., 2013</xref>) and may also regulate mechanochemistry of the cargo-associated motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vallee et al., 2012</xref>). The study of Dix et al. supported the existence of a core functional complex recruited to localisation signals, consisting of Egl, BicD, dynein-dynactin, and Lis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dix et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is not known whether the dynein-dynactin recruited in this manner is more likely to engage in minus end-directed motion than that recruited elsewhere in the RNA. Alternatively, the localisation signals could drive net minus end motion simply by recruiting more copies of functionally equivalent dynein-dynactin complexes per RNP.</p><p>In order to begin to address these mechanistic issues, we have developed a novel in vitro RNA motility assay that combines the manipulability of a cell-free system with the physiological relevance of cargo-motor complexes assembled from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo extract.

A run was operationally defined as a bout of uninterrupted motion in one direction before a reversal, pause, detachment from the microtubule or curtailment by the end of image acquisition. The mean length and velocity of individual runs of unidirectional <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNPs were ∼4 μm and ∼1.2 μm.s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). The mean velocity of individual runs of bidirectional <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNPs in both directions (∼0.8 μm.s<sup>−1</sup>) was similar to that of the unidirectional counterparts, whereas the mean run lengths were much shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>).

These run lengths are much shorter than those previously documented for force-generating dynein and kinesin motors bound to other bidirectional cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shubeita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soppina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schuster et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rai et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the mean run length and velocities of individual bidirectional <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNPs revealed a great deal of variation for each of these values per RNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>). This presumably reflects compositional heterogeneity, a feature that has been observed in populations of cargo-motor complexes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Encalada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schuster et al., 2011</xref>). Despite their variation across the population, the quantitative parameters of motion were highly correlated to each other for individual RNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>). The mean minus end and plus end run lengths were very similar for any given RNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Individual RNPs also exhibited mean velocities that were highly similar in both the minus end and plus end direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Mean run lengths and run velocities for individual RNPs were also highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Thus, complexes that move faster on average tended to move further before a run ends. Overall, our correlation analysis reveals a high degree of coupling between motile properties in each direction for individual RNPs.</p><p>We next studied the effects of alternate nucleotide states on the motility of RNPs. Depletion of ATP and ADP with apyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Higuchi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma and Taylor, 1997</xref>) led to a significant increase in the number of microtubule-associated RNPs compared to the ATP condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In the presence of apyrase there was also a large increase in the proportion of microtubule-bound RNPs that were stationary, with unidirectional behaviour absent and a strong reduction in the proportion of bidirectional complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The affect of apyrase on unidirectional motion is entirely expected as processive movement of dynein is dependent on ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). The inhibition of bidirectional motion by apyrase could conceivably be explained by dynein normally stepping towards both the minus and plus end of microtubules through ATP hydrolysis—as has been documented in two previous studies of purified motor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ross et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walter et al., 2012</xref>)—with frequent reversals between bouts of motion in each direction. Alternatively, RNPs could undergo passive diffusion along microtubules in the presence of ATP, with the presence of the motor on RNPs stimulating long-term arrest in the absence of ATP due to its tight microtubule binding in the no nucleotide state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). Both these scenarios, or a combination of the two, could account for the relatively short mean run lengths, diffusive MSD properties, and the tight coupling of minus and plus end motile properties for individual bidirectional RNPs in the presence of ATP.</p><p>To discriminate between these possibilities we performed motility assays in the presence of both ATP and vanadate. Vanadate inhibits the ATPase activity of dynein and mimics the ADP·Pi state, which is associated with weak affinity for microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shimizu and Johnson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miura et al., 2010</xref>). There was a partial reduction in the number of RNPs bound to microtubules in the presence of vanadate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). As expected, vanadate abolished unidirectional motion of the microtubule-associated RNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Tellingly, the percentage of microtubule-associated RNPs that underwent bidirectional motion was not decreased in the presence of ATP-vanadate compared to ATP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In fact, in the presence of vanadate there was an increase in the proportion of microtubule-associated RNPs that were bidirectional, possibly due to a contribution of RNPs that would otherwise be unidirectional undergoing switching to a bidirectional state.</p><p>The relationship of MSD vs time was very similar for the bidirectional RNPs in the presence of ATP-vanadate and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Similar distributions of lengths and velocities or individual runs in both the minus and plus end direction were also observed for bidirectional RNPs in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Thus, even the occurrence of relatively long runs of <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNPs was not prevented by vanadate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Vanadate actually caused a subtle but statistically significant increase in the mean run length and velocity of bidirectional RNPs in the minus and plus end directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>), implying a modulation of the diffusive properties of RNPs when dynein is in the ADP.Pi state. Overall, our results demonstrate that an active energy transduction property of dynein is required for unidirectional, minus end-directed RNP motion but not for motion of bidirectional RNPs in either the minus or plus end direction. Thus, individual <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup> RNPs can adopt two discrete behaviours in vitro: unidirectional motion, driven by processive movement of dynein that is associated with ATP hydrolysis and bidirectional motion that appears to be dominated by passive diffusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Increasing dynein-dynactin numbers through RNA localisation signals promotes unidirectional, minus end-directed transport</title><p>As described in the introduction, there is substantial debate on the influence of total motor copy number on the translocation of cargos.

Thus, by using fluorescent immunoblotting to determine the proportion of total Dlic in the extract that was labelled with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we could approximate the mean number of Dlic copies on each of the <italic>h</italic> RNA variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The estimated means ± SEM of Dlic copies for <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup>, <italic>h</italic><sup>ΔLE</sup>, and <italic>h</italic><sup>SL1x3</sup> RNPs were, respectively, 6.73 ± 0.44, 4.36 ± 0.33, and 13.85 ± 0.67. It has been reported that there are two Dlic molecules per dynein motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">King et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trokter et al., 2012</xref>) and hence our estimates of Dlic copy number on <italic>h</italic> RNA variants are consistent with 3.36 ± 0.21, 2.18 ± 0.16, and 6.92 ± 0.33 dynein motors associated with <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup>, <italic>h</italic><sup>ΔLE</sup>, or <italic>h</italic><sup>SL1x3</sup> RNPs, respectively. We wish to stress that these values are only estimates of the average dynein copy number on each RNA due to limitations of the photobleaching technique in determining precise copy number of fluorescent molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shu et al., 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, our analysis clearly reveals that manipulating SL1 copy number in the different <italic>h</italic> RNA variants causes significant changes, in relative terms, in the average copy number of dynein and dynactin complexes per RNP.</p><p>We next analysed the motile behaviour of the different <italic>h</italic> RNA variants in the RAT-TRAP assay in the presence of ATP. The population of <italic>h</italic><sup>SL1x3</sup> RNPs had a significantly greater minus end-directed bias than the <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This was associated with a doubling in the proportion of motile <italic>h</italic><sup>SL1x3</sup> RNPs undergoing exclusively unidirectional movement towards the minus end of microtubules compared to <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), without substantially altering the mean run lengths and velocities of these events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Reducing the copy number of dynein-dynactin per RNP by using the <italic>h</italic><sup>ΔLE</sup> RNA resulted in exclusively bidirectional motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) with no significant net directional bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, there was a correlation between the probability of unidirectional minus end-directed motion of RNPs and the average number of associated dynein-dynactin complexes.</p><p>The distribution of run lengths and velocities of the bidirectional RNPs in the minus and plus end directions were similar for <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup>, <italic>h</italic><sup>SL1x3</sup>, and <italic>h</italic><sup>ΔLE</sup> RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>).

These data suggest that increasing dynein-dynactin copy number through localisation signals does not have a major influence on the motile properties of bidirectional RNPs. However, the correlation between increased dynein-dynactin number and increased lengths and velocities of runs in both the minus and plus end direction is consistent with this complex playing a direct role in mediating bidirectional movement of RNPs along microtubules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The <italic>HLE</italic> alone promotes unidirectional motion</title><p>The experiments described above with the <italic>h</italic><sup>ΔLE</sup>, <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup>, and <italic>h</italic><sup>SL1x3</sup> RNAs show that the major mechanism through which increasing the number of RNA localisation signals promotes net minus end-directed motion is by increasing the probability of long, unidirectional transport in this direction. Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amrute-Nayak and Bullock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dix et al., 2013</xref>), we find that RNAs lacking localisation signals still recruit dynein-dynactin but move exclusively bidirectionally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref>). Thus, localisation signals may promote unidirectional motion simply by increasing the average copy number of dynein-dynactin complexes bound per RNP. Such a model is consistent with previous work showing that individual purified dynein-dynactin complexes move bidirectionally in vitro, with additional dynein-dynactin complexes bound to a bead driving unidirectional motion in the minus end direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ross et al., 2006</xref>). Alternatively, dynein-dynactins recruited to localisation signals may be more likely to undergo unidirectional motion than those bound elsewhere in the RNA.</p><p>To discriminate between these possibilities we performed RAT-TRAP assays with Cy3-labelled <italic>HLE</italic> RNA, which lacks the dynein-dynactin binding sites provided by the rest of the <italic>h</italic> 3′UTR sequences.

The comparison of unidirectional runs of <italic>HLE</italic> and <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNPs, together with the earlier evaluation of unidirectional motility of <italic>h</italic><sup>SL1x3</sup> and <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>), demonstrates that once initiated the unidirectional mode of transport is not strongly influenced by the average number of cargo-associated dynein-dynactins.

Collectively, our results suggest that the dynein-dynactin recruited specifically by RNA localisation signals determines the likelihood of RNPs initiating an exclusively unidirectional, minus end-directed mode of transport but is not sufficient to cause an increase in the length or velocity of excursions of bidirectional RNPs in either direction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>MAPs induce reversals of <italic>h</italic> RNPs, with the probability of passing these obstacles not influenced by dynein-dynactin copy number</title><p>The results documented above shed light on how intrinsic properties of RNPs influence motility along the microtubule. Cargos moving along microtubules in vivo also have to contend with extrinsic factors, including MAPs that can act as obstacles. We were therefore interested in how RNPs assembled in the RAT-TRAP assay would react to the presence of MAPs and how this behaviour is influenced by manipulating dynein-dynactin copy number using the different <italic>h</italic> RNA variants. We decorated microtubules with two different recombinant, fluorescent MAPs and analysed the consequences on the motility of Cy3-labelled RNPs. The first MAP was a GFP-labelled <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin-1 with a rigor mutation (Kin<sub>401</sub>T99N:mGFP) that prevents its movement along the microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Telley et al., 2009</xref>). The second was a human Alexa488-labelled tau (isoform 23, also known as 0N3R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McVicker et al., 2011</xref>), most of which undergoes diffusive movement on microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hinrichs et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). For both MAPs, stepwise photobleaching analysis of static, microtubule-associated puncta estimated an average of 4–5 monomers per diffraction-limited spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>The presence of kin<sub>401</sub>T99N:mGFP on microtubules led to a concentration-dependent decrease in the net minus end directional bias of the <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNP population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The presence of tau23 on the microtubules also reduced the overall minus end bias to <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNP motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This effect of the MAPs was not associated with a significant reduction in the time that <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNPs were detected in association with microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, unlike the case for the wild-type kinesin-1 motor under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Telley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McVicker et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNPs did not frequently detach from microtubules bound by kin<sub>401</sub>T99N:mGFP or tau23.

Such outcomes presumably include a contribution of events in which the RNP and MAP do not meet each other due to their presence on different microtubule protofilaments. The vast majority (∼70%) of encounters of <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNPs with a region bound by a kin<sub>401</sub>T99N:mGFP punctum coincided with a reversal of the RNP on the microtubule, regardless of the direction of initial motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Encounters of RNPs with regions of microtubules decorated with static tau23 also led to a reversal in the vast majority of cases, with very few detachments or pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

One experimental approach has been to alter the numbers of isolated motors or motor domains attached to artificial cargos such as beads or DNA origami (e.g.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Block et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mallik et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diehl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vershinin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furuta et al., 2013</xref>). Although very informative, these studies did not include physiological cargo, cargo adaptors, and motor co-factors that could potentially modulate motor behaviour. Other studies have used genetic manipulations to alter the numbers of motor complexes available to cargos in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shubeita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reis et al., 2012</xref>). These approaches are physiologically relevant but cannot rule out influences from the cellular environment, including possible indirect effects of altered motor concentration on other processes that impinge on cargo motility. In this study, we have manipulated the copy number of native motor complexes on a physiological type of cargo, by incubating cellular extracts with RNA variants, and studied the consequences on motility in a defined in vitro setting using high spatiotemporal resolution imaging.</p><p>We find that <italic>h</italic> wild-type RNPs associate with dynein-dynactin and can undergo either unidirectional motion in the minus end direction that is highly processive or bidirectional motion that has characteristics of a diffusive process. Our experiments indicate that unidirectional RNP movement is driven by active, ATP hydrolysis-mediated translocation of dynein along the microtubule. The most parsimonious explanation for the bidirectional motion is that it is also due to dynein undergoing back-and-forth movements along the microtubule, a behaviour that has been observed in several studies of the purified motor in vitro (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang and Sheetz, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mallik et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ross et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miura et al., 2010</xref>) and also appears to occur in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ananthanarayanan et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we observed bidirectional movement of a significant subset of RNPs containing only the <italic>HLE</italic> (∼30% in the absence of MAPs and ∼60% in their presence [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>]), on which we failed to detect binding of a kinesin family member under conditions in which dynein and dynactin were readily detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dix et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, bidirectional motion of RNPs is not overtly sensitive to inhibition of dynein’s ability to hydrolyse ATP. Thus, our findings are compatible with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miura et al. (2010)</xref> who reported passive diffusion along microtubules of dynein in complex with a dynactin component in the presence of ATP or ATP-vanadate. We found no evidence that bidirectional RNPs can undergo long, ATP hydrolysis-dependent runs in both directions akin to those documented for individual, GFP-labelled dynein-dynactin complexes purified from mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ross et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Varying the number of SL1 elements within the context of the <italic>h</italic> 3′UTR revealed a correlation between the total copy number of dyneins per RNP and the probability of entering into the unidirectional, minus end-directed state. Previous studies using purified dynein bound to artificial cargos have demonstrated that increasing motor copy number is sufficient to stimulate processive movement towards minus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mallik et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ross et al., 2006</xref>). However, experiments with the isolated <italic>HLE</italic> signal indicated that total motor number is not the key determinant of the unidirectional mode of RNP movement. The <italic>HLE</italic> alone has a statistically indistinguishable copy number of dynein components to the <italic>h</italic><sup>ΔLE</sup> RNA, in which the localisation signal has been replaced by a heterologous sequence in the context of the <italic>h</italic> 3′UTR, yet only the former RNA is capable of unidirectional motion. These data suggest that features associated with the RNA signal are sufficient to increase the probability of processive movement of the associated dynein. It has recently been shown in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> that microtubule-associated dynein can switch from diffusive to processive behaviour upon contacting cortical anchors, an event that regulates the generation of pulling forces on the microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ananthanarayanan et al., 2013</xref>). Our data suggest that regulation of dynein processivity by associated factors may be a widespread phenomenon.</p><p>Collectively, our results support a novel model in which the same cargo species can interact with processive or non-processive dynein, with discrete cargo-associated features regulating the probability of switching between the two behaviours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, the regulatory mechanisms underpinning sorting of RNPs in this system appear distinct from those of other well-studied bidirectional cargos, which involve the interplay of opposite polarity force-generating motors, such as dyneins and kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shubeita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ally et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soppina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jolly and Gelfand, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reis et al., 2012</xref>). How might localisation signals regulate dynein processivity? One possibility is that proteins recruited by the localisation signal directly regulate the activity of the motor. Two candidates to serve such a role are the adaptor proteins Egl and BicD, which are associated only with the dynein-dynactin bound to the localisation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dix et al., 2013</xref>). It is also conceivable that the structure or rigidity of the RNA signal plays an architectural role in presenting dynein-dynactin to the microtubule in a manner that favours processive movement.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01596.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic model for the role of RNA localisation signals in controlling net RNP motion.</title><p>(Top) In the absence of RNA localisation signals, RNPs undergo passive diffusion on the microtubule lattice. Non-processive dyneins are recruited to sites in the RNA other than localisation signals through an unknown factor (X). The most parsimonious explanation for the diffusive movement is that it is driven by dynein-dynactin. (Middle) The presence of a localisation signal leads to the recruitment of additional dynein-dynactin and a subset of RNPs in the population undergoing processive, minus end-directed transport. This introduces a minus end bias to motion of the RNA population. It is not the increased total copy number of the motor complex that drives unidirectional movement, but rather the ability of localisation signals to increase the probability of associated dynein-dynactin entering into a processive state. (Bottom) Addition of more SL1 elements increases further the likelihood of RNPs entering into the unidirectional state, leading to a greater minus end bias to motility of the RNA population. It is not known whether unidirectional motion involves stepping of a single dynein-dynactin or of multiple motor complexes. Resolving this issue will require long-term nanoscale analysis.

We show that RNPs frequently reverse when encountering the regions of microtubules bound by puncta of both MAPs studied, rigor kinesin and tau23. The behaviour of RNPs at MAPs is therefore highly reminiscent of that seen for individual, purified dynein-dynactin complexes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, comparison of the behaviour of the <italic>h</italic> RNA variants reveals that the number of dynein-dynactins associated with an RNP does not increase the probability of passing microtubule-associated obstacles.</p><p>The ability of RNPs to reverse at MAPs may help them navigate to their destination in vivo. For example, reversals upon meeting an obstacle may facilitate encounters of RNPs with intersecting microtubules. Switching of RNPs between microtubules, a behaviour we have observed when intersections occur in our in vitro assays (unpublished observations), could allow these complexes to explore alternative routes to their destination. Reversals of RNPs at a MAP may also give dynein space to switch to a different lateral position on the same microtubule and thereby provide another opportunity to pass the obstacle following resumption of movement in the previous direction. Compatible with this notion, we see RNPs moving on single microtubules that can pass obstacles after multiple attempts (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis of the behaviour of RNPs at microtubule ends indicates that plus end encounters always result in a reversal. The behaviour may also be advantageous in a cellular environment by preventing detachment of RNPs at this point, an outcome that would necessitate a rebinding event before motion on the microtubule network can resume. Interestingly, a subset of RNPs undergoes pausing at the minus ends of microtubules, with a mean dwell time of ∼1 min for bidirectional complexes. These findings demonstrate that the probability of changing directions is different at the minus end and the plus end of the microtubule and that additional in vivo features, such as the γ-tubulin ring complex or other centrosome-associated factors, are not obligatory for long-term retention of RNPs at the minus end. Intrinsic behaviours of RNPs upon reaching the minus end of the α/β-tubulin polymer may therefore contribute to the dynein-dependent anchorage of RNAs in the vicinity of minus ends in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delanoue and Davis, 2005</xref>). Analysis of <italic>h</italic><sup>ΔLE</sup>, <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup>, and <italic>h</italic><sup>SL1x3</sup> RNAs demonstrates that the probability of an RNP undergoing minus end pausing in vitro, as well as the duration of such events, is not influenced by the addition of more dynein-dynactins through localisation elements. This finding offers an explanation for why inhibition of Egl and BicD following translocation of localising RNAs to the apical cytoplasm of the embryo does not affect dynein-dependent anchorage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delanoue and Davis, 2005</xref>).</p><p>It is intriguing that the average dwell time of pausing events of unidirectional <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> and <italic>h</italic><sup>SL1x3</sup> RNPs at minus ends is ∼ fivefold less than that of bidirectional RNPs harbouring the same RNA species. We also find that the unidirectional <italic>HLE</italic> RNPs, which lack features within the <italic>h</italic> 3′UTR that can recruit non-processive dynein-dynactin, dwell at the minus end for significantly less time than the unidirectional <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> and <italic>h</italic><sup>SL1x3</sup> RNPs. One explanation for these findings is that the ability of dynein bound to localisation signals to walk processively off the minus end is antagonised by interactions with the microtubule mediated by non-processive dynein bound at other sites in the RNA. Additional, long-term experiments will be required to test this hypothesis. Nonetheless, our data suggest more generally that features that promote bidirectional motion could assist in the retention of RNPs at minus ends.</p><p>Collectively, our analysis of encounters of RNPs with MAPs and microtubule ends raises the possibility that the co-existence of unidirectional or bidirectional modes of movement facilitates efficient navigation of an RNA population to its destination in vivo. Processive, unidirectional movement in the minus end direction could be beneficial for rapid, directional movement along regions of the microtubule that are not rich in MAPs. Diffusive motion along microtubules may be valuable for movement of RNPs through an obstacle rich environment and could still contribute to asymmetric sorting as it is associated with long-term retention of complexes at microtubule minus ends. This strategy appears analogous to that used by DNA enzymes and kinesins that depolymerise microtubules, which can employ one-dimensional diffusion to search for their specific target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorman and Greene, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Perspective</title><p>Our in vitro work on RNA motility has provided several new insights into how cargo-motor complexes operate and how their behaviour is modulated by encounters with the environment.

Our results also illustrate that intrinsic motile properties of cargo populations in vivo are likely to be obscured by the influence of extrinsic factors including MAPs and microtubule ends.

In the longer term, it will be important to understand how the behaviours defined in vitro are integrated during sorting of single RNA molecules in vivo, a goal that necessitates the development of new methods to visualise movement of transcripts in the optically challenging embryo system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains</title><p>Wild-type embryos were of the OR-R strain. <italic>P(Ubi-GFP::Dlic)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pandey et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>P(mat-tub-α4-GFP::Dmn)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Januschke et al., 2002</xref>) lead to ubiquitous expression of the GFP fusion proteins during early development and were gifts from J Raff (Oxford University, UK) and A Guichet (Institut Jacques Monod, France), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fluorescent RNA synthesis</title><p>The <italic>hairy</italic> RNA (<italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup>) used for in vitro motility assays is 822 nt long and represents the majority of the transcript’s 3′UTR. <italic>h</italic><sup>SL1x3</sup> is a <italic>h</italic> 3′UTR variant in which the 124 nt <italic>h</italic> localisation signal (<italic>HLE</italic>) is replaced by a cassette containing three copies of the 46 nt <italic>h</italic> stem-loop 1 (SL1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bullock et al., 2003</xref>) separated by 12–17 nt single stranded spacers.

Biotinylated, GmpCpp-stabilised microtubules with plus ends marked by greater incorporation of HiLyte 647 were polymerised as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roostalu et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, long, biotinylated microtubules that were dimly labelled with fluorophore were first produced by polymerisation for 2 hr at 37°C from 1.66 µM unlabelled tubulin, 0.4 µM biotinylated tubulin, 0.15 µM HiLyte 647 tubulin in the presence of 0.5 mM GmpCpp (Jena Bioscience, Germany) in BRB80 (80 mM PIPES, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, pH 6.8).

Microtubules were immobilised on a biotin-PEG-coated glass surface via streptavidin as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>).

Magnetic beads were then incubated with 1 mg·ml<sup>−1</sup> BSA on ice for 60 min. This procedure was designed to block unspecific binding sites on the beads. Subsequently, 1 pmol of fluorescently labelled RNA (containing the streptavidin aptamers and RNA of interest) in DXB buffer (30 mM HEPES at pH 7.3, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μM MgATP, and Complete [EDTA-free] protease inhibitor [Roche]) with 40 U RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI) was incubated with the blocked Dynabeads for 2 hr at 4°C. <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo extracts were produced from dechorionated 0–6 hr wild-type embryos by homogenising in DXB buffer as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>) using 100 μl of DXB buffer per 50 mg of embryos. Embryo extract was then centrifuged for 8 min at 9000 rpm at 4°C to remove debris. Typically, 100 µl embryo extract was added to the Dynabead–RNA complex, supplemented with 40 U of RNasin and incubated for 1 hr at 4°C on a roller mixer. The magnetic beads were washed once with DXB buffer at 4°C and RNA-motor complexes eluted by incubating the Dynabeads with 200 µl of 10 mM biotin (Invitrogen) in motility buffer (30 mM HEPES/KOH, 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0) at 15°C for 20 min in a Thermomixer comfort (Eppendorf, UK; 950 rpm). Biotin competes for the interaction of the aptamer with streptavidin. In control experiments, we confirmed by immunoblotting that components of RNA-motor complexes are present in the eluate from <italic>h</italic><sup>WT</sup> RNA affinity purification experiments by probing for Egalitarian, Bicaudal-D and Dynein heavy chain. These factors were not present when RNA was omitted from the procedure. For motility assays the eluate was transferred immediately to ice and subsequently introduced along with 2.5 mM ATP and an oxygen scavenging system (1250 nM glucose oxidase, 140 nM of catalase, 71 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 24.9 mM glucose) into a flow chamber with polarity-marked, HiLyte 647-labelled microtubules pre-adsorbed to the coverslip. In a subset of experiments sodium orthovanadate or apyrase was added to the eluate (to a final concentration of 100 μM or 20 U·ml<sup>−1</sup>, respectively) before addition to the flow cell. In the apyrase experiment the eluate was not supplemented with ATP. Microtubules and Cy3-labelled RNA molecules were visualised with a TIR microscope (15 fps, that is 66 ms capture time (63 ms exposure plus 3 ms image acquisition) or 4.2 fps, that is 236 ms capture time (200 ms exposure plus 36 ms image acquisition)); unless stated otherwise, ∼ 1500 frames or ∼700 frames were collected for 15 fps or 4.2 fps imaging, respectively. <italic>HLE</italic> RNPs were analysed at the lower frame rate (4.2 fps). This was because the reduced number of Cy3 dye molecules per RNA molecule compared to <italic>h</italic> 3′UTR RNAs (see above) necessitated a longer exposure time. Experiments in which the motility of <italic>h</italic> 3′UTR species was compared to that of <italic>HLE</italic> were also performed at 4.2 fps. Hence, all motility experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6">Figures 4–6</xref> (involving <italic>HLE</italic>) were performed at 4.2 fps, with all other experiments performed at 15 fps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of RNP motion</title><p>For each condition/RNA species, data were collected from three independent days of experiments (8–10 imaging chambers).

Sub-pixel XY coordinates of motile RNPs were acquired from TrackMate as described (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/TrackMate">http://fiji.sc/TrackMate</ext-link>) using two-dimensional Gaussian fitting. The RNP coordinates were imported into Matlab where they were projected onto a vector along the coordinates of the microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hendricks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rai et al., 2013</xref>), thereby producing on-axis positions of the RNP with respect to the track. The difference in on-axis position between consecutive frames (termed <italic>d</italic>) was then calculated. The tracking accuracy was determined to be 11.3 nm (i.e., the standard deviation of instantaneous displacements of tracked immobile RNPs on microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hendricks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>]). Runs were defined as the sum of consecutive displacements &gt;22 nm in one direction (i.e., before termination by pausing, reversal, RNP detachment, or the end of imaging). 22 nm was chosen as a cut-off as it is approximately twice the standard deviation of instantaneous displacement measurements for immobile RNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A similar calculation was previously used to produce a cut-off for the analysis of the motility of neuronal vesicles in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hendricks et al., 2010</xref>). Pauses were defined as ≥1 frame with an instantaneous displacement ≤22 nm. Reversals within RNP tracks were defined as instances when <italic>d</italic> of consecutive frames <italic>i</italic> and <italic>i+1</italic> were &gt;22 nm and the absolute value of the sign of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> minus <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>i+1</italic></sub> equalled 2 (i.e., |sign(<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>)-sign(<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>i+1</italic></sub>)| = 2), where sign(<italic>d</italic>) = +1 for <italic>d</italic> &gt;0 and sign(<italic>d</italic>) = −1 for <italic>d</italic> &lt;0. The trajectories were then analysed for run length and persistence time and these values used to calculate run velocity. In control experiments, analysis of 20 s bins of RNP motion over the duration of image acquisition (100–120 s) revealed that mean run length and velocity does not decrease over time. This indicates that RNA-motor complexes are relatively stable over the total period of image acquisition.</p><p>The proportion of motile RNPs that were unidirectional vs bidirectional for each RNA variant or condition was determined by manual analysis of 6–10 imaging chambers from three independent days of experiments. Automatic tracking of a subset of RNPs defined as unidirectional by manual analysis confirmed that they do not contain plus end-directed events. For the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, RNPs were deemed as unidirectional, bidirectional, or stationary (no motion beyond 1 pixel) by manual analysis of kymographs. 12 randomly selected microtubules from at least three different imaging chambers were analysed for each condition.</p><p>Mean squared displacement (MSD) analysis was performed with sub-pixel resolution using randomly selected bidirectional and unidirectional RNPs filmed at 15 fps.

A still image of the microtubule (635 nm excitation, 236 ms capture time [200 ms exposure +36 ms image acquisition]) was acquired, followed by a still image of rigor kin<sub>401</sub>T99N:mGFP (488 nm excitation, 1.036 s capture time [1 s exposure +36 ms image acquisition]). This was followed by continuous imaging of the Cy3-RNA channel (561 nm excitation, 236 ms capture time [200 ms exposure +36 ms image acquisition]) for 700 frames to monitor the behaviour of RNA-motor complexes. At the end of this series another still image of kin<sub>401</sub>T99N:mGFP was acquired as above.

Outcomes of encounters were scored when the RNP reached the pixels containing kin<sub>401</sub>T99N:mGFP fluorescent signal on the kymograph. The same experimental set up was used for tau23 experiments, with the following modifications: a movie was recorded (488 nm excitation, 236 ms capture time [200 ms exposure +36 ms image acquisition], 40 frames) before and after imaging the RNA-motor complexes.

The absence of nucleotide was designed to promote stable binding of RNA-motor complexes to microtubules. Note that quantification of the number of GFP molecules in RNPs undergoing motion was precluded by fluctuations in GFP fluorescence intensity. GFP and Cy3 fluorophores were illuminated sequentially for 136 ms and images captured as described above. Positions of HiLyte 647-labelled microtubules were recorded by image capture at the beginning and end of filming. Kalaimoscope Motion Tracker (Transinsight, Germany) was used to plot the change over time in fluorescence intensities of GFP signals co-localised with Cy3-RNA signal on microtubules (after background subtraction).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by the Editor-in-Chief Randy Schekman and 3 peer reviewers.</p><p>The Editor-in-Chief and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Editor-in-Chief has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Understanding how microtubule-based cargos move bidirectionally along their tracks and achieve distinct patterns of spatial organization is an important problem. Here, Soundararajan and Bullock tackle this problem by first developing an improved in vitro motility assay for analyzing microtubule-based RNP motility. Their method relies on purifying native motor complexes from Drosophila extracts via their interaction with in vitro transcribed RNAs (hairy). Previous work from the Bullock lab has shown that dynein is recruited to these RNAs along with dynactin, Lis1, BicD and Egl. These RNP complexes exhibit a combination of unidirectional movement towards the minus end of the microtubule and bi-directional movement; no unidirectional plus end-directed motility was observed. This work then goes on to characterize these unidirectional and bidirectional types of motility.</p><p>Summary recommendations:</p><p>The nature of the bidirectional motion can be sorted out in a revision by a) improved MSD analysis, b) higher spatial resolution data of the bidirectional motion, c) analysis of other nucleotide states besides ATP (e.g., ADP/ATP-vanadate or perhaps ADP) and d) most definitive (but perhaps optional) optical trapping to see if the plus end direction is associated with force.</p><p>Detailed major concerns:</p><p>1) A great deal of this paper involves the analysis and dissection of bidirectional transport, and it seems to me that the interpretation requires an understanding of the principle mechanism of bidirectional motion. The primary question is what is causing motion to the plus end of the microtubule? There is some mention of this issue only at the very end of the discussion section, but it makes it confusing to read along the way and to interpret at the end. Addressing this issue is important for making conclusions such as a ”tug of war” between opposing motors. There are three possibilities:</p><p>1) That there is a kinesin moving toward the plus end. This is what most people would assume when “plus end motion or tug of war” is discussed. However, there is no evidence for this in the Results, and in the Discussion, the authors think that this is not the case.</p><p>2) That dynein itself is a plus end directed motor, i.e., that it uses ATP energy to execute a prolonged sequence of plus end direct steps (for example a 500 nm run would be about 60 x 8 nm steps).</p><p>3) That dynein binds weakly to the microtubule and that the bidirectional motion is thermally driven (perhaps with some mild bias toward the minus end).</p><p>This is an important issue and I think that the authors need to confront it in a head-on and convincing way for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. There are some papers in the literature that suggest model 2 (dynein can either be minus or plus end-directed motor, and perhaps can convert between the two states). This would be a significant discovery if true, but convincing evidence is needed to advance the field. It is important to rule out diffusion as a mechanism; an MSD plot for one run can be misleading since a single run with limited events can produce a deviation for diffusion which could look like “active transport”. Thus, this is not an easy question to answer in a convincing way. Simulation of 1-D diffusion (to see how often if produces apparent unidirectional runs) might be helpful. But better data would be most helpful. Looking at stepping behavior directly at higher resolution might be helpful. The 6 GFP RNPs should be pretty good for analyzing stepping behavior of the RNPs (how unidirectional is the motion when one gets down to &lt;10 nm resolution?). It might also be possible to attach the RNP to a Q dot. Second, is the motion in the plus end direction associated with significant force production? This could be done by attaching the RNP to a 1μm bead. Is the plus end direction associated with a ∼6 pN force (this might be suggestive of a kinesin, but would not rule out a dynein or multiple dyneins; it would rule out diffusion)? Even a 1-2 pN force (what has been reported for a single dynein) might rule that out diffusion. It would also be powerful to show that the plus end force (like the unidirectional minus end) scales with copy number of dynein. However, if there is little force, then this would suggest a diffusive model. Although less informative than the two prior suggestions, it could be interesting to add ATP-vanadate to kill unidirectional minus end movement and see what happens to the “bidirectional” RNPs – is the plus end direction affected? If not, then this might be diffusional. The authors might have other ideas on how to address this issue as well. The bottom line is that the authors need to better support their explanation of an active plus end-directed motor activity. This might reveal that bidirectional motion is due to a switching behavior of the dynein motor itself. If shown convincingly, this would be very interesting and would increase the interest in the paper considerably. It could then be featured in the abstract for sure.</p><p>It is clear from the shown data that two types of runs are observed – unidirectional runs and runs where frequent switching of direction takes place. A lot of the conclusions are based on the MSD analysis of individual runs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>. This analysis is thus of crucial importance for the interpretation of the rest of the data in this paper and should therefore be moved, together with the kymographs, to the main figures.</p><p>It is unfortunate that each MSD plot is obtained from just a single event. In such cases, the calculated values at higher time lags become increasingly inaccurate, because they are obtained by averaging much less displacements than at shorter time lags. In these cases, it is recommended (and common practice) to only analyse the MSD trace until the time lag that corresponds to one quarter of the total trace length. (see Saxton, Biophys J 72, 1744-1753, 1997). Therefore, the ranges that were used to fit the MSD curves seem inappropriate, as is the interpretation of the inset shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</xref>.</p><p>In addition, rather than analysing just single events to obtain an MSD trace, it is common practice to analyse many more events and analyse the data in some statistically correct manner. Since many proteins have been observed to perform diffusive motility along microtubules (e.g., MCAK, Eg5, Ase1, PRC1), several procedures have been firmly established for this.</p><p>The authors observe back-and-forth movements along microtubules. The essential question is whether this motility is active, i.e., driven by ATP-dependent molecular motors, or passive, i.e., driven by thermal excitation. The apyrase experiment does not solve this question, as it could lock the motor into a tightly bound state. Additional experiments should include the use of ADP.</p><p>The authors state that: “MSD analysis of individual bidirectional RNPs suggested that there was both a diffusive and a deterministic component to their movement in each direction along the microtubule. These observations imply that individual bidirectional RNA–motor complexes undergo directed transport interspersed with diffusive motion.” These conclusions were based on analyzing the complete MSD trace of an individual trajectory, which is incorrect. In addition, the reasoning suggests that any quadratic dependence somewhere in the MSD trace is evidence for deterministic motion (as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</xref>). This also seems incorrect. In the case of unidirectional motility, one would indeed expect a quadratic dependence of MSD on time lag, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref>. However, for bidirectional motility, there are three different options:</p><p>a) Passive, ATP-independent, one-dimensional diffusion on the MT lattice: In this case, one would expect a linear dependence of MSD on time lag for all times with in the range appropriate for analysis (up to one quarter of the total time, when individual traces are analyzed).</p><p>b) Active, ATP-dependent bidirectional motility occurring as short bursts of directional motion of average duration “tburst” followed by reversal of directionality. In this case, the MSD traces would appear quadratic/ballistic/deterministic for time lags shorter than “tburst”, and linear for times greater than tburst. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors report bursts of ∼500 nm at 1.5 μm/s, suggesting that tburst is approximately 0.3 seconds. Therefore, MSD curves should only be quadratic for times below 0.3 seconds and linear above this.</p><p>c) Passive, ATP-independent, one-dimensional diffusion interspersed with occasional (short) runs in the minus end direction every x seconds. In this case, the MSD trace would appear linear up to t = x seconds and become more quadratic at longer times due to the bias introduced by the occasional unidirectional runs. However, also in this case MSD traces from individual trajectories are only reliable up to one quarter of the total time.</p><p>Finally, in the description of the plots, the authors state that the red curves represent the deterministic contribution (v2t2) and the black lines the diffusive contribution (2Dt) of the fit to the data (open circles), but this description seems incorrect given that the sum of both contributions is much higher than the real data.</p><p>Given these concerns, it is still unclear if bidirectional motility is driven by ATP-dependent motor activity. Even for pure diffusion, the design of subsequent data analysis for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> will result in separation of the trajectories in apparent persistent runs. Therefore, as it stands, none of these data can be properly interpreted. However, the extreme similarity between plus and minus end 'runs' could be evidence for passive diffusion in both cases.</p><p>MSD analysis must therefore be strongly improved.</p><p>a) Much more traces should be analyzed and the analysis should be corrected. One should either just average squared trajectories without internal averaging (such as in Helenius et al. Nature 2005) or average MSD traces obtained by internal averaging until one quarter of the total trajectory time.</p><p>b) In the case of bidirectional trajectories, testing for a quadratic dependence for MSD(t) as evidence for ATP-driven directional bursts should only be done in the range from 0 to 0.3 seconds. Plotting the MSD(t) on a log-log scale would be helpful for such a test.</p><p>c) Nucleotide dependence should also be tested by using ADP instead of ATP.</p><p>2) What is the relative amount of dynein/dynactin recruited to HLE compared to <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>wt</italic></sup>, <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>ΔLE</italic></sup>, <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>SL1x3</italic></sup>? This information seems essential for interpreting the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Overall, I found the HLE experiments confusing. Are Egl and BicD present on HLE? What is the basis for dynein/dynactin recruitment to HLE RNA?</p><p>Perhaps one could examine the effect of transport of RNPs by changing the copy number of the HLE (e.g., a HLE-short oligo-HLE-short oligo-HLE). Looking at the data, the HLE seems to be a cleaner recruiter of active minus end-directed dynein and could be good for looking for effects of what happens with increasing number of active dyneins. The whole hairy mRNA is more physiological but it seems to recruit some “unidirectional and bidirectional” dyneins, which might complicate the interpretation of how increasing copy number affects motor properties. At minimum, it would be interesting to have compare 1x and 3x HLE and see if the same conclusions (e.g., processivity, velocity, mean run time, reversals, etc) are true as for 1x and 3x hairy mRNA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01596.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary</italic> <italic>recommendations:</italic></p><p><italic>The nature of the bidirectional motion can be sorted out in a revision by a) improved MSD analysis, b) higher spatial resolution data of the bidirectional motion, c) analysis of other nucleotide states besides ATP (e.g., ADP/ATP-vanadate or perhaps ADP) and d) most definitive (but perhaps optional) optical trapping to see if the plus end direction is associated with force</italic>.</p><p>Although we initially intended to address this issue in another study, we now appreciate that it is important to tackle it in the current manuscript. The suggested experiment of using ATP-vanadate, which inhibits dynein’s ATP hydrolysis and mimics the ADP.Pi state, was extremely informative. The outcome of this experiment showed that whereas the unidirectional minus end-directed movements depend on an active energy transducing process of dynein, the bidirectional RNPs do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F – I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplements 1B, C and 2C, D</xref>). Whilst we previously favoured bidirectional RNP movement representing diffusive movement of dynein-dynactin interspersed with bouts of active transport in each direction (as reported for individual mammalian dynein-dynactin complexes by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ross et al. 2006</xref>, Nat Cell Biol (PMID 16715075)), our new data indicate that even the longest movements of bidirectional RNPs are due to passive diffusion. Our improved MSD analyses, performed following recommendations in the review (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A – C</xref> (see below for details)), are also consistent with bidirectional motion being driven by diffusion.</p><p>We believe that, in light of the outcome of the vanadate experiments and improved MSD analysis, the suggested experiments of performing force measurements of individual RNPs or visualising stepping patterns with a fluorescence-based method such as FIONA are unnecessary. In any case, both these kinds of experiments would be extremely challenging and therefore not possible within a reasonable timeframe. For example, visualising RNP motility using fluorescence microscopy with enough precision to be able to resolve individual steps will probably require direct labelling of dynein with fluorophores, rather than indirect labelling of the cargo. Developing a method for unobtrusive labelling of dynein is of course time-consuming in a system that deals with native motor complexes from an animal model. There would also be considerable complexity associated with resolving the position of individual dyneins within a multi-dynein cargo-motor assembly. Optical trap experiments would require attaching a large bead to individual RNPs, which (a) is technically not trivial and (b) would not be physiological.</p><p>The requested photobleaching analysis of dynein copy number on the <italic>h</italic> localisation element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>) has also been performed and the results strengthen substantially the evidence for our model that net motion of RNPs is controlled by regulation of dynein activity, rather than total copy number of the motor.</p><p><italic>Detailed</italic> <italic>major concerns:</italic></p><p><italic>1) A great deal of this paper involves the analysis and dissection of bidirectional transport, and it seems to me that the interpretation requires an understanding of the principle mechanism of bidirectional motion.

It might also be possible to attach the RNP to a Q dot. Second, is the motion in the plus end direction associated with significant force production? This could be done by attaching the RNP to a 1μm bead. Is the plus end direction associated with a ∼6 pN force (this might be suggestive of a kinesin, but would not rule out a dynein or multiple dyneins; it would rule out diffusion)? Even a 1-2 pN force (what has been reported for a single dynein) might rule that out diffusion. It would also be powerful to show that the plus end force (like the unidirectional minus end) scales with copy number of dynein. However, if there is little force, then this would suggest a diffusive model. Although less informative than the two prior suggestions, it could be interesting to add ATP-vanadate to kill unidirectional minus end movement and see what happens to the “bidirectional” RNPs – is the plus end direction affected? If not, then this might be diffusional. The authors might have other ideas on how to address this issue as well</italic>.</p><p>As summarised above, our new data with ATP-vanadate provides compelling evidence in support of bidirectional RNP motion being principally driven by passive diffusion. Specifically, we find that whereas unidirectional RNP movements are abolished by ATP-vanadate, the percentage of microtubule-associated RNPs that are bidirectional is not decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Similar distributions of lengths and velocities or individual runs in both the minus and plus end direction were also observed for bidirectional RNPs in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). In fact, we observed a subtle (but statistically significant) increase in run lengths in both directions in the presence of vanadate, suggesting a modulation of diffusive properties of RNPs when dynein is in the ADP.Pi state. Thus, we found no evidence that bidirectional RNPs can undergo ATP hydrolysis-dependent runs in both directions..</p><p><italic>The bottom line is that the authors need to better support their explanation of an active plus end-directed motor activity. This might reveal that bidirectional motion is due to a switching behavior of the dynein motor itself. If shown convincingly, this would be very interesting and would increase the interest in the paper considerably. It could then be featured in the abstract for sure</italic>.</p><p>We previously stated that “These observations imply that individual bidirectional RNA–motor complexes undergo directed transport interspersed with diffusive motion”. We are very pleased that the reviewers’ comments led us to refine our understanding of the basis of back-and-forth RNP motion. However, as included in a letter to Prof. Schekman after the initial reviews, we think that a scenario in which bidirectional RNPs exclusively undergo passive diffusion along the microtubule is no less interesting than our previous model. This is particularly the case given recent evidence in <italic>S. pombe</italic> that dynein can undergo diffusive motion along microtubules in vivo (Ananthanarayanan et al. Cell, 2013. PMID 23791180). In fact, our new data substantially clarify the interpretation of our whole study. They lead to a novel model in which the same cargo species can associate with processive or non-processive dynein, with discrete cargo-associated features controlling switching between the two behaviours. This work therefore also paves the way for identifying factors and mechanisms that regulate dynein processivity. Our realisation that bidirectional motion is principally driven by diffusion also refines substantially our interpretations of the experiments assessing the behaviour of RNPs at MAPs and microtubule ends.</p><p><italic>It is clear from the shown data that two types of runs are observed – unidirectional runs and runs where frequent switching of direction takes place. A lot of the conclusions are based on the MSD analysis of individual runs shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>. This analysis is thus of crucial importance for the interpretation of the rest of the data in this paper and should therefore be moved, together with the kymographs, to the main figures</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers. We have now included improved MSD data for <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup> RNPs that are unidirectional or bidirectional in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. We also show examples of kymographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>. We have also added supplementary data from the new MSD analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> (see below for more details).</p><p><italic>It is unfortunate that each MSD plot is obtained from just a single event. In such cases, the calculated values at higher time lags become increasingly inaccurate, because they are obtained by averaging much less displacements than at shorter time lags. In these cases, it is recommended (and common practice) to only analyze the MSD trace until the time lag that corresponds to one quarter of the total trace length. (see Saxton, Biophys J 72, 1744-1753, 1997). Therefore, the ranges that were used to fit the MSD curves seem inappropriate, as is the interpretation of the inset shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</italic></xref>.</p><p>We are very grateful to the reviewer for their substantial effort to help us correct the analysis. MSD analysis of individual RNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>) is now for the time period that corresponds to one quarter of the total trace length. This information is described in the relevant figure legend and in the methods.</p><p><italic>In addition, rather than analyzing just single events to obtain an MSD trace, it is common practice to analyze many more events and analyze the data in some statistically correct manner. Since many proteins have been observed to perform diffusive motility along microtubules (e.g., MCAK, Eg5, Ase1, PRC1), several procedures have been firmly established for this</italic>.</p><p>We now present data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A, B</xref> that is averaged from many individual RNP trajectories. In this analysis, the MSD analysis is only performed for the time corresponding to one quarter of the duration of the RNP trajectory with the shortest lifetime.</p><p><italic>The authors observe back-and-forth movements along microtubules. The essential question is whether this motility is active, i.e., driven by ATP-dependent molecular motors, or passive, i.e., driven by thermal excitation. The apyrase experiment does not solve this question, as it could lock the motor into a tightly bound state. Additional experiments should include the use of ADP</italic>.</p><p>We assume that here the reviewers are referring to the ADP.Pi state of the motor, which is mimicked by ADP-vanadate. ADP would also be expected to lock dynein in a tightly bound state (e.g., Holzbaur and Johnson, Biochemistry 1989, PMID 2531005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ross et al. 2006</xref>), and therefore the interpretation of such an experiment would suffer from the same caveat as the apyrase experiment.</p><p><italic>The authors state that: “MSD analysis of individual bidirectional RNPs suggested that there was both a diffusive and a deterministic component to their movement in each direction along the microtubule. These observations imply that individual bidirectional RNA–motor complexes undergo directed transport interspersed with diffusive motion.” These conclusions were based on analyzing the complete MSD trace of an individual trajectory, which is incorrect. In addition, the reasoning suggests that any quadratic dependence somewhere in the MSD trace is evidence for deterministic motion (as reported in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</italic></xref><italic>). This also seems incorrect. In the case of unidirectional motility, one would indeed expect a quadratic dependence of MSD on time lag, as shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</italic></xref><italic>. However, for bidirectional motility, there are three</italic> <italic>different options:</italic></p><p><italic>a) Passive, ATP-independent, one-dimensional diffusion on the MT lattice: In this case, one would expect a linear dependence of MSD on time lag for all times with in the range appropriate for analysis (up to one quarter of the total time, when individual traces are analyzed)</italic>.</p><p><italic>b) Active, ATP-dependent bidirectional motility occurring as short bursts of directional motion of average duration “tburst” followed by reversal of directionality. In this case, the MSD traces would appear quadratic/ballistic/deterministic for time lags shorter than “tburst”, and linear for times greater than tburst. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, the authors report bursts of ∼500 nm at 1.5 μm/s, suggesting that tburst is approximately 0.3 seconds. Therefore, MSD curves should only be quadratic for times below 0.3 seconds and linear above this</italic>.</p><p><italic>c) Passive, ATP-independent, one-dimensional diffusion interspersed with occasional (short) runs in the minus end direction every x seconds. In this case, the MSD trace would appear linear up to t = x seconds and become more quadratic at longer times due to the bias introduced by the occasional unidirectional runs. However, also in this case MSD traces from individual trajectories are only reliable up to one quarter of the total time</italic>.</p><p>Our new MSD analysis supports option “a” (passive, ATP-independent, one-dimensional diffusion on the microtubule lattice). We have averaged squared trajectories from 40 bidirectional RNPs (for the time corresponding to one quarter of the duration of the RNP trajectory with the shortest lifetime). The analysis reveals a linear dependence of MSD on time. These data are documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (in a log-log plot, which saves on space in this busy figure by allowing unidirectional and bidirectional RNPs to be plotted on the same graph) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A, B</xref> (without the log-log conversion). We also represent the data for individual RNPs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">figure 2–figure supplement 1C</xref> (with a time interval for each RNP that corresponds to one quarter of the total duration of its trajectory). We find this scatter plot informative as it provides evidence against a subset of RNPs being affected by ATP-vanadate and therefore containing significant bouts of active motion.</p><p><italic>Finally, in the description of the plots, the authors state that the red curves represent the deterministic contribution (v2t2) and the black lines the diffusive contribution (2Dt) of the fit to the data (open circles), but this description seems incorrect given that the sum of both contributions is much higher than the real data</italic>.</p><p>The analysis of individual RNP trajectories in this manner has been removed from the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Given these concerns, it is still unclear if bidirectional motility is driven by ATP-dependent motor activity. Even for pure diffusion, the design of subsequent data analysis for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>will result in separation of the trajectories in apparent persistent runs</italic>.</p><p>This is yet another very important point. Given the distribution of run lengths in the presence and absence of vanadate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2C</xref>), it is not appropriate to apply a cut-off to the run length analysis. The new manuscript therefore includes data from reanalysis of runs without the cut-off.</p><p><italic>Therefore, as it stands, none of these data can be properly interpreted. However, the extreme similarity between plus and minus end 'runs' could be evidence for passive diffusion in both cases</italic>.</p><p>This result is indeed consistent with our data suggesting passive diffusion as the dominant mechanism for bidirectional RNP movement, a point that is now made in the Results section entitled “Characterisation of the motile properties of h<sup>WT</sup> RNPs” of the revised manuscript: “Both these scenarios, or a combination of the two, could account for the relatively short mean run lengths, diffusive MSD properties and the tight coupling of minus and plus end motile properties for individual bidirectional RNPs in the presence of ATP”.</p><p><italic>MSD analysis must therefore be strongly improved</italic>.</p><p><italic>a) Much more traces should be analyzed and the analysis should be corrected. One should either just average squared trajectories without internal averaging (such as in Helenius et al. Nature 2005) or average MSD traces obtained by internal averaging until one quarter of the total trajectory time</italic>.</p><p>As described above, we have taken up the latter suggestion, which appears to be the most commonly used method in the literature.</p><p><italic>b) In the case of bidirectional trajectories, testing for a quadratic dependence for MSD(t) as evidence for ATP-driven directional bursts should only be done in the range from 0 to 0.3 seconds. Plotting the MSD(t) on a log-log scale would be helpful for such a test</italic>.</p><p>We have specifically tested the range only from 0 to 0.3 s and find a linear relationship of MSD with time, including when the data are plotted on a log-log scale. In fact we find a linear dependence of MSD on time for bidirectional RNPs for all timescales analysed. Given that the recommendation of the time interval of 0 to 0.3 seconds was based on our previous cut-off for runs of 250 nm – which we have now discarded – we assume that it is not necessary to include this specific analysis in the paper (although we mention the result as data not shown in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref>). We would of course be willing to take further guidance from the reviewer on this matter.</p><p><italic>c) Nucleotide dependence should also be tested by using ADP instead of ATP</italic>.</p><p>As described above, we have tested the ADP.Pi condition using ATP-vanadate.</p><p><italic>2) What is the relative amount of dynein/dynactin recruited to HLE compared to h</italic><sup><italic>wt</italic></sup><italic>, h</italic><sup><italic>ΔLE</italic></sup><italic>, h</italic><sup><italic>SL1x3</italic></sup><italic>?

Egl also directly binds BicD and these two proteins act as adaptors to dynein-dynactin (Bullock et al., 2006; Dienstbier et al. 2009; Dix et al. 2013). Together with dynein and dynactin components, Lis1 and CLIP-190 (which is not functionally important for mRNA motility), Egl and BicD are the only proteins that are specifically associated with localisation signals using the RNA affinity purification method also employed during the RAT-TRAP procedure (Dix et al. 2013). These data are reviewed in the Introduction, and introduced again in the context of the <italic>HLE</italic> in the section entitled “Increasing dynein-dynactin numbers through RNA localization signals…” in the Results: “The key feature of the HLE is stem-loop 1 (SL1) (Bullock et al. 2003), which recruits dynein- dynactin through the adaptor proteins Egl and BicD (Dienstbier et al. 2009; Dix et al. 2013)”.</p><p><italic>Perhaps one could examine the effect of transport of RNPs by changing the copy number of the HLE (e.g., a HLE-short oligo-HLE-short oligo-HLE). Looking at the data, the HLE seems to be a cleaner recruiter of active minus end-directed dynein and could be good for looking for effects of what happens with increasing number of active dyneins. The whole hairy mRNA is more physiological but it seems to recruit some “unidirectional and bidirectional” dyneins, which might complicate the interpretation of how increasing copy number affects motor properties. At minimum, it would be interesting to have compare 1x and 3x HLE and see if the same conclusions (e.g., processivity, velocity, mean run time, reversals, etc) are true as for 1x and 3x hairy mRNA</italic>.</p><p>This is an interesting suggestion, but we do think it is important to focus in the current study on the influence of motor number using the longer RNA because of the greater physiological significance associated with recruitment of dynein-dynactin to non-signal sites. Given the time constraints, we elected to concentrate on the points raised in the summary recommendations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
