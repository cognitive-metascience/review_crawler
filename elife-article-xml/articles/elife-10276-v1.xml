In yeast, endocytic vesicles move towards early endosomes along actin cables, however, the molecular machinery regulating interaction between endocytic vesicles and actin cables is poorly understood. The Eps15-like protein Pan1p plays a key role in actin-mediated endocytosis and is negatively regulated by Ark1 and Prk1 kinases. Here we show that <italic>pan1</italic> mutated to prevent phosphorylation at all 18 threonines, <italic>pan1-18TA</italic>, displayed almost the same endocytic defect as <italic>ark1</italic>Δ <italic>prk1</italic>Δ cells, and contained abnormal actin concentrations including several endocytic compartments. Early endosomes were highly localized in the actin concentrations and displayed movement along actin cables. The dephosphorylated form of Pan1p also caused stable associations between endocytic vesicles and actin cables, and between endocytic vesicles and endosomes. Thus Pan1 phosphorylation is part of a novel mechanism that regulates endocytic compartment interactions with each other and with actin cables.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10276.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10276.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10276.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells of all eukaryotes – including plants, animals and fungi – absorb many substances that they need from their surroundings by forming pockets around them, and then pinching off these pockets to create structures called vesicles.

Now, Toshima et al. show that a mutant version of the Pan1 protein, which cannot be modified in this way, can bind stably to both clathrin-coated vesicles and the actin filaments and connect them together. The experiments also showed that, in yeast cells that only produce the mutant version of Pan1, clathrin-coated vesicles bind stably to endosomes without the need for actin.

Recent live-cell imaging studies of yeast and mammalian cells have revealed that the actin cytoskeleton plays important roles in the formation and internalization of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and post-internalization events in the endocytic pathway, including vesicle transport and endosome motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engqvist-Goldstein and Drubin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Girao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaksonen et al., 2006</xref>). In the early stages of the endocytic pathway, transient actin polymerization at the endocytic site is required for the formation and internalization of a CCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merrifield et al., 2002</xref>). This process is regulated by several actin nucleation promoting factors (NPFs), including the type I myosins Myo3/5p, the actin binding protein Abp1p, the yeast WASP homologue Las17p, and the Eps15-like protein Pan1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goode et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weinberg and Drubin, 2012</xref>). Compared to Las17p and Myo3/5p, Pan1p has a lower NPF activity, and mutation in the Arp2/3 complex binding region of Pan1p causes only a minor defect in actin polymerization at endocytic sites because of the functional redundancy with Las17p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toshima et al., 2005</xref>). However, a form of Pan1p mutated to prevent phosphorylation at 15 threonines, Pan1-15TA, directly binds to F-actin with high affinity and its expression causes abnormal cytoplasmic actin concentrations, also called actin clumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toshima et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, Pan1p could be acting after F-actin is assembled by other NPFs as well as or instead of during the initiation of actin polymerization during endocytosis.</p><p>Pan1p’s abilities to bind F-actin and promote actin polymerization are regulated by the Prk1 family protein kinases Prk1p and Ark1p, which are related to the mammalian proteins GAK and AAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smythe and Ayscough, 2003</xref>). The Prk1 family kinases are important regulators of endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton in both yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smythe and Ayscough, 2003</xref>). In budding yeast, Ark1p and Prk1p are recruited to endocytic sites 1–2 s after commencement of actin assembly and CCV internalization, and phosphorylate several endocytic proteins, including Sla1p, Ent1/2p, Yap1801/2p, Scd5p, and Pan1p, to disassemble endocytic coat proteins and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cope et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Toret et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zeng and Cai, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zeng et al., 2001</xref>). Pan1p is one of the key targets of Ark1/Prk1 kinases, and phosphorylation of Pan1p by Ark1/Prk1 kinases is believed to be important for disassembly of the Pan1p complex, composed of several endocytic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toshima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wendland and Emr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zeng and Cai, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zeng et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, disruption of the normal phosphorylation cycle by deletion or chemical inhibition of Ark1/Prk1 kinases leads to the concentration of actin in association with endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sekiya-Kawasaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toshima et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting a role for Pan1p and other substrates in regulating interaction between endocytic vesicles and the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>After being internalized, endocytic vesicles move away from the plasma membrane in an association with actin cables that is still mechanistically unexplained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huckaba et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Toshima et al., 2006</xref>). Yeast actin cables, which are bundles of actin filaments that align along the long axis of budding yeast, are crucial for the establishment of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang and Pon, 2002</xref>). Actin cables are also used as tracks for polarized transport during the secretion of exocytic vesicles and the segregation of organelles from mother to daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bretscher, 2003</xref>). Many of these types of transport along actin cables are known to depend on the type V myosins, Myo2/4p, which mediate the movement of cargo from the minus to plus ends of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bretscher, 2003</xref>). However, transport of endocytic vesicles along actin cables is not likely to depend on these myosins, because a temperature sensitive mutant of <italic>MYO2 (myo2-66</italic>) or a deletion of <italic>MYO4</italic> gene did not exhibit any defect in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Govindan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haarer et al., 1994</xref>). Other myosins, such as type II myosin (Myo1p) and type I myosin (Myo3/5p) also do not seem to mediate this transport. Myo1p has an important role in controlling actin cable dynamics at the bud sites or neck, but it is not localized to endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huckaba et al., 2006</xref>). Myo3/5p are necessary for promoting actin assembly and endocytosis at cortical patches, but they stay at the cell cortex when endocytic vesicles are internalized along actin cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, a previous study demonstrated that endocytic vesicle movement occurs at the same velocity and in the same direction as the movement of actin cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huckaba et al., 2004</xref>). They also reported that an endocytic vesicle stays at the same position on the cable and moves together with the actin cable, suggesting that endocytic vesicles are fixed on the actin cables and move as a result of actin cable flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huckaba et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to endocytic vesicles, early endosomes also associate with the actin cytoskeleton, and the motility of endosomes is significantly inhibited by treatment of latrunculin A (LatA), a drug that sequesters actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez-Borja et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Toshima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Voigt et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly to endocytic vesicles, early endosome motility also does not depend on Myo2/4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Toshima et al., 2006</xref>). These results suggest that unknown molecular mechanisms exist that bind endocytic vesicles and endosomes to actin cables.</p><p>We sought to understand the role of Pan1 phosphorylation during endocytosis using a form of Pan1 that mimics the <italic>ark1</italic>Δ <italic>prk1</italic>Δ phenotype. We examined cells expressing Pan1-18TA, which is mutated to prevent phosphorylation at all 18 threonines; this mutant showed almost the same endocytic defect as <italic>ark1</italic>Δ <italic>prk1</italic>Δ cells, resulting in stable association between endocytic vesicles and actin cables. Interestingly, the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant also leads to accumulation of early endosomes in actin clumps. Thus, phosphorylation of Pan1p seems to regulate the interaction between endocytic compartments and the actin cytoskeleton.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pan1p is the major in vivo target of Ark1/Prk1 kinases during their regulation of endocytosis</title><p>Our group had previously demonstrated that expression of a form of Pan1 containing a mutation of 15 Ark1p/Prk1p consensus sequences (LxxQxTG) to alanine causes an endocytic defect and abnormal clumping of actin in the cytosol. However, the defect in the <italic>pan1-15TA</italic> mutant was not as pronounced as that in the <italic>ark1</italic>△ <italic>prk1</italic>△ mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toshima et al., 2005</xref>). We first sought to determine if the presence of other functionally important phosphorylation sites in Pan1p was responsible for the difference in phenotypes. In a previous intensive investigation, Cai and colleagues identified the [L/I/V/M]xx[Q/N/T/S]xTG motif as a further potential site of phosphorylation by Ark1/Prk1 kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2003</xref>). Pan1p contains three more such Ark1p/Prk1p consensus sequences (MQPNIT<sup>464</sup>G, MMPQTT<sup>480</sup>G, and MMPQTT<sup>487</sup>G) all located in the second LR region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2003</xref>). When we additionally mutated these sites to create <italic>pan1-18TA,</italic> we observed a more severe growth retardation phenotype than in <italic>pan1-15TA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The Pan1-18TA protein was expressed normally, but its phosphorylation was mostly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant cells displayed prominent actin concentrations and a more severe defect in endocytic internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Pan1-18TA-GFP also showed defects in localization, with 95% colocalizing with actin clumps or smaller, peripheral actin patches, similar to Pan1-15TA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toshima et al., 2005</xref>). This is in contrast to wild-type cells, in which Pan1p is recruited to cortical patches early, arriving ~20 s before actin is detected, and associates with actin for ~10–15 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaksonen, 2003</xref>), resulting in ~30% of Pan1p colocalizing with Abp1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10276.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Construction and characterization of a Pan1p phosphorylation-site mutant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of a Pan1p phosphorylation mutant.

These target proteins were shown to be phosphorylated by Prk1p in vitro, but significant phenotypes caused by mutations of their phosphorylation-sites have not been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zeng et al., 2001</xref>).

As we had seen the ESCRT-0 component Hse1p localize to actin clumps in the mutant, we wished to investigate its organellar localization in wild-type cells more precisely; therefore we tagged Hse1p with three tandem repeats of GFP (3GFP) or mCherry and confirmed their functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hse1-3GFP was clearly detected as numerous small puncta throughout the cytoplasm and prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Examining Hse1-3GFP in the overlay of 30 consecutive time-lapse frames made it easy to distinguish the Hse1p localizing at endosomes in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, right cell) and at the PVCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, left cell). By comparing the localization of Hse1-mCherry with GFP-tagged markers, we found that Hse1p exhibited high colocalization with Mvb12p, partial colocalization with Ear1p and Vps26p, and little colocalization with Sec7p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). We next utilized A594-α-factor to compare the spatiotemporal localization of Hse1p with Vps26p in the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Toshima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2009</xref>). Hse1-3GFP was highly colocalized with A594-α-factor-labeled endosomes at 5–10 min after α-factor internalization, whereas Vps26-GFP was mainly colocalized with A594-α-factor-labeled endosomes at 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> cells, similar levels of Hse1p also colocalized with Vps26p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,H</xref>). These data indicate that Hse1p is widely localized from early to late endosomes and partially colocalized with Vps26p at late endosomes both in wild-type and <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> cells. Unexpectedly, Vps21p, yeast Rab5, which is known to be localized at early-to-late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabrera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puchner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Toshima et al., 2014</xref>), exhibited lower localization at the actin clumps (~33%), compared to Hse1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). To determine the relative localization of Hse1p and Vps21p at early stage of endocytosis, we slowed endocytic transport by removing glucose from culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoh et al., 2011</xref>), and compared their localization with internalized A594-α-factor. Consistent with a recent study by Arlt et al. reporting that an ESCRT-I subunit, Vps23, is recruited to endosomes earlier than Vps21p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arlt et al., 2015</xref>), we found that Hse1p colocalizes with A594-α-factor slightly more than Vps21p at 10 min after α-factor internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). These results, therefore, suggest that endosomes at the early stage of endocytosis are highly localized to actin clumps.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Actin-dependent motility of Hse1p-residing endosomes</title><p>The localization of early endosomal proteins at actin clumps in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant suggests that early endosomes might associate with the actin cytoskeleton in wild-type cells. Previous studies have also indicated that actin cables mediate the directed movements of early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Toshima et al., 2006</xref>), but which endosomes, and how they associate with actin cables, has not yet been clarified. We utilized Hse1p as a marker to address these questions. However because Hse1p is found at early to late endosomes, we classified these endosomes into two categories using Vps26-mCherry: endosomes not labeled with Vps26-mCherry (early stage endosomes) and endosomes labeled with Vps26-mCherry (late stage endosome) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). Vps26-mCherry mostly colocalized with Hse1p at the vacuolar membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). Quantification of endosome velocity revealed that early-stage endosomes moved with an average speed of 125 ± 119 nm/s (<italic>n </italic>= 100), whereas late-stage endosomes moved with an average speed of 156 ± 130 nm/s (<italic>n </italic>= 100) in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). We then investigated the effects of the actin-sequestering drug, LatrunculinA (LatA), on the movement of these endosomes. Concomitantly, LatA treatment led to a significant decrease in the velocity of early-stage endosomes (~23 ± 47 nm/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). In contrast, the velocity of late-stage endosomes was not significantly affected by LatA treatment (~119 ± 112 nm/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Similar results were obtained by analyzing Vps21p-containing endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The velocity of Vps21p-containing endosomes not labeled with Vps26-mCherry (~146 ± 128 nm/s) was decreased by LatA treatment (~55 ± 42 nm/s), whereas that of ones labeled with Vps26-mCherry (~138 ± 128 nm/s) was not significantly affected (~99 ± 91 nm/s). To further confirm the association between Hse1p-labeled endosomes and the actin cytoskeleton, we labeled actin cables with tdTomato-tagged Abp140p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang and Pon, 2002</xref>) in wild-type cells. Simultaneous imaging revealed that Hse1p-labeled endosomes localized along, and moved on, actin cables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Since two distinct sets of actin assembly-promoting machinery have been identified in yeast, the Arp2/3 complex and formins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goode et al., 2015</xref>), we next utilized specific inhibitors toward these regulators. The Arp2/3 complex inhibitor CK-666 specifically disassembled Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin patches, whereas SMIFH2 disassembled formin-dependent actin cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nolen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rizvi et al., 2009</xref>). As expected, SMIFH2 treatment led to actin cable disassembly, followed by a decrease in the velocity of endosomes (~60 ± 53 nm/s). In contrast, CK-666 inhibited vesicle internalization, but endosome motilities were little affected (~126 ± 123 nm/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).

Therefore, we examined the effect of the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutation on the localization and dynamics of actin cables and endocytic vesicles. In wild-type cells, actin cables are highly dynamic polarized structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang and Pon, 2002</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant exhibited less polarized and more aggregated actin cable structures, some of which associated with the large actin concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). The movement of this Pan1p/actin aggregate in <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> was sensitive to SMIFH2 but not CK-666, suggesting that the aberrant structure associates with actin cables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). In a recent study, we showed that ~85% of endocytic vesicles were internalized along actin cables at the internalization step of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toshima et al., 2015</xref>). Here we show that in this step, Pan1-mCherry-labeled vesicles in wild-type cells associated with actin cables for ~4.6 s and moved on cables about 0.4 μm after internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B,C</xref>). This association and these movements were significantly decreased by treating with 25 μM SMIFH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C,D</xref>). Over 80% of Pan1-mCherry-labeled endocytic vesicles, even in single focal plane images, also associated with and internalized along actin cables in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast to wild-type cells, Pan1-18TA-mCherry structures became stably associated with peripheral patches, as well as actin clumps, labeled by Abp140-3GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Interestingly, live-cell imaging revealed that many of internalized patches labeled by Pan1-18TA-mCherry stably associated with actin cables over 30 s, and move on actin cables more than 3.0 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C,E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). We also wished to determine the relationship of endocytic vesicles and endosomes in the absence of Pan1 phosphorylation. In the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant, we often observed that peripheral Pan1-18TA-mCherry patches colocalized and moved together with Hse1p-labeled endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>), whereas such colocalization was rarely observed in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These findings suggest that in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant, endocytic vesicles and endosomes interact before fusion while they are both associated with actin cables, potentially tethering them together. Our data was collected with a wide field microscope; high-speed confocal microscopy could improve the quality of our results as it would permit 3-D analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kurokawa et al., 2013</xref>). However, since some vesicles and endosomes move in a single focal plane, the simultaneous double color live cell imaging used in this study permits analysis leading to substantive biological insights.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-10276-media3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10276.012</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Localization of Abp140-3GFP in wild-type and <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> cells.</title><p>The interval between frames is 1 s.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10276.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10276.012</ext-link></p></caption></media><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10276.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Interaction of Pan1p-containing compartments with actin cables and endosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Localization of Abp140-3GFP and Pan1-mCherry in a wild-type cell.

Thus, we next examined whether Pan1p directly mediates the interaction between vesicles and actin cables via its actin binding. To completely destroy the actin binding activity of Pan1p, we used a Pan1 C-terminal deletion mutant (<italic>pan1</italic>△855–1480), which lacks actin binding and Arp2/3-activating regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duncan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toshima et al., 2005</xref>).

The interaction between Pan1-mCherry-labeled vesicles and actin cables also decreased, but the vesicles still had an ability to bind actin cables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting the existence of additional actin-binding coat protein(s) that stabilize the association of vesicles with actin cables.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Interaction between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> phosphorylation site mutant</title><p>To be sure that this association is not merely a product of both being caught up in aberrant actin concentrations, we sought to isolate a mutant that could suppress actin clump formation in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant. To this end, we deleted several actin-related genes involved in endocytic internalization in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant and found three out of seven genes whose absence suppressed actin clump formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Deletion of Sla2p, a yeast Hip1R-related protein, in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant decreased the fraction of cells containing actin clumps by 95% as detected by Abp1-mCherry in maximum-intensity projections of Z stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These <italic>pan1-18TA sla2</italic>△ double mutants exhibited the elongated actin tails originating from non-motile endocytic sites seen in <italic>sla2</italic>△ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Deletion of both of the yeast type I myosins, Myo3p and Myo5p, led to an 85% reduction and deletion of Sac6p, the yeast homologue of the actin filament bundling protein fimbrin, almost completely suppressed actin clump formation in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). All three mutants showed a severe defect in the internalization of cortical actin patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2005</xref>), resulting in the loss of actin clumps in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant. We then wished to examine the localization of early endosomes, using Hse1-GFP as a marker, in these double and triple mutants. Interestingly, Hse1p-labeled endosomes showed a change in localization to the cell periphery in all three suppressing mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). We also observed that Pan1-18TA patches accumulate near Hse1p-labeled endosomes at the cell periphery in <italic>pan1-18TA sac6</italic>△ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gheorghe et al., 2008</xref>), deletion of the <italic>SAC6</italic> gene increased the lifetime of actin patches, but around half of the endocytic vesicles were able to internalize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), indicating that the formation of endocytic vesicles is delayed but eventually occurred. In contrast, in <italic>pan1-18TA sac6</italic>△ cells, the lifetime of actin patches were significantly increased and their internalizations were markedly decreased, but ~5.3% of patches were still internalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, it seems that endocytic vesicle formation is not completely blocked in <italic>pan1-18TA sac6∆</italic> cells. To examine if endocytic vesicles are formed in this double mutant, we explored the ultrastructure of these mutants using electron microscopy. Interestingly, we observed many vesicle-like structures (~40–60 nm) accumulating around the cell periphery in <italic>pan1-18TA sac6</italic>△ cells, whereas in wild-type cells such structures were rarely detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). We also observed that several endosome-like structures (~200–300 nm) associate with these vesicles in this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Quantification of these structures revealed that endosome-like structures associate with ~1–3 small vesicles in two-dimensional cross sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Similarly to <italic>pan1-18TA sac6</italic>△ cells, in <italic>pan1-18TA sla2</italic>△ cells, Hse1p-labeled endosomes were observed at the cell periphery. <italic>sla2</italic>△ cells are reported to have a severe defect in endocytic internalization, but the internalization is not completely inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raths et al., 1993</xref>) and endocytic coats are assembled on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skruzny et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, in <italic>pan1-18TA sla2</italic>△ cells, peripheral endosomes might interact with the occasionally formed endocytic vesicles at the cell periphery or with coat proteins accumulating on the plasma membrane. Examining Hse1-GFP in overlaid time-lapse images of <italic>pan1-18TA sac6</italic>△ cells demonstrated its localization exclusively at the cell periphery and vacuolar membrane, and that peripheral endosomes are less motile (~17.8 nm/s), compared to prevacuolar ones (~189.0 nm/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Since the <italic>pan1-18TA sac6</italic>△ double mutant has apparently normal late endosomes at the vacuolar membrane, similar to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), the peripheral immotile endosomes observed in the mutant are likely early endosomes. Such peripheral endosomes were rarely observed in the <italic>sac6</italic>△ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that they are due to the mutation of the phosphorylation sites in Pan1p and not just due to the defects in the actin cytoskeleton. LatA treatment had no effect on endosome localization in <italic>pan1-18TA sac6</italic>△ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), supporting the contention that endocytic vesicles and early endosomes stably associate, independently of actin.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10276.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Interaction between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Localization of Hse1-3GFP-labeled endosomes and actin structures in <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> double mutant cells.

The vesicles move in a retrograde direction, from daughter toward mother cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huckaba et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Toshima et al., 2006</xref>). This is distinct from most types of transport along actin cables, such as secretion and organellar division, that move from mother to daughter cells due to the action of myosin V motor proteins (Myo2p and Myo4p). Findings that endocytic vesicle movement occurs at the same velocity and direction as that of actin cables have suggested that endocytic vesicles remain fixed on the actin cables and move as a result of actin cable flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Girao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huckaba et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The molecular machinery that attaches endocytic vesicles to actin cables has not yet been elucidated, although a likely candidate would be an endocytic protein that binds F-actin. Several such proteins exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engqvist-Goldstein and Drubin, 2003</xref>). Considering that the association between endocytic vesicles and actin cables should be transient and controllable, Pan1p is an ideal candidate to mediate this interaction. Pan1p can bind directly to F-actin with high affinity (KD&lt;0.5 μM) and its binding activity is regulated by phosphorylation through the Ark1/Prk1 kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toshima et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that a Pan1-18TA △855 mutant lacking its C-terminal actin binding and Arp2/3-activating regions partially suppressed the formation of the actin clump and reduced the interaction between Pan1p-residing vesicles and actin cables. Thus, Pan1p seems to be one of the key regulators that fixes vesicles to the actin cable and then dissociate from the cable and the vesicle upon phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, the ability of vesicles to bind to actin cables was not completely lost in the mutant, implying the existence of additional actin-binding coat protein(s) that stabilize vesicle association with actin cables. Sla2p, the yeast HIP1R, and Ent1p, the yeast epsin, bind to both the plasma membrane and F-actin via their N-terminal lipid-binding domain and C-terminal actin-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skruzny et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 1999</xref>). A recent study showed that Sla2p and Ent1p interact redundantly with F-actin, and strains carrying a deletion of both proteins’ actin-binding domains exhibit severe a defect in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skruzny et al., 2012</xref>). Although the defects caused by these mutants are predominantly observed in vesicle formation, these proteins could be responsible for the residual association of endocytic vesicles with actin cables in the Pan1-18TA actin-binding mutant.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10276.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of the actin cable-mediated endocytic pathway.</title><p>Unphosphorylated Pan1p on an endocytic vesicle binds to actin to fix the vesicle to the actin cable. After being pinched off from the membrane, the endocytic vesicle moves into the cytosol as a result of actin cable flow, and then, interacts with the early endosome via potential tethering protein. Pan1p phosphorylation by Ark1/Prk1 kinases causes dissociation of coat proteins and the actin cable from the endocytic vesicle, making it possible for the vesicle to fuse to the endosome. This also results in the dissociation of the actin cable and the early endosome, which then moves to the vacuolar membrane, and matures into a late endosome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10276.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10276.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-10276-fig7-v1"/></fig></p><p>Early endosomes also associate with actin cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Toshima et al., 2006</xref>), but the mechanism is still unknown. In the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant, endocytic vesicles stably associate with and move together with endosomes. This finding suggests that endocytic vesicles are capable of tethering to early endosomes, but are inefficient at fusing with them due to the inhibition of endocytic vesicle uncoating caused by Pan1p-dephosphorylation. Many tethering proteins localized at target organelles have been shown to directly interact with coat proteins of transport vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2007</xref>), supporting this idea. After phosphorylation of Pan1p by Ark1/Prk1 kinases, the endocytic vesicle is uncoated, making it possible to fuse to the early endosome. Thus the cycle of Pan1 phosphorylation could release endocytic vesicles from the actin cable precisely at the time of their fusion to the endosome, also allowing the endosome which is indirectly tethered to then move on and mature into a late endosome.</p><p>Our experiments may also permit a clearer ordering of the mechanistic steps of endocytosis. Many lines of evidence indicate that cargo transport from early to late endosomes is achieved by endosome maturation, which is a successive and rapid process accompanied by Rab5-Rab7 conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nordmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rink et al., 2005</xref>). In yeast, attempts to visualize the conversion of Vps21p (yeast Rab5) to Ypt7p (yeast Rab7) on endosomes have so far been unsuccessful. Since Vps21p is localized not only at early, but also at late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Toshima et al., 2014</xref>), it is difficult to determine the point at which the early endosome ends and the late endosome begins. In the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant, localization of endosomal proteins was clearly divided into several groups, and endosomes at the early stage were more highly localized to actin clumps. This observation may be informative when considering the timing of several events comprising the endocytic pathway. For instance, subunits of the ESCRT-0, I, and II complex are highly localized but the subunit of ESCRT-III or Vps4p is localized only partially at actin clumps in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant, suggesting that recruitment of early ESCRT components to the endosome occurs at a relatively early stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Vps21p is a key regulator of early endocytic trafficking, being involved in fusion between early endosomes and the maturation of early to late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Russell et al., 2012</xref>). Deletion of the <italic>VPS21</italic> gene results in accumulation of early endosomes in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Toshima et al., 2014</xref>). Yet Vps21p exhibited only partial localization at actin clumps, suggesting that Vps21p is recruited to the endosomal membrane after the start of ESCRT complex formation. Vps26p, a component of the retromer complex, is rarely localized at actin clumps and is predominantly localized at the vacuolar membrane, suggesting that the retromer complex mediates retrograde transport to the Golgi at the late endosome stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although Rab5-Rab7 conversion is important for endosome maturation what triggers initiation of early-to-late endosome transition is still unknown. We demonstrated that early endosomes associate with actin filaments and then change their localization to the vacuolar membrane. This suggests that dissociation of early endosomes from the actin filaments might be a trigger for the initiation of endosome maturation.</p><p>In mammalian cells, before endosomes move from the plasma membrane to the lysosome along microtubules, endosomes associate with the cortical actin cytoskeleton underlying the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aschenbrenner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez-Borja et al., 2005</xref>). The interaction between endosomes and actin is regulated by RhoB GTPase, an upstream recruiter and activator of mammalian Dia1 and PRK1/PKN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez-Borja et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mellor et al., 1998</xref>). Expression of activated RhoB facilitates the association of early endosomes with cortical actin filaments, which prevents the transfer of endosomes to microtubules and inhibits further transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez-Borja et al., 2005</xref>). The physiological importance of the interaction between endosomes and the actin cytoskeleton in mammalian cells has not been determined, but in analogy to our findings this might enable endosomes to fuse with endocytic vesicles more efficiently, at the same time preventing the progression of immature early endosomes to late endosomes.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that phosphorylation of Pan1p regulates the interaction between endocytic compartments and the actin cytoskeleton. Clarifying the molecular mechanisms regulating the interaction between endocytic vesicles and endosomes, and endosomes and the actin cytoskeleton is important for elucidating the whole picture of transport from the formation of an endocytic vesicle to its fusion to an early endosome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, growth conditions, and plasmids</title><p>The yeast strains used in this study are listed in the strain list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The results presented here provide important insights into the association of earliest endosomal compartments with the actin cytoskeleton, by studying how the coat protein Pan1 impacts interactions between endocytic vesicles, early endosomes and actin.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There is much to like about this manuscript. It is well written and addresses an important problem. The data are generally of high quality. There are issues that would need to be addressed, involving some additional experimentation and quantification, before the work would be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. How endocytic vesicles evolve into endosomal compartments is an important unanswered question in the field. The model developed by the authors is very interesting and if true, represents a significant advance for the field.</p><p>One concern is that the main experimental technique used in this work is 2D wide-field fluorescence microscopy, which may not be the best method to analyze endosomes, which move dynamically in 3 dimensions. Some of the key data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) in this work lack quantification. In addition, some key results using mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) are a bit hard to interpret. Thus, the data are not yet adequate to support the conclusions.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The claim that Pan1 is the key biological target for Ark1 and Prk1 kinases could use better support. The experiment done here, where 10 threonines within Sla1 are mutated to block its phosphorylation, should be backed up with some kind of experimental assessment that shows that these ten mutations completely block phosphorylation of Sla1. Without this kind of experimental evidence, it is impossible to tell whether the lack of endocytic phenotype in this mutant is due to Sla1 not being an important Ark1/Prk1 target, or if it is due to not all Ark1/Prk1 phosphorylation sites in Sla1 being mutated. Similarly, can the authors present evidence that the 18 threonines mutated in Pan1 are bona fide in vivo Ark1/Prk1 phosphorylation sites?</p><p>Nonetheless, given the similarity of the phenotype, it is likely that Ark1/Prk1 are the responsible kinases. However, that is not even relevant for the rest of their study, which deals with downstream effects of the phosphorylation. therefore, in the absence of the sort of results suggested above, the strong focus on Ark1/Prk1 in the interpretation of results as well as in Introduction and Discussion (last paragraph) should be reduced.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors attempt to establish Hse1-3GFP as an early endosome marker in wild-type cells. However, Hse1 is also reported to be involved in late endosome to vacuole transport. Thus, some Hse1-3GFP puncta may not be early endosomes. In <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant cells, endocytic internalization is largely defective, but it is not clear how the various endosomal compartments are affected. It does not seem reasonable to assume that Hse1-3GFP localizes only in early endosomes in this mutant. If Hse1-3GFP does not label only the early endosomes in <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant, then the observation that &quot;peripheral Pan1-18TA-mCherry patches colocalized and moved together with Hse1p-labeled endosomes,&quot; does not support the conclusion that &quot;constitutive dephosphorylation of Pan1p, which inhibits endocytic vesicle uncoating, might lead to stable tethering between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes.&quot;</p><p>3) The last round of papers that looked at vesicle/endosome transport on actin cables was published before specific actin cytoskeleton drugs were developed, so the authors of those studies relied on LatA. Now, we have CK-666 (Arp2/3 complex inhibitor) and SMIFH2 (Formin FH2 Domain Inhibitor), so the model that vesicles move by attaching to cables and harnessing the power of actin flux could be tested more directly. Movement of these vesicles should be sensitive to SMIFH2 (or formin mutations) but not CK-666 if the model suggested in this paper is true.</p><p>4) The authors use the ESCRT0 component Hse1 as marker for early endosomes. They do not find the Rab5-orthologue Vps21, an established marker for early endosomes, to be present at significant amounts in <italic>pan1-18TA</italic>-induced actin clumps, and they further conclude form WT cells that Hse1 is present at very early endosomes, while Vps21 (and the CORVET complex) arrives later. This is in contrast to the general view that the Rab5/Vps21 marks early endosomes and is required for earliest fusion and maturation events (Zeigerer et al., Nature 2012, Cabrera et al., JBC 2013, Puchner et al., PNAS 2013 Arlt et al., MBoC 2014). The authors have previously published that initial steps in the yeast endocytic network are not dependent on Rab5, however, they have also seen that about 80% of Vps21 endosomes colocalize with Hse1 (Toshima et al., Nature Communications 2014). It is therefore surprising that Vps21 would not be able to mark the here studied earliest endosomes. Given its importance, I suggest substantiating the role of Hse1 as an early marker, provide a more precise definition of the early endosomes studied here, and discuss the results with respect to the literature on Vps21. The exclusion of Vps21 from early steps seems to be based on the quantification of actin clumps that contain the GFP-tagged protein of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, this does not take into account differences in the amount and lifetime of the individual proteins. I would rather suggest quantifying and comparing the percentage of GFP-fused protein that is colocalizing with actin clumps. To clarify the identity of the early endosomes that associate with actin, I suggest the measurements of endosome velocity marked by Hse1-GFP/Vps26-mCherry, with and without LatA, (subsection “Actin-dependent motility of Hse1p-residing endosomes”) to be also done with GFP-Vps21/Vps26-mCherry.</p><p>5) Data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> should be quantified. One of the main claims of the paper is that the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutation causes stable association of peripheral actin patches with cables. This should be quantified meticulously, and numbers for run length and amount of time spent associated with cables should be reported for patches in wild-type cells and <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> cells. Care should also be taken to define the percent of endocytic vesicles that associate with actin cables in the wild-type and mutant conditions.</p><p>6) The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> with <italic>pan1-18TA sac6∆</italic> are hard to interpret. Deletion of SAC6 alone is known to cause substantial defects in endocytic vesicle formation and scission. Thus, it is not clear if and how endocytic vesicles are formed in <italic>pan1-18TA sac6∆</italic> cells. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors should provide evidence that the small vesicles are endocytic vesicles and the bigger vesicles are early endosomes. In addition, a larger sample size should be analyzed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, with quantification.</p><p>7) It seems that a more straightforward method to test the authors' model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> than using <italic>pan1-18TA sac6</italic> would be a chemical genetics approach (Bishop et al., 2001), which rapidly modulates Ark1/Prk1p kinase activity in vivo (Sekiya-Kawasaki et al.). If the authors' model is correct, upon a rapid inhibition of Ark1/Prk1 kinase activity by 1NA-PP1, Pan1p should no longer be phosphorylated and the endocytic vesicles should be fixed to the actin cables near the cell periphery. However, the data shown in Sekiya-Kawasaki et al. did not seem to suggest that this is the case.</p><p>8) The scope of the final Results section (”Interaction between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> phosphorylation site mutant”) is a bit unclear. The authors search for mutants that suppress clump formation in <italic>pan1-18TA</italic>, to distinguish tethering of vesicles to endosomes from association of both with actin, if I understand correctly. They find three such mutants that all show peripheral, non-motile endosomes. Firstly, I miss clear evidence that these endosomes are less motile than prevacuolar ones. Second, the authors conclude from their data that these early endosomes associate with vesicles independently of actin. The problem is that <italic>sac6∆</italic>, as well as the other two suppressor deletions, are known to inhibit endocytic internalization (as the authors correctly cite) – why would there be any endocytic vesicles present? Could there be another interpretation for the presence of peripheral endosomes in these mutants? Could the vesicles seen in EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) be other than primary endocytic vesicles?</p><p>9) The authors interpret their results to support the model that Pan1 mediates interaction between vesicles and actin cables (for example, Discussion, start of second paragraph). However, the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> do not distinguish between a direct role for Pan1 as the bridging molecule or an indirect role through effects on uncoating that allow for other actin-binding coat proteins to stabilize vesicle association with actin cables. One approach to address this issue might be to introduce actin-binding mutations into Pan1-18TA, such as the WH2-like domain KE mutations described in Toshima et al., 2005. Such mutations are expected to disrupt actin cable binding but not vesicle uncoating. Although these mutations suppress the actin aggregation phenotype, it should still be possible to assess vesicle interaction with actin cables. Alternatively, the actin-binding mutations could be introduced into an otherwise wild-type Pan1 and tested for effects on vesicle association with cables.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Pan1p regulates regulates the interaction between endocytic vesicles, endosomes and the actin cytoskeleton&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. One of the three reviewers has agreed to share his identity: Greg Payne.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes how primary endocytic vesicles associate with and are transported along actin cables. The transiency of this interaction appears to be regulated by phosphorylation of Pan1. Furthermore, the authors find that early endosomes also associate with actin cables. They also present evidence that tethering interactions between early endosomes and primary vesicles takes place during this phase of actin association. The authors use yeast cells expressing a Pan1-phosphorylation mutant, which retards these transient events, to dissect the actin-cable association of endosomes and vesicles. They back up their interpretations of phenotypes by experiments in wild type cells including transient drug treatments.</p><p>The authors have addressed the reviewers' major concerns in the revised manuscript. What has particularly improved the manuscript is that they clarified the role of Hse1 as an endosomal marker (and, thus, the identity of the endosomes they study), they quantified the association of vesicles and endosomes with actin, and finally, the experiments with analogue-sensitive Prk1 substantiated the phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of vesicles from cables.</p><p>We do think the manuscript is a significant contribution to our understanding of the early events in the endosomal pathway. However, several concerns remain that could be addressed by changes in the text</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion that constitutive dephosphorylation, which inhibits uncoating, leads to stable tethering of primary vesicles to endosomes (end of subsection “Pan1p-labeled endocytic vesicles associate with actin cables in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant”) is based on the observation that in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant, endocytic vesicles and endosomes move together along cables. While overall, their results do suggest that endocytic vesicles and endosomes, before fusion, interact and tether while both associated to actin cables, the conclusion that dephosphorylation leads to their stable tethering, seems a bit over interpreted. In this mutant, both vesicles and endosomes are associated with actin for much longer, therefore their long-time tethering may be due to crowding or other effects, rather than the fact that dephosphorylation prevents uncoating of the vesicles.</p><p>The evidence supporting an association of endosomes with endocytic vesicles in the absence of actin is also weak. It seems clear that there is an increase in peripheral endosomes in cells lacking actin clumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>), or treated with LatA (6G), but that this localization is due to tethering with vesicles in not established. The data in 6D are not very convincing – a single static image of double mutant cells with no quantification and no comparison to single mutants. It may be a challenge for the authors to provide additional support for stable association in live cells since tracking association during movement may be difficult because of the limited motility of the peripheral endosomes. In the absence of additional data, the authors could rewrite so that association via tethering is a proposal rather than an interpretation/conclusion and either take out the tether in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> or put a question mark next to it.</p><p>Furthermore, the use of the <italic>sac6delta/pan1-18TA</italic> mutant to show that tethering of early endosomes with vesicles is not just due to actin clumping but independent of actin, is not yet entirely clear-. If I understand correctly, this finding is based on the fact that in the double mutant, early endosomes accumulate in the cell periphery, and that must be due to their association with vesicles. However, they also see endosomes in the cell periphery of <italic>sla2∆</italic> cells, which is known to totally block endocytic vesicle formation (Kaksonen 2003, Skruzny 2012). How are these endosomes held at the cell periphery? (subsection “Interaction between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> phosphorylation site mutant”).</p><p>2) The authors failed to address the major concern that they are using 2D wide field microscopy to study endosomes, which move in three dimensions. Use of three-dimensional microscopy could improve the quality of the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in particular. While I am disappointed that the authors still present only 2D microscopy, I believe that the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are sufficient to support the authors' conclusions. A comment on this limitation is requested.</p><p>3) The layout of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> should be changed such that the panels appear in alphabetical order. For example, panel F in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> seems to be out of place, coming after B and C but before D on the page.</p><p>4) In the text (subsection “Interaction between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> phosphorylation site mutant”), the authors claim that deletion of SLA2 leads to 95% reduction in actin clumps, but the representative image of a <italic>sla2Δ</italic> cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> clearly has an Abp1-labeled actin clump in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the <italic>myo3Δ/myo5Δ</italic> cell shown has no noticeable actin clump, even though the authors say in the text that clumps form more readily in this mutant. Two comments on this confusion: first, the authors should explicitly mention how they are quantifying internal clump formation; are the clumps 95% less bright in <italic>sla2Δ</italic> cells? Or do they form 95% less frequently? Second, perhaps a better representative image could be chosen, such that the numbers stated in the text are borne out in the data shown in the figure.</p><p>5) In the Discussion, first paragraph, the authors cite the vesicle formation defects in <italic>sla2</italic> and <italic>ent1</italic> actin-binding mutants as evidence that these proteins function before transport of endocytic vesicles on actin cables. However, predominant effects of the mutants on vesicle formation could obscure latter roles in vesicle transport and thus do not preclude such roles. Consequently, Sla2 and Ent1 could be responsible for the residual association of endocytic vesicles with actin cables in the Pan1-18TA actin-binding mutant. It might be worth editing the text in the Discussion to allow for this possibility.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10276.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: There is much to like about this manuscript.

This experiment showed that transient inhibition of Prk1p’s kinase activity caused stable association of endocytic vesicles to actin cables that resembled the phenotype observed in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This result supports the idea that phosphorylation by Ark1/Prk1 kinases regulates interaction between vesicles and actin cables. However, since we agree the reviewers’ opinion that we emphasize Ark1/Prk1 too much without enough evidences, we modified the sentences in Introduction and Discussion as follows;</p><p>In the Introduction, the sentence “Thus, Ark1/Prk1 kinases seem to phosphorylate Pan1p to regulate the interaction between endocytic compartments and the actin cytoskeleton.” was changed to “phosphorylation of Pan1p seems to regulate the interaction between ~”.</p><p>In the Discussion, the sentence “the Ark1/Prk1 kinases phosphorylate Pan1p to regulate the interaction ~” was changed to “phosphorylation of Pan1p regulates ~”.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors attempt to establish Hse1-3GFP as an early endosome marker in wild-type cells. However, Hse1 is also reported to be involved in late endosome to vacuole transport. Thus, some Hse1-3GFP puncta may not be early endosomes. In pan1-18TA mutant cells, endocytic internalization is largely defective, but it is not clear how the various endosomal compartments are affected. It does not seem reasonable to assume that Hse1-3GFP localizes only in early endosomes in this mutant. If Hse1-3GFP does not label only the early endosomes in pan1-18TA mutant, then the observation that &quot;peripheral Pan1-18TA-mCherry patches colocalized and moved together with Hse1p-labeled endosomes,&quot; does not support the conclusion that &quot;constitutive dephosphorylation of Pan1p, which inhibits endocytic vesicle uncoating, might lead to stable tethering between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes.&quot;</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that some Hse1-3GFP puncta may not be early endosomes. As we showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>, Hse1p is widely localized from early to late endosomes and partially colocalized with Vps26p at late endosomes. We also showed that similar levels of Hse1p colocalized with Vps26p in <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, H</xref>). Thus, we changed the sentence “constitutive dephosphorylation of Pan1p, which inhibits endocytic vesicle uncoating, might lead to stable tethering between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes.” to “~ stable tethering between endocytic vesicles and endosomes.”</p><p><italic>3) The last round of papers that looked at vesicle/endosome transport on actin cables was published before specific actin cytoskeleton drugs were developed, so the authors of those studies relied on LatA. Now, we have CK-666 (Arp2/3 complex inhibitor) and SMIFH2 (Formin FH2 Domain Inhibitor), so the model that vesicles move by attaching to cables and harnessing the power of actin flux could be tested more directly. Movement of these vesicles should be sensitive to SMIFH2 (or formin mutations) but not CK-666 if the model suggested in this paper is true.</italic> </p><p>We examined the effects of CK-666 and SMIFH2 on the movement of endocytic vesicles and endosomes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B, D, E</xref>, we found that the movement of endocytic vesicles and endosomes are sensitive to SMIFH2 but not CK-666, as the reviewer suggested.</p><p> <italic>4) The authors use the ESCRT0 component Hse1 as marker for early endosomes. They do not find the Rab5-orthologue Vps21, an established marker for early endosomes, to be present at significant amounts in pan1-18TA-induced actin clumps, and they further conclude form WT cells that Hse1 is present at very early endosomes, while Vps21 (and the CORVET complex) arrives later. This is in contrast to the general view that the Rab5/Vps21 marks early endosomes and is required for earliest fusion and maturation events (Zeigerer et al., Nature 2012, Cabrera et al., JBC 2013, Puchner et al., PNAS 2013 Arlt et al., MBoC 2014). The authors have previously published that initial steps in the yeast endocytic network are not dependent on Rab5, however, they have also seen that about 80% of Vps21 endosomes colocalize with Hse1 (Toshima et al., Nature Communications 2014). It is therefore surprising that Vps21 would not be able to mark the here studied earliest endosomes. Given its importance, I suggest substantiating the role of Hse1 as an early marker, provide a more precise definition of the early endosomes studied here, and discuss the results with respect to the literature on Vps21. The exclusion of Vps21 from early steps seems to be based on the quantification of actin clumps that contain the GFP-tagged protein of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, this does not take into account differences in the amount and lifetime of the individual proteins. I would rather suggest quantifying and comparing the percentage of GFP-fused protein that is colocalizing with actin clumps. To clarify the identity of the early endosomes that associate with actin, I suggest the measurements of endosome velocity marked by Hse1-GFP/Vps26-mCherry, with and without LatA, (subsection “Actin-dependent motility of Hse1p-residing endosomes”) to be also done with GFP-Vps21/Vps26-mCherry.</italic> </p><p>To determine the relative localization of Hse1p and Vps21p at early stages of endocytosis, we slowed endocytic traffic by removing glucose from the culture medium (Aoh et al., MBoC, 2011), and compared their localization with internalized A594-α-factor. Interestingly, we found that Hse1p colocalizes with A594-α-factor at slightly higher amounts than Vps21p at 10 min after α-factor internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This result is consistent with a recent study by Arlt et al. (MBoC, 2015). In the paper, they carefully compared the recruitment timing of several endosomal proteins, including ESCRT subunits and Vps21p and reported that an ESCRT-I subunit, Vps23, is recruited to endosomes earlier than Vps21p. We also quantified the percentage of GFP-fused Vps21p that colocalizes with actin clumps, as the reviewer suggested, and found only ~8% of GFP-Vps21p is localized to actin clumps whereas ~22% of Hse1-GFP is localized to actin clumps (data not shown in the manuscript). Thus, it seems to be reasonable that Hse1p, another ESRCT-I subunit, is recruited to early endosomes before Vps21p, and that Hse1p localizes to actin clumps more than Vps21p.</p><p>Additionally, in accordance with the reviewers’ suggestion, we examined the velocity of endosomes marked by GFP-Vps21 with or without Vps26-mCherry. Similar to Hse1p-residing endosomes, the velocity of GFP-Vps21 endosomes not labeled with Vps26-mCherry was decreased by LatA treatment, whereas those labeled with Vps26-mCherry was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Taken with the previous results (colocalization with Vps21p and recruitment of ESCRT-1 complex to early endosomes), we concluded that Hse1p is suitable as an early endosome marker, as well as Vps21p.</p><p><italic>5) Data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> should be quantified. One of the main claims of the paper is that the pan1-18TA mutation causes stable association of peripheral actin patches with cables. This should be quantified meticulously, and numbers for run length and amount of time spent associated with cables should be reported for patches in wild-type cells and pan1-18TA cells. Care should also be taken to define the percent of endocytic vesicles that associate with actin cables in the wild-type and mutant conditions.</italic> </p><p>According to the reviewers’ suggestion, we added quantified data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>. With regard to percent of endocytic vesicles that associate with actin cables, we recently reported that over 80% of actin patches were internalized actin cables at the internalization step of endocytosis (Toshima et al., JCS, 2015). We also examined their association in <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant, and found that over 80% of Pan1-mCherry-labeled endocytic vesicles also associated with and internalized along actin cables in <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant. To explain this result, we have added some sentences to the text (subsection “Pan1p-labeled endocytic vesicles associate with actin cables in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant”).</p><p> <italic>6) The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> with pan1-18TA sac6∆ are hard to interpret. Deletion of SAC6 alone is known to cause substantial defects in endocytic vesicle formation and scission. Thus, it is not clear if and how endocytic vesicles are formed in pan1-18TA sac6∆ cells. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors should provide evidence that the small vesicles are endocytic vesicles and the bigger vesicles are early endosomes. In addition, a larger sample size should be analyzed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, with quantification.</italic> </p><p>To examine the defects of endocytic vesicle formation and scission quantitatively in <italic>sac6</italic>△ and <italic>pan1-18TA sac6∆</italic> mutant, we quantified actin patch lifetime and percentage of vesicle internalization. As reported previously (Gheorghe et al., 2008), deletion of the <italic>SAC6</italic> gene increased actin patch lifetime, but around half of endocytic vesicles were able to move inside the cells, indicating that though the formation of endocytic vesicles is delayed it eventually occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>pan1-18TA sac6</italic>△ cells, the lifetime of actin patches were significantly increased and their internalizations were rarely observed. Yet ~5.3% of patches were still internalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>) supporting the conclusion that endocytic vesicle formation is not completely blocked in <italic>pan1-18TA sac6∆</italic> cells.</p><p>We also performed immuno-EM to identify the small vesicles and the bigger vesicles observed in the EM images as endocytic vesicles and early endosomes, but we could not obtain a clear result because our antibodies did not work on the EM samples, probably due to the low expression of Pan1p or Hse1p on the vesicles. Thus, as reviewer #2 suggested in comment #5, we moved the Figure to the supplementary file (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and de-emphasized the result in the new manuscript (subsection “Interaction between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> phosphorylation site mutant”). In addition, we have added quantified data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) It seems that a more straightforward method to test the authors' model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> than using pan1-18TA sac6 would be a chemical genetics approach (Bishop et al., 2001), which rapidly modulates Ark1/Prk1p kinase activity in vivo (Sekiya-Kawasaki et al.). If the authors' model is correct, upon a rapid inhibition of Ark1/Prk1 kinase activity by 1NA-PP1, Pan1p should no longer be phosphorylated and the endocytic vesicles should be fixed to the actin cables near the cell periphery. However, the data shown in Sekiya-Kawasaki et al.</italic></p><p><italic>did not seem to suggest that this is the case.</italic> </p><p>In accordance with the reviewers’ suggestion, we performed an experiment using an analogue-sensitive mutant of Prk1p in cells lacking Ark1p (<italic>ark1</italic>△ <italic>prk1-as3</italic>). This mutant enabled us to investigate the direct and immediate consequence of Prk1p inactivation for the interaction between endocytic vesicles and actin cables. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, we found that, at 1 min after treatment of the mutant with 100 μM 1NA-PP1, endocytic vesicles stably associated with, and moved on actin cables. Then, small aggregates containing Pan1p that associated with actin cables were formed by 3 min, and a large actin clump that stably associates with actin cables was formed in the mutant after 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These observations support the idea that Pan1p phosphorylation by Ark1/Prk1 kinases promotes dissociation of endocytic vesicles from actin cables.</p><p> <italic>8) The scope of the final Results section (”Interaction between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes in the pan1-18TA phosphorylation site mutant”) is a bit unclear. The authors search for mutants that suppress clump formation in pan1-18TA, to distinguish tethering of vesicles to endosomes from association of both with actin, if I understand correctly. They find three such mutants that all show peripheral, non-motile endosomes. Firstly, I miss clear evidence that these endosomes are less motile than prevacuolar ones.</italic> </p><p>We have added quantified data for the endosome velocity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>.</p><p><italic>Second, the authors conclude from their data that these early endosomes associate with vesicles independently of actin. The problem is that sac6∆, as well as the other two suppressor deletions, are known to inhibit endocytic internalization (as the authors correctly cite) – why would there be any endocytic vesicles present? Could there be another interpretation for the presence of peripheral endosomes in these mutants? Could the vesicles seen in EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) be other than primary endocytic vesicles?</italic> </p><p>To examine of if endocytic vesicles are formed in <italic>pan1-18TA sac6</italic>∆ cells, we examined the lifetime and dynamics of actin patches in <italic>sac6</italic>∆ and <italic>pan1-18TA sac6</italic>∆ cells (please see the response to comment #6). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>, the lifetime of actin patches were significantly increased and their internalizations were rarely observed, but ~5.3% of patches were still internalized. Thus, it seems that endocytic vesicle formation is not completely blocked in <italic>pan1-18TA sac6∆</italic> cells. With regard to the EM data, we have moved the Figure to the supplementary file and de-emphasized the result, because we could not confirm the exact identity of the vesicle-like and endosome-like structures through antibody stains.</p><p> <italic>9) The authors interpret their results to support the model that Pan1 mediates interaction between vesicles and actin cables (for example, Discussion, start of second paragraph). However, the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> do not distinguish between a direct role for Pan1 as the bridging molecule or an indirect role through effects on uncoating that allow for other actin-binding coat proteins to stabilize vesicle association with actin cables. One approach to address this issue might be to introduce actin-binding mutations into Pan1-18TA, such as the WH2-like domain KE mutations described in Toshima et al., 2005. Such mutations are expected to disrupt actin cable binding but not vesicle uncoating. Although these mutations suppress the actin aggregation phenotype, it should still be possible to assess vesicle interaction with actin cables. Alternatively, the actin-binding mutations could be introduced into an otherwise wild-type Pan1 and tested for effects on vesicle association with cables.</italic></p><p>To determine whether Pan1p directly mediates the interaction between endocytic vesicles and actin cables, we prepared the Pan1-18TA mutant lacking its C terminal actin binding and Arp2/3-activating regions (Duncan et al., NCB, 2001; Toshima et al., NCB, 2005). Interestingly, as the reviewer expected, <italic>pan1-18TA</italic>△<italic>855</italic> caused accumulation of vesicles containing Pan1p similar to that seen in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant, but the formation of actin clumps was significantly suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). The interaction between vesicles and actin cables also decreased, but the ability of endocytic vesicles to bind to actin cables was not completely lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, it seems that other actin-binding coat protein(s) that stabilizes vesicle association with actin cables exist, in addition to Pan1p.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) The conclusion that constitutive dephosphorylation, which inhibits uncoating, leads to stable tethering of primary vesicles to endosomes (end of subsection “Pan1p-labeled endocytic vesicles associate with actin cables in the pan1-18TA mutant”) is based on the observation that in the pan1-18TA mutant, endocytic vesicles and endosomes move together along cables. While overall, their results do suggest that endocytic vesicles and endosomes, before fusion, interact and tether while both associated to actin cables, the conclusion that dephosphorylation leads to their stable tethering, seems a bit over interpreted. In this mutant, both vesicles and endosomes are associated with actin for much longer, therefore their long-time tethering may be due to crowding or other effects, rather than the fact that dephosphorylation prevents uncoating of the vesicles. The evidence supporting an association of endosomes with endocytic vesicles in the absence of actin is also weak. It seems clear that there is an increase in peripheral endosomes in cells lacking actin clumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>), or treated with LatA (6G), but that this localization is due to tethering with vesicles in not established. The data in 6D are not very convincing</italic> –</p><p><italic>a single static image of double mutant cells with no quantification and no comparison to single mutants. It may be a challenge for the authors to provide additional support for stable association in live cells since tracking association during movement may be difficult because of the limited motility of the peripheral endosomes. In the absence of additional data, the authors could rewrite so that association via tethering is a proposal rather than an interpretation/conclusion and either take out the tether in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> or put a question mark next to it.</italic> </p><p>In accordance with the reviewers’ suggestion, we rewrote the sentence which said “constitutive dephosphorylation, which inhibits uncoating, leads to stable tethering of primary vesicles to endosomes.” to “in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant, endocytic vesicles and endosomes interact before fusion while they are both associated with actin cables, potentially tethering them together.” We also modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> as reviewer suggested, indicating a protein as a “potential tethering protein” in the legend and placing a question mark next to it in the figure.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the use of the sac6∆ /pan1-18TA mutant to show that tethering of early endosomes with vesicles is not just due to actin clumping but independent of actin, is not yet entirely clear-. If I understand correctly, this finding is based on the fact that in the double mutant, early endosomes accumulate in the cell periphery, and that must be due to their association with vesicles. However, they also see endosomes in the cell periphery of sla2∆ cells, which is known to totally block endocytic vesicle formation (Kaksonen 2003, Skruzny 2012). How are these endosomes held at the cell periphery? (subsection “Interaction between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes in the pan1-18TA phosphorylation site mutant”).</italic> </p><p>As the reviewers’ suggested, <italic>sla2</italic>△ cells are reported to have a severe defect in endocytic internalization, but the internalization is not completely blocked at 24<sup>o</sup>C as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (Raths et al., JCB, 1993). Thus, similarly to <italic>pan1-18TA sac6</italic>△ cells, endocytic vesicle formation might not be completely blocked in <italic>pan1-18TA sla2∆</italic> cells and peripheral endosomes could interact with those endocytic vesicles. As another possibility, in <italic>sla2</italic>△ cells, although endocytic internalization is severely inhibited, endocytic coats are assembled on the plasma membrane (Kaksonen et al., Cell, 2003; Skruzny et al., PNAS, 2012). Thus, peripheral endosomes might interact with coat proteins accumulating on the plasma membrane in <italic>pan1-18TA sla2</italic>△ cells. To explain about this, we have added some sentences in the Results section (subsection “Interaction between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> phosphorylation site mutant”).</p><p><italic>2) The authors failed to address the major concern that they are using 2D wide field microscopy to study endosomes, which move in three dimensions. Use of three-dimensional microscopy could improve the quality of the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in particular. While I am disappointed that the authors still present only 2D microscopy, I believe that the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are sufficient to support the authors' conclusions. A comment on this limitation is requested.</italic> </p><p>In accordance with the reviewers’ suggestion, we have added sentences in the Results section (subsection “Pan1p-labeled endocytic vesicles associate with actin cables in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant”).</p><p><italic>3) The layout of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> should be changed such that the panels appear in alphabetical order. For example, panel F in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> seems to be out of place, coming after B and C but before D on the page.</italic> </p><p>We modified those Figures to arrange all panels in alphabetical order.</p><p><italic>4) In the text (subsection “Interaction between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes in the</italic> pan1-18TA <italic>phosphorylation site mutant”), the authors claim that deletion of SLA2 leads to 95% reduction in actin clumps, but the representative image of a sla2Δ cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> clearly has an Abp1-labeled actin clump in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the myo3Δ/myo5Δ cell shown has no noticeable actin clump, even though the authors say in the text that clumps form more readily in this mutant. Two comments on this confusion: first, the authors should explicitly mention how they are quantifying internal clump formation; are the clumps 95% less bright in sla2Δ</italic></p><p> <italic>cells? Or do they form 95% less frequently? Second, perhaps a better representative image could be chosen, such that the numbers stated in the text are borne out in the data shown in the figure.</italic> </p><p>To mention how we quantified internal clump formation described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and 1B</xref>, we have added a sentence in the legend of the Figure. We also changed the sentence “Deletion of Sla2p, a yeast Hip1R-related protein, in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant decreased the formation of actin clumps by 95%~” to “Deletion of Sla2p, a yeast Hip1R-related protein, in the <italic>pan1-18TA</italic> mutant decreased the fraction of cells containing actin clumps by 95% ~”. We have also replaced the micrographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (<italic>sla2</italic>△ and <italic>myo3/5</italic>△ cells) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> (<italic>myo3/5</italic>△ cells) to better ones.</p><p><italic>5) In the Discussion, first paragraph, the authors cite the vesicle formation defects in sla2 and ent1 actin-binding mutants as evidence that these proteins function before transport of endocytic vesicles on actin cables. However, predominant effects of the mutants on vesicle formation could obscure latter roles in vesicle transport and thus do not preclude such roles. Consequently, Sla2 and Ent1 could be responsible for the residual association of endocytic vesicles with actin cables in the Pan1-18TA actin-binding mutant. It might be worth editing the text in the Discussion to allow for this possibility.</italic></p><p>According to the reviewers’ suggestion, we have changed the sentence from “~ these proteins seem to function at the steps before the transport of endocytic vesicles along the actin cable.” to “~ these proteins could be responsible for the residual association of endocytic vesicles with actin cables in the Pan1-18TA actin-binding mutant.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
