Yet within these networks, neurons can exhibit high connection probabilities, suggesting that cell-intrinsic factors, not proximity, determine connectivity. Here, we identify ephrin-B3 (eB3) as a factor that determines synapse density by mediating a cell-cell competition that requires ephrin-B-EphB signaling. In a microisland culture system designed to isolate cell-cell competition, we find that eB3 determines winning and losing neurons in a contest for synapses. In a Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) genetic mouse model system in vivo the relative levels of eB3 control spine density in layer 5 and 6 neurons. MADM cortical neurons in vitro reveal that eB3 controls synapse density independently of action potential-driven activity. Our findings illustrate a new class of competitive mechanism mediated by trans-synaptic organizing proteins which control the number of synapses neurons receive relative to neighboring neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptogenesis</kwd><kwd>activity-independent</kwd><kwd>connectivity</kwd><kwd>trans-synaptic</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Liqun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1NS050835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Liqun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA022727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dalva</surname><given-names>Matthew B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS106906</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dalva</surname><given-names>Matthew B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Farber Family Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dalva</surname><given-names>Matthew B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Competition between neurons for postsynaptic ephrin-B3 controls distribution of a limited pool of synapses and defines a novel trans-synaptic mechanism enabling neurons to set the number of synapses they receive.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the developing brain, neurons must form specific connections in an environment with many potential synaptic partners while also controlling the number of synapses they receive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sanes and Yamagata, 2009</xref>). Defects in the abundance of synaptic connections are associated with devastating diseases, such as schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zoghbi and Bear, 2012</xref>). The precise number and pattern of contacts only emerge after a period of exuberant synaptogenesis, which generates an excess of synapses that are then subjected to further refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Williams et al., 2010</xref>). However, while synaptic sites are over-produced during development, connectivity is thought to remain sparse, with only a small number of all possible synaptic contacts made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Druckmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stepanyants and Chklovskii, 2005</xref>). Indeed, serial electron microscopic reconstruction of dendritic spines in mouse cortex reveals that each spine contacts an average of nine different axons, while only forming a synapse with one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>). Since only a small fraction of the possible connections between neurons exist, how do neurons decide whether to accept or reject potential synaptic contacts? Despite the importance of this question, molecular mechanisms that might enable neurons to specify and control the number of contacts made remain largely unknown.</p><p>One way to generate the sparse set of contacts found in the brain would be to regulate the number of contacts each neuron is capable of making relative to its nearby neighbors. The observation that synapse density varies greatly between neighboring neurons and does not correlate to local axon density suggests that neurons may physically interview potential synaptic partners, using molecular cues that control synapse density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown and Hestrin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chklovskii et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Druckmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stepanyants and Chklovskii, 2005</xref>). Consistent with a role for such molecular cues, synapse development proceeds normally in the absence of neuronal activity or even neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sando et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sigler et al., 2017</xref>). By defining how potential synaptic inputs are distributed between neighboring neurons as they develop, molecular cell-contact driven mechanisms could both limit the overall local connectivity and regulate local variations in synapse density.</p><p>Numerous trans-synaptic cell adhesion interactions serve as mediators of synapse formation and maturation and likely provide for specificity between synaptic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biederer and Stagi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai and Ip, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McMahon and Díaz, 2011</xref>). Trans-synaptic interactions can coordinate the wiring of individual synapses, but recent evidence suggests that trans-synaptic signaling may also control how many synapses a neuron receives in relation to nearby neurons. Indeed, differences in the expression of trans-synaptic adhesion proteins and BDNF/TrkB can control the local distribution of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>). These studies suggest that similar to activity-dependent competition in the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>), neurons may use molecular cues to compete with one another for synapses. While each of these studies provides some evidence for a molecular competition, they fail to demonstrate that a molecular competition occurs, since specific winning and losing neurons cannot be identified in complex in vivo or in vitro systems.</p><p>One molecule linked to a competitive mechanism for synapse development is eB3. Relative, but not absolute levels of eB3 expression regulate excitatory synapse density in cortical neurons, without affecting inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>). Thus<italic>, Efnb3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cortical neurons have normal synapse density in vitro and in vivo but generate fewer synaptic contacts when co-cultured with wild type neurons at a 1:10 ratio. Likewise, wild type neurons co-cultured with eB3 null neurons at a 1:10 ratio have higher than normal synapse density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>) . Consistent with these findings, shRNA knockdown of eB3 using low-efficiency transfection methods also reduces synapse density in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The above results led us to propose a model in which post-synaptic eB3 acts as a competitive signal that enables neurons with higher eB3 levels to generate more synapses. For what are neurons competing? Ephrin-B3 can regulate synapse density through a trans-synaptic interaction with pre-synaptic EphB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that neurons might compete for EphB2. In this model, higher eB3 expression gives neurons an advantage to more effectively compete for binding of EphB2 found in axons. Based on this neuron-neuron competition model we predict that: 1) relative differences in eB3 expression levels between two neurons should generate a winning (more eB3) and a losing (less eB3) neuron with higher and lower synaptic density respectively, without altering the total number of synapses received by the two neurons; and 2) blocking or preventing interactions between eB3 and EphB2 should nullify the competitive signaling, leading to equal synapse density regardless of the level of eB3 in each post-synaptic neuron.</p><p>Here, using a combination of approaches, including a two-neuron microisland cortical neuron culture system that allows assignment of winners and losers in a competition for synapses, we demonstrate that neurons use eB3 to compete for pre-synaptic EphBs. Using the Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) genetic mouse model we show that relative levels of ephrin-B3 regulate dendritic spine density in layer 5 and 6 pyramidal neurons in vivo. Remarkably, control of local synapse density by eB3 persists in the absence of action potential-driven activity, suggesting that eB3-mediated competition functions independently of activity-dependent mechanisms in cultured cortical pyramidal neurons. Together these results define eB3 as a trans-synaptic signal that is not required for synapse formation but instead controls the local distribution of a limited pool of synapses by competing for EphBs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ephrin-B3 does not regulate synapse density in a non-competitive environment</title><p>Our previous findings in complex cortical neuron cultures and in vivo suggest a model in which post-synaptic eB3 regulates synapse density through a molecular contest for pre-synaptic EphBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>). However, the complexity of these systems precludes testing of the hypothesis that eB3 directs a molecular competition for synaptic inputs between adjacent neurons. To address whether relative differences in eB3 expression between identified neurons control a competition for synaptic inputs, we utilized a microisland cortical culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tarsa and Goda, 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We generated two types of islands: one containing a single neuron, and a second containing two neurons. Unlike previous studies in vivo, in brain slice, or in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>), each microisland is a closed system, enabling neurons to be isolated without the opportunity to compete (single-neuron system), or providing for direct competition between identifiable neurons (two-neuron system). Moreover, the simplified nature of the microisland system allows the essential aspect of a competition to be observed: a winner and a loser. We expect that if eB3 directs a contest for synapses between neighboring neurons, eB3 knockdown in single-neuron microislands should have no effect on synapse density since competition cannot occur. In contrast, knockdown of eB3 in one neuron within a two-neuron microisland should reduce this neuron’s ability to compete. Thus, if eB3 regulates a competition for synapses, these two-neuron doublets should generate a ‘loser’, the neuron with reduced eB3, with lower synapse density and a ‘winner’, the untransfected neuron, with higher synapse density, without changing the total density of synapses in the microisland.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, we first generated single-cortical neuron microisland cultures and knocked down eB3 expression with a lentivirus containing a previously characterized eB3 shRNA that selectively reduces eB3 expression by at least 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>). We then quantified synapse density by fixing and immunostaining cultures for pre- and post-synaptic markers (vGlut1 and PSD-95, respectively), a method which we have shown detects decreases in synapse number following eB3 knockdown as confirmed by a concomitant reduction in mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>). In these single-neuron microislands, synapse density should be unaffected by changes in eB3 expression level. As expected, synapse density in neurons transduced with GFP and either eB3 shRNA or control virus were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). Thus, in conditions where cell-cell competition cannot occur, eB3 does not regulate synapse density or the ability of neurons to form synapses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41563.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Knockdown of ephrin-B3 does not alter synapse density in single-neuron microislands.</title><p>(<bold>a and b</bold>) Representative images of dendrites from single-neuron microislands transduced with control (pSuper) and eB3 shRNA viruses and immunostained at DIV21 for vGlut1 and PSD-95.

To test whether this results from a failure of neurons expressing low levels of eB3 to compete for synapses, the levels of eB3 in one neuron within a two-neuron microisland were reduced and the effects on synapse density of both neurons in the microisland determined. In order to distinguish synaptic contacts onto the transfected neuron from those onto the transfected neuron within microisland doublets, we developed a Gateway compatible expression construct (Fisher Scientific) expressing PSD-95-GFP and cell filling tdTomato from two distinct mammalian promoters. In addition, this vector expressed either eB3 shRNA (pFUGW-tdTomato-eB3.2) or pSuper control (pFUGW-tdTomato-pSuper) from a separate promoter. Using this construct, we found that PSD-95-GFP reliably localized to post-synaptic sites and could be effectively used to determine the density of synapses onto transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). Importantly, with our transfection conditions the expression of PSD-95-GFP did not alter the density of synapses onto neurons in either single- or two-neuron microislands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It should be noted that although expression of PSD-95-GFP to mark post-synaptic specializations did not alter synapse density in our culture system, any potential increase in synapse number caused by PSD-95-GFP expression would only be expected to lessen the effect of eB3 shRNA expression within competitive doublets, since eB3 shRNA and PSD-95-GFP were expressed in the same cell. Thus, this approach is well suited to examine whether eB3 regulates the ability of individual neurons to compete for pre-synaptic contacts. Consistent with the results of eB3 knockdown using lentiviral transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), expression of eB3 shRNA combined with PSD-95-GFP did not affect synapse density in single-neuron microislands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41563.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PSD-95-GFP localizes to synapses and does not alter synapse density.</title><p>(<bold>a and b</bold>) Representative images of single-neuron microislands transfected with the indicated constructs and immunostained for GFP (for PSD-95-GFP), PSD-95 and vGlut1.

To do this, we transfected neurons by electroporation in suspension with our PSD-95-GFP control construct (pFUGW-tdTomato-pSuper). Two-cell microislands were generated when one transfected and one untransfected neuron landed on the same island as the neurons were plated. At day in vitro (DIV) 21 we quantified synapse density in two-neuron microislands by immunostaining for synaptic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We have shown previously that expression of eB3 varies between neurons and eB3 levels positively correlate with synapse density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we expected that neither the transfected or untransfected cell would consistently have more synapses, but that one neuron in each pair of cells might have more synapses than the other. To capture variation between individual cells, we plotted synapse density in untransfected vs. control (PSD-95-GFP) transfected neurons on a scatter plot such that each data point represents two cells within a single microisland pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Synapse density was typically higher in one neuron within each pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, dashed line represents equal synapse density), but there was no bias in whether the transfected or untransfected neuron won. Accordingly, untransfected and transfected cells in these control doublets received an equal proportion of synapses within the doublets on average, indicating that synapses were equally distributed among neurons.</p><p>Next, we created a situation with reliable differences in eB3 levels with the expectation that a consistent winning and losing neuron would emerge. Neurons were transfected with our eB3 knockdown construct (pFUGW-tdTomato-eB3.2) and microislands were created by transfected and untransfected neurons that landed on individual islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). In competitive doublets where eB3 was knocked down in one of the two neurons, eB3 shRNA transfected cells received a significantly lower proportion of total synaptic contacts than untransfected cells, and a significantly lowerproportion of synaptic contacts than transfected and untransfected cells in control doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,e</xref>). Likewise, untransfected cells received a higher proportion of synapses within competitive doublets, and a higher proportion of synapses than untransfected and transfected cells in control doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,e</xref>). Thus, in a single two-neuron microisland, a higher relative level of eB3 in a cell provides a competitive advantage, generating a winner in a competition for synaptic inputs. Neurons within microisland doublets have a broad range of synapse densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>). Despite this variation, examination of competitive doublets shows that neurons with endogenous levels of eB3 (untransfected) consistently emerged as winners (83% of doublets). In contrast, control transfected cells were winners much less often (83% vs. 44%, Competitive vs. Control p=0.001, Fisher’s exact test). There was a ~ 35% increase in synapse density in untransfected neurons compared to eB3 knockdown neurons within the same competitive doublet (mean difference, untransfected cell-transfected cell, n = 53 doublets, 8.05 ± 1.48 synapses/100 µm, p&lt;0.0001, one-sample t-test), while no such difference was observed in control doublets (n = 25 doublets, 0.15 ± 2.18 synapses/100 µm, p=0.994, one sample t-test). Total synapse density in competitive doublets in which one neuron expressed eB3 shRNA was unchanged from that of control doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). This indicates that knockdown of eB3 did not alter the overall number of synapses that the pair of neurons could form. Rather, knockdown of eB3 results in a redistribution of synapses onto neurons with higher eB3 expression (winners) at the expense of neurons that were transfected with eB3 shRNA (losers). These results suggest that eB3 functions as a cell-cell competition signal that controls how a limited pool of synaptic inputs is distributed between neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ephrin-B3 competes for EphBs</title><p>What might be controlling the pool of synaptic inputs neurons can receive? We have previously demonstrated that knockdown of pre-synaptic EphB2 completely blocks the ability of eB3 to induce pre-synaptic differentiation in a heterologous cell synapse induction assay, suggesting that pre-synaptic EphB2 is required in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scheiffele et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with this finding, biochemical fractionation revealed that EphB2 is localized to pre-synaptic active zones, though not exclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouvier et al., 2008</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesized that neurons are competing for pre-synaptic EphBs. In this model, higher levels of eB3 expression would enable a cell to out-compete neighboring cells for axonal contacts expressing EphBs, leading to higher synapse density. This model predicts that preventing the interaction between eB3 and EphBs should nullify the competitive advantage conferred by higher levels of eB3 expression, preventing these cells from competing for EphB-expressing axons and thereby rescuing synapse density in neurons with reduced eB3 to control levels. To block the interaction between eB3 and endogenous EphBs, we applied unclustered EphB2 ectodomain that binds ephrin-Bs but does not activate ephrin-B signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">San Miguel et al., 2011</xref>). In the context of eB3 knockdown, we expected that EphB2 ectodomain would functionally eliminate differences in eB3 expression between cells expressing eB3 shRNA and the surrounding untransfected cells by preferentially binding to cells expressing wild-type levels of eB3. To confirm that binding of EphB2 ectodomain is reduced in cells expressing eB3 shRNA, we first transfected E17-18 rat cortical neurons at DIV0 with EGFP and either eB3 shRNA or control vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>). We then applied EphB2 ectodomain for 45 min at DIV10, fixed the cultures, and stained for exogenously applied EphB2 ectodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). As expected, EphB2 ectodomain puncta density and size were reduced in neurons expressing eB3 shRNA compared to control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>). In addition, we confirmed that unclustered EphB2 ectodomain does not activate ephrin-B signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>).</p><p>We next tested our hypothesis that applying exogenous EphB2 ectodomain in this manner would nullify the competitive advantage of high eB3 expression, rescuing synapse density in neurons expressing eB3 shRNA. After transfecting neurons with GFP and either eB3 shRNA or control vector as described above, we treated cultures from DIV3-10 with EphB2 ectodomain, fixed the neurons at DIV10 and determined synapse density by immunostaining for PSD-95 and vGlut1. Knockdown of eB3 in these complex cortical neuron cultures significantly reduced synapse density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). Remarkably, treatment with unclustered EphB2 ectodomain rescued this reduction in synapse density to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). Consistent with the competition model, the rescue of synapse density by treatment with EphB2 ectodomain was dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The effects of EphB2 ectodomain were specific to cultures containing neurons with reduced eB3 expression, since treatment of control-transfected neurons with EphB2 ectodomain had no effect on synapse density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). These findings suggest that control of synapse density by eB3 relies on relative differences in eB3 expression, which allow cells to compete for binding of EphBs. As eB3 requires EphB2 in axons to initiate pre-synaptic differentiation, eB3 likely allows cells to compete for axonal EphB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41563.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Effects of ephrin-B3 knockdown are rescued by unclustered EphB2 ectodomain treatment.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) DIV10 cortical neurons transfected with the indicated constructs along with GFP and treated with unclustered EphB2 ectodomain (EphB2-ecto).

This is supported by three findings: 1) relative differences in eB3 control the distribution of pre-synaptic inputs between isolated pairs of cells without altering total synapse density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), 2) relative levels of eB3 control spine density in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and 3) addition of exogenous EphB2 prevents eB3-dependent competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Further supporting the competition model, neurons that lack eB3 have no synapse density phenotype when cultured with other neurons lacking eB3. However, when challenged with wild-type eB3 expressing neurons, these cells have significantly fewer synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, analogous to activity-dependent competition that is important for critical period plasticity of ocular dominance and orientation selectivity in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>), eB3 appears to regulate a molecular competition for generation or stabilization of synapses at the level of individual neurons.</p><p>Cortical neurons in <italic>Efnb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice do not display a synaptic density phenotype, but exhibit reduced synapse density when co-cultured with wild-type neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>). These findings suggested the surprising possibility that eB3 might direct a competition between adjacent cells to regulate synaptic density. We find that cell-cell differences in eB3 levels in two neuron microislands regulate the distribution of synaptic contacts but not total synapse number. Thus, we propose that eB3 functions as a signal that allows cells to compete with one another for pre-synaptic contacts. The absence of a synaptic density phenotype in <italic>Efnb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is consistent with this model since without eB3 expressed there can be no competition. Also consistent with the model is the finding that in eB3 MADM mice the relative levels of eB3 regulate dendritic spine density in CTIP2 + layer 5 and 6 pyramidal neurons, which express higher levels of eB3 than neighboring SATB2 +/CTIP2 - cells. Our findings suggest that eB3 defines a new class of proteins that regulate an underappreciated aspect of synapse development: the specification of synapse number in relation to neighboring cells.</p><p>For what does eB3 compete? The finding that blockade of ephrin-B-EphB interaction rescues synapse density following eB3 knockdown suggests that eB3 likely competes for EphB-expressing axonal contacts and is consistent with the finding that EphB2 can be localized both pre- and post-synaptically in cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouvier et al., 2008</xref>). However, it is possible that other Ephs, such as EphA4 may also function as pre-synaptic ligands, or that <italic>cis</italic> interactions between eB3 and EphB2 may be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antion et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takemoto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yokoyama et al., 2001</xref>). Importantly, treatment of control cultures with unclustered EphB2 ectodomain to block ephrin-B-EphB interactions does not alter synapse density, suggesting that it does not directly affect synapse development. In contrast, EphB2 ectodomain fully rescued synapse density following eB3 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these data suggest that blockade of ephrin-B-EphB interaction does not increase the intrinsic ability of neurons to form synapses following eB3 knockdown, but rather nullifies the competitive advantage of surrounding eB3-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>). Together with data showing that EphB2 is required for eB3-mediated pre-synaptic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>), the simplest model suggested by our data is that eB3 enables neurons to compete for EphB2-expressing axons.</p><p>It is unlikely that other ephrin-B family members function in a similar fashion to ephrin-B3. Loss of function experiments in cortical neurons have demonstrated that members of the ephrin-B family have non-redundant roles in synapse development. Ephrin-B3 functions post-synaptically, while ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 have specific pre-synaptic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McClelland et al., 2009</xref>). These differences likely arise in part from different subcellular localization of the three ephrin-Bs. In addition, there are important differences in how ephrin-B3 signals that likely mediate its ability to control the competition for excitatory synapses. Ephrin-B3, but not ephrin-B1 or ephrin-B2, contains an Erk-binding D domain that is required for regulation of synapse density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hruska et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, eB3 contains a perfect MAPK consensus sequence centered on serine 332 that is absent in ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hruska et al., 2015</xref>). Phosphorylation of serine 332 is dependent on Erk-MAPK signaling and negatively regulates a direct interaction between eB3 and PSD-95. The eB3-PSD-95 interaction stabilizes PSD-95 at synaptic sites and appears to be crucial for eB3 to regulate synapse number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hruska et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, within the ephrin-B family, ephrin-B3 has unique signaling motifs and protein interactions that likely enable post-synaptic eB3 to controlling synapse development. Further work will be needed to determine whether these specific signaling mechanisms mediate the molecular competition for synapses.</p><p>Though other synaptogenic factors have not been studied in a system where competitive interactions can be isolated, there is evidence that proteins such as Neuroligin-1 (NLGN1) and Trk receptor tyrosine kinases, which have strong knockdown phenotypes but fail to display clear synaptogenesis defects in knockout mice, and may also determine synapse number in a competitive fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the lack of a decrease in overall synapse number in NLGN1 knockout (KO) mice, it was found that NLGN1 specifically promotes the formation of thalamocortical synapses by interacting with the astrocyte-secreted protein Hevin, which bridges NLGN1 with pre-synaptic neurexin-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). NLGN1 KO mice exhibit no change in the overall density of synapses, but a decrease in the number of thalamocortical synapses, suggesting that other sources of synaptic input to cortex compensate for the loss of thalamocortical connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). This raises the intriguing possibility that distinct populations of axons may compete with one another for post-synaptic targets. Determination of whether NLGN1 and Trk receptors mediate a direct competition or regulate the ability of neurons to establish synaptic contacts will require use of a simplified system similar to microislands. Future studies should investigate whether these proteins are also members of a class of trans-synaptic molecules that function to define the distribution of synapses between neighboring neurons.</p><p>Early in development, activity-independent molecular cues such as trans-synaptic adhesion molecules establish the initial patterning of synapses, after which neuronal activity plays a key role in refining connectivity while maintaining the proper density of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flavell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>). Our results suggest that the density of synapses onto each neuron can be tuned in relation to its neighbors early in development by competition mediated by eB3. This competition persists in the absence of action potential-driven neuronal activity, suggesting that eB3 may function in an activity-independent pathway. Our findings suggest that while neurons possess activity-dependent mechanisms that regulate the input-output relationship of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>), molecular cues can also set the density of excitatory inputs. Ephrin-B3-dependent regulation of synapse density appears to be one such mechanism. It is possible that synapse density and connectivity established by eB3 represents a first step in generating specific patterns of connections which are later refined by activity-dependent competition. Since the eB3-PSD-95 interaction is required for control of synapse number by eB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hruska et al., 2015</xref>), one possibility is that eB3 may stabilize nascent contacts by recruiting PSD-95 prior to activity-dependent synapse refinement. Interestingly, another trans-synaptic adhesion protein, N-Cadherin, was recently found to be involved in an activity-dependent inter-spine competition that appears to be important for synaptic pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bian et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, distinct trans-synaptic interactions may be involved in different stages of synapse development and refinement.</p><p>In mammalian cortex, neighboring pyramidal neurons exhibit a low connection probability (CP) on average (CP &lt; 0.1). Yet within these sparsely connected circuits, subpopulations of neurons exhibit connection probabilities much higher than what would be expected by chance, with an overrepresentation of reciprocal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown and Hestrin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Song et al., 2005</xref>). These patterns of connections cannot be explained by patterns of axonal growth, as the axon of each neuron is thought to promiscuously contact the dendrites of all neighboring neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown and Hestrin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalisman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that the decision to accept or reject a potential synaptic contact is local, occurring at the site of axo-dendritic contact.</p><p>Here, we find that a cell-cell competition mediated by a trans-synaptic organizing protein, eB3, can control the relative distribution of synaptic contacts between neighboring neurons, without altering the overall number of synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). By generating a trans-cellular competition, eB3 may act as a cue that enables neurons to ‘interview’ potential synaptic partners with appropriate pre-synaptic markers (EphBs). Importantly, expression levels of eB3 and gene dosage of eB3 is correlated with synapse number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, eB3-dependent competition could allow neurons to fine tune the number of synapses they receive. Consistent with this model, <italic>Efnb3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> neurons within eB3 MADM mice exhibited spine densities in between that of WT and <italic>Efnb3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neurons in the same mice. Interestingly, the difference between WT and <italic>Efnb3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> neurons reached significance, while the difference between <italic>Efnb3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> neurons and <italic>Efnb3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neurons did not. Given the large effects seen in heterogenotypic cultures or following eB3 knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>), these findings are somewhat surprising and, suggest either that there may be some compensation in the MADM mice, or that the presence of many unlabeled <italic>Efnb3</italic><sup>+/-</sup> neurons in MADM eB3 mice reduces the impact of the loss of eB3. Regardless, variations in the level of eB3 appear to regulate the density of excitatory synaptic connections cortical neurons receive.</p><p>Ephrin-B3-EphB2-mediated competition appears ideally suited to generate a key feature of cortical connectivity: highly interconnected sub-populations of cells within an overall sparsely connected network, a feature that may be crucial for optimizing the storage capacity of cortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunel, 2016</xref>). One example of this type of connectivity is in visual cortex, where the connection probability between neighboring cells differs between subpopulations of layer five neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown and Hestrin, 2009</xref>). Subcortically projecting neurons (corticotectal and corticostriatal) receive a high density of inputs from callosally projecting and corticostriatal neurons, respectively. In contrast, the local inputs onto neighboring callosally projecting layer 5 cells are relatively sparse. In light of the finding that CTIP2+, subcortically projecting neurons express higher levels of <italic>Efnb3</italic> mRNA than SATB2+/CTIP2 -, callosally projecting neurons, one function of eB3-dependent competition may be to increase the relative density of specific types of inputs to subcortically projecting cells compared to neighboring callosally projecting cells. Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>), we also observed considerable variability in eB3 expression between individual CTIP2 + cells, suggesting that eB3 may serve to finely tune the connectivity of individual neurons within this population. More work will be needed to determine whether loss of eB3 impacts these specific types of circuit organization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ephrin-B3 knockout (and WT littermates)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yokoyama et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hruska et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antion et al., 2010</xref>.</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3026744">MGI:3026744</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MADM-11 TG, eB3+/MADM-11 TG, eB3- (founder line)</td><td valign="top">This paper.</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Progenitor: MADM-11 TG/TG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hippenmeyer et al., 2010</xref>), RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:013749">IMSR_JAX:013749</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MADM-11 GT/GT;

The promoters used are from human ubiquitin (hUb), synapsin (Syn), and H1, respectively. To do this, the existing pFUGW vector was converted into a GATEWAY destination vector using the Gateway vector conversion system kit (Fisher Scientific). First, we removed GFP (EGFP) downstream of the hUb promoter from the original pFUGW by cutting with XbaI (New England Biolabs) and subsequently blunted the sites with Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs). Then in place of GFP we cloned Reading Frame A cassette (RfA, Fisher Scientific) that contains 5’ attR1 and 3’ attR2 sites, with chloramphenicol and ccdB genes, thus rendering pFUGW Gateway compatible. Finally, to generate the expression plasmid containing PSD-95-GFP, tdTomato and ephrin-B3 shRNA with their respective promoters, we performed 4-fragment Gateway LR recombination by combining the pFUGW-Destination vector and four pDONR 221 entry plasmids containing following fragments: 1) 5’ attL1_PSD-95-GFP_attR5 3’; 2) 5’ attL5_BGH_PA_attL4 3’; 3) 5’ attR4_SynPro_tdTomato_SV40PA_attR3r 3’ and 4) 5’ attL3_H1_ephrin-B3shRNA_attL2 3’ or 5’ attL3_pSuper cassette_attL2 3’.

Brains were post-fixed for 24 hr at 4˚ C, then washed 3X with PBS and submerged in 30% sucrose/PBS for 48 hr at 4˚C. Brains were then frozen in OCT medium, cryosectioned at 20 µm, and mounted on Superfrost slides (Fisher Scientific). Slides were stored at −80 ˚C until use, then baked at 50 ˚C for one hour prior to initiating the RNAscope protocol. Pre-treatment of tissue sections and RNAscope ISH was carried out according to manufacturer protocols (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Inc) using the RNAscope fluorescent multiplex kit (Cat No. 320850) with CTIP2 (Cat No. 413271-C3), SATB2 (Cat No. 413261-C2) and eB3 (Cat No. 526771) probes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Imaging and analysis</title><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Complex neuronal cultures and microislands</title><p>Images were aquired on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). Stacks of 6–8 images taken at 0.3 μm intervals were acquired with a 63X oil immersion objective (Leica) with a 1.7X-1.9X zoom. Maximum intensity projections of the image stacks were analyzed to calculate synapse or puncta density using custom ImageJ macros as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, each channel for each image was thresholded and converted to a binary image, and vGlut1, and PSD-95 puncta were defined as 0.5–7.5 μm of continuous pixels. For unclustered EphB2 ectodomain control experiments, puncta were defined as having at least one pixel overlap with GFP-labeled dendrites. Synapse or puncta density was calculated as the density of colocalized puncta (with &gt; 1 pixel overlap) from a region of at least 50 μm of dendrite per cell. In two-neuron microislands, the number of colocalized PSD-95-GFP/vGlut1 puncta was used to calculate synapse density in transfected neurons. For untransfected neurons, synapse density was calculated by subtracting the number of colocalized PSD-95-GFP/vGlut1 puncta from the number of PSD-95/vGlut1 puncta.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>MADM cultures</title><p>MADM cultures were imaged on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Manheim, Germany). The automated imaging feature in Leica application suite was used to sequentially image the entirety of each coverslip with a 63X oil immersion objective (Leica) and 1.7X zoom. Image fields containing EGFP + and tdTomato + cells were then selected for analysis. We confirmed that the numbers of tdTomato + and EGFP + neurons in each culture did not significantly differ by selecting 6–10 random image fields form each experiment and counting the number of EGFP + and tdTomato + cell bodies in each image. The numbers of EGFP + and tdTomato + cells did not significantly differ in control (n = 26 fields, 2.46 ± 0.347 red vs. 2.231 ± 0.29 green cells, t(50)= 0.51, p=0.6123, two-tailed Student’s t-test) or heterogenotypic (n = 25 fields, 2.44 ± 0.252 red vs. 3.16 ± 0.496 green, t(48)= 1.295, p=0.2016, two-tailed Student’s t-test) cultures. Fields with exceedingly high cell density were excluded due to the difficulty of accurately assigning synaptic contacts to cells. In addition, fields containing cells with non-neuronal morphology were excluded. Analysis was carried out using custom ImageJ macros. Briefly, maximum intensity projections for each channel for each image were generated, thresholded and converted to binary images. Axons were removed from tdTomato and EGFP channels using the particle analysis tool in ImageJ. vGlut1 puncta were defined as 0.5–7.5 μm of continuous pixels. An ImageJ macro was used to assess the overlap of each vGlut1 puncta with tdTomato and EGFP channels, assigning each puncta to the channel that contained the largest area of overlap with the vGlut1 puncta. Puncta that overlapped equally with each channel were categorized as ‘unknown’, and manually assigned when possible. Synapse density was then calculated on a per image basis as density per unit area of vGlut1 puncta assigned to tdTomato + and EGFP + cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-3"><title>Dendritic spine imaging and quantification</title><p>MADM brain sections were imaged on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). Stacks of 5–15 images taken at 0.6–2 μm intervals were acquired with a 63X oil immersion objective (Leica) with 1.7–2.4X zoom. For each cell, dendritic spines were counted on a segment of apical dendrite at least 40 μm in length. Dendrite width was measured by creating a mask of each dendrite, manually erasing dendritic protrusions from the image, then calculating the average width of the dendrite by dividing the total area of the dendrite by its length.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-4"><title>RNAscope ISH imaging and quantification</title><p>WT and <italic>Efnb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brain sections were imaged on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). 10–18 µm stacks (approximately the width of a single nucleus) were acquired at 2 µm intervals with a 63X oil immersion objective and 1.7X zoom. To avoid experimenter bias, fields of view were chosen by visualizing CTIP2 and DAPI signals to identify subgranular layers of cortex, without looking at the eB3 channel. Images were analyzed using custom ImageJ macros. Briefly, maximum projections of each channel were thresholded after applying gaussian blur and background subtraction (same threshold for all RNAscope probes), and nuclei were automatically identified and selected as ROIs. RNAscope puncta in the size range of 4–100 pixels were selected for further analysis. Each ROI corresponding to a nucleus was automatically scored as ‘positive’ for CTIP2 and/or SATB2 if it contained at least 10 puncta. Ephrin-B3 probe puncta within each of these ROIs were then automatically counted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data plotted on bar graphs are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Sample sizes were not formally calculated but are consistent with the standards in field. Statistical differences were determined using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test, one sample t-test, Fisher’s exact test, or Student’s t-test as indicated. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and data were pooled from a minimum of three independent experiments unless otherwise indicated. Statistical tests were done on a per cell basis unless otherwise noted. Experimental groups were defined by treatment/transfection condition or genotype. No outlying data points were removed from analysis. Analysis and data aquisition was done with the experimenter blinded to condition with the exception of MADM culture and RNAscope experiments, for which the analysis was automated. For each experiment, cell morphology was examined and cells that exhibited signs of poor health were excluded.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s6" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software development, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing First Draft Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervising, Fundraising, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines at Thomas Jefferson University in accordance with US National Institutes of Health guidelines (01289 and 01286).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ephrin-B3 controls excitatory synapse density through cell-cell competition for EphBs&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Henderson and colleagues investigates the role of intercellular competition in synapse formation. The authors use cell culture and in vivo approaches to address the consequences of reducing ephrin-B3 levels on synapse density. They find that neurons with reduced ephrin-B3 levels are less competitive in forming synapses in a microisland assay. Treatment with excess unclustered EphB2 abolishes the competitive disadvantage of ephrin-B3 shRNA-expressing neurons, suggesting that the cells compete for presynaptic EphB2. To test this model in vivo, the authors use the MADM approach to analyze spine density in sparsely labeled WT or ephrin-B3 KO neurons surrounded by ephrin-B3 heterozygous cells. They find that WT neurons have higher spine density than KO neurons. Finally, the authors show that neuronal activity is not required for ephrin-B3 mediated competition for synapses.</p><p>This is a well-written paper with a clear presentation. The experimental approach is elegant and the topic of cell-cell competition in synapse formation is interesting and not well understood. The main limitation is that compared to a previous study from the same group (McClelland PNAS 2008), the conceptual advance resulting from the current work is limited. The McClelland study already showed that ephrin-B3 mediated competition regulates synapse density independent of neuronal activity, albeit in a less elegant way.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Based on the competition experiments with excess soluble EphB2, the authors conclude that neurons compete for presynaptic EphB2. They cite Bouvier et al., 2008, in demonstrating that EphB2 is presynaptic, but this study actually shows a mostly dendritic localization of EphB2 in hippocampus and cortex. To make the point that neurons compete for presynaptic EphB2, the authors should demonstrate this directly by knocking down/out EphB2 in axons. If their model is correct, removing EphB2 presynaptically would abolish the competitive disadvantage of ephrin-B3 shRNA neurons. This can be done in the microisland assay with an shRNA for EphB2 expressed in both neurons.</p><p>2) To support their model, the authors should provide evidence for varying expression levels of ephrin-B3 (relative to another constantly expressed marker) in CTIP2+ cortical layer 5 and 6 neurons in cortical sections using fluorescent in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry. Do CTIP2-/SATB2+ neurons not express ephrin-B3 because their dendrites do not seem sensitive to ephrin-B3 levels?</p><p>3) In their previous study (McClelland et al.) it was shown that spine density is strongly (60%) reduced in cortical neurons in the ephrin-B3 global KO (no competition between neurons; synapse number in cortical sections based on antibody staining however appeared unchanged). Another study showed that the density of shaft synapses is decreased in ephrin-B3 KO hippocampus using EM (Aoto JNeurosci 2007). This data does not seem entirely compatible with the current study, in which spine density is reduced in MADM mosaic KO neurons compared to WT neurons. In the MADM mouse, WT and KO neurons compete with a majority of ephrin-B3 heterozygous neurons. What is the spine density in heterozygous neurons and do WT and KO neurons differ significantly from these? In Figure 5B, is spine density in KO neurons significantly different from control MADM neurons? This does not seem to be the case in the graph and should be explained.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41563.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Based on the competition experiments with excess soluble EphB2, the authors conclude that neurons compete for presynaptic EphB2.

We feel that this critique may stem in part from a lack of clarity on our part in describing the published evidence that EphB2 is the pre-synaptic ligand for ephrin-B3. In addition to the Bouvier et al. paper mentioned by the reviewers, our lab has previously shown that ephrin-B3 requires pre-synaptic EphB2 to induce pre-synaptic differentiation in a heterologous cell co-culture assay (McClelland et al., 2010). The reviewers also requested experiment where we knock down EphB2 in both cells within a competitive microisland, with the expectation that this would block competition if EphB2 is indeed the pre-synaptic ligand. We have considered this experiment ourselves, but feel that the results would be very difficult to interpret in light of the fact that both pre- and post-synaptic EphB2 would be eliminated in the system. Therefore, we asked for and were given permission by the editor to respond to this criticism with changes to the text. These change are found in the subsection “Ephrin-B3 competes for EphBs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To support their model, the authors should provide evidence for varying expression levels of ephrin-B3 (relative to another constantly expressed marker) in CTIP2+ cortical layer 5 and 6 neurons in cortical sections using fluorescent in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry.

We are therefore conducted RNAscope ISH experiments to simultaneously visualize and quantify the expression of ephrin-B3 mRNA (<italic>Efnb3</italic>), CTIP2 mRNA (<italic>Bcl11b</italic>) and SATB2 mRNA (<italic>Satb2</italic>) in brain sections. Consistent with our previous data, we found that CTIP2+ and CTIP2+/SATB2+ neurons in layer 5 and 6 neurons express significantly higher levels <italic>of Efnb3</italic> than SATB2+/CTIP2- cells (Figure 5, subsection “Relative levels of ephrin-B3 determine spine density in vivo”). The levels of eB3 probe signal in SATB2+/CTIP2- cells were not significantly different than CTIP2+, CTIP2+/SATB2+, or SATB2+/CTIP2- cells in ephrin-B3 knockout cortex, suggesting that SATB2+ express little or no eB3. Moreover, the amount of eB3 RNA varied between different CTIP2+ neurons. Thus, CTIP2+ neurons express more ephrin-B3 than SATB2+ neurons and the level of expression varies from CTIP2+ neuron to CTIP2+ neuron. These data are show in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In their previous study (McClelland et al.) it was shown that spine density is strongly (60%) reduced in cortical neurons in the ephrin-B3 global KO (no competition between neurons; synapse number in cortical sections based on antibody staining however appeared unchanged). Another study showed that the density of shaft synapses is decreased in ephrin-B3 KO hippocampus using EM (Aoto JNeurosci 2007). This data does not seem entirely compatible with the current study, in which spine density is reduced in MADM mosaic KO neurons compared to WT neurons. In the MADM mouse, WT and KO neurons compete with a majority of ephrin-B3 heterozygous neurons. What is the spine density in heterozygous neurons and do WT and KO neurons differ significantly from these? In Figure 5B, is spine density in KO neurons significantly different from control MADM neurons? This does not seem to be the case in the graph and should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the phenotype of the ephrin-B3 heterozygous neurons is interesting and relevant to our study. Based on our model, we would predict that within the ephrin-B3 MADM mice, these neurons would exhibit spine densities in between those of wild-type and ephrin-B3 knockout neurons. We have conducted to further experiments to quantify spine density on these ephrin-B3 heterozygous neurons in brain sections from MADM mice, which are now included in Figure 6. As expected, we found that, on average, spine density on the heterozygous neurons was in between that of wild-type and ephrin-B3 KO neurons.</p><p>This new data also sheds light on the reviewers’ second concern, namely the lack of a significant difference between ephrin-B3 KO neurons and wild-type neurons in control MADM mice. In ephrin-B3 MADM mice, wild-type neurons had significantly higher spine density than heterozygous neurons, while heterozygous neurons were not significantly different than ephrin-B3 knockout neurons (Figure 6C). This suggests that in terms of their ability to compete for synapses, ephrin-B3 heterozygous neurons may be closer to ephrin-B3 knockout neurons than wild-type neurons. If this is the case, the competitive advantage of wild-type neurons in the context of the ephrin-B3 heterozygous background would be greater than the disadvantage of the ephrin-B3 knockout neurons. This could explain why spine density on wild-type neurons within a heterozygous background is higher than in neurons in control MADM mice, but spine density on ephrin-B3 knockout neurons within a heterozygous background is not significantly lower than that of neurons in control MADM mice. This is now added to the eighth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
