Here, we analyzed Polycomb group protein (PcG) complex integrity in response to heat shock (HS). Upon HS, various Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC)1 and PRC2 subunits, including CBX proteins, but also other chromatin regulators, are found to accumulate in the nucleolus. In parallel, binding of PRC1/2 to target genes is strongly reduced, coinciding with a dramatic loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 marks. Nucleolar-accumulated CBX proteins are immobile, but remarkably both CBX protein accumulation and loss of PRC1/2 epigenetic marks are reversible. This post-heat shock recovery of pan-nuclear CBX protein localization and reinstallation of epigenetic marks is HSP70 dependent. Our findings demonstrate that the nucleolus is an essential protein quality control center, which is indispensable for recovery of epigenetic regulators and maintenance of the epigenome after heat shock.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45205.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All cells in our bodies contain the same sequence of DNA, hence the same genes, in a compartment called the nucleus. Yet different sets of genes are switched on in different types of cells. Cells achieve this by a process called epigenetic regulation. Proteins known as epigenetic regulators modify DNA and its associated proteins in ways that can turn genes on or off. Different types of cells contain different epigenetic regulators, and so express different genes. The Polycomb group proteins (or PcG for short) turn their target genes off and are important to maintain the identity of a cell. When the target genes of PcG proteins are inadvertently switched on, this may lead to changes in the fate of cells, potentially resulting in diseases such as cancer. So, it is important that cells keep the PcG proteins active where necessary, even in the face of stress.</p><p>Cellular stresses come in several forms but often interfere with the normal activities of proteins. If cells experience high temperatures, they can experience a stress known as heat shock. This can cause proteins, including PcG proteins, to unfold. Azkanaz et al. have now investigated what happens to PcG proteins in cells experiencing heat shock, and how these cells try to limit the damage this causes.</p><p>Azkanaz et al. conducted their experiments on healthy and cancerous human blood cells. After exposing the cells to half an hour of high temperature the PcG proteins disappeared from the genes they were switching off. This means that cells exposed to heat shock lose their epigenetic control machinery, which may lead to permanent changes to epigenetic modifications found across the genome when not quickly reinstalled. PcG proteins, and another group of proteins called the heat shock proteins, were found to move to a compartment within the nucleus called the nucleolus. While the cells had returned to body temperature and were recovering from the heat shock, the heat shock proteins helped the PcG proteins fold back into their proper shapes. The PcG proteins then left the nucleolus and returned to their target genes, where they reinstalled the epigenetic marks.</p><p>These experiments show that heat shock causes a temporary loss of epigenetic regulators from their target genes and that the nucleolus acts as a protein quality control center. Future experiments might explore how PcG proteins get to the nucleolus after heat shock and how impaired protein quality control (i.e. upon aging) may lead to alterations of the epigenetic landscape in a cell. Deeper knowledge of this process could help us to understand how cells can recover from stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Polycomb</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>heat shock</kwd><kwd>protein quality control</kwd><kwd>leukemia</kwd><kwd>nucleolus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>KWF Kankerbestrijding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RUG 2014-6832</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuringa</surname><given-names>Jan Jacob</given-names></name><name><surname>van den Boom</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Heat shock induces relocalization of epigenetic modifiers to the nucleolus, which acts as a dedicated protein quality control center that is indispensable for recovery of epigenetic regulators and epigenetic modifications.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The epigenetic landscape of a cell is fundamentally important for various DNA metabolic processes including gene transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tessarz and Kouzarides, 2014</xref>). Proper maintenance of the epigenome is essential for cell viability, and increasing evidence suggests that changes in the chromatin landscape are causally related to aging-associated functional decline of a cell and ultimately cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth and Brunet, 2016</xref>). Maintenance of the epigenetic landscape can only be guaranteed by correct positioning and activity of epigenetic modifiers across the genome, and may be threatened by proteotoxic stress. Importantly, misregulation of epigenetic modifiers (i.e. mutations, misexpression) is frequently observed in various cancer types, underlining that regulation of the epigenetic landscape is essential for appropriate cellular functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dawson and Kouzarides, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The Polycomb group (PcG) protein family of epigenetic modifiers warrants proper regulation of stem cell self-renewal and cell lineage specification. PcG proteins reside in the canonical Polycomb repressive complexes 1 (PRC1) and 2 (PRC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simon and Kingston, 2013</xref>). The PRC2 complex contains EZH1/2-dependent methyltransferase activity toward histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ezhkova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kirmizis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuzmichev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shen et al., 2008</xref>). PRC1 can ubiquitinate histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119), by means of its E3 ligase subunit RING1A/B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Napoles et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). PRC1 and PRC2 frequently colocalize at target genes and initially a hierarchical model was proposed for PRC1/2 function, where the CBX subunit of PRC1 recognizes the PRC2 mark H3K27me3, placing PRC1 function downstream of PRC2. However, recent studies have shown that PRC1 and PRC2 recruitment to chromatin, and associated histone modifying activities, can also be independent of each other (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackledge et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, non-canonical PRC1-deposited H2AK119ub was shown to independently sequester PRC2 complexes. Work from many labs, including ours, has underlined the importance of (non-)canonical PRC1 complexes for regulation of cellular identity of normal hematopoietic stem cells and leukemic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iwama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lessard and Sauvageau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rizo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rizo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rizo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van den Boom et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van den Boom et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore evident that preservation of Polycomb-mediated epigenetic regulation is essential to maintain cell identity and prevent cellular transformation and that, in case of cellular stress induced proteotoxicity, the functionality of the epigenetic machinery is guaranteed.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the stability of the epigenetic machinery in response to heat shock (HS). HS is known to lead to a general shutdown of transcription. Cellular stressors like HS and proteasome inhibition induce a quick depletion of the free ubiquitin pool and this coincides with a quick reduction of ubiquitinated histone H2A (H2AK119ub) in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlson and Rechsteiner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dantuma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mimnaugh et al., 1997</xref>). These data suggest that the epigenome may be affected by HS. A study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells indeed showed that HS leads to dramatic alterations of the 3D chromatin architecture as a consequence of weakening insulators between topologically associating domains (TADs) and newly formed architectural protein binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, Polycomb complexes were redistributed to active promoters/enhancers and formed inter-TAD interactions, likely resulting in transcriptional silencing.</p><p>For a subset of genes, however, in particular the genes encoding the heat-shock proteins (HSPs), HS does not cause a decrease but rather an increase in gene transcription. This response is referred to as the Heat Shock Response and mediated largely by the so-called Heat Shock Transcription factor-1 (HSF-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerfelt et al., 2010</xref>). HSPs function as molecular chaperones, not only guiding co-translational folding under normal conditions but also serving to refold heat-unfolded proteins. If proteins cannot be correctly refolded, they can be poly-ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Importantly, the intracellular pool of ‘free’ ubiquitin that is used for poly-ubiquitination of proteins is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlson and Rechsteiner, 1987</xref>). As such, HSPs prevent protein dysfunction and aggregation, a hallmark of various age-related neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kampinga and Bergink, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morimoto, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we specifically investigated the effects of HS on the epigenetic machinery and how this is restored upon return to physiological temperatures. We observed that PRC1 and PRC2 subunits and various other chromatin modifiers accumulate in the nucleolus upon HS. Various labs have reported on reversible accumulation of reporter-proteins in the nucleus upon heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nollen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2013</xref>), but whether this also holds true for endogenous proteins, and what could be the physiological relevance of this process, has remained unclear. We find that the nucleolar accumulation of these epigenetic regulators coincides with a displacement of PRC1 and PRC2 from their target genes and a dramatic loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3. Most importantly, the nucleolar accumulation is reversible in an HSP70-dependent manner allowing epigenetic recovery. Our data demonstrate that the nucleolus is an essential protein quality control (PQC) center that serves to restore the epigenomic landscape after conditions of proteotoxic stress in an HSP-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Heat shock induces nucleolar localization of CBX proteins</title><p>To investigate the effects of thermal stress on the epigenetic machinery, we analyzed the localization of PRC1 subunits in response to heat shock (HS). We transduced cord blood CD34<sup>+</sup> stem/progenitor cells using a GFP-CBX2 lentiviral vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, GFP pull out experiments in K562 GFP-CBX2 cells confirmed that GFP-CBX2 was properly incorporated in the PRC1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and ChIP-seq experiments in K562 GFP-CBX2 and K562 wild-type cells showed that GFP-CBX2 target genes largely overlapped with endogenous CBX2 target genes (based on ENCODE/Broad Institute data) and H2AK119ub enriched genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van den Boom et al., 2016</xref>). These data underline that the GFP-CBX2 fusion protein is incorporated into a fully functional PRC1 complex. Next, we studied the localization of GFP-CBX2 in untreated and heat shocked cord blood CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. Whereas GFP-CBX2 was homogenously distributed throughout the nucleus in untreated cells, cells that received a HS (30 min, 44°C) displayed strong accumulations of GFP-CBX2 in subnuclear domains, both in cells that were fixed after HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, K562 leukemic cells also showed HS-induced relocalization of GFP-CBX2 to subnuclear domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Transmission images suggested that HS induces relocalization of GFP-CBX2 to nucleoli, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence analyses using antibodies against the nucleolar proteins NPM1 and Fibrillarin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). GFP-CBX2 localized directly around Fibrillarin, which is confined to the dense fibrillar component (DFC) of the nucleolus, and partially colocalized with the granular component (GC) protein NPM1. Taken together, these data suggest that GFP-CBX2 is most enriched in the granular component of the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boisvert et al., 2007</xref>). The kinetics of HS-induced nucleolar accumulation of GFP-CBX2 were both dependent on the duration and temperature of the HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>). Cells exposed to a temperature of 42°C also displayed nucleolar localization of GFP-CBX2 albeit with slower kinetics.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45205.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Heat shock induces nucleolar relocalization of CBX proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical representation of the pRRL SFFV GFP-CBX2 lentiviral vector that was used in this study.

Based on these data, we hypothesized that a common domain in these proteins is sufficient for HS-induced nucleolar accumulation. Since the homology between these various CBX proteins is confined to the chromodomain (N-terminus) and Pc box (C-terminus), we generated GFP-CBX2 and GFP-CBX8 fusions only containing the chromobox (GFP-CBX2 [2-63]) or the chromobox and AT hook (GFP-CBX2 [2-96]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

Whereas initially considered as heat-induced damage, several lines of independent observations have suggested that this might rather reflect a regulated, HSP-dependent process in which the nucleolus serves as a temporal storage site for unfolded proteins during proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nollen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohtsuka et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Welch and Feramisco, 1984</xref>).

Subsequently, we analyzed proteins that were up or down in the nucleolus after HS. MaxQuant-based label-free quantification of two independent experiments measured in triplicate resulted in the identification of 153 significantly enriched proteins in the nucleolus after HS and six depleted proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>).

In addition to these PcG proteins, many other chromatin and transcription regulating proteins were found to be enriched in the nucleolus after HS, including members of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family and the FACT chromatin remodeling complex that both can remodel chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marfella and Imbalzano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Winkler and Luger, 2011</xref>), and the PAF complex, which regulates release of RNAPII into processive elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Oss et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Indeed, we also observed a strong decrease in H2AK119ub levels after HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, H3K27me3 levels were also significantly reduced in heat-shocked cells vs. control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These data show that HS not only causes displacement of PRC1/2 complexes but also leads to a reduction of their respective epimarks. To assay HS-induced loss of PRC1 chromatin binding in a genome-wide manner, we performed ChIP-seq of both endogenous CBX8 (K562 cells) and GFP-CBX2 (K562 GFP-CBX2 cells) in untreated cells or after HS. Heat maps and band plots of CBX8 and GFP-CBX2 peaks clearly showed a loss of CBX8 and GFP-CBX2 chromatin binding after HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary files 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">5</xref>).

Clearly, also here a loss of CBX8 and GFP-CBX2 chromatin association is observed upon HS. TSS-localized peaks are associated to genes enriched for development-related GO terms, confirming that these are Polycomb target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Typical examples of chromatin regions that show a reduction of CBX8 or GFP-CBX2 chromatin binding are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>. Next, we analyzed HS-induced changes of other epigenetic modifications. Here we find that, in addition to loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3, after HS (1 hr, 44°C) also H3K4me3 levels are reduced, and, likely as a consequence of H3K4me3 loss, H3K4me1 levels are increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). The increase in H3K4me1 levels argues that loss of epimarks is not a mere consequence of decreased nucleosome occupancy but truly a consequence of changes in the epigenetic marking of the chromatin. Finally, we investigated whether the HS-induced loss of PRC1/2-associated epimarks also resulted in loss of silencing of Polycomb target genes. Indeed, we found that the expression of various Polycomb target genes was increased 3 hr after HS, and recovered to pre-HS levels afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Taken together, these data show that, in parallel to the reallocation of chromatin remodelers and transcriptional regulators to the nucleolus, HS induces a quick reduction in PRC1 and PRC2 chromatin binding and changes in the epigenetic profile of PcG target genes with consequences for the transcriptional state of these genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Altered GFP-CBX2 protein dynamics in the nucleolus upon HS</title><p>Next, we aimed to determine the physical-dynamic properties of PcG in the nucleoli of heat shocked cells.

Analysis of the intra-nucleolar dynamics of GFP-CBX2 in heat shocked cells using FRAP/FLIP (fluorescence loss in photobleaching) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), revealed that there was very little fluorescence recovery in the bleached region and fluorescence loss in the adjacent nucleolar region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>), indicating that GFP-CBX2 might be present in these nucleoli in a more solid-like state. Proteins in similar solid states have been shown to be aggregated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patel et al., 2015</xref>). To discriminate between a liquid-like or solid state of CBX protein accumulations, we exposed heat shocked K562 GFP-CBX2 and K562 GFP-CBX8 cells to 1,6-hexanediol, an aliphatic alcohol that disturbs weak hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel et al., 2007</xref>).

In addition, we argued that the co-appearance of HSPs in these nucleoli may be required to recover these regulators from their solid-like, aggregated state. Certain mammalian HSPs have been demonstrated to be able to disentangle protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mogk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nillegoda et al., 2018</xref>), including the HSPs (DNAJB1 and HSP70) that we identified as part of the nucleolar proteome after heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). To test the reversibility of nucleolar GFP-CBX2 accumulations after HS, we treated K562 GFP-CBX2 cells with a HS (30 min, 44°C) and monitored GFP-CBX2 localization at 37°C afterwards. Clearly, within 3 hr after HS the GFP-CBX2 nucleolar accumulations dispersed and GFP-CBX2 regained its original pan-nuclear distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), showing that nucleolar accumulations of PcG proteins are readily reversible. Similarly, and in line with our cellular fraction data and LC-MS/MS data, we also observed a reversible HS-induced nucleolar accumulation of DNAJB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, also HSP70 showed post-HS nuclear translocation, and localized to the nucleolus in a reversible fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Accumulation of HSP70 in the nucleolus was not as prominent as observed for DNAJB1, which is in line with our LC-MS/MS data, and may be a consequence of other nuclear activities of HSP70. Next, we investigated whether drug-induced inhibition of the HSP70 machinery using the HSP70 inhibitor VER-155008 would impact on the relocalization of PcG proteins to the nucleolus or would delay recovery of GFP-CBX2 from the nucleolus after HS. Clearly, post-HS nucleolar accumulation was not impaired upon HSP70 inhibition, suggesting that the HSP70 machinery is not involved in chaperoning PcG proteins to the nucleolus after HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, HSP70 inhibition led to a clear delay in recovery of GFP-CBX2 from the nucleoli suggesting that HSP70 activity is required to resolve the nucleolar accumulation of GFP-CBX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Similarly, a partial knockdown of HSPA1A, an abundant heat-inducible HSP70 family member in human cells and identical to HSPA1B at the protein level, resulted in a significant delay of GFP-CBX2 recovery from the nucleoli in HEK293T GFP-CBX2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Next, we investigated whether induction of endogenous HSPs accelerates GFP-CBX2 recovery after HS. K562 GFP-CBX2 cells were treated with two consecutive HSs with a 3-hr interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). HS is known to induce HSP expression (including several HSP70s), resulting in a period of increased thermotolerance. This cellular property allowed us to compare the kinetics of GFP-CBX2 recovery in the presence of basal or HS-induced HSP levels. Indeed, whereas recovery of GFP-CBX2 after the first HS required almost 3 hr, recovery after the second HS was almost completed within 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Importantly, the amount of GFP-CBX2 that initially accumulated during the first or second HS did not change dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). This implies that increased HSP levels specifically affect the recovery of GFP-CBX2 proteins from the solid phase within the nucleolus. Next, we tested whether the kinetics of recovery of GFP-CBX2 from the nucleolus and epigenetic recovery after HS were similar. Indeed, we found that H2AK119ub was completely recovered at 4 hr after HS, whereas H3K27me3 recovery was slightly delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). At later time points after HS we observed a complete recovery of GFP-CBX2 and various epigenetic modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, H2AK119ub recovery was strongly dependent on HSP protein expression. Thermotolerant cells that received a second HS displayed a much faster recovery of H2AK119ub compared to cells after the first HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). In line with our ChIP-qPCR data, H3K27me3 was also reduced albeit with slower kinetics. Both HSP70 and DNAJB1 were strongly induced upon the first HS, whereas EZH2 and CBX8 protein levels were rather stable or slightly reduced. Next, we investigated whether post-HS H2AK119ub recovery is dependent on Polycomb proteins that are recovered from the nucleolus and not merely on newly translated Polycomb proteins. Therefore, we pre-treated K562 cells for 1 hr with cycloheximide or DMSO and studied H2AK119ub recovery after HS. Importantly, H2AK119ub recovery did not depend on de novo protein synthesis as H2AK119ub levels also recovered in cycloheximide-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Taken together, these data show that molecular chaperones are crucial for recovery of GFP-CBX2 from the nucleolus and that this activity is essential for epigenetic recovery after HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45205.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Post-HS nucleolar recovery of CBX proteins and epigenetic recovery depends on heat-shock protein activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Percentage of cells with nucleolar accumulation of GFP-CBX2 during recovery at 37°C after HS (30 min, 44°C).

At the same time, this ‘storage’ may allow for rapid recovery of proteins to re-initiate the crucial processes they are normally engaged in. For the nucleolus, these experiments have been done with reporter proteins, without any direct connection to physiological cellular processes. Despite this drawback, these studies revealed that HS-induced redistribution to the nucleolus is important for both refolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nollen et al., 2001</xref>) or degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2013</xref>) of these reporters. Our data are the first to show that numerous endogenous chromatin regulators temporarily accumulate in the nucleolus upon a HS, and, in an HSP70-dependent manner, fully and functionally recover to the chromatin upon return to physiological temperatures.</p><p>At this stage, we do not know what drives the association of the various PcG proteins to the nucleolus upon HS. Given the protein denaturation effects of HS, (partial) protein unfolding is likely a key driver of protein relocalization to the nucleolus. Whether it is unfolding of nucleolar proteins that cause retention of PcG proteins or actually partial unfolding of PcG proteins (or both) remains to be elucidated. Data from Audas and colleagues showed that a ncRNA, arising from intergenic stretches in between ribosomal DNA repeats, is capable of sequestering and immobilizing various proteins in the nucleolus upon acidosis or HS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Audas et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively or in parallel, heat-unfolded nuclear reporter proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nollen et al., 2001</xref>) or cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2013</xref>) have been reported to accumulate in the nucleolus via chaperoned transport. Whilst we cannot exclude this possibility here, the appearance of PcG proteins in the nucleolus were independent of the HSP70 machinery. However, like in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nollen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Welch and Feramisco, 1984</xref>), we did find significant enrichment of HSP70 family members, and co-chaperones such as DNAJB1 and HSPB1, in the nucleolus after HS. We also show that both HSPA1A/HSP70 knockdown and inhibiting HSP70 activity result in a significant delay of GFP-CBX2 recovery from the nucleolus, whereas elevated HSP70 expression accelerates the reallocation of PcG proteins to the chromatin.</p><p>Whereas the nucleolus is a membrane-less organelle with liquid-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marko, 2012</xref>), our finding that post-HS GFP-CBX2 accumulations are 1,6-hexanediol insensitive, suggest that it is present in the nucleolus in a more solid phase. This could relate to the requirement of an active HSP70 machinery for its re-solubilization upon recovery. In fact, both HSP70 and DNAJB1 that accumulate in the nucleolus are crucial components of chaperone machines with protein disaggregation power capable of functionally solubilizing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mogk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nillegoda et al., 2018</xref>). It is important to note that the functional recovery of epigenetic control was not dependent on de novo synthesis of the PcG proteins. Translation inhibition did not interfere with this H2AK119ub recovery, suggesting that a least a large fraction of nucleolar PcG proteins are re-solubilized and functionally refolded. In addition, a fraction of the nucleolar accumulated proteins may be targeted for proteasomal degradation supported by the HS-induced nucleolar enrichment of the 26S proteasome that we found. In line with these data, a link between the proteasome and the nucleolus was previously suggested and proteasome inhibition leads to nucleolar accumulation of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arabi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fátyol and Grummt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Latonen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, also other types of stress such as transcription inhibition, DNA damage induction and viral infection, have been shown to cause major changes in the protein composition of the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boisvert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emmott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lam et al., 2010</xref>). However, whereas HS mainly induced accumulation of proteins in the nucleolus, transcription inhibition using actinomycin D resulted in a release of ribosomal proteins and RNA processing factors and an increase of snRNP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which similarly to HS leads to proteotoxic stress, led to an increase in ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2005</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the nucleolus could be an important protein quality control center serving under many different stress conditions.</p><p>Proteotoxic stress-induced loss of H2AK119ub has previously been observed by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlson and Rechsteiner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dantuma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mimnaugh et al., 1997</xref>), and it has been proposed that the reason for this loss is the urgent need for ‘free’ ubiquitin in cells post-HS. Our data suggests that HS-induced redistribution of PcG proteins to the nucleolus has direct implications for histone marking and is not limited to H2AK119ub, but also affects H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 levels at PcG target genes. Other studies have also shown HS-induced loss of H3K27Ac from HS-repressed enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) and changes in the 3D chromatin structure and epigenetic landscape in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In this latter study, the authors observed a moderate localization of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Polycomb (Pc) protein to the nucleolus upon HS. Although ribosomal DNA transcription in the nucleolus was strongly reduced upon HS, Pc binding to ribosomal DNA repeats was not increased, suggesting that Pc is not involved in repressing ribosomal DNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas our HS-induced CBX protein accumulation in the nucleolus is more robust, we did not observe an increase in rDNA binding by CBX8 (data not shown). We also did not find increased H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub levels in the nucleolus after HS suggesting that accumulating PRC1 and PRC2 subunits are functionally inactive. Together these findings contradict a hypothetical chromatin regulatory activity of PRC1/2 in the nucleolus after HS but rather suggest that their respective subunits are undergoing protein quality control.</p><p>Taken together, our data shows that HS directly affects chromatin binding of PcG proteins and results in a decrease of PcG-related epigenetic modifications. Importantly, HSP70-dependent protein disaggregation and refolding enables PcG proteins to quickly re-initiate their epigenetic functions at target genes. It is evident that quick re-installation of PcG epimarks is key to maintain proper epigenetic regulation of PcG target genes. The question remains how often cells will erroneously ‘repair’ the epigenetic profile after stress-induced epigenetic instability. Despite the fact that the majority of epimarks may be properly reinstalled, mistakes will result in epigenetic scars, which may contribute to cellular transformation, loss of cell function and ultimately cell death. Various studies have shown that alterations in transcriptional and epigenetic regulation are major contributors to aging-associated loss of cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth and Brunet, 2016</xref>). Based on our data, it is tempting to speculate that cellular-stress-induced epigenetic changes may contribute to age-associated epigenetic alterations. Importantly, it has been shown that the molecular chaperone system of a cell displays age-associated functional decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klaips et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>). This may well trigger age- or disease-associated reduction in protein quality control of epigenetic regulators, including PcG proteins, leading to alterations in the epigenome.</p><p>We propose a model where HS leads to loss of chromatin binding and nucleolar accumulation of PcG proteins and various other epigenetic regulators, likely as a consequence of protein unfolding. Loss of PcG chromatin binding leads to a loss of PRC1/2-related epigenetic modifications which recovery depends on HSP70 activity in the nucleolus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CCL-243 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0004">CVCL_0004</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HL60</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CCL-240 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0002">CVCL_0002</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HeLa</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CCL-2 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0030">CVCL_0030</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-3216 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>pRRL SFFV GFP-CBX2</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van den Boom et al., 2016</xref>; PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26748712">26748712</ext-link></td><td/><td>Lentivirally transduced in K562, HeLa and HEK293T, stable cell lines</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>PC182 GFP-CBX4</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vandamme et al.

To measure protein mobility after HS, cells were first heat shocked (30 min, 44°C), followed by FRAP analysis at 37°C. To perform FRAP experiments first the subnuclear location of nucleoli was identified using a transmission image. Next, a region of interest covering the whole nucleolus (in the case of FRAP experiments), or half the nucleolus (FRAP/FLIP) was defined. For FRAP/FLIP experiments the opposite side of the nucleolus was selected to measure the FLIP signal. The FRAP region was bleached for five iterations at the highest intensity of the 488 nm line of a 25 mW argon laser focused by a EC Plan-Neofluar 40x/1.30 Oil DIC M27 lens (Carl Zeiss Microcopy). Recovery of fluorescence was monitored at 1 s intervals at 0.5% of the laser intensity used for bleaching. For generation of FRAP and FLIP curves the background signal was subtracted from the measured fluorescent intensities and subsequently normalized to prebleach levels. Finally, the mean and standard deviation were plotted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>siRNA-mediated HSP70 knockdown</title><p>For HSPA1A/HSP70 knockdown, HEK293T GFP-CBX2 cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine coated coverslips, and the next day mock or HSPA1A/HSP70 siRNAs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

End repair was performed using the precipitated DNA using Klenow and T4 PNK. A 3’ protruding A base was generated using Taq polymerase and adapters were ligated. The DNA was loaded on gel and a band corresponding to ~ 300 bp (ChIP fragment + adapters) was excised. The DNA was isolated, amplified by PCR and used for cluster generation on the Illumina NextSeq 500 genome analyzer. The 50 bp tags were mapped to the human genome HG19 using BWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). For processing and manipulation of SAM/BAM files SAMtools was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2009</xref>). For each base pair in the genome, the number of overlapping sequence reads was determined and averaged over a 10 bp window and visualized in the UCSC genome browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kent et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Detection of enriched regions</title><p>Peak calling algorithm MACS was used to detect the binding sites at a q-value cut off for peak detection of 0.01.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Azkanaz et al. presents a thorough and convincing study on how Polycomb repressive complexes redistribute from chromatin to the nucleolus during heat shock. This redistribution is temporally coincident with reduced binding of polycomb proteins and the loss of epigenetic marks on H2AK119ub and H3K27me3. Loss of these marks is then correlates with the silencing of PRC1/2 target genes. Interestingly, while these Polycomb complexes are present within the nucleolus upon heat shock, FRAP/FLIP assays show the nucleolus acquires a more solid state versus its more fluidic state as seen under normal growth conditions. Upon recovery from heat shock, the PRC 1/2 and their associated CBX proteins leave the nucleolus, and the authors suggest that this is dependent on HSP70. Polycomb proteins associate again with chromatin, thus re-establishing their epigenetic marks. The authors suggest the nucleolus functions as a protein quality control center during times of stress (heat shock). The topic is timely, the manuscript is well written and figures are well presented. With several revisions (as outlined below), this manuscript should be suitable for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main, overarching concern is that this study is heavily relies on the overexpression of GFP-tagged proteins and thus it is not possible to establish which part of the fusion protein, or whether an artificial high level of expression, is responsible for the reported effects. This is partly tackled with experiments included in Figure 3, showing that endogenous Polycomb proteins accumulate in the nucleolus upon heat shock by proteomics. However, it would be required to perform additional immunofluorescence of endogenous Polycomb proteins to demonstrate nucleolar accumulation of endogenous proteins (at normal cellular levels) upon heat shock.</p><p>To accomplish this goal, the authors are requested to consider the following:</p><p>a) Given that most data rely on cell lines expressing GFP-CBX fusions, the authors should explain how they concluded that these proteins are fully functional. Functionality of at least the GFP-CBX2 fusion should be solidly established.</p><p>b) Experiments are carried out mainly in one leukemic cell line and thus it is not possible to rule out that nucleolar accumulation of Polycomb proteins is a cell type-specific phenomenon. Proof that endogenous Polycomb proteins accumulate in the nucleolus upon heat shock in a different cell model would increase the impact and value of the study. Primary non-transformed cells would be best.</p><p>c) The authors should conclusively demonstrate that the PRC1/2 and associated regulators are enriching within the granular components of nucleoli rather than in peri-nucleolar spaces. There is some confusion among the reviewers as to why DAPI should stain nucleoli in Figure 2D. Could this be chromatin that has accumulated in per-nucleolar spaces under stress conditions? Additional immunofluorescence using marker proteins for the granular component (e.g., Nucleostemin) should be performed.</p><p>2) In Figure 3D, are you saying SUZ12 rises in nucleolar abundance upon heat shock? Its nucleolar abundance seems rather modest. This should be clarified.</p><p>3) In many of the experiments, standard deviations were provided when n=2. When there are only 2 replicates, the range should be reported, not standard deviation. Please update all figures.</p><p>4) The authors claim that recovery of CBX proteins is dependent on HSP70. However, they present very weak lines of evidence to support this link. At least, authors should present confocal analysis to study colocalization of Polycomb proteins and HSP70 upon heat shock and during recovery. Also, proof of reduced reversibility could be presented in a genetic loss of function experiment.</p><p>5) There are also several places in the manuscript that were deemed unclear, and where editing and/or clarification is recommended.</p><p>a) In the Introduction (second paragraph) is the PRC1 complex dependent on the PRC2 complex? This portion of the Introduction was not too clear.</p><p>b) The final sentence of paragraph two in subsection “HS induces large-scale changes in the nucleolar proteome” should be re-written for improved clarity.</p><p>c) Subsection “HS alters Polycomb complex binding and the epigenetic state at target genes”, and Figure 4 legend: are these K562 cells?</p><p>d) Paragraph two of subsection “HS alters Polycomb complex binding and the epigenetic state at target genes” could be edited just for clarity: the loss of the PRC complexes from the chromatin during heat shock does not explain global genome silencing doing heat shock, correct?</p><p>e) In Figure 4J and paragraph two of subsection “HS alters Polycomb complex binding and the epigenetic state at target genes”, as H3K4me3 declines and H3K4me1 rises, can I assume H3K4me3 is losing two methyl groups to give rise to H3K4me1?</p><p>f) The first sentence of paragraph two in subsection “Altered GFP-CBX2 protein dynamics in the nucleolus upon HS” could be written: &quot;The nucleolus is a membrane-less nuclear body with liquid-like properties; its formation depends…&quot; Related to this, do the authors have any speculation on what makes nucleoli more solid upon heat shock? I thought this was very interesting.</p><p>g) The statement “Thermotolerant cells that received a second HS displayed a much faster recovery of H2AK119ub compared to cells after the first HS (Figure 6H). Importantly, H2AK119ub recovery did not depend on de novo protein synthesis as H2AK119ub levels also recovered in cycloheximide treated cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B)” in the Results were confusing until I read the third paragraph in the Discussion. Perhaps the authors could better explain in the Results why they blocked protein synthesis with cycloheximide and exactly when the drug was added with respect to heat shock.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45205.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main, overarching concern is that this study is heavily relies on the overexpression of GFP-tagged proteins and thus it is not possible to establish which part of the fusion protein, or whether an artificial high level of expression, is responsible for the reported effects.

To address this, we have included new data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 where we now show, by means of GFP pull-outs, that GFP-CBX2 is properly incorporated in the PRC1 complex (panel A), and that GFP-CBX2 target genes largely overlap with endogenous CBX2 target genes (based on ENCODE/Broad Institute data; Ram et al., 2011) and H2AK119ub enriched genes (our own data from Van den Boom et al., 2016). In Van den Boom et al. (2016), we also performed independent ChIP-seq analysis on K562 GFP-CBX2 cells and found that over 96% of the identified GFP-CBX2 target genes were also targeted by GFP-RING1B in K562 GFP-RING1B cells. Taken together, these data show that the GFP-tag does not impair the integration of GFP-CBX2 into the PRC1 complex and does not prevent GFP-CBX2 chromatin binding to sites that largely overlap with sites occupied by endogenous CBX2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Experiments are carried out mainly in one leukemic cell line and thus it is not possible to rule out that nucleolar accumulation of Polycomb proteins is a cell type-specific phenomenon. Proof that endogenous Polycomb proteins accumulate in the nucleolus upon heat shock in a different cell model would increase the impact and value of the study. Primary non-transformed cells would be best.</p></disp-quote><p>To study accumulation of endogenous Polycomb proteins, we used antibodies directed against CBX4 and EZH2 that worked efficiently in fluorescence microscopy experiments. We also tried several anti-CBX2 antibodies but these did not yield good signals. Confocal analysis of endogenous CBX4 clearly displays HS-induced accumulation in the nucleolus, both in K562 cells (Figure 1H) and HL60 cells (leukemic cell line, Figure 1—figure supplement 2G), in line with data we observed for GFP-CBX4 (Figure 1F). We have also included confocal images showing HS-induced nucleolar accumulation of endogenous EZH2 in HL60 cells, K562 cells, and primary non-transformed CD34<sup>+</sup> peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A-C). Finally, we have added an additional cellular fractionation study where we isolated nucleoli from HL60 cells (Figure 2G and Figure 3D). Also in HL60 cells we observe a robust nucleolar accumulation of endogenous CBX4, CBX8, RING1B, EZH2 and SUZ12 upon HS.</p><p>Taken together, these data clearly show that endogenous Polycomb proteins also accumulate in nucleoli after HS and that this behavior is observed in multiple cell types, including HL60 cells and primary non-transformed CD34<sup>+</sup> mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (mPBSCs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The authors should conclusively demonstrate that the PRC1/2 and associated regulators are enriching within the granular components of nucleoli rather than in peri-nucleolar spaces. There is some confusion among the reviewers as to why DAPI should stain nucleoli in Figure 2D. Could this be chromatin that has accumulated in per-nucleolar spaces under stress conditions? Additional immunofluorescence using marker proteins for the granular component (e.g., Nucleostemin) should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>To further specify the subnucleolar localization of Polycomb proteins upon HS we have now included NPM1 as a marker for the granular layer of nucleoli. Confocal images of K562 cells stained with NPM1 and Fibrillarin antibodies (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B) clearly shows that, as expected, NPM1 is localized around Fibrillarin in the nucleolus (untreated and heat shocked). Confocal and fluorescence microcopy analysis of heat shocked K562 GFP-CBX2 cells co-stained with NPM1 antibody shows that GFP-CBX2 is mostly colocalizing with NPM1 in the granular layer or is surrounded by the NPM1 staining (Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 2C-D), underlining the fact that GFP-CBX2 truly accumulates in the nucleolus upon heat shock.</p><p>Concerning the DAPI signal in the isolated nucleoli in Figure 2D: we acknowledge that the intra-nucleolar DAPI signal indeed is lower than in the surrounding chromatin, but still stains the nucleoli due to the presence of genomic DNA in the form of rDNA repeats. Due to the lack of intense extranucleolar DAPI signal this may now be picked up more easily in the nucleolar preparations. In line with our findings, in a recent study in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> cells, purified and FACS sorted nucleoli were stained DAPI positive (Pontvianne et al., 2016). Importantly, the intranucleolar DAPI signal is not dependent on a stress condition since the signal is equal to that of nucleoli isolated from untreated cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3D, are you saying SUZ12 rises in nucleolar abundance upon heat shock? Its nucleolar abundance seems rather modest. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our LC-MS/MS data and Western blot analysis of cellular fractions, we indeed conclude that SUZ12 also enriches in the nucleoli of K562 cells. We have now included cellular fractionation data of untreated and heat shocked HL60 cells that show an even more robust accumulation of SUZ12 in the nucleolar fraction upon HS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In many of the experiments, standard deviations were provided when n=2. When there are only 2 replicates, the range should be reported, not standard deviation. Please update all figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the figures and legends accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim that recovery of CBX proteins is dependent on HSP70. However, they present very weak lines of evidence to support this link. At least, authors should present confocal analysis to study colocalization of Polycomb proteins and HSP70 upon heat shock and during recovery. Also, proof of reduced reversibility could be presented in a genetic loss of function experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>This is also an important point made by the reviewers. We have now included confocal images of K562 GFP-CBX2 cells (untreated, directly after HS, 3h after HS) stained with antibodies directed against either DNAJB1 or HSP70 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B). These experiments clearly show a nucleolar accumulation of DNAJB1 after HS, which is lost from the nucleoli in time after HS. Importantly, cells that show a recovery of GFP-CBX2 from the nucleoli 3h after HS also do not display DNAJB1 accumulation in the nucleolus anymore, suggesting that the kinetics of nuclear recovery for both proteins are very similar. Also for HSP70, which is excluded from the nucleoli in untreated cells, we observe a HS-induced nuclear translocation and a loss of nucleolar exclusion. Upon recovery of GPF-CBX2 from of the nucleoli in time after HS, we also find that HSP70 is again excluded from the nucleoli. The nucleolar accumulation of DNAJB1 is more prominent than that of HSP70, which is in line with our LC-MS/MS data, and may be a consequence of the requirement of HSP70 in other nuclear processes.</p><p>To test whether in an HSP70 loss-of-function setting nucleolar recovery of GFP-CBX2 is slowed down, we have stably expressed GFP-CBX2 in HEK293T cells and transfected these with mock siRNAs or HSPA1A/HSP70 siRNAs (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-E). Clearly, in cells depleted of HSP70, a significantly delay in recovery of GFP-CBX2 from the nucleolus was seen.</p><p>Taken together, our previous and newly added data now show that after HS (i) HSP proteins accumulate in the nucleolus, (ii) the kinetics of HSP70/DNAJB1 recovery of nucleolar accumulation after HS resemble that of GFP-CBX2, (iii) HSP70 inhibition and partial HSPA1A/HSP70 knockdown both delay GFP-CBX2 nucleolar recovery, and (iv) HS-induced upregulation of HSP expression (thermal tolerance) accelerates GFP-CBX2 recovery.</p><p>Importantly, HSPA1A is the most abundant HSP70 family member expressed in human cells. However, since the HSPA1A and HSPA1B gene products are identical at the protein level, we cannot distinguish between both proteins in our LC-MS/MS analysis. Therefore, for reasons of clarity, we have changed in our Volcano plots HSPA1B to HSPA1A/B (Figure 3H, Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, Figure 3—figure supplement 4D). In the main body of the text we refer to these proteins as HSP70.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There are also several places in the manuscript that were deemed unclear, and where editing and/or clarification is recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>We edited our manuscript and clarified the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) In the Introduction (second paragraph) is the PRC1 complex dependent on the PRC2 complex? This portion of the Introduction was not too clear.</p></disp-quote><p>This section has been rewritten and clarified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The final sentence of paragraph two in subsection “HS induces large-scale changes in the nucleolar proteome” should be re-written for improved clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>This section has been rewritten and clarified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Subsection “HS alters Polycomb complex binding and the epigenetic state at target genes”, and Figure 4 legend: are these K562 cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is now explicitly mentioned in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Paragraph two of subsection “HS alters Polycomb complex binding and the epigenetic state at target genes” could be edited just for clarity: the loss of the PRC complexes from the chromatin during heat shock does not explain global genome silencing doing heat shock, correct?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, loss of PRC1/2 complexes from the target genes does not induce gene silencing upon heat shock. We have now included expression data of a selected set of Polycomb target genes (Figure 4K), which shows that transcription of these genes is actually temporarily increased 3h after HS and recovered to normal at later time points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) In Figure 4J and paragraph two of subsection “HS alters Polycomb complex binding and the epigenetic state at target genes”, as H3K4me3 declines and H3K4me1 rises, can I assume H3K4me3 is losing two methyl groups to give rise to H3K4me1?</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed assume that increase of H3K4me1 is a direct consequence of loss of H3K4me3, we have made this more explicit in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) The first sentence of paragraph two in subsection “Altered GFP-CBX2 protein dynamics in the nucleolus upon HS” could be written: &quot;The nucleolus is a membrane-less nuclear body with liquid-like properties; its formation depends…&quot; Related to this, do the authors have any speculation on what makes nucleoli more solid upon heat shock? I thought this was very interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the text accordingly. The immobilization of GFP-CBX2 in the nucleoli after HS is indeed fascinating. As we do not have any experimental data as to what is the cause of this immobilization, we have not included these speculations in the main text of the manuscript. However, it could be that partial unfolding of proteins causes them to have a strong increase in intranucleolar interaction with a very low dissociation constant. Whether this is due to a specific interaction with nucleolar components or as a consequence of the formation of molecular aggregates remains to be seen and is a focus for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) The statement “Thermotolerant cells that received a second HS displayed a much faster recovery of H2AK119ub compared to cells after the first HS (Figure 6H).

Perhaps the authors could better explain in the Results why they blocked protein synthesis with cycloheximide and exactly when the drug was added with respect to heat shock.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text accordingly and moved the rationale for this experiment to the Results section.</p><p>References:</p><p>Pontvianne F, Carpentier MC, Durut N2 Pavlištová V, Jaške K, Schořová Š, Parrinello H, Rohmer M, Pikaard CS, Fojtová M, Fajkus J, Sáez-Vásquez J. <italic>Identification of Nucleolus-Associated Chromatin Domains Reveals a Role for the Nucleolus in 3D Organization of the A. thaliana Genome.</italic> Cell Rep. 2016. 16(6):1574-1587. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2016.07.016.</p><p>Ram O1, Goren A, Amit I, Shoresh N, Yosef N, Ernst J, Kellis M, Gymrek M, Issner R, Coyne M, Durham T, Zhang X, Donaghey J, Epstein CB, Regev A, Bernstein BE.
