However, the specific defects that lead to hearing loss have not been described. Using a zebrafish model of DFNB63, we show that the auditory and vestibular phenotypes are due to a lack of mechanotransduction (MET) in Tomt-deficient hair cells. GFP-tagged Tomt is enriched in the Golgi of hair cells, suggesting that Tomt might regulate the trafficking of other MET components to the hair bundle. We found that Tmc1/2 proteins are specifically excluded from the hair bundle in <italic>tomt</italic> mutants, whereas other MET complex proteins can still localize to the bundle. Furthermore, mouse TOMT and TMC1 can directly interact in HEK 293 cells, and this interaction is modulated by His183 in TOMT. Thus, we propose a model of MET complex assembly where Tomt and the Tmcs interact within the secretory pathway to traffic Tmc proteins to the hair bundle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28474.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28474.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>hair cells</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>transmembrane channel-like proteins</kwd><kwd>tomt</kwd><kwd>deafness</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC013572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicolson</surname><given-names>Teresa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 DC013531</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicolson</surname><given-names>Teresa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102892</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcotti</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC002368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nechiporuk</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name><name><surname>Barr-Gillespie</surname><given-names>Peter G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30DC005983</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barr-Gillespie</surname><given-names>Peter G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A zebrafish model for a particular form of human deafness (DFNB63) changes our view of this disease by revealing a defect in the localization of Transmembrane channel-like proteins that are essential for mechanotransduction in sensory cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) is the process by which sensory hair cells convert mechanical force such as auditory and vestibular stimuli into electrical signals. The mechanosensitive organelle of the hair cell is the hair bundle, an apical collection of actin-filled stereocilia arranged in a staircase fashion. These stereocilia are tethered by interciliary links, including a <italic>trans</italic> heteromeric complex of Cadherin 23 (CDH23) - Protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) called the tip link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kazmierczak et al., 2007</xref>). One potential location of the MET channel complex is at the lower end of the tip link where PCDH15 resides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beurg et al., 2009</xref>). A commonly accepted model of hair-cell mechanotransduction postulates that excitatory deflections of the bundle towards the tallest stereocilia will tension the tip links, thereby transferring the mechanical force to the associated MET channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corey and Hudspeth, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pickles et al., 1984</xref>). How the MET channel complex is assembled to transduce mechanical stimuli is largely unknown.</p><p>Our current understanding is that the MET channel complex is composed of the tip link protein PCDH15, and the transmembrane proteins lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5), transmembrane inner ear (TMIE), and transmembrane channel-like proteins (TMC1Â andÂ TMC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beurg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurima et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Although conclusive evidence is still lacking, the TMCs are currently the most promising candidates for the pore-forming subunit of the MET channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corey and Holt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu and MullerMÃ¼ller, 2016</xref>). TMC proteins are present at the site of mechanotransduction at the stereocilia tips of hair bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beurg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurima et al., 2015</xref>) and can interact directly with PCDH15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beurg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>). In humans, mutations in <italic>TMC1</italic> are responsible for both recessive (DFNB7/11) and dominant (DFNA36) forms of nonsyndromic deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurima et al., 2002</xref>). In mice, <italic>Tmc1/2</italic> double knockouts have no conventional MET current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>). Several lines of evidence support the idea that TMC1/2 are the candidate pore-forming subunits of the MET channel. Hair cells expressing either <italic>TMC1</italic> or <italic>TMC2</italic> alone exhibit MET channel properties that are distinct from those observed when both proteins are present, suggesting thatÂ the TMCs may form heteromeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this finding, the tonotopic gradient in MET channel conductance of outer hair cells (OHCs) is eliminated in <italic>Tmc1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beurg et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>Beethoven</italic> (<italic>Bth</italic>) M412K amino acid change in mouse TMC1 reduces the calcium permeability and conductance of the MET channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corns et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). For these reasons, it is important to understand the role of TMC1/2 in mechanotransduction and how they form a functional unit with other members of the MET complex.</p><p>The zebrafish <italic>mercury</italic> (<italic>mrc</italic>) mutant was originally identified in a forward genetic screen for genes required for hearing and balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nicolson et al., 1998</xref>). Similar to those genes directly involved in hair-cell mechanotransduction (<italic>cdh23/sputnik</italic>, <italic>pcdh15a/orbiter</italic>), the <italic>mercury</italic> phenotype is characterized by (i) balance defects, (ii) an absence of the acoustic startle reflex, (iii) failure to inflate the swim bladder, (iv) lack of hair-cell-dependent calcium responses in the hindbrain, and (v) undetectable microphonic currents. Together, these phenotypes suggest that the <italic>mercury</italic> gene is essential for hair-cell mechanotransduction.</p><p>Here, we report that mutations in the zebrafish <italic>transmembrane O-methyltransferase</italic> (<italic>tomt</italic>) gene are causative for the <italic>mercury</italic> mutant phenotype. The Tomt protein is predicted to have a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase domain that is most closely related to Catechol O-methyltransferase (Comt; EC 2.1.1.6). The human ortholog of the <italic>tomt</italic> gene is called Leucine Rich and O-Methyltransferase Containing (<italic>LRTOMT</italic>), a dual reading frame locus that codes for either Leucine-Rich Repeat Containing 51 (LRTOMT1 / LRRC51) or TOMT (LRTOMT2). Mutations in <italic>LRTOMT2</italic> are responsible for DFNB63, a non-syndromic, autosomal recessive form of human deafness that is characterized by severe to profound neurosensory hearing loss that can be congenital or prelingual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tlili et al., 2007</xref>). No vestibular dysfunction has been described for DFNB63 patients. A mouse model of DFNB63 has also been reported. The <italic>add</italic> mouse (named for its attention deficit disorder-like symptoms) has a single R48L amino acid change in the <italic>Tomt</italic> (<italic>Comt2</italic>) gene, and behavioral analyses confirm that TOMT is required for both auditory and vestibular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2008</xref>). The major findings from the mouse model of DFNB63 were that TOMT exhibits modest O-methyltransferase activity toward the catecholamine norepinephrine, and that there is progressive degeneration of cochlear hair cells in TOMT-deficient mice. Based on these findings, the authors speculated that the hair-cell pathology was caused by deficient degradation of catecholamines. However, this hypothesis has not been tested.</p><p>Using the <italic>mercury</italic> mutant zebrafish as a model of DFNB63, we have found that Tomt-deficient hair cells have no mechantransduction current. Mechanotransduction in <italic>mercury</italic> mutants can be rescued by transgenic expression of either zebrafish Tomt or mouse TOMT, but not with the closely related Comt enzyme. This result suggests that catecholamine metabolism is not the cause of the MET defects. Instead, we show that Tomt is required for trafficking Tmc proteins to the hair bundle. We find that GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b fail to localize to the hair bundle in <italic>mercury</italic> mutants, and that Tomt can rescue this trafficking defect. Furthermore, mouse TOMT and TMC1 can interact in HEK 293 cells, and this interaction is modulated by His183 in the putative active site of TOMT. Together, these data suggest that DFNB63 is unlikely to be a disease involving catecholamine metabolism. Rather, TOMT-deficient hair cells exhibit a specific defect in mechanotransduction that can be explained by a failure of TMCs to properly localize to the hair bundle. As such, we propose a model where a TOMT-TMC interaction is required in the secretory pathway of hair cells for the proper integration of TMC proteins into the MET complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of the <italic>mercury</italic> mutation</title><p>The <italic>mercury tk256c</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nicolson et al., 1998</xref>) was initially mapped between the SSLP markers Z20009 (G41723) and Z858 (G40668) on the distal end of chromosome 15. Sequencing of known candidate genes within this region revealed no pathogenic mutations and mRNA in situ hybridization (ISH) for these genes did not reveal any transcripts with hair cell-enriched expression patterns (data not shown). To determine if there were any genes within the <italic>mercury</italic> critical region that were not annotated in the zebrafish genome assembly, we identified a region with conserved synteny on the stickleback (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) groupI chromosome that contained many of the <italic>mercury</italic> candidate genes previously excluded by sequencing and ISH, including <italic>inppl1a</italic>, <italic>stard10</italic>, <italic>clpb</italic>, <italic>phox2a</italic>, and the folate receptor <italic>IZUMO1R</italic> (Assembly BROAD S1 - groupI:6160000â6236000). The stickleback ortholog of the human deafness gene <italic>LRTOMT</italic>/<italic>DFNB63</italic> was also present in this region (<italic>tomt</italic>, ENSGACG00000007832).

To confirm that the Tomt-enriched compartment is within the Golgi apparatus, we engineered a medial Golgi marker by fusing the first 110 amino acids of the zebrafish glycosyltransferase Mgat1a (<italic>mannosyl (alpha-1,3-)-glycoprotein beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase a</italic>) to the mKate2 far-red fluorescent protein (Mgat1a_1-110-mKate2).

The crystal structure for human COMT (structure PDB_3BWM) has revealed that the cluster of amino acids Asp141/191, His142/192, Trp143/193, and Lys144/194 are located in the active site (human S-COMT / MB-COMT amino acid numbering, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rutherford et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vidgren et al., 1994</xref>). Asp141/191 coordinates a requisite Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, His142/192 and Trp143/193 interact with the SAM methyl donor, while Lys144/194 interacts with the catechol substrate and may aid in catalysis. This DHWK motif is conserved in all vertebrate COMT orthologs and some vertebrate TOMT proteins, most notably those from non-mammalian species. Interestingly, mammalian TOMT proteins retain only the histidine in this region (armadillo / mouse H183 and human H216, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The lack of conservation of these active site residues is surprising if TOMT shares the same substrates as COMT.

We tested thisÂ idea by co-expressing mouse TOMT and TMC1 in HEK 293 cells and performing co-immunoprecipitation experiments. TMC1-GFP was co-expressed with HA-tagged TOMT or TOMT-H183A, as well as the HA-tagged controls COMT, EZRIN (EZR), or RIÎ± subunit of protein kinase A (PRKAR1A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>). HA immunoprecipitates were blotted for the presence of TMC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,D</xref>). TOMT and TMC1 can directly interact, and this interaction is reproducibly enhanced by the H183A change in TOMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). There was no detectable interaction between TMC1 and COMT, EZR, or PRKAR1A.

Studies using the mouse model of DFNB63 suggested that TOMT functions as a catechol O-methyltransferase, and that the failure of hair cells to metabolize catecholamines leads to a degenerative phenotype and subsequent hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2008</xref>). However, progressive degeneration of hair cells is a common phenotype amongst mechanotransduction mutants in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alagramam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Longo-Guess et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchem et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Steel and Bock, 1980</xref>). It was not clear if aberrant catecholamine metabolism was truly responsible for the observed hair cell degeneration, nor whether Tomt-deficient hair cells had mechanotransduction defects prior to degenerating.</p><p>To clarify the role of Tomt in hair cell function, we used the zebrafish <italic>mercury</italic> mutant as a model for DFNB63. In the present study, we show that Tomt-deficient hair cells have a specific defect in mechanotransduction. Tomt-deficient hair cells have no evoked MET current and do not label with MET channel permeant FM dyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The behavioral and physiological phenotypes can both be rescued by expression of Tomt-GFP specifically in hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). We determined that the absence of mechanotransduction was not due to a general developmental defect by using a heat-shock approach to express Tomt-GFP in mature hair cells. Heat-shock-inducible Tomt-GFP was able to restore MET channel function to mature mutant hair cells, indicating that Tomt-deficient hair cells are otherwise competent for mechanotransduction, but actively require Tomt function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Based on these results, we propose that a defect in hair cell mechanotransduction is the cause of hearing loss in <italic>tomt</italic> mutants and DFNB63 patients.</p><p>Our data suggest that the absence of mechanotransduction in <italic>tomt</italic> mutants is caused by defects in Tmc protein trafficking. Using GFP-tagged versions of zebrafish Tmc1 and Tmc2b, we show that Tmc proteins do not correctly localize to the hair bundle of Tomt-deficient hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This trafficking defect can be rescued by transgenic expression of Tomt. Like Tomt-deficient hair cells, mouseÂ TMC1/2 double knockout hair cells do not label with FM, have no evoked mechanotransduction currents, but have normal voltage-dependent currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, <italic>mercury</italic> hair cells exhibit only mild defects in bundle morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This phenotype is similar to that observed in <italic>Tmc1/2</italic> double knockout mice at early stages when TMC-deficient hair cells have no mechanotransduction current but still have tip links and relatively normal bundle morphology. Furthermore, the time course of hair cell degeneration in TOMT-deficient mice is very similar to that observed for TMC-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>). Given the similarities between <italic>Tomt</italic> and <italic>Tmc</italic> mutant mice, it is likely that the zebrafish <italic>mercury</italic> mutant is equivalent to a triple <italic>tmc1/2a/2b</italic> knockout.</p><p>Typically, proteins that are involved in mechanotransduction are themselves localized in the hair bundle, the mechanosensitive organelle of the hair cell. However, neither Tomt-GFP, Tomt-HA, Tomt(1-45)-GFP nor Mmu.TOMT are detectable in the hair bundle. Rather, these proteins are localized to the secretory pathway, with the zebrafish proteins showing enriched localization in the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). This intracellular location suggests that Tomt is regulating Tmc protein localization prior to the point at which the Tmcs are trafficked to the hair bundle. Although zebrafish Tomt is enriched in the Golgi compartment, this enrichment does not appear to be necessary for function. When transgenically expressed in zebrafish hair cells, Mmu.TOMT-GFP appears to be primarily located in the ER, yet can still restore MET channel activity to <italic>mercury</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that Mmu.TOMT is also present in the Golgi apparatus, but enrichment within that organelle is not strictly required for function. Since other known members of the MET channel complex can localize to the bundle in <italic>mercury</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), we propose that Tomt is actively required for the trafficking of Tmc proteins to the hair bundle where the Tmcs can then form a functional MET complex with Pcdh15, Lhfpl5, and Tmie. As such, LRTOMT / TOMT may be a suitable target for gene therapy, as has been shown for the TMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Askew et al., 2015</xref>). These data suggest that Tomt regulates Tmc protein trafficking (and therefore mechanotransduction) from within the secretory pathway, and does not directly participate in the MET complex.</p><p>The mechanisms by which Tomt regulates Tmc protein trafficking in hair cells are still not clear. However, we suggest that the mechanotransduction defects are not caused by a failure of hair cells to metabolize catecholamines. We find that Comta, a closely related O-methyltransferase, cannot restore mechanotransduction to <italic>mercury</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This result argues against the idea that Tomt is primarily responsible for catecholamine metabolism in hair cells. Additionally, transcriptomic and proteomic surveys of mouse and chick hair cells shows that <italic>Comt</italic> is endogenously expressed in hair cells and the surrounding cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scheffer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2013</xref>), yet is unable to compensate for the loss of TOMT. Furthermore, we show that COMT active site residues are not absolutely required for TOMT activity in hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), suggesting that TOMT and COMT proteins perform unique functions.</p><p>COMT can methylate a variety of catechol-containing substrates, with methylation of the 3â-hydroxyl (meta) favored over the 4â-hydroxyl (para) by about 5:1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang and Klinman, 2011</xref>). While an exhaustive survey has not been done, single amino acid substitutions in COMT can decrease its affinity for catechol substrates, decrease the meta:para ratio, and change the rate of catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Law et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang and Klinman, 2011</xref>). Although human COMT and Danio Tomt are 44% identical and 68% similar within their putative enzymatic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), those residues where they differ may have important consequences for Tomt methyltransferase activity toward catechols.</p><p>Using the COMT crystal structure as a guide, we find that there are some potentially important differences between the two enzymes, especially comparing mammalian COMT and TOMT. In S-COMT, the amino acid residues Asp141, Asp169, and Asn170 coordinate a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion that is required to correctly orientate the hydroxyl groups of the catechol in the active site for methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vidgren et al., 1994</xref>). Of these three residues, only TOMT Asp210 (orthologous to S-COMT Asp169) is conserved, suggesting that TOMT may not require a divalent ion in order to function. Mammalian TOMT proteins also differ from COMT with respect to other active site residues, most notably the putative catalytic residue Lys144 in S-COMT. Depending on the substrate, mutating COMT Lys144 to an alanine dramatically reduces or abolishes the methyltransfer reaction and can change the meta:para ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Law et al., 2016</xref>). It has been suggested that His183 could take over as the catalytic residue in TOMT due to the native Lys185Pro substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehler et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mouse TOMT-H183A-GFP protein can still rescue the mechanotransduction and behavioral defects in <italic>mercury</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, the His183Ala change also enhances the biochemical interaction between TOMT and TMC1 in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Together with the possibility that TOMT does not bind divalent cations, these results call into question whether TOMT functions as a catechol O-methyltransferaseÂ in vivo. Consistent with this idea is the finding that TOMT exhibited only modest catechol O-methyltransferaseÂ activity in vitro, even when supplied with supraphysiological levels of norepinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, Tomtâs <italic>bona fide</italic> physiological target has yet to be identified.</p><p>Given the evidence that TOMT is unlikely to be a functional catechol O-methyltransferase in vivo, the question now becomes: what is TOMT doing to regulate TMC protein trafficking in hair cells? Is it a methyltransferase and what is its substrate? Or is it performing a non-enzymatic function? There are precedents for methylation events regulating protein function and trafficking. Intriguingly, another COMT-related protein, Catechol O-methyltransferase domain containing protein 1 (COMTD1 / MT773), has been shown to stimulate epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edinger et al., 2006</xref>). Protein O-methylation is also involved in Ras protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarke, 1992</xref>) and the function of a bacterial chemotaxis sensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falke et al., 1997</xref>). However, the idea that TOMT is a protein methyltransferase is speculative at this point. Alternatively, the role of TOMT in sensory hair cells may be independent of an enzymatic function, as has been shown for some methyltransferases in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DebRoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perreault et al., 2009</xref>). The protein-protein interaction between TOMT and TMC1 presents the possibility that TOMT acts as a chaperone to facilitate TMC protein folding or trafficking. However, we did not observe a redistribution of TMC1-GFP localization to the plasma membrane of HEK 293 cells when co-expressed with TOMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that other factors in hair cells are involved in modulating TMC localization. More work is required to determine if TOMT is a methyltransferase in vivo, to identify its substrate, and to understand the functional consequences of the interaction between TOMT and the TMCs in sensory hair cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were maintained at 28Â°C and bred using standard conditions.

Specimens were mounted on a depression slide in 1.2% low-melting point agarose and imaged on a Leica DMLB microscope fitted with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc five camera using Zeiss AxioVision acquisition software (Version 4.5).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>FM dye labeling of hair cells</title><p>To label neuromast hair cells, groups of four larvae were incubated in a 3 Âµm solution of either FM 1â43 or FM 4â64 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in E3 embryo media for 30 s, followed by three rinses in E3. To label hair cells of the inner ear, larvae were anesthetized with E3 plus 0.03% MS-222 and mounted laterally on a depression slide in 1.2% low-melting point agarose/E3. Approximately 2 nl of a 3 Âµm FM1-43 solution was injected directly into the otic capsule, and the larvae were immediately imaged. Because it is not possible to rinse out the FM dye from the otic capsule, some background staining of hair bundles is observed in <italic>mercury</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Imaging and quantification of fluorescence intensity</title><p>For imaging, live larvae were anesthetized with E3 plus 0.03% MS-222 and mounted laterally on a depression slide in 1.2% low-melting point agarose/E3 and imaged on a Zeiss LSM700 laser-scanning confocal microscope with a Plan Apochromat 40x/1.0 water lens and Zeiss Zen software. To quantify FM dye or GFP fluorescence intensity, unadjusted maximum projections were analyzed in Image J (v. 1.48). Fluorescence intensity is reported as the background-substracted Integrated Density value. Figures were assembled and adjusted for brightness and contrast in Adobe Photoshop (CS6). Where relevant, individual channels were adjusted equally for siblings and mutants, and images chosen for Figures were near the mean of the group data. Because transient transgenesis can cause variation in expression levels between individual cells, the mCherry channel only in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref> was differentially adjusted for brightness between the sibling and mutant images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis and replicates</title><p>For the purpose of this study, biological replicates are defined as the individual larvae analyzed in each experiment, the numbers of which are provided in the Figure legends. Data for quantification and statistical comparisons are taken from single experiments, although at least two technical replicates was performed for each experiment to confirm the results. All graphs and statistical comparisons were done using GraphPad Prism v.6.0h.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting</title><p>HEK 293 cells were seeded in multiwell plates with 10 cm wells at 1 Ã 106/dish. After 24 hr in culture, they were transfected with the indicated DNA combination using Effectene (Qiagen). To equalize protein expression, DNA was titrated to: 2 Î¼g/dish TMC1-GFP, 0.25 Î¼g/dish TOMT-HA, 0.5 Î¼g/dish TOMT-H183A-HA, 0.1 Î¼g/dish COMT-HA, 1 Î¼g/dish HA-EZR, and 2 Î¼g/dish HA-PRKAR1A. Total DNA was adjusted to 4 Î¼g/dish using empty pcDNA3. After 48 hr, the medium was aspirated and the cells frozen rapidly at â80Â°C. Cell extracts were prepared using two 1 ml aliquots of RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, P8340). Insoluble material was removed by centrifuging at 90,700 x g (r<sub>av</sub>).</p><p>Totals were prepared from 100 Î¼l of extract with 100 Î¼l 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer (prepared from LifeTech LDS sample buffer together with DTT). Immunoprecipitations from 250 Î¼l extract were accomplished with either 10 Î¼l of 50 mg/ml Dynabeads MyOne Tosylactivated (#65502, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with 2 mg/ml recombinantly produced anti-GFP (gift of Hongyu Zhao) for 1 hr at room-temperature, or 10 Î¼l of anti-HA-agarose (clone HA-7; Sigma-Aldrich, #A2095) overnight at 4Â°C. Following incubation, beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, and heated at 95Â°C for 10 min with two aliquots (90 Î¼l) of 1X SDS-PAGE sample buffer (without DTT). After separation from the adsorbent, eluates were adjusted to 50 mM DTT. Totals were thus 40% of immunoprecipitates.</p><p>Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 4â12% gels with either MOPS (TMC1 immunoblots), or MES (HA immunoblots) running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were transferred to 0.45 Î¼m PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA), stained with India Ink, blocked with ECL PRIME blocking agent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL), and probed with rabbit anti-mmTMC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>) or anti-HA (clone HA-7; Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. Protein bands were visualized with HRP-coupled anti-rabbit or light-chain-specific anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and ECL PRIME (GE Healthcare) using a FujiFilm LAS3000 imaging system.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the NIH (R01DC013572 and R01DC013531 to TN, R01HD072844 to AN, R01DC002368 and P30DC005983 to PGBG), the Max Planck Society (TN) and a Wellcome Trust grant 102892 (WM).

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Raible (Reviewer #2); Gregory I Frolenkov (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Although this work examining the role of Tomt in zebrafish hair cells is interesting and potentially important, there are major concerns preventing fourth consideration at this time. The two biggest concerns of the Reviewers are the use of the resting potential as a proxy for mechanotransduction and the poor image quality for some of the figures. If the authors could address these major shortcomings, especially with new experiments that directly measure MET currents in the mutant, then a revision would be welcome.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting and potentially important paper examining the role in zebrafish hair cells of Tomt, a methyl-transferase protein previously shown to underlie human deafness. A large amount of data is presented on the distribution of the protein and the consequences of its mutation. The most significant conclusions are the absence of mechanotransduction in the Tomt mutant and its requirement for targeting of Tmc proteins to the hair bundle. Also important is the demonstration that Comta, a methyltransferase closely related to Tomt cannot restore transduction in <italic>mercury</italic> mutants, so eliminating an earlier hypothesis about the involvement of catecholamines. However, there are experimental weaknesses for some of the conclusions. Evidence used to argue for lack of MET currents in the mutant is a failure to incorporate FM1-43 and FM4-64 dyes (which normally permeate MET channels), and change in the resting potential in the mutant (which is interpreted as loss of resting MET current). Both of these arguments are indirect and the results could be explained by a shift in the position of the I-X curve rather than absence of MET channels. Although difficult, MET currents have been previously recorded in zebra fish hair cells (Ricci et al. 2013) and this must be attempted here to support the important conclusion. A few such records could be supplemented by measuring microphonics. The conclusion about the Tmc targeting suffers from poor images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. In view of the significance of the conclusions, the supporting evidence must be strengthened. Poor imaging also undermines some of the other conclusions, such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Tomt-GFP seems to be in the basolateral cytoplasm and/or membrane. Is this background? In the right hand image, where is the pink Golgi marker? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, these images are of limited value since the sub-cellular organization is unclear. An important conclusion is whether Tomt is present in the bundle (the authors state it is not) but given the low-resolution images this conclusion is questionable. It is too bad that sub-cellular localization is not demonstrated using immunogold labeling (of GFP) in electron-micrographs.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Use of the resting potential as a proxy for mechanotransduction is not convincing for several reasons. Firstly, the absolute values seem variable between measurements. Thus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> shows controls around -50 mV with reduction in DHS to 60 mV in wild-type, whereas in Olt et al. (2014) controls are -60 mV with reduction in DHS to -67 mV. A manifestation of this is that the resting potentials in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> in the presence of DHS are the same (-60 V) but different in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; thus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, all three red points (Tomt mutants) should be at the same potential of -60 mV. However, a more important criticism is that with the mutant, the hyperpolarization might merely reflect a positive shift in the MET channel current-displacement relationship. A direct assay of transduction is needed; if this is not achievable, the figure should be removed because the K<sup>+</sup> current data add nothing to the central argument. (Why is the resting MET current not evident in the I-V curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> â has it been subtracted as part of the leak?) Elsewhere in the paper, accumulation of FM dyes is used to indicate transduction even though that too has a similar drawback which is not commonly mentioned.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Lack of effect on bundle localization of Lhfpl5, Pchd15 and Tmie in the mutant is an important result but the examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9A,9B, and C</xref> are ugly. Higher resolution views of the bundle might help, but there also seems significant background. The Tmie image looks especially bad, as though there many non-specific spots over the bundle. Better examples should be chosen. What is the significance of the statistically-significant differences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9F,G</xref>?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. Even worse problems exist here, especially in the Tmc1-GFP column (left-hand A, B, F, G). In none is the hair bundle labeling clear, and the cell body label is absent in B compared to A. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>, the Tomt mutant is non-zero, but there is no obvious label in B. The poor images should be compared to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> in Maeda et al. 2014. Perhaps images containing one hair-cell/bundle at higher resolution might be better.</p><p>5) Figure 12. This is a complicated figure. What is the significance of the TMC1 multimers in B, D and E? While the EZR, COMT and PRKAR1A negative controls are nice, they contribute to making the figure complicated and difficult to take in.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>LRTOMT2 is the gene responsible for the non-syndromic deafness DFNB63. The authors in this paper look at zebrafish with mutations in the zebrafish orthologue of this gene to uncover the role it plays in hearing. They show that zebrafish Tomt mutants show defects in mechanotransduction and that these defects are not due to developmental problems as they can be rescued by expressing Tomt in mature hair cells. It has previously been speculated that TOMT's role in hair cell activity was due to its O-methyltransferase activity and that deficient degradation of catecholamines lead to hearing loss. The authors provide evidence that this is not the case by showing that overexpression of the closely related Comt enzyme, which can also degrade catecholamines, does not rescue Tomt mutant phenotypes. Mutation of an amino acid necessary for methyltransferase activity does not affect the ability of Tomt to rescue mutants. The authors show that Tomt can directly interact with Tmc1 and Tmc2b, two components of the putative mechanotransduction channel, in 293 cells and that Tomt is required for the proper localization of these proteins to stereocilia.</p><p>While the authors demonstrate that zebrafish Comt cannot rescue Tomt mutants, this protein localizes to the ER instead of the Golgi. Mouse Tomt also appears to localize less strongly to Golgi. Would fusion of Tomt1-45, which is sufficient to target GFP to the Golgi, allow Comt to rescue?</p><p>In Figure 11D the two cells expressing tomt-P2A-nls-mCherry appear to show a significantly higher level of cytoplasmic Tmc2b in addition to localization of Tmc2b to stereocilia. It would be informative to see if there is consistently a change in cytoplasmic Tmc2 levels with changes in Tomt levels, as perhaps it is playing a role in protein stabilization as well as trafficking.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting manuscript describing unexpected role of the zebrafish transmembrane O-methyltransferase (Tomt) in the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) in the hair cells of the inner ear and lateral line neuromasts. It has been previously reported that mutations in human ortholog of the Tomt, LRTOMT, are responsible for DFNB63, a non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness in humans. Mutations in Tomt gene in mouse also result in auditory and vestibular abnormalities. However, it was unknown how exactly all these mutations contribute to the auditory phenotype. This new study from Teresa Nicolson and collaborators as well as accompanying manuscript from Uli Muller group provide the first evidence for the involvement of Tomt in trafficking TMC1 and TMC2 (the putative components of the hair cell MET channels) to the stereocilia tips, thereby affecting hair cell mechanotransduction. Regulation of mechanotransduction by Tomt seems to be independent of its enzymatic activity and occurring not at stereocilia but within secretory pathway in the hair cell. Even though the mechanism of this regulation is unclear, this is the first identified molecule that may regulate trafficking of the MET channel components in the hair cells. Therefore, the study is significant despite few but essential drawbacks described below.</p><p>Based on the electrophysiological characterization presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it is hard to agree with the authors' conclusion that the only effect of Tomt deficiency is &quot;little to no resting MET current&quot;. If that would be the case, one would expect that the resting membrane potential in Tomt-deficient cells would be identical to the membrane potential of the wild type hair cells after blocking MET channels with dihydrostreptomycin (DHS), i.e. around -60 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) â close to the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup>. Instead, Tomt-deficient cells are constitutively depolarized to around -50 mV, exactly like the wild type hair cells with partially open MET channels (Fig, 4F). Independence of this constitutive depolarization from DHS may indicate that: (i) either Tomt deficiency causes insensitivity of still functioning MET channels to DHS, which is unlikely based on other data of the manuscript; or (ii) Tomt regulates other channels that are essential for establishing the resting membrane potential in hair cells. The latter possibility is particularly important and needs to be explored. Constitutive activation of some non-selective cation channels, for example, may depolarize the cell and change dramatically the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels affecting intracellular traffic of many molecules. The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-C</xref> are not helpful in addressing this issue as they don't show the reversal potentials of the whole-cell currents.</p><p>Despite the fact that the <italic>mercury</italic> phenotype has been previously characterized, it would be helpful in some experiments of this study to assess MET function not only by MET channel-permeable fluorescent dyes but also by recording microphonic currents. For example, the experiments on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1</xref> would greatly benefit from microphonic current recordings since the recovery of resting MET current may not correlate with the recovery of overall mechanosensitivity.</p><p>Besides the effects on TMC1 and TMC2, Tomt deficiency seems to affect also stereocilia localization of Pcdh15a and Tmie. In addition, electrophysiology data point to some abnormalities in Tomt-deficient hair cell besides MET current reduction (see above). Yet, the overall discussion and the take-home message of the paper are focused on TMC1 and TMC2 trafficking. This focus seems to be misleading. The data of the manuscript do not allow considering Tomt as a specific regulator of TMC1 and TMC2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript provides multiple lines of evidence favoring the authors' argument that transmembrane-O-methyltransferase serves as a chaperone that effects the translocation of the putative transduction-channel components Tmc1 and Tmc2 to their normal site atop the stereocilia of hair cells in the zebrafish. The work constitutes a demonstration of the mechanism of action of the mariner mutation in zebrafish. Moreover, inasmuch as it has been impossible heretofore to target the Tmcs to the membrane surface in heterologous cell systems, this is an interesting contribution that might facilitate the expression of the transduction complex.</p><p>Despite the positive aspects of the work, it suffers from a major flaw: although &quot;mechanoelectrical transduction&quot; is evoked again and again, that process is never tested! Instead, there is a bizarre proxy: modest changes in the current-evoked membrane potentials of mutant hair cells are interpreted as an indication that the resting mechanoelectrical-transduction current is absent. This is at best a weak and indirect indication of transduction, and the interpretation of the effect is highly questionable when one is dealing with a mutation whose phenotypic effects are uncertain.</p><p>Numerous investigators have demonstrated mechanoelectrical transduction in multiple experimental preparations, including hair cells of the zebrafish. Especially when the senior author is an accomplished electrophysiologist, there is no excuse for using ancillary effects of transduction and indirect arguments: the authors should in my estimation perform the necessary experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28474.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is an interesting and potentially important paper examining the role in zebrafish hair cells of Tomt, a methyl-transferase protein previously shown to underlie human deafness[â¦] In view of the significance of the conclusions, the supporting evidence must be strengthened.
