In order to sense and integrate light for regulating various biological functions, photoreceptor proteins have evolved in a modular way. This modularity is targeted in the development of optogenetic tools enabling the control of cellular events with high spatiotemporal precision. However, the limited understanding of signaling mechanisms impedes the rational design of innovative photoreceptor-effector couples. Here, we reveal molecular details of signal transduction in phytochrome-regulated diguanylyl cyclases. Asymmetric structural changes of the full-length homodimer result in a functional heterodimer featuring two different photoactivation states. Structural changes around the cofactors result in a quasi-translational rearrangement of the distant coiled-coil sensor-effector linker. Eventually, this regulates enzymatic activity by modulating the dimer interface of the output domains. Considering the importance of phytochrome heterodimerization in plant signaling, our mechanistic details of asymmetric photoactivation in a bacterial system reveal novel aspects of the evolutionary adaptation of phytochromes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>photoreceptor</kwd><kwd>phytochrome</kwd><kwd>GGDEF</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>sensor-effector</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P27124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winkler</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular insights to phytochrome activation and signal transduction over long distances enable the allosteric regulation of enzymatic effectors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>While symmetry is a recurring feature of life on earth, many processes in biology deviate from this general trend. Starting from the selection of specific building blocks for biological systems, that is <italic>L</italic>-amino acids and <italic>D</italic>-sugars for proteins and nucleic acids, respectively, asymmetry has impacted living organisms ever since the origin of life. The importance of asymmetric processes ranges from the regulation of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) and signaling processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sysoeva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neiditch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarado et al., 2010</xref>), to the polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Gundersen, 2008</xref>) and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knoblich, 2001</xref>) of cells, and all the way to phenotypic asymmetry of whole animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin, 2005</xref>). Specifically in the field of sensor-effector communication, asymmetry is emerging as a critical aspect of both signal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neiditch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Narayanan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chervitz and Falke, 1996</xref>) and regulation of various output functionalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moore and Hendrickson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>An interesting group of environmental sensors are light-regulated photoreceptors; proteins that interact with various cofactors to convey light responsiveness to different qualities and intensities of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fraikin et al., 2013</xref>). These photoreceptors control complex processes in all kingdoms of life ranging from phototaxis in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gomelsky and Hoff, 2011</xref>) to intricate regulatory networks of photomorphogenesis in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fraser et al., 2016</xref>) or entrainment of circadian rhythms in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cashmore, 2003</xref>). As far as naturally occurring light regulated functionalities are concerned, current evidence for asymmetric properties of the frequently oligomeric photoreceptor systems is mainly observed in the family of plant phytochromes where two different types of asymmetry have been implicated in providing flexible light-regulated systems. The first one is a consequence of the evolutionary duplication of phytochrome genes and the observation that some family members only form mixed heterodimers, for example <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> phyC and phyE only form heterodimers with phyB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mathews and McBreen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clack et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu and Sharrock, 2013</xref>). The second form of asymmetry relates to the functional state of each individual light responsive module in either classical homodimeric or mixed heterodimeric red light photoreceptors. Phytochromes generally interconvert between an inactive red-light absorbing (P<sub>r</sub>) and a physiologically active far-red-light absorbing (P<sub>fr</sub>) species. Different biophysical properties of functional heterodimers featuring a P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> assembly have been suggested as one plausible model to explain differences in morphological development at different photon flux densities of actinic light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casal et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hennig and Schäfer, 2001</xref>), extending previous models that range from differences in degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clough and Vierstra, 1997</xref>) to interactions among different phytochrome family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sharrock and Clack, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our characterization of the bacterial phytochrome <italic>Is</italic>PadC (phytochrome activated diguanylyl cyclase from <italic>Idiomarina species A28L</italic>) shows that structural rearrangements at the coiled-coil sensor-effector linker that increase enzymatic activity are coupled to heterodimer formation characterized by two different functional phytochrome states. Based on the functional implications of a quasi-translational switching between two coiled-coil conformations coupled to asymmetric changes of the sensory modules, such a mechanism of sensor-effector cross-talk might be more widespread than currently believed, both in phytochrome-like protein signaling and in regulatory mechanisms of dimeric enzymatic functionalities. In canonical phytochromes such asymmetric heterodimers feature one dark-adapted bilin conformation (P<sub>r</sub>, cofactor in its <italic>ZZZssa</italic> configuration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murgida et al., 2007</xref>]) and one activated P<sub>fr</sub> state with bilin isomerized at the C15-C16 methine bridge (<italic>ZZEssa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salewski et al., 2013</xref>]). Changes in the local environment of the cofactor affect the whole photosensory module (PSM) since the bilin chromophore interacts with different regions of the PSM. In bacterial phytochromes the bilin chromophore is covalently linked via a thioether linkage to a conserved cysteine residue located in the N-terminal extension (NTE), an α-helix preceding the N-terminal Period/ARNT/Single-minded (PAS) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lamparter et al., 2004</xref>). The main stabilization of the open-chain tetrapyrrole cofactor is mediated by a cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenylyl cyclase/FhlA (GAF) domain following the PAS domain. The complete PSM of canonical phytochromes features an additional phytochrome-specific (PHY) domain at the C-terminus that stabilizes the photoactivated P<sub>fr</sub> state via residues from a domain extension, the PHY-tongue, that interacts with the bilin binding pocket in the GAF domain and undergoes a conformational rearrangement from β-hairpin to α-helix upon P<sub>r</sub>-to-P<sub>fr</sub> photoconversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgie et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show how structural rearrangements in the vicinity of the cofactors of a functional P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> heterodimer affect additional functional elements of the PSM and how these asymmetric dimers influence downstream signaling partners on a molecular level. Specifically, P<sub>fr</sub> formation is coupled to a quasi-translational rearrangement of one helix in the coiled-coil sensor-effector linker element that enables switching between two conformational states. While these molecular details are important for the understanding of bacterial diguanylyl cyclase regulation, they also have far reaching implications for the structurally related nucleotidyl cyclases, where the importance of the preceding helical elements has only recently been appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ziegler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Etzl et al., 2018</xref>) and linked to the occurrence of genetic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vercellino et al., 2017</xref>). In comparison to functional details of other characterized phytochrome systems that form active P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>fr</sub> homodimers, our results reveal an interesting molecular mechanism for the evolutionary adaptability of various sensor-effector systems. Considering that the rational design of novel sensor-effector combinations is a critical aspect for the rapidly developing field of optogenetics, the consideration of asymmetric functional states will be beneficial for understanding and optimizing initial designs of promising new light-regulated functionalities.</p><sec id="s1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Screening and expression of <italic>Is</italic>PadC variants stabilized in different coiled-coil registers</title><p>Our previous characterization of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC system revealed that the phytochrome – diguanylyl cyclase (DGC) linker region populates two different coiled-coil register conformations that influence the enzymatic activity of the effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>). To test this hypothesis, amino acids at special positions of the coiled-coil were replaced to either destabilize or stabilize the presumably stimulating register conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Previously, the corresponding sequence variants of the coiled-coil register were used in screening assays - <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg1</sup> (<italic>Is</italic>PadC D504L A518L; constitutively inactive) and <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> (<italic>Is</italic>PadC S505V A526V; constitutively active) – and a detailed biochemical characterization was only provided for variants with parts of the coiled-coil deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref><underline>)</underline>. This time we focused entirely on the sequence variants with identical linker length and included an additional construct, <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup> (<italic>Is</italic>PadC S505V N512V N519V A526V), that is further stabilized in the stimulating register. To this end, we substituted the highly conserved, polar asparagine residues at the generally hydrophobic <italic>a</italic> positions of the coiled-coil in its stimulating register 2 conformation with valine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). Employing a Congo red-based screening system for cyclic-dimeric-GMP production in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antoniani et al., 2010</xref>), we show that <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup>, comparable to <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup>, is constitutively active under both dark and light conditions, whereas <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg1</sup> is always inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). All three constructs were expressed in an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain coexpressing heme oxygenase to isolate holoproteins loaded with the biliverdin co-factor and to enable a more detailed biochemical characterization. It should be noted that so far none of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC constructs tested could be purified as apoprotein as they appear to irreversibly aggregate inside the cells in the absence of their cofactor. Therefore, all final protein preparations correspond to fully loaded holoproteins of each construct. A three-step purification procedure, consisting of an affinity, a reverse affinity and a size-exclusion chromatography step, allowed isolation of all full-length proteins to apparent homogeneity. Based on the elution volume of the purified proteins in the size exclusion step, all variants form stable dimers in solution. All subsequent biochemical and biophysical experiments were performed with protein samples obtained by this procedure.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34815.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Is</italic>PadC constructs and their functional characterization.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of <italic>Is</italic>PadC and coiled-coil linker variants.

By following the thermal reversion of 15<italic>E</italic> biliverdin to its 15<italic>Z</italic> isomer by means of quenching the protein after different dark adaptation times, mean lifetimes and amplitudes are observed that are comparable to those obtained for the native protein (inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), which indicates a direct correlation of the native spectral properties with the isomerization state of biliverdin. Interestingly, at the high concentrations of 10 µM required to perform this experiment, fitting of the data required the sum of three exponentials (Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). While this fitting function and the obtained parameters differ from previously reported data for <italic>Is</italic>PadC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>), we realized that these observations directly correlate with the protein concentration used for the different experiments. At low protein concentrations, fitting with the sum of two exponentials is sufficient to describe the recovery kinetics, however, increasing the protein concentration results in apparently slower recoveries until at some point the inclusion of a third exponential is indicated – eventually providing comparable values for the time constants of the first two phases (cf. Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Importantly, also changing the salt concentration of the samples significantly impacts the obtained recovery kinetics. This, in combination with the effect of protein concentration, points towards an involvement of the protein oligomerization state and/or non-specific interactions of structural elements close to the chromophore binding site in modulating the recovery kinetics of the biliverdin cofactor.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34815.007</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of PadC kinetics of substrate conversion</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th colspan="3">Comparison of initial rates* @ 200 µM GTP (µmol product min<sup>−1</sup> µmol<sup>−1</sup> enzyme<sub>2</sub>)</th></tr><tr><th>Construct</th><th>Dark state</th><th>Light state</th><th>Fold activation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Is</italic>PadC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>)</td><td>0.8 ± 0.1</td><td>34.2 ± 0.4</td><td>44x</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg1</sup></td><td valign="top">2.13 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">2.12 ± 0.01</td><td valign="top">-</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup></td><td valign="top">52 ± 4</td><td valign="top">117 ± 5</td><td valign="top">2.2x</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup></td><td valign="top">53.2 ± 0.4</td><td valign="top">53 ± 3</td><td valign="top">-</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Comparison of product formation between the various constructs was performed for initial reaction rates at 200 µM GTP.

The absorption maxima of the P<sub>r</sub> states are shifted slightly from 710 nm for the wild-type to 708 nm for both <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg1</sup> and <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup> as well as to 707 nm for <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup>. Consequently, the difference spectra of light-dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–c</xref>) show analogous changes in maxima of the negative P<sub>r</sub> signals, whereas the signals associated with P<sub>fr</sub> formation remain almost unaffected. The thermal recoveries to the ground state P<sub>r</sub> absorption spectra, however, are pronouncedly affected by the amino acid substitutions in the coiled-coil linker (Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>). We also observed that the protein concentration has a pronounced effect on the recovery kinetics of the register variants and have therefore decided to use 2 µM protein samples for the comparison of individual protein variants. Since this concentration differs from that used for the initial <italic>Is</italic>PadC characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>) the reported values in Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> also differ slightly from previously reported data for <italic>Is</italic>PadC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, recovery kinetics of wild-type <italic>Is</italic>PadC and the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> variant could be fitted with the sum of two exponentials, whereas <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg1</sup> and <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup> required the addition of a third exponential function to provide satisfying fits already at low protein concentrations. Interestingly, the latter variants are presumably extensively stabilized in their coiled-coil registers (inhibiting register 1 and stimulating register 2, respectively) and feature at least one phase with extremely slow recovery, whose contribution to the overall amplitude differs pronouncedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>). Especially <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup> appears to be severely limited in fully recovering to the P<sub>r</sub> ground state, which shows that the conformation of the coiled-coil register and its dynamics strongly influence the biliverdin environment.</p><p>A closer inspection of the recovery kinetics by comparison of data measured at 710 nm (reformation of P<sub>r</sub>) and 750 nm (depletion of P<sub>fr</sub> and potential non-P<sub>fr</sub> photoproducts) revealed that the time constants of individual recovery phases match between the 710 and 750 nm analyses. Interestingly, also the relative amplitudes contributing to individual phases at 710 and 750 nm appear to correlate for all constructs. While this observation might suggest that the recoveries do not involve photoproducts that significantly differ in their spectra from the P<sub>r</sub> or P<sub>fr</sub> absorbing species, it does not exclude the presence of closely related species such as for example meta-R states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borucki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buhrke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>). The observation of a non-isosbestic recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e</xref>) further supports the involvement of at least one colored species in addition to P<sub>r</sub> and P<sub>fr</sub>. In fact, the fairly constant amplitude contributions of the fastest phase of the thermal recoveries (~36%, <italic>cf</italic>. Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) suggest that this phase might correspond to the recovery of a biliverdin species with lower extinction coefficient bound to one PadC protomer, whereas the remaining phase(s) reflect the recovery of the second biliverdin species – most likely the classical P<sub>fr</sub> state. A closer inspection of the thermal recoveries in the region of the expected isosbestic points between P<sub>r</sub> and P<sub>fr</sub> as well as P<sub>r</sub> and meta-R (<italic>cf</italic>. ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borucki et al., 2005</xref>]) confirmed that the relative amplitudes of the individual contributions change significantly in this spectral region and that the maximal contribution of the meta-R and P<sub>fr</sub> species lies close to the isosbestic point of the respective other contribution. Therefore, our initial spectroscopic characterization indicates that two different biliverdin species are stabilized upon red light illumination of <italic>Is</italic>PadC in the two protomers of the functional parallel phytochrome dimer.</p><p>Such an asymmetric activation of <italic>Is</italic>PadC and its variants is also supported by the observations made for a construct lacking the PHY-tongue element (<italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Δ442-477::SG</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>). The spectral characteristics of the illuminated <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Δ442-477::SG</sup> construct are reminiscent of a composite of P<sub>r</sub> and meta-R states considering meta-R species characterized for D207 and H260 variants of <italic>Dr</italic>BphP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>) or low temperature trapped forms of Agp1 from <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borucki et al., 2005</xref>). The meta-R contribution is also supported by the characteristic changes in the light-dark difference spectrum compared to the other <italic>Is</italic>PadC variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>). Importantly, acidic denaturation of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Δ442-477::SG</sup> revealed that in comparison to wild-type <italic>Is</italic>PadC only half of the biliverdin population can be isomerized to the 15<italic>E</italic> form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>). The biliverdin cofactor bound to the respective other protomer of the dimeric species radiatively decays to the ground state rather than isomerizing, as shown by the significantly increased fluorescence of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Δ442-477::SG</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3c</xref>). Interestingly, the spectral properties of this partial light-activated state are retained over hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>) and even over-night incubation does not allow recovery to the P<sub>r</sub> ground state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>These data are consistent with a mechanism of <italic>Is</italic>PadC light activation involving light-induced isomerization of both biliverdin molecules of dimeric <italic>Is</italic>PadC. However, only one biliverdin moiety can undergo all subsequent structural rearrangements to obtain a classical P<sub>fr</sub> state. The second biliverdin is most likely trapped in an early meta-R like conformation. This asymmetry is more pronounced for the register variants stabilized in register 2, where the P<sub>fr</sub> environment is significantly stabilized relative to the wild-type and the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg1</sup> variant. Considering that the stimulating register and activation of enzymatic activity by illumination are coupled in wild-type <italic>Is</italic>PadC, we also had a closer look at the effect of stabilizing the coiled-coil in the two registers on catalytic turnover of GTP to c-di-GMP.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>The kinetic characterization of <italic>Is</italic>PadC variants reveals a complex interplay of enzymatic activity and coiled-coil conformations</title><p>In order to quantify the light regulation capacities of individual <italic>Is</italic>PadC register variants we employed an HPLC-based assay that enables baseline separation of the substrate GTP, the pppGpG intermediate and the product c-di-GMP. None of the analyzed register variants showed significant levels of intermediate formation as observed for <italic>Is</italic>PadC homologs or some linker deletion variants characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to <italic>Is</italic>PadC the conversion of substrate to product tends to be inhibited by increasing substrate concentrations, however, this phenomenon is less pronounced for both variants designed to stabilize the stimulating register 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a–c</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> summarizes the obtained rate constants for product formation at a substrate concentration of 200 µM, which corresponds to the maximum of GTP conversion for <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup>.

Considering that <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> activity can be increased whereas <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup> cannot, indicates that a too strong stabilization of the coiled-coil in the stimulating register can have negative effects for c-di-GMP formation. Apparently, the coiled-coil conformation of register 2 has a positive effect on enzymatic activity, but also the conformational dynamics of this structural element influence overall enzymatic turnover of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC system.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>The crystal structure of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> features an asymmetric P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> heterodimer</title><p>Addressing the structural implications of the stimulating register 2 conformation was enabled by the crystallization of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> under dark conditions.

A closer inspection of the cofactor binding site revealed that also biliverdin in its classical <italic>ZZZssa</italic> conformation would not fit into the observed electron density. However, models of biliverdin in its isomerized and rotated 15<italic>E</italic> conformation nicely explain the observed electron density as supported by the polder OMIT maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liebschner et al., 2017</xref>) of the co-factor region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Refolding of the tongue hairpin provides the structural flexibility for the PHY domain of chain A to reposition relative to chain B resulting in pronounced rearrangements at the PHY dimer interface. This repositioning of the PHY dimer correlates with the structural rearrangements of the coiled-coil to populate the register 2 conformation. In fact, the terminal PHY-helix directly extends into the coiled-coil sensor-effector linker and the whole structural element undergoes a hinge-like motion that is related to the structural transitions observed for various parallel phytochrome dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Considering that more than 40 residues are part of this extended helical region, the global structural rearrangements are a complex mixture of individual sub-regions. Especially for the central part of the coiled-coil, the hinge-like separation of the corresponding residues is not very pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and, due to the absence of any rotational contribution to the transition between registers 1 and 2, is approximated as a quasi-translational movement throughout the manuscript. Interestingly, the hinge-like rearrangement at the central helical spine of the phytochrome module breaks the Arg327-Asp494 salt bridge at the PHY interface.

The structural consequences of the coiled-coil rearrangement are a different spacing of the two structural elements corresponding to the functionally important DXLT sequence in the dimeric assembly. Since these structural elements are directly linked to the open active site at the interface of the two GGDEF domains, the coiled-coil register switching apparently has direct implications for DGC activity. In this context, it should be emphasized that the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> structure has been solved in almost the same crystal lattice as the wild-type <italic>Is</italic>PadC dark state structure. This implies that the conformational rearrangements of the DGC dimer are associated with the coiled-coil register transition and the asymmetric activation of the sensory module rather than being affected by lattice specific crystal contacts. Interestingly, superimposing the DGC dimer onto itself by aligning one protomer with the corresponding other protomer (residues 529–683 chain A over chain B) reveals a pronounced asymmetry of the DGC dimer interface in <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), which significantly differs from the DGC dimer interface of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC dark state (RMSD 0.370 over 141 α-carbon and RMSD 0.267 over 138 α-carbon of chain A superimposed over chain B for <italic>Is</italic>PadCReg2 and <italic>Is</italic>PadC, respectively). Overall we observe a rotational movement of the DGC protomer linked to the repositioned coiled-coil linker helix. This leads to an opening of the DGC dimer at one side and a closing at the other side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a–b</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of substrate or product bound to the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> structure it is, however, not possible to associate a specific functional state to this DGC architecture. Nevertheless, the fact that <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> features constitutively high GTP turnover suggests that the conformational opening of the DGC dimer might either increase the affinity for GTP and/or bring two GTP moieties after binding into an energetically favorable position to catalyze the first phosphodiester bond formation. Interestingly, the DGC dimer architecture does not resemble any deposited GGDEF dimer in an inhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wassmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Navarro et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the observed dimer might correspond to a functionally important conformation along the catalytic cycle of DGCs. In fact, the relative position of the two catalytic GGEEF sites at the center of the DGC dimer is affected by the asymmetric rearrangements in <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> and the net effect is a shortened distance between the GGEEF sites potentially facilitating the contact between the C3 ribose hydroxyl group of one GTP and the alpha phosphate group of the respective other GTP molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schirmer and Jenal, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c</xref>). This could provide the geometry required for the initial phosphodiester bond formation step, generating the pppGpG intermediate. Subsequent structural rearrangements would then be required to complete the second phosphodiester bond formation step and ultimately the release of the c-di-GMP product. That the observed architecture corresponds to one functionally important state along this pathway is further supported by the observed asymmetry of specific conserved residues close to the binding site of the GTP base (e.g. Lys569 and Tyr670) that change their rotamer positions and relative orientation to the other protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2d</xref>).

This appears to be true for bacterial phytochromes as well as evolutionary distant plant phytochromes, where asymmetric properties on the level of different protomers as well as different functional states of individual phytochromes are being employed to regulate complex cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clack et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu and Sharrock, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hennig and Schäfer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sharrock and Clack, 2004</xref>). However, when considering other organisms, the description of functional asymmetry in photoreceptor oligomers is rather scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heintz and Schlichting, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Winkler et al., 2013</xref>), although it apparently represents an interesting evolutionary approach to modulate photochromic behavior and signaling diversities. In general, asymmetry is emerging as a critical aspect of signal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neiditch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Narayanan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chervitz and Falke, 1996</xref>) as well as regulation of output functionalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Based on spectral data provided for several phytochrome systems, functional activation through P<sub>fr</sub> state formation in a single protomer might be a prevalent mechanism conserved in the family of phytochrome-like sensors that has so far been underestimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tarutina et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Loughlin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Essen et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Detailed comparison of the wild-type and <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> crystal structures</title><p>Interestingly, both the wild-type and the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> crystal structures have been obtained from crystals grown under constant dark conditions. Even though both constructs display very similar P<sub>r</sub> state spectra in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>].), <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> always features a small shoulder around 750 nm indicating a subpopulation of species present in the P<sub>fr</sub> conformation. Apparently the crystallization conditions favor the assembly of asymmetric P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> heterodimers existing in equilibrium with the predominant P<sub>r</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> homodimer in solution. These heterodimers feature the coiled-coil in its stimulating register, which stabilizes one protomer in the P<sub>r</sub> and the other in the P<sub>fr</sub> conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The enrichment of the P<sub>fr</sub> species only occurs during crystal growth and not in solution, confirming that the amino acid substitutions in <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> alone are not responsible for the stabilization of P<sub>fr</sub> under dark conditions, as observed in bathyphytochromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zienicke et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> heterodimer should not be considered a crystallization artifact, but rather reflects one conformational assembly of the full-length system that is energetically compatible with the stabilization of the coiled-coil in its stimulating register.</p><p>The pronounced asymmetry in the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> structure is characterized by one protomer in the P<sub>r</sub>-state while the second protomer features a P<sub>fr</sub>-conformation with its biliverdin chromophore in the 15<italic>E</italic> configuration and the associated PHY-tongue element rearranged into the characteristic P<sub>fr</sub> α-helical conformation. Obviously in the refolded state, the PHY domains exhibit greater flexibility, leading to a less defined electron density for this region compared to the rest of the protein. The directly linked PHY-tongue elements that are stabilized by interactions with the GAF domains, however, feature a well-defined electron density leaving no ambiguity regarding their differences in secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The P<sub>r</sub>-state protomer, with its characteristic β-hairpin conformation in the tongue element, superimposes very well with the corresponding protomer of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC dark state structure (RMSD of 0.26 Å over 347 Cα-atoms for the PSM alignment for the respective chains B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The superposition is only disturbed by some flexibility towards the end of the coiled-coil linker and the associated DGC. The P<sub>fr</sub> protomer deviates from the P<sub>r</sub> state of wild-type <italic>Is</italic>PadC as well as the P<sub>r</sub> protomer of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> by refolding of the PHY-tongue region into an α-helical structure that leads to a bending at the helical spine region triggering a quasi-translational movement of the associated PHY – coiled-coil – DGC region (RMSD of 1.56 Å over 402 Cα-atoms for the PSM alignment of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> on <italic>Is</italic>PadC of the respective chains A). The directly linked GGDEF protomer repositions relative to the second DGC protomer increasing the asymmetry within the GGDEF dimer. By calculating the free energy of assembly dissociation (ΔG<sup>diss</sup>) by PISA analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>), we observed that the energetic stability of the PAS-GAF-PHY interface (residues 8–500) in the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> structure is only slightly affected compared to the one calculated for <italic>Is</italic>PadC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>) (ΔG<sup>diss</sup> = 6.5 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> and 8.8 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>, respectively). Moreover, the stability of the PAS-GAF-PHY-coiled-coil assembly in the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> structure is in the range of the same assembly calculated for the <italic>Is</italic>PadC structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>) (ΔG<sup>diss</sup> = 20.0 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>, and ΔG<sup>diss</sup> = 22.6 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>, respectively), which suggests that the overall stability of the phytochrome sensor is only slightly affected by the structural rearrangement of the PHY-tongue and the coiled-coil linker. A closer look at the dimeric PHY interface shows that upon linker helix translation the Arg327 - Asp494 intermolecular salt bridges observed in the dark state structure of <italic>Is</italic>PadC are absent in the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> structure thereby enhancing the conformational freedom at the PHY interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Interestingly, the asymmetry of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> structure is also reflected in several other amino acids at the dimeric interface, for instance Phe132, Gln137, Arg140, Met320 for the PSM interface, and His577, K569, Y670 at the DGC interface. Upon isomerization of the biliverdin cofactor, Tyr168 and Phe195 change their rotamer conformation to accommodate the D-ring rotation as already described for other phytochrome species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgie and Vierstra, 2014</xref>). Also His193 changes its rotamer to interact with the carbonyl oxygen of the rotated D-ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–c</xref>). In addition, the tryptophan switch scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgie and Vierstra, 2014</xref>) is also observed for refolding of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC PHY-tongue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>DGC activity is regulated by structural rearrangements and changes in conformational dynamics</title><p>As far as downstream signaling of the activated PSM heterodimer is concerned, the crystal structure supports the switching mechanism between two coiled-coil registers proposed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to the anticipated rotation mechanism, we observe a quasi-translational rearrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,d</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) that is linked to a hinge movement of the whole PHY-coiled-coil linker region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). This type of functional rearrangement of the phytochrome dimer interface has also been observed by comparison of various phytochrome structures already at the PSM level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). More precisely, the refolding of the PHY-tongue is linked to a tilting of the central helical spine – PHY – coiled-coil region. This eventually causes the C-terminal parts of the coiled-coil linker to interact more tightly and repositions the directly following DXLT motifs at the dimer interface of the GGDEF domains. This highly conserved motif is directly linked to structural elements that are part of the open active site at the dimer interface of the GGDEF domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schirmer, 2016</xref>). In the absence of substrate, the coiled-coil linker rearrangement induces a different DGC dimer architecture due to a displacement of the DGC protomer linked to the photoactivated phytochrome protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). This results in a more open interface at one side of the dimer that potentially facilitates substrate binding or product release. In addition, we observed that the GGEEF motifs of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> are positioned closer to each other, indicating that the two GTP substrates could be more closely interacting and potentially initiating the chemical reaction between the two molecules in an asymmetric fashion, as opposed to the symmetric binding of GTP in the dark inhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the complex reaction mechanism of DGCs involves coordination of two GTP molecules, initial bond formation to form the asymmetric pppGpG intermediate, structural rearrangements to form the second linkage of c-di-GMP and subsequent product dissociation. Therefore, a single crystallographic snapshot cannot correspond to ‘the active’ conformation of DGCs; the dynamic nature of GGDEF dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schirmer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zähringer et al., 2013</xref>) rather supports a model in which the coiled-coil register switching influences the conformational sampling of different dimeric interfaces. In the case of the stimulating register 2 conformation of the coiled-coil, the sampling of dimers compatible with the geometry required for the DGC reaction to proceed is facilitated. Since an additional increase in activity can be achieved by stimulating the conformational dynamics of the coiled-coil by illumination, not a static dimer interface, but rather a dynamic assembly of GGDEF protomers, enables optimal DGC activity.</p><p>Interestingly, the superposition of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> structure with the GTP soaked <italic>Is</italic>PadC structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>) suggests that GTP binding within the DGC dimer induces a slight translation of the coiled-coil linker towards the stimulating register (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). Therefore, the full-length system involves a complex cross-talk between sensor and effector domains that influence each other based on finely tuned dimer interfaces. The coiled-coil as central communication hub integrates the functional state of input and output modules, indicating that the rational design of artificial sensor-effector couples needs to consider this complex interplay of dynamic dimeric interfaces of sensor and effector domains as well as properties of the coiled-coil linker.</p><p>The importance of conformational dynamics was also confirmed by hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, phytochrome activation by red light results in similar effects for both <italic>Is</italic>PadC and <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup>. Both constructs showed an overall increase in deuterium uptake upon red light illumination indicating a light-induced increase of conformational dynamics. However, the relative amount of deuterium exchanged under dark and light conditions is lower for peptides in functionally important regions of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> compared to <italic>Is</italic>PadC. This general decrease of conformational dynamics of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> highlights the molecular cross-talk between different functionally important elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>). The decrease of deuterium uptake of coiled-coil peptides correlates with the stabilization of the linker in the stimulating register conformation as anticipated for the amino acid substitutions in <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup>. The fact that this variant has a higher turnover rate constant in the dark compared to <italic>Is</italic>PadC indicates that the coiled-coil conformation in the stimulating register has a positive effect on enzymatic activity of the DGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). However, HDX-MS shows that illumination increases the dynamics of the coiled-coil and thereby destabilizes the coiled-coil arrangement, which results in an additional increase in enzymatic activity; this implies that, in addition to the register conformation, the overall dynamics of the system play an important role in modulating DGC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, HDX-MS measurements derive from an ensemble measurement of all peptides in the protein dimer. Therefore, it is not possible to specifically address asymmetric stabilization or destabilization in the context of the full-length protein dimer in solution. However, the broad deuterium uptake distributions of PHY-tongue peptides upon illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>) are indicative of a deuterium exchange regime that considers two conformational states with pronounced differences in deuterium uptake kinetics. Even if these observations are no direct proof of a heterodimer in solution, they suggest that different conformational states of the PHY-tongue elements co-exist upon light activation of the PadC system. This conformational coupling is also reflected in the crystal structure of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> and its pronounced differences to the inactive wild-type structure. Even though the P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> heterodimer conformation is not the energetically most favorable in solution, it does represent one functional form of the dimeric assembly that highlights the cross-talk between the site of light activation and the central regulatory element for enzymatic activity – the coiled-coil linker. Additional experiments to address the directionality of signal transduction by producing apoproteins of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> and wild-type <italic>Is</italic>PadC could provide interesting additional insights, however, the isolation of apoprotein is not feasible in the <italic>Is</italic>PadC system.</p><p>Figure 5 summarizes the observed influence of the coiled-coil register conformation and the dynamics of the system for regulating output activity of the DGC in a simplified model. To that end, the structure of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> and the structural changes associated with activation will help to readdress the activation mechanism of other phytochromes that are commonly used for designing optogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tischer and Weiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shcherbakova et al., 2015</xref>). In the context of phytochrome function, our study confirms that functional P<sub>fr</sub>/meta-R or P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> phytochromes exist and that, while chromophore isomerization coupled to reorganization of the PHY-tongue region appears to be conserved in phytochromes, the extent to which this affects the output domain is tuned by the dimeric phytochrome interface via modulation of the effective population of P<sub>fr</sub>-states as characterized by the structural rearrangements of the PHY-tongue and the PHY dimer interface. Ultimately, the flexibility to stabilize different functional states via the dimer interface enables phytochromes to be adapted to various effectors and also enables tuning of the action spectra by reducing the cross-section with inactivating far-red light.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein preparation</title><p>Linker register variants were produced by site-directed mutagenesis following the protocol described by Liu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu and Naismith, 2008</xref>) using pETM-11 <italic>Is</italic>PadC based plasmids as templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>) (used primers are listed in Table 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Is</italic>PadC variants were expressed and purified as described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>).

All kinetic data were normalized to the concentration of the dimeric protein, and all samples were corrected for the amount of c-di-GMP formed during the inactivation step.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Hydrogen-Deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry</title><p>Deuterium labeling experiments were performed to address the effect of illumination on the conformational dynamics of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> in order to compare it with the previously performed analysis of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, 200 µM protein sample were equilibrated at 20°C in the dark or under red light illumination (630 nm, 0.7 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>, Luminea LED) for 1 min prior to starting the deuterium-labelling reaction by diluting the sample 20-fold in D<sub>2</sub>O containing 10 mM Hepes (pD 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Reactions were quenched with ice-cold 200 mM ammonium formic acid (pH 2.5) after 10 s, 45 s, 3 min, 15 min, and 60 min and injected into a cooled HPLC setup as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Winkler et al., 2015</xref>). To sum up, deuterated samples were digested on an immobilized pepsin column (Poroszyme; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operated at 10°C. Resulting peptides were desalted on a 2 cm C18 guard column (Discovery Bio C18, Sigma), and separated during a 7 min acetonitrile gradient (15–50%) in the presence of 0.6% (v/v) formic acid on a reversed phase column (XR ODS 75 x 3 mm, 2.2 µM, Shimadzu). Peptides were then infused into a maXis electrospray ionization-ultra high resolution-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA). Deuterium incorporation was analyzed and quantified using the Hexicon 2 software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hx2.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de">http://hx2.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindner et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank E Zenzmaier for technical support and U Vide for cloning, expressing and purifying the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Δ442-477::SG</sup> variant.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Katrina T. Forest (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Gourinchas, Heintz and Winkler addresses the mechanistic role of structural asymmetry in allosteric activation of modular signaling proteins. Specifically, the authors examined the light signaling mechanism in a full-length photo-activated diguanylyl cyclase, <italic>Is</italic>PadC. They reported the crystal structure of an activated <italic>Is</italic>PadC variant (<italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup>). By comparing the IsPadCreg2 structure with the inactive wild type <italic>Is</italic>PadC structure from their previous work, they propose that light-induced structural asymmetry represents a critical event in <italic>Is</italic>PadC activation. Apparently, the output module can be de-coupled from the photosensing module and remain either inactive or active, and one half of the molecule can be structurally P<sub>r</sub>, while the other half is structurally P<sub>fr</sub>.</p><p>Relatively local changes in the dimer interface are seen relative to the native structure, supporting the conclusion that there are not any major conformational changes upon activation but rather subtle rearrangements at interfaces. HDX experiments are also presented and provide a complete comparison to the native protein results presented previously. These results support the model presented and confirm the overall structure of Reg2 behaves very similarly to the native protein in terms of accessibility changes before and after illumination.</p><p>While the topic and findings of this work are interesting, several major issues must be addressed or clarified before its final publication. All three reviewers were in agreement about the major strengths and weaknesses of the paper, and this decision letter uses wording from each of the reviews and the discussion in an attempt to summarize the reviewers' comments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most significant concern of all reviewers and the major point of our discussion is the inconclusive interpretation of the spectroscopic data regarding structural asymmetry at the chromophore site. The spectroscopic arguments lack validity because there are too many equally valid alternatives, including the possibility of apo protein and/or misfolded protein within the sample. It is not clear if the authors mean the P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub>heterodimer or P<sub>fr</sub>/meta-R heterodimer represents the functional dimer for <italic>Is</italic>PadC. It is important to distinguish between the signaling state of the protein structure and the signaling state of the chromophore, because the protein tertiary structure may or may not correspond to a specific chromophore conformation in photoreceptors. Very often, they are decoupled in asymmetric dimers such as <italic>Is</italic>PadC or in crystals due to lattice constraints. The authors should both provide more detailed information (see below) and tone down interpretations about 50%/50% Z/E conformation in the activated Reg2 protein.</p><p>The following should be included: a) P<sub>r</sub>-P<sub>fr</sub> difference spectra for Reg2 in solution.</p><p>b) More careful presentation of P<sub>fr</sub> to P<sub>r</sub> thermal reversion data.</p><p>It appears from the Materials and methods section that this reaction was measured at 700 and 750 nm, but Supplementary file 1 indicates in the legend and the table that it was measured at 710 nm. Thermal reversion could be used in a more systematic way to address the possibility of a non-P<sub>fr</sub>photoproduct. The authors noted that three exponentials are required to explain P<sub>r</sub> accumulation. Are there three exponentials for P<sub>fr</sub> depletion? If so, do the time constants of these exponentials match? And, if so, are the ratios of the amplitudes at 750 nm to those at 700 nm similar for each time constant? If this is the case, the authors may just be looking at three manifestations of P<sub>fr</sub> to P<sub>r</sub> thermal reversion (e.g., P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>fr</sub> to P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub>, P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> to P<sub>r</sub>/P<sub>r</sub>, thermal reversion from misfolded species, etc.). If not, the authors may have a non-P<sub>fr</sub>photoproduct (e.g., if only two exponentials are required for fitting of P<sub>fr</sub> depletion, or if the 750 nm:700 nm amplitude ratio corresponding to one time constant differs greatly from the other two).</p><p>c) Simulated annealing omit-maps for LBV in subunit A and B as well as superposition of the bilin chromophores between subunit A and B in both the WT (inactive; symmetric) and Reg2 (activated; asymmetric) structure.</p><p>d) Superposition of the LBV chromophores from subunits A and B based on the structural alignment of the protein framework.</p><p>e) Simulated annealing omit-maps of the PHY-tongue in subunit A and B.</p><p>The crystal spectra are confusing rather than informative (Figure 1C). The authors appear to normalize spectra at the P<sub>r</sub> state of the Q band of the crystalline and RL solution samples. However, proteins are structurally ordered within crystals, and random in a solution. Absorption spectra for a crystal will then be a function of the angle through which light passes. This issue is seen most clearly for the Soret peak, which is actually higher in magnitude than the Q band, this issue could also affect the relative extinction coefficients of the Q band of P<sub>r</sub> and P<sub>fr</sub>, because the D-ring flips and the bilin moves within the binding pocket. The way to get around this would be to collect 180 degrees of absorption data for a single crystal and take a weighted average (weighted against the pathlength through the crystal), or more easily, collect spectra from several randomly oriented crystals in a cuvette.</p><p>2) Asymmetry in protein conformation:</p><p>Although there is an advantage in the same crystal form for WT and Reg2 (it implies this asymmetry can't be forced by the crystal packing), it is also possible that further conformational changes are inhibited by the crystal packing. If this asymmetric state is active, then the crystalline protein should be active. Whereas, if further protein changes are needed to get to a P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>fr</sub> state for full activity, and if that is prohibited by crystal packing, the crystalline protein will be inactive. Unfortunately testing activity of crystals is tricky due to the possibility of soluble protein in equilibrium with crystalline. Thus, this assay is not a requirement of a revision, but it might be worth trying.</p><p>One suggestion for improved presentation of this point is that the authors should use superposition between subunit A and B (aligned according to PAS-GAF-PHY), rather than superposition between the WT and Reg2 structures (as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3), to demonstrate structural asymmetry.</p><p>3) Translational Movement:</p><p>The conformational change that moves the linker coiled-coil into its second active register is described throughout the paper as a translation. This is not entirely accurate, as a true translation would mean that every atom has moved by the same x, y, z vector. Could &quot;pivot&quot; or &quot;hinge&quot; be used in the text, as it is in Figure 2D? This would more accurately describe motions which lead to larger translations of the atoms further from the pivot point than those close to it. (Examples in subsection “Detailed comparison of the active and inactive <italic>Is</italic>PadC crystal structures” and subsection “DGC activity is regulated by structural rearrangements and changes in conformational dynamics”).</p><p>4) Active site rearrangements:</p><p>It is a bit surprising and unacceptable that the authors did not compare any (asymmetric) structure features at the active site of DGC given the full-length WT and Reg2 structures. Ultimately, asymmetry in the tertiary/quaternary structure must serve the active site of DGC, in which the catalytic residues from each subunit are positioned to perform different (thus asymmetric) functional roles. In particular, direct comparison between the full-length crystal structures of WT and Reg2 is expected to reveal structural (re-)arrangements at the catalytic site of DGC. In the absence of structural data and discussion on asymmetry at the active site of DGC, the significance and contribution of the full-length structure is significantly diminished.</p><p>It is entirely possible that the catalytic site configuration in the crystal structure does not correspond to the signaling state of PSM. In other words, the effector domain is decoupled from the PAS-GAF-PHY domains, either due to the crystal packing effect or mutations in the linker helices. Regardless of the configuration of the DGC active site (presumably located at the dimer interface), the authors should take advantage of their full-length structures of WT and Reg2 with detailed descriptions and structural comparisons between the WT and Reg2 structures in the effector domains, in particular the active site.</p><p>5) Overall organization:</p><p>The entire Introduction is written as a single paragraph and is consequently pretty clunky. Also, the fusion of Results section and Discussion section causes confusion because the experimental data, structural interpretation, hypotheses, speculation and reasoning are not clearly distinguished in the text. Results section and Discussion section should be separated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34815.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most significant concern of all reviewers and the major point of our discussion is the inconclusive interpretation of the spectroscopic data regarding structural asymmetry at the chromophore site.

Therefore, we agree that the initial spectroscopic characterization presented was superficial and to some extent not interpreted with the required care. We have now reanalyzed the data and provided additional figures/panels (Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 3) to enrich the presentation of the thermal recoveries in Supplementary file 1. Plotting the recoveries as A750/A710 ratios vs. time showed that extremely slow recovery contributions are present in <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg1</sup> and <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup>. Including fixed, known endpoints (based on the initial dark state spectrum) for the fitting routine provided a much more robust observation of time constants and relative amplitudes of the various contributing species.</p><p>In fact, this revealed that all analyzed <italic>Is</italic>PadC constructs (starting from almost identical steady-state light-activated spectra) feature a fast recovering contribution with constant relative amplitude of roughly 36% at 750 nm. In combination with the observation that the recoveries proceed with a subtle non-isosbestic behavior (Figure 1—figure supplement 2E), this indicates a molecular species featuring a lower extinction coefficient at 750 nm with overlapping spectral properties to the P<sub>r</sub> and P<sub>fr</sub> states as being responsible for the fast recovery contribution. Further supporting our initial hypothesis of meta-R like states in combination with P<sub>fr</sub> contributions being responsible for the steady-state light activated <italic>Is</italic>PadC spectrum, these spectral characteristics have been combined with references to previously published studies describing spectral properties of meta-R states (e.g. Borucki et al., 2005; subsection “Individual protomers of dimeric <italic>Is</italic>PadC feature different biliverdin environments upon illumination”). While we agree that other factors could also be responsible for the observed behavior, we think that the observations of asymmetry along several additional lines of evidence support our conclusion of an asymmetric heterodimer upon light activation. Especially the spectral characterization of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup> variant, with an extremely stable P<sub>fr</sub> contribution, indicates that the stabilization of the coiled-coil in register 2 greatly enhances P<sub>fr</sub> lifetime without affecting the amplitude of the fast recovering meta-R species. If the steady-state spectrum was obtained by mixed biliverdin populations in both cofactor pockets of the dimer or apo-protomer containing dimers, then such a pronounced stabilization of P<sub>fr</sub> should result in an increased P<sub>fr</sub> population in the steady-state, which is not the case.</p><p>The initial characterization of spectral properties during red light illumination clearly reveals a complex system involving multiple molecular species that are difficult to ultimately confirm with the methods used in this manuscript. More sophisticated experiments aiming at improving the time resolution and addressing vibrational modes of the biliverdin cofactor have been initiated in collaborative efforts and will help to address spectroscopic properties in more detail. Especially since no fast spectroscopy data are available for the <italic>Is</italic>PadC system, we refrained from a direct assignment of the meta-R state (meta-Ra or meta-Rc) but based on the structural implications we think that an early meta-R state where no tongue rearrangement has taken place is the most likely candidate to be stabilized in the asymmetric <italic>Is</italic>PadC heterodimer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear if the authors mean the P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub>heterodimer or P<sub>fr</sub>/Meta-R heterodimer represents the functional dimer for IsPadC. It is important to distinguish between the signaling state of the protein structure and the signaling state of the chromophore, because the protein tertiary structure may or may not correspond to a specific chromophore conformation in photoreceptors. Very often, they are decoupled in asymmetric dimers such as IsPadC or in crystals due to lattice constraints.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being consistent enough with our description of conformational states describing the biliverdin environment, the PSM rearrangements, the coiled-coil register, or overall structural changes. Since this is complicated by the fact that some uncoupling of the structural rearrangements is always possible a clearer description of what is meant at which stage of the Results section and Discussion section is of course very important. We have tried to meet this requirement throughout the revised version, but have to admit that, considering the dynamic contribution of all functionally important elements, this can sometimes be difficult or even ambiguous. To reduce the ambiguity with respect to photo<underline>activation</underline>, <underline>active</underline> register and enzyme <underline>activity</underline>, we have changed the nomenclature of the coiled-coil registers from inactive and active to inhibiting and stimulating, respectively.</p><p>With respect to the P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> vs. P<sub>fr</sub>/meta-R differentiation, we think that the global structural implications will be quite similar. Considering that early meta-R states are characterized by an isomerized biliverdin cofactor where only side chain rearrangements close to the biliverdin are realized without fully proceeding to the true P<sub>fr</sub> state (i.e. including tongue refolding), we believe that the P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub>heterodimer crystal structure (obtained in the dark) globally reflects the structure of the P<sub>fr</sub>/meta-R heterodimers that are present during illumination with saturating red light. After switching off the light the meta-R component converts back to P<sub>r</sub> relatively quickly and the resulting P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub>heterodimer would still be expected to be more active than a P<sub>r</sub>/P<sub>r</sub>homodimer in the wild-type. In terms of the nomenclature used by the reviewers both forms are therefore “functional dimers” of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC system. If the remark referred to “the active” dimer, we have to say that there is not only a single conformation that is active. Due to the partial uncoupling of different functional elements in the PSM, the coiled-coil and also the DGC the global dynamic interplay influences the enzymatic activity and, similar to many other photoreceptors, <italic>Is</italic>PadC is clearly not an on/off switch.</p><p>As far as lattice restraints are concerned, of course they can play a role for trapping non-functional states and could therefore bias our conclusions; however, in our case the crystal lattices are almost identical between the Pr/Pr homodimer in the wild-type structure and the P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub>heterodimer in <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup>. We believe that the driving force for the observed structural rearrangements is due to the population of register 2 even in solution (as indicated by HDX-MS). This register conformation stabilizes the P<sub>fr</sub> state as also shown by the thermal recoveries (Supplementary file 1) and even in solution there appears to be an equilibrium of P<sub>fr</sub> and P<sub>r</sub> states – eventually the heterodimeric species crystallizes in the case of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup>. However, the fact that the P<sub>r</sub>homodimer is still more stable in solution than a P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> mix, indicates that indeed there might be some uncoupling between the linker and the biliverdin environment; the coiled-coil can exist in register 2 at the same time as both protomers biliverdin environments are in Pr. We also cannot rule out some switching of the coiled-coil back to register 1 even in this variant, which most likely would also be partially uncoupled from the tongue and biliverdin environments. Clearly the signal transduction pathways in phytochromes do not follow the domino principle but more the violin model of allosteric regulation referred to also in our initial <italic>Is</italic>PadC publication (<italic>Gourinchas et al., 2017</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should both provide more detailed information (see below) and tone down interpretations about 50%/50% Z/E conformation in the activated Reg2 protein.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we have rephrased many passages where a direct reference to an activated species and a specific structural conformation is mentioned. Clearly there is no strict requirement for a 50/50 <italic>E/Z</italic> ratio for optimal activity and this is definitely not what we intended to say. Under high light conditions the <italic>E</italic> conformation will be strongly enriched and the resulting P<sub>fr</sub>/meta-R species (<italic>E/E</italic>) are highly active. However, under some circumstances an <italic>E/Z</italic>heterodimer will also exist and can be fully active considering the coupling of chromophore and coiled-coil environments. For example, under low light conditions – or even single photon excitation – the P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> species will dominate the equilibrium of species in solution. Also, after switching off the light the meta-R species recovers more quickly than P<sub>fr</sub> and we again have a P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> enrichment. In both cases <italic>E/Z</italic> ratios of individual (activated) dimers will be close to 50% and dependent on the degree of coupling between the conformational states in functionally important elements. The population average might of course differ from that and due to the thermal recoveries also change in a time dependent manner.</p><p>If this comment was meant to refer only to the crystal structure, then I hope that the new data included (comparison of crystal spectra and OMIT maps – Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 3) further support the refined model of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup>heterodimer with a 50% <italic>E/Z</italic> ratio.</p><p>To bring more clarity on these points, the following new data have been included as suggested by the reviewers:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following should be included: a) P<sub>r</sub>-P<sub>fr</sub> difference spectra for Reg2 in solution</p></disp-quote><p>In order to be consistent for all the variants described in the manuscript we included difference spectra of light–dark (which appears to be the more prevalent type of phytochrome difference spectra in the literature) for <italic>Is</italic>PadC, <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg1</sup>, <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup>, <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup> and the tongue deletion variant (<italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>D442-477::SG</sup>).

Thermal reversion could be used in a more systematic way to address the possibility of a non-P<sub>fr</sub>photoproduct. The authors noted that three exponentials are required to explain P<sub>r</sub> accumulation. Are there three exponentials for P<sub>fr</sub> depletion? If so, do the time constants of these exponentials match? And, if so, are the ratios of the amplitudes at 750 nm to those at 700 nm similar for each time constant? If this is the case, the authors may just be looking at three manifestations of P<sub>fr</sub> to P<sub>r</sub> thermal reversion (e.g., P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>fr</sub> to P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub>, P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> to P<sub>r</sub>/P<sub>r</sub>, thermal reversion from misfolded species, etc.). If not, the authors may have a non-P<sub>fr</sub>photoproduct (e.g., if only two exponentials are required for fitting of P<sub>fr</sub> depletion, or if the 750 nm:700 nm amplitude ratio corresponding to one time constant differs greatly from the other two).</p></disp-quote><p>Again, many thanks for bringing up this point and for the helpful suggestions. How our efforts to address these points have helped to improve our understanding of the system has already been stated in our reply to the general paragraph of comment 1. Therefore, we only refer to specific details at this point:</p><p>The thermal reversion data have been measured at the maximum of the P<sub>r</sub> Q-band absorption of wild-type (710 nm) and the maximum of the P<sub>fr</sub> (+ early meta-R) contribution in the light-dark difference spectrum of <italic>Is</italic>PadC (750 nm). We apologize for the typo in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>The time constants of individual exponential contributions match very well between 710 and 750 nm data. In addition to the time constants, also the amplitude contributions at the two wavelengths appear very similar. Detailed analysis of all phases resulted in amplitude@750/amplitude@710 ratios of: <italic>Is</italic>PadCt1 – 0.69, t2 – 0.62; <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg1</sup> t1 – 0.53, t2 – 0.75, t3 – 0.83; <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> t1 – 0.64, t2 – 0.72; <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup> t1 – 0.66, t2 – 0.66, t3 – 0.7. Combining these data results in an average amplitude@750 over amplitude@710 ratio of 0.68, with a sample standard deviation of 0.08 for the 10 phases reported in Supplementary file 1. Along the lines of argumentation of the reviewers these observations would suggest different manifestations of P<sub>fr</sub> to P<sub>r</sub> recovery. In the case where two exponentials are sufficient to describe the data, the fact that the amplitude contributions are not 50%, however, suggests that the colored species of the steady-state light activated spectrum have different spectral contributions. Therefore, the most likely explanation in our opinion is the inclusion of an early meta-R species that has a lower extinction coefficient as P<sub>fr</sub>. The amplitude contributions of meta-R and P<sub>fr</sub> species match very well with data provided for the corresponding states in Agp1 phytochrome (Borucki et al., 2005). Considering also the different isosbestic points of meta-R and P<sub>fr</sub> with the P<sub>r</sub> state, the observed non-isosbestic behavior (Figure 1—figure supplement 2E) matches the postulated behavior for a fast meta-R recovering species and a slower P<sub>fr</sub> recovery. Looking more closely at the amplitude contributions in the range of the isosbestic points also revealed a strong dependence of relative amplitudes on the wavelength of the fit (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Therefore, the similar amplitude contributions observed at 710 and 750 nm are merely a coincidence and do not indicate that our observations refer to different manifestations of P<sub>fr</sub> recoveries.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34815.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34815-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>But why do we need three exponentials for some constructs and only two to adequately fit the data for other constructs? This is a complex question and we do not have a conclusive answer to that; however, since the number of exponentials needed to describe the recoveries depends on salt and protein concentration, one potential answer would be that the more stable registers 1 and 2.a variants have different in solution properties than the other tested variants at the same protein concentration – e.g. tendency for unspecific oligomerization. Another explanation could be that the restriction of conformational dynamics in the coiled-coil linker affects the biliverdin environments of the two protomers differently. <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup> would favor the P<sub>fr</sub> state on the structurally predestined protomer and only a small partially uncoupled subpopulation could form P<sub>fr</sub> on the other protomer. Due to the restrained dynamics of the overall system the two different P<sub>fr</sub>–coiled-coil substructures would show different recoveries, which is why the total P<sub>fr</sub> recovery contribution is split up into two different phases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Simulated annealing omit-maps for LBV in subunit A and B as well as superposition of the bilin chromophores between subunit A and B in BOTH the WT (inactive; symmetric) and Reg2 (activated; asymmetric) structure</p></disp-quote><p>We performed OMIT map calculations using a recently described, improved version of OMIT map generation that handles issues with bulk-solvent models more adequately. Details can be found in Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol. 2017 Feb 1;73(Pt 2):148-157 doi: 10.1107/S2059798316018210. While similar to simulated annealing OMIT maps calculated by a classical approach, the slightly improved quality of the “polder maps” enable easier visualization of features of interest. The LBV maps for both protomers in the asymmetric unit are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 for both the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> structure (panel a and b) and wild-type <italic>Is</italic>PadC data (panel c and d). While the two biliverdin conformations of the wild-type structure are virtually identical, the two LBV models of the register 2 variant differ significantly. To illustrate the differences, the refined models of each protomer are overlaid with the model of the corresponding other protomer in the colors used in previous figures; i.e. dark-red for the biliverdin cofactor of the P<sub>fr</sub>protomer A and light-red for the P<sub>r</sub>protomer. We refrained from including the analogous superposition for the wild-type panels since it causes confusion due to the almost identical conformations in both protomers. However, panels e and f of Figure 2—figure supplement 2 show the biliverdin cofactors of both protomers based on the alignment of the PAS-GAF cores in the context of neighboring residues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Superposition of the LBV chromophores from subunits A and B based on the structural alignment of the protein framework;</p></disp-quote><p>The superposition of the biliverdin cofactors mentioned above was calculated using the PAS-GAF bidomain for the structural alignment; we apologize if we have not correctly interpreted the lines in comments <italic>c</italic> and <italic>d</italic>, but we think that one superposition of the LBV cofactors is sufficient. To better appreciate the consequences of D-ring rotation in the near surrounding of the biliverdin, we have included panels e and f in Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Simulated annealing omit-maps of the PHY-tongue in subunit A and B.</p></disp-quote><p>They have been included in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, using the same “polder maps” described in our response to comment <italic>c</italic>. While it is difficult to find suitable views that satisfy the reader in every aspect of both tongue conformations, we hope that the illustration chosen helps to appreciate the pronounced differences in tongue architectures. We believe that the interested reader will download the coordinates along with the deposited structure factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The crystal spectra are confusing rather than informative (Figure 1C). The authors appear to normalize spectra at the P<sub>r</sub> state of the Q band of the crystalline and RL solution samples. However, proteins are structurally ordered within crystals, and random in a solution. Absorption spectra for a crystal will then be a function of the angle through which light passes. This issue is seen most clearly for the Soret peak, which is actually higher in magnitude than the Q band, this issue could also affect the relative extinction coefficients of the Q band of P<sub>r</sub> and P<sub>fr</sub>, because the D-ring flips and the bilin moves within the binding pocket. The way to get around this would be to collect 180 degrees of absorption data for a single crystal and take a weighted average (weighted against the pathlength through the crystal), or more easily, collect spectra from several randomly oriented crystals in a cuvette.</p></disp-quote><p>The intention of this figure was to illustrate that there are spectral similarities between the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> crystals and the in solution properties upon illumination of all <italic>Is</italic>PadC constructs. The normalization to the Q band of in solution data, used to bring them on similar scales, was probably pushing the limits of acceptable data treatments too far; we apologize for that.</p><p>We now decided to strictly separate crystal spectra from in solution spectra and have therefore moved the crystal spectrum to Figure 2—figure supplement 3. To partially account for the extinction coefficient variation at different orientations of the crystal, we averaged 20 different snapshots at different orientations (knowing that they might be biased to suitable orientations of the plate like crystals in the loop relative to the incident light beam) acquired at cryogenic temperature. This is then compared to cryogenic data of P<sub>r</sub>/P<sub>r</sub>homodimer wild-type <italic>Is</italic>PadC crystals (4 different orientations available). These two datasets were normalized to the region where light and dark-state spectra intersect in solution (strictly speaking no isosbestic point is available, but for a direct comparison this is the best normalization approach that we could think of). In this illustration, it is obvious that <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> crystals have a pronounced 750 nm contribution and that wild-type vs <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> crystal spectra mimic the dark vs light spectra in solution, with the only exception that the Q band features are more defined at the cryogenic temperature measurements.</p><p>Of course, it was not our intention to say that the crystal spectrum is identical to the in solution spectrum of light activated <italic>Is</italic>PadC. Crystals clearly feature a mix of P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> species whereas in solution and at saturating red light conditions we expect P<sub>fr</sub>/meta-R heterodimers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Asymmetry in protein conformation:</p><p>Although there is an advantage in the same crystal form for WT and Reg2 (it implies this asymmetry can't be forced by the crystal packing), it is also possible that further conformational changes are inhibited by the crystal packing. If this asymmetric state is active, then the crystalline protein should be active. Whereas, if further protein changes are needed to get to a P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>fr</sub> state for full activity, and if that is prohibited by crystal packing, the crystalline protein will be inactive. Unfortunately testing activity of crystals is tricky due to the possibility of soluble protein in equilibrium with crystalline. Thus, this assay is not a requirement of a revision, but it might be worth trying.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not performed any activity assays with isolated <italic>Is</italic>PadC or <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> crystals. The reason for this relates to the caveats mentioned by the reviewers, but also the fact that the GGDEF mechanism is a lot more complex than substrate conversion at a defined active center. The DGC active site is formed at the interface of both subunits and requires concerted structural rearrangements of both subunits for appropriately positioning the two GTP molecules for initial bond formation (pppGpG intermediate), subsequent second bond formation (c-di-GMP), product and sideproduct(s) (PPi) dissociation, followed by binding of new GTP molecules. Considering the dynamic nature of the GGDEF interface and the reduced degrees of freedom in the crystal lattice, we would not expect that substantial turnover can happen in the crystals.</p><p>However, we tried soaking of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> crystals with GTP to see if we could obtain indications of initial steps of substrate conversion in the crystals. However, the crystals start cracking and partially disintegrate resulting in rather lousy diffraction data (worse than 4 Å). This could result in increased populations of soluble protein in equilibrium with the crystals and any activity data inferred from such measurements should not be correlated with the activity of the crystals. Interestingly, the same soaking procedure with the wild-type protein crystals did not result in cracking and a refined dataset has been included in our previous <italic>Is</italic>PadC publication (pdb 5LLX). This difference points at an increased structural flexibility of the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> system that might be correlated with structural arrangements that are not possible in the structure of the wild-type protein. In our opinion, the GTP induced structural changes, resulting in cracking of the crystals, are indicative of subsequent catalytic steps following GTP binding that are not feasible in the inhibiting register 1 conformation of the coiled-coil. Even though no full catalytic cycle is compatible with the lattice restraints, the fact that coiled-coil switching is coupled to P<sub>fr</sub> formation on one protomer suggests that the observed P<sub>fr</sub>/P<sub>r</sub> assembly is one functionally important state involved in DGC activity regulation. Whether the GGDEF conformations are fully coupled or partially uncoupled from the PSM-coiled-coil rearrangements in the crystal lattice is a different question. We tried to clarify these points in the Results section and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One suggestion for improved presentation of this point is that the authors should use superposition between subunit A and B (aligned according to PAS-GAF-PHY), rather than superposition between the WT and Reg2 structures (as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3), to demonstrate structural asymmetry.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that Figure 2 should focus only on the new <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> data. Even though we mentioned that the PAS-GAF-PHY domains of the P<sub>r</sub> conformation in the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> crystal structure are virtually identical to the wild-type P<sub>r</sub> conformation, we have now replaced the corresponding grey cartoon representation in panel D of Figure 2. Due to the similarities of the P<sub>r</sub> states, the new figure appears to only have a changed label compared to the original one. In terms of the superposition algorithm we refrained from using PAS-GAF-PHY, because in fact the PHY domain rearrangements relative to the PAS-GAF bidomain are one of the important things to show at this point (the PAS-GAF dimer remains virtually unaffected by P<sub>fr</sub> state formation).</p><p>That the PHY dimer rearrangement is eventually also translated into an asymmetric GGDEF interface is reflected in panel c, where we now also only show <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> data and aligned the GGDEF protomer of chain A to that of chain B. Since this no longer corresponds to the structural rearrangement induced by the coiled-coil transition, we have included an enriched version of the original comparison to the wild-type DGC interface in Figure 3—figure supplement 2. In the latter figure, we also kept the structural alignments between the wt / <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> / <italic>Is</italic>PadC + GTP structures to highlight the differences in linker architectures induced by P<sub>fr</sub> formation and GTP binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Translational Movement:</p><p>The conformational change that moves the linker coiled-coil into its second active register is described throughout the paper as a translation. This is not entirely accurate, as a true translation would mean that every atom has moved by the same x, y, z vector. Could &quot;pivot&quot; or &quot;hinge&quot; be used in the text, as it is in Figure 2D? This would more accurately describe motions which lead to larger translations of the atoms further from the pivot point than those close to it. (Examples in subsection “Detailed comparison of the active and inactive IsPadC crystal structures” and subsection “DGC activity is regulated by structural rearrangements and changes in conformational dynamics”).</p></disp-quote><p>We admit that the term translation is only an approximation and only valid for the structural changes in the center of the coiled-coil region. The C-terminal PHY helix features a more pronounced hinge-like movement and also the C-terminal part of the coiled-coil follows a more complex structural reorganization to satisfy supercoiling of the two helices (strictly speaking, a pure hinge like movement in a coiled-coil would destroy the knobs into holes packing of this structural entity). In order to account for these complex structural rearrangements, we have now clearly stated in the Results section that the translational component in the coiled-coil is part of a hinge-like global structural rearrangement (subsection “The crystal structure of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> features an asymmetric Pfr/Pr heterodimer”). In fact, the hinge-like movement of the PHY-coiled-coil is coupled to the hinge movement of the PSM. The fact that the estimated pivot points do not overlap shows that even description as a hinge rearrangement is only an approximation in a complex three-dimensional system.</p><p>Therefore, we decided to use the term “quasi-translational” movement of the coiled-coil throughout the manuscript. This terminology allows clear differentiation from the more commonly assumed rotational coiled-coil transitions and still indicates that the situation is more complex than a pure translation. That “translation” is indeed a good approximation is also shown in a close up of the central coiled-coil linker part in Figure 3—figure supplement 1b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Active site rearrangements:</p><p>It is a bit surprising and unacceptable that the authors did not compare any (asymmetric) structure features at the active site of DGC given the full-length WT and Reg2 structures. Ultimately, asymmetry in the tertiary/quaternary structure must serve the active site of DGC, in which the catalytic residues from each subunit are positioned to perform different (thus asymmetric) functional roles. In particular, direct comparison between the full-length crystal structures of WT and Reg2 is expected to reveal structural (re-)arrangements at the catalytic site of DGC. In the absence of structural data and discussion on asymmetry at the active site of DGC, the significance and contribution of the full-length structure is significantly diminished.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially kept the discussion of mechanistic aspects of the DGC to a minimum because we wanted to focus the manuscript on the asymmetric activation mechanism of the phytochrome module. Our assumption was that including the complex DGC mechanism description in the manuscript would distract the reader from the major findings in the phytochrome part.</p><p>Especially since it is known that DGCs can crystallize in many (also unspecific) dimer interfaces, we are aware that any conclusions drawn from this specific crystallographic snapshot need to be considered with caution. Nevertheless, we have now included a basic discussion of the observed structural rearrangements and their potential implications for mechanistic aspects of GTP to c-di-GMP conversion (subsection “The crystal structure of <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2</sup> features an asymmetric Pfr/Pr heterodimer”).</p><p>As far as asymmetric functional roles are concerned (as stated in the reviewers comment), we want to point out that asymmetry is likely important for the first bond formation step, but that in the second step of c-di-GMP formation a symmetric active site could also be envisaged (cf. pdb 3TVK with symmetry mate). Such multi-step pathways are difficult to rationalize with one crystallographic snapshot in the absence of substrate and therefore we tried not to overinterpret our findings in the corresponding parts of the Results section and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is entirely possible that the catalytic site configuration in the crystal structure does not correspond to the signaling state of PSM. In other words, the effector domain is decoupled from the PAS-GAF-PHY domains, either due to the crystal packing effect or mutations in the linker helices. Regardless of the configuration of the DGC active site (presumably located at the dimer interface), the authors should take advantage of their full-length structures of WT and Reg2 with detailed descriptions and structural comparisons between the WT and Reg2 structures in the effector domains, in particular the active site.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in our previous reply, we have included additional descriptions and comparisons between DGC conformations of WT and Reg2 in the revised version of the manuscript. We also clearly stated that the observed DGC arrangement has interesting implications for the catalytic mechanism but pointed out that the interpretation is complicated by the complex reaction mechanism and the fact that multiple rearrangements are expected to be involved in the turnover of GTP to c-di-GMP. This concept also shows that the dimeric DGC assembly cannot be strictly coupled to the coiled-coil conformation. Some uncoupling from the coiled-coil register conformation and ultimately the signaling state of the PSM is required to perform its function. An almost complete uncoupling from the PSM is nicely demonstrated by the <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg1</sup> and <italic>Is</italic>PadC<sup>Reg2.a</sup> variants, which still show PSM photoactivation but no effect of light on the catalytic activity. In both variants the coiled-coil conformation is the activity determining parameter. The degree to which the PSM can influence the coiled-coil register and the degree to which this register is coupled to the DGC dynamics ultimately affect the dynamic range of the system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Overall organization:</p><p>The entire Introduction is written as a single paragraph and is consequently pretty clunky. Also, the fusion of Results section and Discussion section causes confusion because the experimental data, structural interpretation, hypotheses, speculation and reasoning are not clearly distinguished in the text. Results section and Discussion section should be separated.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of structure in our initial version and have introduced new paragraphs at appropriate positions throughout the manuscript. We also separated Results section and Discussion section, but kept the Discussion section very similar to the previous version. We removed redundant passages and pure results wherever possible but are aware that this was not possible for all aspects of the new Discussion section. We think that a certain degree of redundancy will help the reader to follow the main conclusions and believe that the overall readability has greatly improved from restructuring the initial manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
