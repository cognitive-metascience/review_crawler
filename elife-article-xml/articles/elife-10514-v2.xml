Although σ factors are generally classified as initiation factors, σ can also remain associated with, and modulate the behavior of, RNAP during elongation. Here we establish that the primary σ factor in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, σ<sup>70</sup>, can function as an elongation factor in vivo by loading directly onto the transcription elongation complex (TEC) <italic>in trans</italic>. We demonstrate that σ<sup>70</sup> can bind <italic>in trans</italic> to TECs that emanate from either a σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter or a promoter that is controlled by an alternative σ factor. We further demonstrate that binding of σ<sup>70</sup> to the TEC <italic>in trans</italic> can have a particularly large impact on the dynamics of transcription elongation during stationary phase. Our findings establish a mechanism whereby the primary σ factor can exert direct effects on the composition of the entire transcriptome, not just that portion that is produced under the control of σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoters.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10514.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10514.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10514.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are made following instructions that are encoded by sections of DNA called genes. In the first step of protein production, an enzyme called RNA polymerase uses the gene as a template to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). This process—known as transcription—starts when RNA polymerase binds to a site at the start of a gene. The enzyme then moves along the DNA, assembling the mRNA as it goes. This stage of transcription is known as elongation and continues until the RNA polymerase reaches the end of the gene.</p><p>In bacteria, RNA polymerase needs a family of proteins called sigma factors to help it identify and bind to the start sites associated with the genes that will be transcribed. In the well studied bacterium known as <italic>E. coli</italic>, the primary sigma factor that is required for transcription initiation on most genes is called sigma 70. Recent research has shown that sigma 70 also influences the activity of RNA polymerase during elongation. During this stage, the RNA polymerase and several other proteins interact to form a complex called the transcription elongation complex (or TEC for short). However, it is not clear how sigma 70 gains access to this complex: does it simply remain with RNA polymerase after transcription starts, or is it freshly incorporated into the TEC during elongation?</p><p>Goldman, Nair et al. found that sigma 70 is able to incorporate into TECs during elongation and causes them to pause at specific sites in the gene. Sigma 70 can even incorporate into TECs on genes where transcription was initiated by a different sigma factor. These findings indicate that sigma 70 can directly influence the transcription of all genes, not just the genes with start sites that are recognized by this sigma factor.</p><p>Goldman et al. also observed that in cells that were growing and dividing rapidly, the pauses that occurred due to sigma 70 associating with TECs were of shorter duration than those in cells that were growing slowly. This implies that the growth status of the cells modulates the pausing of RNA polymerase during transcription. In the future, it will be important to understand how much influence the primary sigma factor has on RNA polymerase during elongation in <italic>E. coli</italic> and other bacteria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10514.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10514.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>bacterial transcription</kwd><kwd>sigma factor</kwd><kwd>transcription pausing</kwd><kwd>elongation factor</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM044025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochschild</surname><given-names>Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM088343</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nickels</surname><given-names>Bryce E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sigma subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase, classically known as an initiation factor, can also operate as an elongation factor with effects that vary with growth phase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The σ subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) is an essential initiation factor that specifies the recognition of promoter sequences in the context of the RNAP holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feklistov et al., 2014</xref>). All bacteria contain a primary σ factor that directs transcription from the major class of bacterial promoters; in addition, most bacteria contain multiple alternative σ factors that direct transcription from specialized promoters in response to stress or alterations in growth state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gruber and Gross, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Osterberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo and Gross, 2014</xref>). Among the best-studied primary σ factors is <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> σ<sup>70</sup>, which recognizes promoters that are defined by two conserved hexameric DNA sequence elements termed the −10 and the −35 elements (consensus sequences: TATAAT and TTGACA, respectively). Members of the σ<sup>70</sup> family share a conserved 4-domain architecture, with domain 2 contacting the −10 element and domain 4 contacting the −35 element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gross et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paget and Helmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feklistov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paget, 2015</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> also has six alternative σ factors, five of which are members of the σ<sup>70</sup> family and recognize similarly positioned promoter elements using the counterparts of σ<sup>70</sup> domains 2 and 4. Most alternative σ factors exhibit highly restricted promoter specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koo et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rhodius et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, genes that are responsive to disparate physiological inputs often carry two or more promoters that are recognized by distinct σ factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wade et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gama-Castro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although σ factors were historically identified as promoter specificity factors, it has become clear that their roles are not limited to the initiation phase of transcription. In particular, multiple studies have shown that the release of σ from the transcription complex is not required for entry into the elongation phase of transcription (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mooney et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perdue and Roberts, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the functional properties of a transcription elongation complex (TEC) containing σ differ from the properties of a TEC that does not contain σ. For example, TEC-associated σ<sup>70</sup> can induce transcription pausing by engaging promoter −10-like sequence elements within transcribed regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ring et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodolin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nickels et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hatoum and Roberts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deighan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perdue and Roberts, 2011</xref>), a phenomenon that was first uncovered in the context of the bacteriophage λ late gene promoter (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roberts et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perdue and Roberts, 2011</xref>). This pausing occurs due to an interaction between the −10-like element and domain 2 of TEC-associated σ<sup>70</sup> (the same domain of σ<sup>70</sup> that binds the promoter −10 element during transcription initiation). In addition, the presence or absence of σ can alter the accessibility of the TEC to elongation factors, including the λ Q protein and RfaH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roberts et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nickels et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sevostyanova et al., 2008</xref>), and can influence the ability of RNAP to reinitiate transcription at certain promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bar-Nahum and Nudler, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Initial-transcribed-region −10-like elements, such as those associated with the λ late promoters and the late promoters of other lambdoid phages, induce early elongation pausing because they are recognized by TECs that have not yet released the σ<sup>70</sup> that was used during initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marr et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nickels et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kapanidis et al., 2005</xref>). In prior work, we showed that such promoter-proximal σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent pause elements also function to inhibit σ<sup>70</sup> loss during the earliest stages of elongation, increasing the σ<sup>70</sup> content of downstream TECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deighan et al., 2011</xref>). This effect can be detected using a template that carries a second pause element positioned downstream of a promoter-proximal pause element; specifically, the presence of the promoter-proximal pause element facilitates the retention of σ<sup>70</sup> in the TEC and thus substantially enhances the extent of pausing induced by the downstream pause element both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deighan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although promoter −10-like elements that induce transcription pausing can be recognized by a σ<sup>70</sup> subunit that has been retained in the TEC after promoter escape, in vitro studies have established that transcribed region −10-like elements can also be recognized by a σ<sup>70</sup> subunit that was not present during initiation, but rather joined the TEC by loading <italic>in trans</italic> during elongation. Thus, it has been shown that the efficiency of pausing induced by transcribed region −10-like elements can be increased in vitro by increasing the concentration of free σ<sup>70</sup> in the transcription reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mooney and Landick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sevostyanova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deighan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sevostyanova et al., 2011</xref>). A key question that emerges from these in vitro findings is whether or not cellular conditions permit σ<sup>70</sup> to gain access to the TEC through this <italic>‘trans</italic>-acting pathway’ in vivo. Here we address this question by employing an assay that enables us to measure the extent of TEC pausing induced by a −10-like element within a transcribed region in vivo. We find that the extent of pausing induced by a transcribed-region −10-like element is sensitive to the intracellular concentration of σ<sup>70</sup>, indicating that σ<sup>70</sup> can gain access to the TEC <italic>in trans</italic>. We further establish that σ<sup>70</sup> can gain access to the TEC <italic>in trans</italic> and engage −10-like elements within transcribed regions that are expressed under the control of either a σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter or a promoter that is recognized by an alternative σ factor. In addition, we show that the extent of TEC pausing mediated by σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading varies as a function of growth-phase. Our findings imply that distinct σ factors can control initiation and elongation on the same transcription unit in vivo, and that the functional consequences of σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading vary as a function of growth state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Detection of σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading on a σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent transcription unit in vivo</title><p>To determine whether or not σ<sup>70</sup> can bind <italic>in trans</italic> to the TEC in vivo, we took advantage of the fact that TEC-associated σ<sup>70</sup> can induce transcription pausing by engaging transcribed-region −10-like elements. We therefore sought to determine whether or not the efficiency of pausing induced by a transcribed-region −10-like element was sensitive to the concentration of σ<sup>70</sup> present in vivo. To do this, we introduced into <italic>E. coli</italic> cells a plasmid carrying a σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter, λP<sub>R′</sub>, fused to a transcribed region containing a −10-like element that has the potential to induce σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent pausing at a nascent RNA length of ∼35 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deighan et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top); the transcription unit also contains an intrinsic terminator element (positioned to terminate transcription after the synthesis of an ∼116 nt transcript). Pausing induced by the −10-like element on this template in vitro is sensitive to the concentration of free σ<sup>70</sup> in the transcription reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deighan et al., 2011</xref>); furthermore, because the template lacks a promoter-proximal −10-like element, engagement of the pause element by σ<sup>70</sup> that is retained during the transition from initiation to elongation contributes minimally to the observed pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deighan et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10514.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading on a σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent transcription unit in vivo (MG1655).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Top:</italic> schematic of DNA template carrying λP<sub>R'</sub>, transcribed-region consensus extended –10 element (wild-type or mutant) and terminator (see ‘Materials and methods’ for the λP<sub>R′</sub> promoter sequence).

To detect nascent RNAs associated with paused TECs (pause RNAs) and full-length terminated transcripts produced from this template, we isolated total RNA and used Northern blotting with a locked-nucleic-acid (LNA) probe, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deighan et al., 2011</xref>). We quantified the extent of pausing by dividing the signal associated with a pause RNA by the sum of this signal and the signal associated with the full-length terminated transcript (hereafter termed relative abundance). We found that the relative abundance of a ∼35-nt pause RNA (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deighan et al., 2011</xref>) increased ∼fivefold when σ<sup>70</sup> was overproduced by a factor of ∼7, compared to that observed in cells containing chromosomally encoded σ<sup>70</sup> only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the ∼35-nt pause RNA was barely detected with or without excess σ<sup>70</sup> using a control template carrying base-pair substitutions that disrupt sequence-specific recognition of the transcribed-region −10-like element by σ<sup>70</sup> region 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deighan et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We conclude that pausing of the TEC under the control of a −10-like element within a transcribed region is sensitive to the intracellular concentration of σ<sup>70</sup>, suggesting that σ<sup>70</sup> can access the TEC <italic>in trans</italic>, in vivo.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether or not σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading could augment the effect of a promoter-proximal pause element on the σ<sup>70</sup> content of downstream TECs. To do this, we used LNA probe-hybridization to detect transcripts produced from the template shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. This λP<sub>R′</sub> template bears the same −10-like element as the template shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, but in addition carries a promoter-proximal −10-like element (positioned between +1 and +6) that induces σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent pausing at a nascent RNA length of ∼16 nt. Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deighan et al., 2011</xref>), the presence of the promoter-proximal −10-like element resulted in a substantial increase (∼ninefold) in the relative abundance of the ∼35-nt pause species (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Nonetheless, when σ<sup>70</sup> was overproduced, the relative abundance of the ∼35-nt pause species increased further (∼1.5 fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, middle and bottom panels), indicating that the effect of the promoter-proximal −10-like element on the σ<sup>70</sup> content of downstream TECs is not saturating.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Detection of σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading on a transcription unit expressed under the control of an alternative sigma factor in vitro and in vivo</title><p>We next sought to determine whether or not free σ<sup>70</sup> can bind to TECs on a transcription unit controlled by an alternative σ factor. To address this possibility we generated a new template that carried a promoter recognized by RNAP holoenzyme carrying σ<sup>28</sup>, an alternative σ factor that controls the expression of genes involved in flagellar synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chilcott and Hughes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koo et al., 2009a</xref>). This σ<sup>28</sup> dependent promoter (P<italic>tar</italic>) was fused to the same transcribed region sequences that are present on the λP<sub>R′</sub> template shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> starting at position +6 (including the −10-like element; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We first performed in vitro transcription experiments to determine whether or not σ<sup>70</sup> could access the TEC and induce pausing on this template. We formed open complexes on P<italic>tar</italic> using RNAP holoenzyme containing σ<sup>28</sup> and then allowed a single round of transcription to occur in the absence or presence of excess σ<sup>70</sup>. We monitored the RNA content of each reaction at three time points after the initiation of transcription. Addition of σ<sup>70</sup> to the transcription reactions resulted in the appearance of a cluster of RNAs ∼35-nt in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 1–3). These RNAs were not observed when reactions were performed using a control template carrying disruptive base-pair substitutions within the transcribed-region −10-like element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 7–12). A set of reactions performed in the presence of σ<sup>70</sup> but in the absence of σ<sup>28</sup> confirmed that appearance of the cluster of ∼35-nt RNAs is strictly dependent on transcription that initiates from P<italic>tar</italic> under the control of σ<sup>28</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 13–15).

In particular, pausing mediated by chromosomally encoded <italic>trans</italic>-loaded σ<sup>70</sup> was detectable during the exponential phase of growth and this pausing became more prominent during stationary phase. Our experiments revealed that this increase in the relative abundance of the pause species during stationary phase was explained at least in part by an increase in pause half-life in stationary phase cells as compared to exponentially growing cells.

Our findings illustrate another mechanism whereby the combined input of multiple σ factors can modulate gene expression. Specifically, we show that distinct σ factors can direct initiation and modulate elongation on the same transcription unit. Such ‘σ cross regulation’ might enable the cell to integrate signals transmitted via σ<sup>70</sup> and an alternative σ factor to modulate gene expression within a single transcription unit under the control of a non σ<sup>70</sup>–dependent promoter. In principle there are several ways that σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading might modulate gene expression. First, as shown here, σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading can cause the TEC to pause, which is expected to influence transcription output directly in a manner that depends on pause half-life (and, as suggested by our results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, may become particularly relevant in stationary phase). σ<sup>70</sup>–dependent pausing might also influence gene expression indirectly, by facilitating engagement of regulatory factors, influencing formation of RNA secondary structures, or influencing translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roberts et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wickiser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan and Sosnick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lemay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perdrizet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nechooshtan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belogurov and Artsimovitch, 2015</xref>). Second, σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading might impede the accessibility of the TEC to other elongation factors such as NusG or RfaH, which share the same primary binding site on RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sevostyanova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mooney et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Future work will be required to investigate the extent to which σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading contributes to gene expression through these or other mechanisms. In this regard, the application of sequencing-based methodologies such as native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vvedenskaya et al., 2014</xref>) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Myers et al., 2015</xref>) should enable the identification of transcription units that manifest growth phase-dependent pausing attributable to <italic>trans</italic> loaded σ<sup>70</sup>.

All three reviewers were concerned about the relevance of the σ<sup>70</sup> overproduction. If this critique can be addressed by additional experiments that identify physiological conditions where σ<sup>70</sup> levels increase dramatically or examine the effects of an alternative σ factor on transcription elongation initiated from a σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter you might consider sending the manuscript back to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This brief paper is a “proof-of-concept” study that establishes the potential for loading of σ<sup>70</sup> in <italic>trans</italic> at sites downstream of transcription start sites to regulate transcript elongation in vivo. The authors demonstrate that σ<sup>70</sup> loads in <italic>trans</italic> at a −10-like element downstream of the λP<sub>R</sub> promoter in vivo, that it increases pausing at this site, that σ<sup>70</sup> can load downstream even when the transcript is initiated at a promoter directed by an alternative holoenzyme (Es28; thus establishing that σ<sup>70</sup> really is loading in trans), that the level of the resulting pause increases in a σ<sup>70</sup> concentration-dependent manner (further evidence that the effect is exerted in trans), and that the total fraction of transcripts that pause is additive with the effect in <italic>cis</italic> of a σ binding site in the initial transcribed region. The effects are small at natural concentrations of σ<sup>70</sup> but quite strong when σ<sup>70</sup> is overproduced. The experiments are well-designed, the results are clear, and the description is precise. These are important findings, building on a proposal from the Landick lab about 10 years ago from experiments with a σ factor fused to core RNAP. The potential that specific operons are regulated by either free σ<sup>70</sup> or other σ factors at entry sites within the coding regions of operons is enticing. A few ideas for improvements in presentation are listed below, but otherwise the paper is ready to go.</p><p>1) It is not clear to me why <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is presented after the cartoon/summary slide in the Discussion. It seems like it would make more sense to present <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, just after <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, in the Results section, before the summary slide in the Discussion section. The experiment pictured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is, after all, an important Result. Its presentation in the Discussion makes it seem like an afterthought.</p><p>2) Although the technical quality of the paper is high, the importance of σ binding in <italic>trans</italic> to transcription in native operons at levels of σ that exist in nature awaits further studies. The amount of pausing induced by native levels of σ<sup>70</sup> appears to be fairly low, and there is no nutritional/environmental condition to my knowledge when σ<sup>70</sup> is overproduced. This should be acknowledged in a more forthright manner, but some potential conditions when such a phenomenon might influence transcription might be expanded on. For example, most of the alternative σ factors are induced naturally, some to quite high levels, and one could imagine that binding sites for these σs at strategic positions in the transcribed region might transiently influence elongation in <italic>trans</italic>.</p><p>3) Another direction for the future that might be introduced in the Discussion to add to the impact of the present study would be a genome-wide analysis of the transcriptome following induction of one or more σs. These might turn up candidates for further exploration of in <italic>trans</italic> effects of σ binding at natural levels of σ.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The Hochschild and Nickels labs have previously shown that the initial-transcribed sequences, sequences that lead to pausing of RNA polymerase due to interactions of σ<sup>70</sup> region 2 with −10 -like sequences, affect the content of σ<sup>70</sup> in transcription elongation complexes (TECs) in vivo. In addition, they showed that increases in the concentration of σ<sup>70</sup> increased the efficiency of pausing in vitro.</p><p>In this manuscript, they test the in vivo effect of changes in the intracellular concentration of σ<sup>70</sup> on the proportion of TECs that contain σ<sup>70</sup>. The results presented indicate that in vivo increases in the concentration of σ<sup>70</sup> lead to increases of its content in TECs whether the TECs originate from σ<sup>70</sup> or σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent promoters. The results provide further evidence to the growing appreciation of the role of σ factors as a component of the elongation machinery with its implications such as: 1) the ability to affect directly the behavior of the elongation complex through pausing with possible consequences for regulating translation, 2) the ability to compete with or recruit other elongation factors, or 3) trans-regulation of elongation complexes originating from alternative σ factor-dependent promoters.</p><p>Requiring clarification:</p><p>The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is performed at a 6–7 fold increase in the concentration of σ<sup>70</sup> over wild-type conditions. Under what experimental conditions is that increase expected in the absence of over-production? Or how sensitive is the response to increases in the concentration of σ<sup>70</sup>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Goldman et al. aims at demonstrating the action of the <italic>E. coli</italic> primary transcription initiation σ factor, σ<sup>70</sup>, upon transcript elongation, both in vitro and in vivo. Unfortunately, the manuscript under review falls far short of its stated aim and cannot be recommended for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form.</p><p>It is a generally accepted view in the transcription field that shortly after synthesis of 30–50 nt-long RNA by a bacterial RNA polymerase, the initiation/σ factor is released from the transcription complex, likely in competition with nascent RNA and/or elongation factors, such as NusG. Apart from the promoter-proximal σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent pausing, no convincing data exists pointing to the larger role of initiation factor during the elongation phase of transcription. Goldman et al. do not go beyond this already established fact (by focusing on promoter-proximal pausing), nor do they add any new information or nuance to the subject matter. In fact the experiments reported in the manuscript are fairly limited in scope whereas their interpretations are rather over-reaching.</p><p>All the experiments reported by Goldman et al. focus on promoter-proximal transcription events, in fact the entire length of the templates used both in vitro and in vivo is ∼116 bp (from the start site to terminator). These offer no new insights into the σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent pausing per se, while the trans-loading onto early elongation complexes formed by σ28-containing holoenzymes is a fairly trivial observation. The significance of the manuscript's “findings” is dramatically overstated: e.g. the “control” of elongation by σ<sup>70</sup> in vitro is not quantified in terms of elongation rate, pausing efficiency or pause half-life, instead the reader is presented with a (phosphor)image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) s/he can only eyeball. Based on such eyeballing this reviewer concludes that the σ<sup>70</sup> effects on elongation are minimal (judging by the apparent “amount” of full-length product) and limited to the induction of promoter-proximal arrest or termination in a small fraction of complexes. These complexes are labeled as “pause” on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> without any merit: there is no apparent time-decay (escape from the pause site), and no discernable escape from these “pauses” for up to 18 min (lanes 6 and 18). Moreover, it was not determined whether or not the shorter transcripts were still associated with RNA polymerase (which would distinguish paused/arrested complexes from terminated ones). As such, all that can be asserted from these experiments is the changes in RNA length. The same applies to the in vivo experiments reported by Goldman et al. Physical loading of σ<sup>70</sup> onto elongation complexes has not been demonstrated either in vivo or in vitro which in turn means that Goldman et al. should limit their conclusions to a simple correlation between the concentration of σ<sup>70</sup> and the abundance of the short transcripts produced from a handful of artificial templates.</p><p>The technical aspect of the work reported by Goldman et al. is confusing. This is especially evident in the description of their in vitro experiments: the authors claim to initiate transcription in vitro by adding together MgCl2 (which supplies catalytic Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and rifampicin (which inhibits transcription initiation by restricting nascent RNA synthesis to the first 3–4 nt) to the pre-formed open complexes. In single-round transcription assays, rifampicin is routinely added after the elongation complex is stalled (by selective NTP deprivation) in proximity to the promoter (and is no longer sensitive to it) to prevent re-initiation. As described by Goldman et al. the single-round assay would be a no-round one and the transcripts depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> could not have been obtained as described in the Materials and methods.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to make such assays quantitative the radioactively labeled nucleotide is usually supplied at the initiation stage and is incorporated into a defined length of RNA (essentially an end-labeling). This nucleotide is later removed (e.g. by gel-filtration) or diluted to negligible levels by the excess of the unlabeled one in the chase/extension mix. This way the amount of radioactivity in RNA is practically length-independent, enabling quantitative kinetic analysis of pausing, termination, etc. In contrast, in experiments described by Goldman et al. both labeled and un-labeled UTP are present in the reaction mix together from the start and no measure is mentioned that was taken to remove/dilute P32-labeled one. This makes the amount of radioactivity in the transcript dependent on its length and sequence (more radioactivity is incorporated as the transcript grows) rendering any quantitative interpretation of the data impractical.</p><p>The conclusions Goldman et al. derive from their in vivo experiments call for greater scope and technical sophistication of experimentation than the ones employed (i.e. monitoring the levels of transcripts produced from 2 short artificial templates by LNA hybridization and of 2 proteins by Western blotting). High-throughput/deep sequencing and mass-spectrometry allow for much more rigorous and quantitative monitoring of the proposed control σ<sup>70</sup> exerts over various stages of transcription in vivo (and incidentally of the impact its overexpression would have on the proteome outside its own concentration). These methods are presently accessible and affordable enough to make the approach chosen by Goldman et al. seem somewhat myopic in scope, and archaic in design.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled “The primary σ factor in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> can access the transcription elongation complex from solution in vivo” for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors should discuss whether trans-loading is just an accidental process or plays a meaningful role in the cell and what approaches will be needed to address the biological significance of trans-loading in the future.</p><p>2) In experiments designed to compare the level of transcripts originating from plasmids in exponentially growing cells with those in stationary phase no effort was made to ascertain whether the plasmid levels (copy numbers) remained equal at the two growth stages (most likely were not).

We believe that our revised manuscript addresses the main overall critique of our original manuscript – namely that we had not identified a physiological condition under which σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading could be expected to have a significant effect on transcription in the cell. We now show that the effect of σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading on transcription pausing becomes highly significant in the absence of ectopically produced σ<sup>70</sup> when the cells are in stationary phase. In particular, we observe an −10-fold increase in the abundance of the pause species in stationary-phase cells as compared to exponential-phase cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of the revised manuscript). The use of a σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent transcription unit to demonstrate this growth phase- dependent effect of σ<sup>70</sup> on transcription pausing establishes unequivocally that the effect is due to <italic>trans</italic>-loaded σ<sup>70</sup> and not σ<sup>70</sup> that has been retained following the transition from initiation to elongation.

The amount of pausing induced by native levels of σ</italic><sup><italic>70</italic></sup> <italic>appears to be fairly low, and there is no nutritional/environmental condition to my knowledge when σ</italic><sup><italic>70</italic></sup> <italic>is overproduced. This should be acknowledged in a more forthright manner, but some potential conditions when such a phenomenon might influence transcription might be expanded on. For example, most of the alternative σ factors are induced naturally, some to quite high levels, and one could imagine that binding sites for these σs at strategic positions in the transcribed region might transiently influence elongation in trans</italic>.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we describe a condition that leads to a high degree of pausing in the absence of ectopically produced σ<sup>70</sup>. In particular, we now show that the effect of σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading on transcription pausing manifests a dramatic growth phase dependence. Thus, we observe an ∼10-fold increase in the abundance of the pause species in stationary-phase cells as compared to exponential-phase cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of the revised manuscript). The amount of pausing we detect in stationary phase cells containing chromosomally encoded σ<sup>70</sup> only is greater than that detected during exponential phase with σ<sup>70</sup> overproduction. A rifampicin time-course experiment suggests that the observed increase in the abundance of the pause species is due, at least in part, to a decrease in pause half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Although we did not detect an increase in the total cellular concentration of σ<sup>70</sup> in stationary phase, we cannot exclude the possibility that the amount of free σ<sup>70</sup> available to bind the TEC varies with growth phase.</p><p><italic>3) Another direction for the future that might be introduced in the Discussion to add to the impact of the present study would be a genome-wide analysis of the transcriptome following induction of one or more σs. These might turn up candidates for further exploration of in</italic> trans <italic>effects of σ binding at natural levels of σ</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer and intend to use NET-seq (with an epitope-tagged version of σ<sup>70</sup>) to perform such genome-wide analyses.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>Requiring clarification</italic>:</p><p><italic>The experiment in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>is performed at a 6–7 fold increase in the concentration of σ</italic><sup><italic>70</italic></sup> <italic>over wild-type conditions.

With regard to the sensitivity of the response, we note that in the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (with the P<italic>tar</italic> template) a comparable increase in σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent pausing is observed with only an ∼3-fold increase in the concentration of σ<sup>70</sup>.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>[…] It is a generally accepted view in the transcription field that shortly after synthesis of 30-50 nt-long RNA by a bacterial RNA polymerase, the initiation/σ factor is released from the transcription complex, likely in competition with nascent RNA and/or elongation factors, such as NusG. Apart from the promoter-proximal σ</italic><sup><italic>70</italic></sup><italic>-dependent pausing, no convincing data exists pointing to the larger role of initiation factor during the elongation phase of transcription. Goldman et al. do not go beyond this already established fact (by focusing on promoter-proximal pausing), nor do they add any new information or nuance to the subject matter. In fact the experiments reported in the manuscript are fairly limited in scope whereas their interpretations are rather over-reaching</italic>.</p><p>Although σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent pausing has indeed been well established, our finding that such pausing can occur in vivo due to <italic>trans</italic> loaded σ<sup>70</sup> is new. We believe that our revised manuscript provides strong evidence for physiological relevance with the new demonstration that the abundance of paused species due to <italic>trans</italic> loaded σ<sup>70</sup> is dramatically increased during stationary phase.</p><p><italic>All the experiments reported by Goldman et al. focus on promoter-proximal transcription events, in fact the entire length of the templates used both in vitro and in vivo is ∼ 116 bp (from the start site to terminator). These offer no new insights into the σ</italic><sup><italic>70</italic></sup><italic>-dependent pausing per se, while the trans-loading onto early elongation complexes formed by σ</italic><sup><italic>28</italic></sup><italic>-containing holoenzymes is a fairly trivial observation</italic>.</p><p>Our experimental system enables the detection of pausing events that occur relatively close to the promoter. But as these events are unambiguously occurring during the elongation phase of transcription, we do not believe their significance is diminished by their promoter-proximal location. We note that the 5’- untranslated region is the locus of many well characterized examples of post-initiation transcription regulation, and that early elongation pausing is emerging as a theme in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription. With also wish to emphasize that the use of a σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent transcription unit for our experiments enables us to distinguish unequivocally between pausing due to retained σ<sup>70</sup> and pausing due to <italic>trans</italic> loaded σ<sup>70</sup>. And, as noted above, the growth phase dependence of pausing due to <italic>trans</italic> loaded σ<sup>70</sup> that we now report suggests that such pausing has the potential to influence the entire transcriptome.</p><p><italic>The significance of the manuscript's “findings” is dramatically overstated: e.g. the “control” of elongation by σ</italic><sup><italic>70</italic></sup> <italic>in vitro is not quantified in terms of elongation rate, pausing efficiency or pause half-life, instead the reader is presented with a (phosphor)image (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>) s/he can only eyeball. Based on such eyeballing this reviewer concludes that the σ</italic><sup><italic>70</italic></sup> <italic>effects on elongation are minimal (judging by the apparent “amount” of full-length product) and limited to the induction of promoter-proximal arrest or termination in a small fraction of complexes. These complexes are labeled as “pause” on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>without any merit: there is no apparent time-decay (escape from the pause site), and no discernable escape from these “pauses” for up to 18 min (lanes 6 and 18)</italic>.</p><p>We wish to clarify that the purpose of our study is to investigate whether or not σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading occurs in vivo, and what it’s potential impact might be. As cited in the manuscript, σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading in vitro has been demonstrated previously. The point of the in vitro transcription experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is simply to establish a correspondence between the pause species that arise when transcription initiates from <sup>λP</sup><sub>R'</sub> (as reported previously) and those that arise when transcription initiates from a σ<sup>28</sup>-dependent promoter. Our previous study with the <sup>λP</sup><sub>R'</sub> template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deighan et al., 2011</xref>) established the identity of the ∼35-nt RNAs as σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent pause species based on 4 characteristics, including their sensitivity to the transcript cleavage factor GreB and their sensitivity to a mutation in σ<sup>70</sup> that causes a defect in σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent pausing. In the context of the current study, we did not think it appropriate to repeat these tests. In the revised manuscript, we now clarify that the transcription reactions were performed in the absence of GreA and GreB, which accounts for the long-lived pause species (see legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); in Deighan et al., we show that the pause species chase very quickly when GreB is added to the reactions.</p><p><italic>Moreover, it was not determined whether or not the shorter transcripts were still associated with RNA polymerase (which would distinguish paused/arrested complexes from terminated ones). As such, all that can be asserted from these experiments is the changes in RNA length. The same applies to the in vivo experiments reported by Goldman et al. Physical loading of σ</italic><sup><italic>70</italic></sup> <italic>onto elongation complexes has not been demonstrated either in vivo or in vitro which in turn means that Goldman et al. should limit their conclusions to a simple correlation between the concentration of σ</italic><sup><italic>70</italic></sup> <italic>and the abundance of the short transcripts produced from a handful of artificial templates</italic>.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we have addressed the reviewer’s concern about whether or not the short (∼35-nt) RNA species observed in vivo actually represent pause RNAs. Specifically, we have shown that these species are RNAP-associated by performing immunoprecipitation experiments using a strain that encodes the RNAP β’ subunit with a C-terminal 3xFLAG tag (see new panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p><italic>The technical aspect of the work reported by Goldman et al. is confusing. This is especially evident in the description of their in vitro experiments: the authors claim to initiate transcription in vitro by adding together MgCl2 (which supplies catalytic Mg</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup><italic>) and rifampicin (which inhibits transcription initiation by restricting nascent RNA synthesis to the first 3–4 nt) to the pre-formed open complexes. In single-round transcription assays, rifampicin is routinely added after the elongation complex is stalled (by selective NTP deprivation) in proximity to the promoter (and is no longer sensitive to it) to prevent re-initiation. As described by Goldman et al. the single-round assay would be a no-round one and the transcripts depicted in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>could not have been obtained as described in the Materials and methods</italic>.</p><p>We neglected to specify in the original manuscript that this is a well-established procedure for initiating single-round transcription, which is effective because most of the transcription complexes escape into productive elongation before rifampicin reaches its binding site on RNAP. We now clarify this point by citing several prior studies that use this method to initiate single-round transcription (including two of a large number of papers from the Roberts lab over a 30-year period).</p><p><italic>Furthermore, in order to make such assays quantitative the radioactively labeled nucleotide is usually supplied at the initiation stage and is incorporated into a defined length of RNA (essentially an end-labeling). This nucleotide is later removed (e.g. by gel-filtration) or diluted to negligible levels by the excess of the unlabeled one in the chase/extension mix. This way the amount of radioactivity in RNA is practically length-independent, enabling quantitative kinetic analysis of pausing, termination, etc. In contrast, in experiments described by Goldman et al. both labeled and un-labeled UTP are present in the reaction mix together from the start and no measure is mentioned that was taken to remove/dilute P32-labeled one. This makes the amount of radioactivity in the transcript dependent on its length and sequence (more radioactivity is incorporated as the transcript grows) rendering any quantitative interpretation of the data impractical</italic>.</p><p>As we hope we have clarified, we are not attempting to make any quantitative argument about the in vitro data. The focus of our study is the question of what occurs in vivo.</p><p><italic>The conclusions Goldman et al. derive from their in vivo experiments call for greater scope and technical sophistication of experimentation than the ones employed (i.e. monitoring the levels of transcripts produced from 2 short artificial templates by LNA hybridization and of 2 proteins by Western blotting). High-throughput/deep sequencing and mass-spectrometry allow for much more rigorous and quantitative monitoring of the proposed control σ</italic><sup><italic>70</italic></sup> <italic>exerts over various stages of transcription in vivo (and incidentally of the impact its overexpression would have on the proteome outside its own concentration). These methods are presently accessible and affordable enough to make the approach chosen by Goldman et al. seem somewhat myopic in scope, and archaic in design</italic>.</p><p>We believe that a genome-wide analysis of the effects of σ<sup>70</sup> <italic>trans</italic> loading is beyond the scope of the current study, though we certainly agree that such experiments will be revealing. We do not agree with the reviewer’s assessment of our approaches in the study, which we believe are well suited to address the questions we sought to investigate.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Essential revisions</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The reviewers were not able to reach a consensus on whether genome-wide ChIP-seq and transcriptome-wide RNASeq studies were needed to address the physiological significance of trans-loading.

We conclude in the manuscript that the observed effect of growth phase on the extent of pausing is due “at least in part” to an increase in the half-life of the pause (Results, last sentence and Discussion, subsection “Dual pathways for σ<sup>70</sup> to associate with the TEC in vivo”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic>A</xref><italic>: Sequences upstream of +1 should be added up to the -35 element, since these determine the appearance of the (*) transcript</italic>.</p><p>We have included the sequences upstream of +1 for each promoter in the Materials and methods (and cited this in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).
