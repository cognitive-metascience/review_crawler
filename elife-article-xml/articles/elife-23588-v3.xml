Murine embryonic stem cells (mESC) were fused with human endothelial cells in stable, non-dividing, heterokaryons. Using RNA-seq, it is possible to discriminate between human and mouse transcripts in these chimeric heterokaryons. We observed a temporal pattern of gene expression in the ESCs of the heterokaryons that recapitulated ontogeny, with early mesodermal factors being expressed before mature endothelial genes. A set of transcriptional factors not known to be involved in endothelial development was upregulated, one of which was POU class 3 homeobox 2 (Pou3f2). We confirmed its importance in differentiation to endothelial lineage via loss- and gain-of-function (LOF and GOF). Its role in vascular development was validated in zebrafish embryos using morpholino oligonucleotides. These studies provide a systematic and mechanistic approach for identifying key regulators in directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to somatic cell lineages.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23588.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23588.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23588.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Endothelial cells form the inner surface of blood vessels, acting like a non-stick coating.

Accordingly, our methodologies for obtaining endothelial cells from pluripotent stem cells are empirically driven and suboptimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">James et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wong et al., 2012</xref>). There is unexplained inconsistency in the yield of iPSC-ECs; in the stability of their phenotype; and in the fidelity of differentiation (in terms of replicating the epigenetic and genetic profile of a mature endothelial cell). Furthermore, our ability to efficiently generate specific endothelial subtypes (e.g. arterial, venous, lymphatic) is poor. Thus, a systematic approach is needed to more completely define the genetic and epigenetic programs required for differentiating pluripotent stem cells to the endothelial phenotype. Here, we propose an unbiased systematic approach to discover determinants of differentiation. We use interspecies heterokaryons, RNA sequencing and third-generation bioinformatics to discover novel candidate genes critical for proper endothelial differentiation and specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Interspecies heterokaryons as a discovery tool</title><p>To discover new genes involved in endothelial specification, we made heterokaryons consisting of human endothelial cells (hEC) and murine embryonic stem cells (mESC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>), which expressed cell surface markers and characteristics of both cell types. We hypothesized that the factors that are actively maintaining endothelial phenotype (transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers and non-coding RNA etc) would act on the pluripotent stem cell nuclei to induce expression of key determinants of endothelial lineage. We reasoned that we could use RNA seq to monitor global changes in the transcriptome of the pluripotent nucleus as it is reprogrammed in the heterokaryon toward an endothelial fate. In 95% of cases, the species-specific nucleotide differences between the mouse and human transcripts would permit us to differentiate between reads of murine versus human transcripts when the sequences were aligned to their respective genomes.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23588.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Heterokaryon recapitulates gene expression of endothelial ontogeny.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Scheme for heterokaryon generation.

Since there is no nuclear fusion, chromosome rearrangement, or chromosome loss in the heterokaryons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhutani et al., 2010</xref>), we reasoned that this synchronization would permit us to study the temporal sequence of reprogramming to endothelial lineage using RNA seq. We optimized the cell fusion strategy using the fusagen HVJ (Sendai virus) envelope protein. By skewing the ratio of the input cells so that endothelial cells outnumbered pluripotent stem cells in the multinucleate heterokaryon, we forced reprogramming of the pluripotent stem cell nuclei toward an endothelial phenotype. To confirm that the system was working as anticipated, we assessed the expression of the mESC mRNA transcripts using murine-specific primers. In mESCs which were fused with human endothelial cells, we observed upregulation of murine endothelial genes including Kdr, Tie2, Cdh5 and Vwf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–g</xref>), and transcription factors involved in endothelial development such as Etv2, Ets1 and Tal1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l–n</xref>). Intriguingly, the expression of these genes seemed to mirror ontogeny, in that genes involved early in mesoderm specification (e.g. Kdr) were expressed earlier in the heterokaryon, whereas genes that are more specific to hemato-endothelial lineage (e.g. Von Willebrand factor) were expressed later. In parallel to the upregulation of genes involved in endothelial development, we observed down-regulation of genes encoding pluripotent factors (Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1o</xref>).</p><p>As a complementary approach, we generated heterokaryons consisting of murine endothelial cells (mEC) and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). We fused hiPSCs with mECs, and the expression of human mRNA transcripts was assessed using human specific primers. We observed in the pluripotent cells an upregulation of human genes including Kdr, Tie2, Cdh5 and Vwf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h–k</xref>), and transcription factors involved in endothelial development such as Etv2, Ets1 and Tal1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1p–r</xref>). Again, we observed a temporal sequence that mirrored ontogeny, with a parallel downregulation of genes encoding pluripotent factors (Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1s</xref>). These results demonstrate rapid induction of endothelial genes in the heterokaryon which appears to recapitulate endothelial development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>RNA seq for novel EC determinants</title><p>Having observed that the heterokaryon system seemed to mirror endothelial ontogeny, we applied RNA-seq to identify novel determinants of endothelial lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Heterokaryons were double-positive cells (GFP<sup>+</sup> for mESC and CellTracker Red<sup>+</sup> for hECs) and were harvested at 6–24 hr post-fusion. These time points were chosen based on our qPCR data, which showed rapid sequential activation of endothelial genes as early as 6 hr post-fusion. Total RNA (~2 ug) was isolated from heterokaryons or co-culture controls, and prepared for RNA-seq studies. We also did RNA-Seq for parental mESC; and for mESC that were exposed to an endothelial differentiation protocol for 4 or 8 days. We defined genes that are up- or down-regulated in each sample relative to the parental mESC. We were most interested in novel genes that encode transcriptional factors that are not known to be involved in mesodermal lineages or endothelial specification. We postulated that the heterokaryon system would be particularly useful to detect transcription factors that are transiently expressed during endothelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The RNAseq analysis of the heterokaryon samples (mESC/hEC) revealed a set of 1297 genes in the mESC that were upregulated as well as a set of 795 genes that were downregulated after fusion with hEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The upregulated genes included known endothelial related genes, for example, Kdr and Vwf, as well as hemangioblast markers, that is, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, CD143). Conversely, murine pluripotency markers were down-regulated. We identified some novel transcriptional factors (such as Tbx1, Cebpd, Nrarp, Pou3f2, Maf, Tbx20, Tigd5, Pdn and Batf2), and targeted one of these (Pou3f2) for further study.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23588.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Heterokaryon bi-species RNA-seq reveals transcriptome reprogramming during differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into endothelial lineages.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Heat map to show expression level of genes that are up- or down-regulated either uniquely in the Heterokaryon (Het) at 6 hr after fusion or commonly in all het samples relative to the mESC samples. mESCs were exposed to a standard endothelial differentiation protocol for 4 or 8 days.

By contrast, the transcriptome of mESC co-cultured (but not fused) with hECs bears a closer relationship to the transcriptome of the parental mESCs. Global gene function enrichment analysis indicates that differentially up- or down-regulated genes in the mESC in heterokaryons are similar to those in mESC exposed to the endothelial differentiation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). In particular, the upregulated genes in the heterokaryons tend to be involved in transcription regulation, RNA alternative splicing, DNA binding, embryonic organ development, differentiation and regulation of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), whereas downregulated genes are implicated in ATP and ribonucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). These results suggest that the heterokaryon system may serve as an effective model for cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Validation of Pou3f2 in differentiation to EC lineage</title><p>To validate our approach in discovery of novel determinants of cell lineage, we focused on Pou3f2, which was identified as a candidate EC transcription factor in the RNA seq studies. Accordingly, we examined the temporal sequence of gene expression of Pou3f2 in the heterokaryon system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The expression of Pou3f2 was up-regulated at 6-hr post-fusion and its expression then declined over the ensuing 48 hr. In addition, we examined <italic>Pou3f2</italic> expression during the differentiation of murine ESC to endothelial cells using our standard differentiation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Intriguingly, the pattern of expression was similar, albeit with a slower time course. Specifically, the expression of Pou3f2 increased from Day 3 to Day 7 and then declined in the later phase (11 days) of the endothelial differentiation protocol. Notably, the expression of other mesodermal and EC genes followed a similar pattern, in that their regulation was accelerated when ESCs were placed into heterokaryons versus the standard endothelial differentiation protocol. This observation is consistent with the notion that current differentiation protocols could be considerably improved.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23588.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Role of Pou3f2 as a novel transcription factor in endothelial differentiation from murine embryonic stem cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Gene expression pattern of Pou3f2 in heterokaryons consisting of mESC and hEC compared to Co-culture control.

We found that KD of Pou3f2 reduced the expression of endothelial genes including Kdr, Tie2, Nos3, Cdh5 and Vwf at Day 8 of the differentiation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Similarly, the expression of endothelial transcription factors such as Ets1, Erg, Etv2 and Fli1 were also reduced in the Pou3f2 KD mESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The KD of Pou3f2 in mESC did not affect the expression of mesoderm- (Bmp4, T), endoderm- (Cxcr4, Gata4) or ectoderm- (Pax6 and Nestin) related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Notably, the generation of mESC-derived CD31<sup>+</sup> and CD144<sup>+</sup> cells were reduced by over 50% in Pou3f2 <italic>KD</italic> group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). Furthermore, Pou3f2 <italic>KD m</italic>ESC-derived endothelial cells manifested poor network formation on matrigel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). To summarize, Pou3f2 seems to be necessary for the full expression of genes known to be involved in endothelial development, and for the efficient generation of fully functioning endothelial cells. Amongst the factors released from endothelial cells in the heterokaryons that could control Pou3f2 expression there is Wnt and β-catenin. The Wnt/B-catenin signalling pathway is highly conserved and regulates vascular cell fate and development through Dll4/Notch signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corada et al., 2010</xref>). The promoter for the Pou3f2 gene is a direct target for β-catenin/Lef1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodall et al., 2004a</xref>). Endothelial cells in the heterokaryon might also contribute phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to activate Pou3f2. The PI3K pathway mediates angiogenesis and the expression of growth factors in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>) and also regulates Pou3f2 in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonvin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Importance of Pou3f2 in EC development</title><p>Pou3f2 promotes neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaegle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dominguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sugitani et al., 2002</xref>). Specifically, it activates the Notch ligand Delta1, synergistically with Mash1, to maintain a subset of neural progenitors in an undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castro et al., 2006</xref>), whereas it suppresses the Notch effector Hes5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dominguez et al., 2013</xref>) that negatively regulate transcription of neurogenesis-promoting genes Neuregulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>). In human melanoma spheres and tumor xenograft, Pou3f2 is proposed to induce the Notch pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thurber et al., 2011</xref>). In our studies, the importance of <italic>Pou3f2</italic> in endothelial development in vivo was assessed using the zebrafish model. The availability of transgenics expressing endothelial-specific fluorescent reporters, for example Tg(<italic>fli1:EGFP</italic>)<sup>y1</sup>, combined with the transparency of the embryo, facilitate visualization of vascular development and blood flow in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldessari and Mione, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ellertsdóttir et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Holden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamei et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In situ hybridization for <italic>Pou3f2</italic> showed that this transcription factor is expressed in most embryo structures, although the staining is particularly evident in the brain region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because endothelial and hematopoietic cells share a common progenitor, we assessed the expression of <italic>Pou3f2</italic> in both endothelium and hematopoietic cells. To do so, we purified GFP+ cells from <italic>tg(fli1:EGFP)<sup>y1</sup></italic> or <italic>tg(cmyb:GFP)</italic> embryos. We found expression of <italic>Pou3f2</italic> in both type of cells, although more pronounced in the GFP+ cells from <italic>tg(fli1:EGFP)<sup>y1</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Injection of morpholino targeting <italic>Pou3f2</italic> (the relevant zebrafish analogue) resulted in 100% embryo death, as embryo could not reach 50% epiboly stage, at 5.3 hr post-fertilization. Both Pou3f2-targeted morpholinos caused the same effects. Therefore, we used light-activated cyclic caged morpholinos against <italic>Pou3f2</italic> to study the role of this gene in vascular development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–d</xref>). When the Pou3f2-targeted morpholino was activated by UV light at six hpf the embryo survival was around 80%. We observed a general phenotype characterized by curved body and curly tail, and specific dysmorphogenesis of the vascular system in most of the <italic>tg(fli1:EGFP)<sup>y1</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). A reduced number of intersegmental vessels (ISVs) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–c</xref>), which could be rescued with <italic>Pou3f2</italic> mRNA. In situ hybridization showed that <italic>Fli1</italic> and <italic>Kdr</italic> were downregulated following <italic>Pou3f2</italic> KD, particularly evident in the intersegmental vessels, confirming the role for <italic>Pou3f2</italic> in endothelial development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). These results were confirmed by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), where <italic>Fli1</italic> and <italic>Kdr</italic> were significantly reduced in <italic>Pou3f2</italic> knockdown embryos compared to control. Effective knockdown by the morpholino in zebrafish embryos was documented by Western blotting using a <italic>Pou3f2-</italic>specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). In addition, there was a global reduction of endothelial cells in <italic>Pou3f2</italic> KD animals. Specifically, the percentage of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from the <italic>tg(fli1:EGFP)<sup>y1</sup></italic> zebrafish embryos at 24 hr post-fertilization was 6.7% of total cells in control compared to 3.7% following <italic>Pou3f2</italic> KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f–g</xref>). Injection of Pou3f2-targeted caged morpholino in tg(<italic>cmyb:GFP</italic>) did not significantly reduce the percentage of GFP+ cells, suggesting that <italic>Pou3f2</italic> is more critical for endothelial rather than hematopoietic development. Notably, caged MO activation at 24 hpf or later did not produce a significant phenotype, indicating that <italic>Pou3f2</italic> is necessary early in endothelial development, but is not required for maintenance of the endothelial phenotype. This observation is consistent with the lack of expression of Pou3f2 in mature endothelial cells. Our studies suggest that Pou3f2 could act upstream of Notch during endothelial, as well as neuronal development. In this regard, Pou3f2 could have a role in the human vascular diseases caused by mutations in Notch family members, such as Alagille syndrome and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loomes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joutel et al., 1997</xref>). As Notch signaling is also required for arterio-venous differentiation during vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lawson et al., 2001</xref>), this suggests that Pou3f2 could be also upstream of the eph-ephrin system and play a role in arterio-venous specification. Pou3f2 gene expression seems to be controlled by MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodall et al., 2004b</xref>) and Wnt/β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodall et al., 2004a</xref>) signaling, two key pathways linked to cell proliferation. Pou3f2 function can be also modulated by posttranslational modifications including sumoylation, ubiquitinylation, glycosylation and in particular phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasibhatla et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augustijn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diamond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nieto et al., 2007</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23588.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Pou3f2 knockdown in the <italic>tg(fli1:EGFP)<sup>y1</sup></italic> zebrafish embryo.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Bright-field images of embryos injected with caged morpholino against <italic>Pou3f2</italic> translation start site in the absence of photoactivation (control), or with photoactivation with UV light at 6 or 24 hpf.

Murine ESCs (D3, ATCC, Manassus, VA) of the SV129 strain were cultured on gelatin-coated dish and maintained in ESGRO media plus GSK3β inhibitors. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) (obtained from Lonza, Walkersville, MD) and murine endothelial cells (obtained from Applied Stemcell, Menlo Park, CA) were cultured in EC growth medium EGM-2 MV (cc-3162). Cells were used for all experiments at passage 6–8.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Heterokaryon formation and isolation</title><p>One day before cell fusion, 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> endothelial cells were seeded on one well of a 6-well dish. The endothelial cells were confluent on the day of cell fusion. On the same day, 1 hr prior to cell fusion, the endothelial cell medium was replaced with fresh EGM-2 MV medium supplemented with 1 μM Cell Tracker Red, then cells were incubated at 37°C in darkness for 30 min. Human iPSCs or murine ESCs labeled by transduction with retroviruses encoding GFP were rinsed with PBS followed by accutase treatment at 37°C for 5 min to dissociate the pluripotent stem cells into single-cell suspension. The cells were then collected in conical tubes after neutralization by MEF media containing 10% FBS. The cells were then counted with hemocytometer and 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> pluripotent stem cells were taken. The cells were then centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min at 4°C, the supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 25 μL ice-cold cell fusion buffer with 2.5 μL ice-cold HVJ-envelope fusagen. The reaction mixture was placed on ice for 5 min with regular agitation in 2.5 min apart. After 5 min, the cells were centrifuged again and the supernatant was discarded and 2 ml cell fusion buffer was added. The pluripotent cells were then plated onto the endothelial cells. The six-well dish was then centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min at 4°C. After centrifugation the dish was placed into a 37°C incubator to induce cell fusion. Twenty minutes later, the medium was removed and EGM-2 MV medium was added. For the Co-culture Control, the described procedure was the same except HVJ-enveloped fusagen was not added. The heterokaryons (double-positive cells) can be efficiently sorted by FACS. Heterokaryons (GFP<sup>+</sup> and CellTracker Red<sup>+</sup>) were harvested by FACS at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hr post-fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Preparation of RNA-seq libraries and sequencing</title><p>The species-specific nucleotide differences between the mouse and human transcripts enable us to differentiate between reads of transcripts from the murine ESC versus those from the human EC when the sequences are aligned to their respective genomes. Heterokaryons (GFP<sup>+</sup> and CellTracker Red<sup>+</sup>) were harvested by FACS at 6, 12 and 24 hr post-fusion and prepared for analysis by RNA-seq. Total RNA from heterokaryons were isolated. Human and mouse mRNA transcripts were isolated from the total RNA samples using polyA-based enrichment using oligo-dT magnetic beads. The majority of contaminating ribosomal RNA was eliminated by this approach. The resulting mRNA was fragmented, reverse transcribed to cDNA, ligated to adapters, and subject to brief PCR amplification in preparation of the Illumina library. The integrity and quality of RNA and complementary DNA were monitored using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. The samples were sequenced using pair-end 100 base-pair reads. For the estimation of gene expression and data analysis, any remaining ribosomal reads were discarded, and the resulting murine and human transcripts were mapped to their respective genomes. Reads that map to both transcriptomes would be discarded and the RPKMs adjusted accordingly (discarded reads represent only 5% of the total reads; furthermore, virtually all genes have at least one unique read that is different between species, so that no gene is completely discarded).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>RNA-seq read mapping and gene expression</title><p>RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the mouse genome version mm9 using TopHat version 2.1.0.

RNA-Seq read counts for each gene in each sample was calculated using Cuffdiff function in Cufflinks version 2.2.1. The Cuffdiff also calculates fragment per kilobase per million reads (FPKM) for each gene. We further subject the reads counts to EdgeR version 3.12.0 for differential expression analysis, and define differential genes based on false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff 1e-5. We subject interesting gene groups to the DAVID website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov">https://david.ncifcrf.gov</ext-link>) for functional enrichment analysis. Enriched functional terms were defined based on Benjamini adjusted p value cut-off 0.05. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression heatmap was conducted using MEV based on Pearson correlation distance metric and the average linkage method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>RNA extraction and quantitative PCR</title><p>Using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), total RNA was extracted.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Daniel Garry (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers find that the paper describes an excellent study performed by well-known experts in the field establishing and validating chimeric heterokaryons as a novel approach to identify genes involved in endothelial development and differentiation. The authors use a wide array of state-of-the-art methods including RNA seq, ChIP, endothelial functional assays in murine and human cells and the zebrafish as in vivo model. They identified novel genes involved in endothelial differentiation and focused on the role of transcription factor POU3F2 as a novel master switch orchestrating endothelial development and differentiation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The factors released from endothelial cells controlling POU3F2 expression and activity in the chimeric heterokaryon model and mouse models should be discussed in more detail.</p><p>2) Please also discuss what is known about the regulation of POU3F2 in transgenic models of the Notch pathway and the Ephrin/Eph system, as POU3F2 seems to play a central role in arterio-venous differentiation. Also, provide a short discussion of potential upstream regulators of Pou3f2.</p><p>3) As many transcripts are commonly expressed in the endothelial and the hematopoietic lineages, it will be important to define the expression pattern for Pou3f2 in both the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages in either the mouse or the zebrafish embryos. Immunohistochemical and/or transcript expression (in situ hybridization) should be provided to demonstrate and define Pou3f2 expression in the developing mouse or zebrafish embryos.</p><p>4) More detailed characterization of the lethal phenotype of the Pouf2 knockdown (morpholino studies) in the zebrafish should be provided. Also, please specify if they are involved primarily in endothelial, hematopoietic or cardiac perturbations. Typically, more than one morpholino is evaluated to rule out off-target effects (in addition to the scrambled morpholino controls). Please specify if more than one morpholino has been used.</p><p>5) It would be helpful to provide one additional (conventional) technique (such as a dose response transcriptional assay and mutagenesis) to verify at least one of the downstream targets of Pou3f2. Immunohistochemical and/or transcript expression (in situ hybridization) should be included to demonstrate (and define) Pou3f2 expression in the developing mouse or zebrafish embryos.</p><p>6) Statistics should be indicated in the bar graphs of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B,C,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Overall this is a well-written and well organized manuscript that identifies Pou3f2 as an important transcriptional regulator of the endothelial lineage. Strategies and data obtained (as outlined in the manuscript) will be a benefit to the field. The heterokaryon strategy is interesting and as shown by the authors it was effective in identifying endothelial transcriptional activators. Although this is an excellent manuscript, additional experiments should be included to further enhance the impact of the discovery.</p><p>4) Typically more than one morpholino is evaluated to rule out off-target effects (in addition to the scrambled morpholino controls) – did the authors use more than one morpholino in their studies?</p><p>5) Provide a short discussion of potential upstream regulators of Pou3f2 in the Discussion section.</p><p>6) Provide one additional (conventional) technique (such as a dose response transcriptional assay and mutagenesis) to verify at least one of the downstream targets of Pou3f2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23588.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The factors released from endothelial cells controlling POU3F2 expression and activity in the chimeric heterokaryon model and mouse models should be discussed in more detail.</italic> </p><p>We now discuss potential molecules released from endothelial cells controlling Pou3f2 expression at the end of the subsection “Validation of Pou3f2 in differentiation to EC lineage”.</p><p><italic>2) Please also discuss what is known about the regulation of POU3F2 in transgenic models of the Notch pathway and the Ephrin/Eph system, as POU3F2 seems to play a central role in arterio-venous differentiation.
