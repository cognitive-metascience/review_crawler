IRE1 is the most conserved UPR sensor in eukaryotic cells. It has remained controversial, however, whether mammalian and yeast IRE1 use a common mechanism for ER stress sensing. Here, we show that similar to yeast, human IRE1α’s ER-lumenal domain (hIRE1α LD) binds peptides with a characteristic amino acid bias. Peptides and unfolded proteins bind to hIRE1α LD’s MHC-like groove and induce allosteric changes that lead to its oligomerization. Mutation of a hydrophobic patch at the oligomerization interface decoupled peptide binding to hIRE1α LD from its oligomerization, yet retained peptide-induced allosteric coupling within the domain. Importantly, impairing oligomerization of hIRE1α LD abolished IRE1’s activity in living cells. Our results provide evidence for a unifying mechanism of IRE1 activation that relies on unfolded protein binding-induced oligomerization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30700.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are long string-like molecules that fold into specific three-dimensional shapes. Most proteins that a cell uses to communicate with its environment are folded within a part of the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum. Dedicated sensor proteins in this cellular compartment track this process to make sure that it continues to meet the cell’s demand for protein folding. If it cannot meet the demand, unfolded or poorly folded proteins build up, which stresses the cell.</p><p>IRE1 is a sensor protein that detects stress in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is found in a range of organisms from yeast to humans, where it spans the membrane that encloses the endoplasmic reticulum. When unfolded proteins accumulate, IRE1 proteins come together and form so-called oligomers. The IRE1 oligomers then become active and send signals outside of the endoplasmic reticulum. These signals adjust the cell’s protein-folding capacity according to its needs at that time.</p><p>The yeast version of IRE1 directly recognizes unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Yet, its human counterpart was found to have a different three-dimensional structure, which suggested that it might use a different mechanism to detect the stress.</p><p>Now, Karagöz et al. show that, as in yeast, the sensor part of human IRE1 does indeed bind to unfolded proteins directly. This binding causes this part of the protein to engage other copies of IRE1 and form the oligomers. To understand this interaction in more detail, Karagöz et al. used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor changes in the shape of proteins. These observations revealed that binding to an unfolded protein causes other parts of IRE1 protein to change shape. In turn, these shape changes act as a switch that causes the oligomers to form. Stopping the sensor domains from forming oligomers inactivated the IRE1 protein in mammalian cells; this rendered IRE1 unresponsive to stress within the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>The regulation of IRE1 affects many health disorders, including diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. By showing that unfolded proteins switch IRE1 into its active, oligomeric state, these findings might lead to new approaches to manipulate IRE1’s activity with small molecules to help to treat these diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IRE1</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>ER-stress</kwd><kwd>nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CLF #1307367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ER-stress sensing mechanism of the unfolded protein response sensor/transducer IRE1 is conserved from yeast to mammals, where in mammals, unfolded protein binding to IRE1's ER lumenal domain is coupled to its oligomerization and activation through an allosteric conformational change.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein-folding homeostasis is critical for proper cell function. Accordingly, cells evolved surveillance mechanisms to monitor protein-folding status and elicit adaptive responses to adjust protein-folding capacity according to need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balchin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bukau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the majority of transmembrane and soluble secretory proteins fold and mature, protein-folding homeostasis is ensured by a network of signaling pathways collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). In metazoans, perturbations leading to the accumulation of mis- or unfolded proteins in the ER are recognized as ‘ER stress’ by three unique ER-resident UPR sensors, IRE1, PERK and ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox and Walter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niwa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sidrauski and Walter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tirasophon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). These sensors transmit information about the protein-folding status in the ER and drive gene expression programs that modulate both the protein-folding load and folding capacity of the ER. If ER stress remains unmitigated, the UPR induces pro-apoptotic pathways, thereby placing the network at the center life-or-death decisions that affect the progression of numerous diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vidal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang and Kaufman, 2008</xref>).</p><p>IRE1 drives the most conserved branch of the UPR, which exhibits remarkably similar mechanistic aspects shared between yeast and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In mammals, IRE1 exists in two isoforms, α and β. IRE1α is ubiquitously expressed, whereas IRE1β expression is restricted to gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertolotti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsuru et al., 2013</xref>).

Oligomerization is crucial for IRE1 activation as it allows for <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation and allosteric activation of its endonuclease domain, which for IRE1α then initiates the unconventional splicing of the <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox and Walter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sidrauski and Walter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>).

A putative peptide-binding groove that architecturally resembles that of the major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) extends across this interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Credle et al., 2005</xref>). yIRE1 selectively binds a misfolded mutant of carboxypeptidase Y (Gly255Arg, CPY*) in vivo, and purified yIRE1 cLD directly interacts with peptides in vitro, leading to its oligomerization. Taken together, these observations support the model that direct binding of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen to IRE1 induces its oligomerization leading to IRE1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Due to structural differences between human and yeast IRE1 lumenal domains, it is not yet clear if this mechanism is also used by mammalian IRE1. Although the crystal structure of human IRE1α (hIRE1α) cLD displays conserved structural elements in its core, there are several notable differences between the crystal structures of human and yeast IRE1 cLD known to date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). First, the helices flanking the groove in yIRE1 cLD are too closely juxtaposed in the human structure to allow formation of the MHC-like groove present in the yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). Second, the yIRE1 cLD structure displays a second interface, IF2<sup>L</sup>, which provides contacts for higher order oligomerization, which was experimentally validated to be indispensable for yIRE1 activation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the yIRE1 cLD, an α-helix–turn region forms an important element in IF2<sup>L</sup> making contacts with the incomplete β-propeller in the neighboring protomer. Notably, the residues corresponding to the α-helix–turn are not resolved in the hIRE1α cLD crystal structure (aa V307-Y358). Instead, hIRE1α cLD has two other symmetry mates in addition to the dimerization interface, which appear to be crystal lattice contacts that are predicted to be too energetically unstable to form biologically important oligomerization interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, the equivalent of an IF2<sup>L</sup> cannot form in the depicted hIRE1α cLD structure because of a steric hindrance from a prominent α-helix (‘αB helix’; aa V245-I263) that is absent in yIRE1 cLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30700.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Human and yeast IRE1 cLD’s crystal structures display distinct features.</title><p>The αB helix in hIRE1α cLD structure (pdb: 2hz6) , the helix-turn region and the incomplete β-propeller in yIRE1 cLD (pdb: 2be1) structure are indicated with arrows.

This model poses that due to the aforementioned structural differences—rather than direct unfolded protein binding—it is the reversible dissociation of the ER-resident Hsp70-type chaperone BiP from IRE1’s lumenal domain the main driving force regulating hIRE1α activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). According to this view, titration of BiP to unfolded proteins upon ER stress licenses IRE1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). In yeast, however, this view has been experimentally refuted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Considering the degree of conservation at various features of IRE1 mechanism of action from yeast to mammals, we favor the unifying direct activation model. Such model finds support in the notion that all structures adopted by a protein in a crystal lattice represent a singular snapshot of many possible conformational states. Therefore, it is entirely plausible that human and yeast IRE1 cLD use a common mechanism of activation and that the divergent structures aforementioned represent different states in a spectrum of possible conformational states that the IRE1 cLD from <italic>any species</italic> could assume. In this scenario, the crystal structure of hIRE1α cLD represents a ‘closed’ conformation that can shift towards an ‘open’ state to allow peptide binding in the MHC-like groove that is apparent in the structure of the yeast ortholog (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>). As such, this model predicts specific outcomes that can be experimentally tested. Specifically, that (i) human IRE1 α cLD can bind to unfolded polypeptides, (ii) unfolded polypeptide binding stabilizes the open conformation of the hIRE1α cLD, and (iii) the open conformation of hIRE1α cLD favors its oligomerization.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-30700-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30700.004</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>The model displaying the transition of hIRE1α cLD from the ‘closed’ to ‘open’ state.</title><p>The crystal structure of hIRE1α cLD is used to represent (pdb: 2hz6) the closed and the hIRE1α cLD structural model based on the yeast crystal structure (pdb: 2be1) represents the open state.

Moreover, we provide insights into the mechanism that couples peptide binding and oligomerization to produce active IRE1 oligomers. Importantly, we show by mutational analysis that lumenal domain driven oligomerization is crucial for IRE1 function in mammalian cells.

Like BiP, hIRE1α cLD favored binding to aromatic and positively charged residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Otero et al., 2010</xref>). BiP is a highly abundant chaperone in the ER lumen, whereas IRE1 is present at orders of magnitude lower levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, if IRE1 and BiP recognize the same regions of unfolded proteins, the peptide-binding activity of hIRE1α cLD would depend entirely on saturation of BiP by unfolded substrate proteins—a scenario difficult to reconcile with IRE1’s task of dynamically sensing ER stress. To address this point, we compared the binding preferences of mammalian BiP (fused to an N-terminal 10x-histidine tag) on the same peptide arrays. We found sequences recognized by both hIRE1α cLD and BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Importantly, however, we also found profound differences. While IRE1 tolerated both prolines and histidines, BiP strongly disfavored these amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, p&lt;0.05). Conversely, BiP tolerated serine and threonines, while IRE1 strongly disfavored them.

Fluorescence anisotropy revealed that hIRE1α cLD bound to MPZ1 with K<sub>1/2</sub> = 24 ± 4.7 µM and to 8ab1 with K<sub>1/2</sub> = 5 ± 1.7 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). (Note that we used K<sub>1/2</sub> to denote a measure of affinity because, as we show below, hIRE1α cLD exists in solution as an ensemble of different interconverting conformational states and our measurements therefore score several superimposed equilibria. The measured affinities therefore do not reflect true K<sub>d</sub> values). These affinities fall within the same order of magnitude of chaperone binding to unfolded proteins, supporting the notion that similar modes of fast transient interactions with unfolded proteins are adopted by both IRE1 and chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karagöz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marcinowski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Street et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To identify the minimal region in MPZ1 for binding to hIRE1α cLD, we next divided MPZ1 into 12, 11 and 9 amino acid long fragments representing its N-terminal (MPZ1-N), middle (MPZ1-M) and C-terminal (MPZ1-C) regions and measured their respective affinities for hIRE1α cLD. hIRE1α cLD bound to MPZ1-N with a similar affinity as the full-length peptide (K<sub>1/2</sub> = 16.0 ± 2.6 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), whereas the other peptide fragments displayed much lower binding affinities (K<sub>1/2</sub> = 377 ± 54 µM and 572 ± 107 µM, respectively, assuming similar maximum anisotropy values as for the MPZ1-N peptide). We further truncated MPZ1-N by two residues at a time from either its N- or C-terminus. Deleting amino acids from the C-terminus gradually decreased the affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). By contrast, deletion of the first two hydrophobic residues from the N-terminus (leucine and isoleucine) abolished its binding to hIRE1α cLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These analyses revealed that the minimum peptide length with a comparable binding affinity to the full-length MPZ1 peptide is a 12-mer. This 12-mer peptide matches the chemical properties we found for hIRE1α cLD-binding peptides: it is enriched in aromatics, hydrophobic amino acids and arginines, indicating that specific binding contacts play a role in hIRE1α cLD’s interaction with unfolded proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>hIRE1α cLD binds unfolded proteins</title><p>To validate that peptides are valid surrogates for unfolded proteins, we next tested binding of intact but constitutively unfolded proteins to hIRE1α cLD.

NMR spectroscopy reveals structural information at the atomic level for dynamic protein complexes and is well suited to study structural changes in hIRE1α cLD upon its interaction with peptides and unfolded proteins. The hIRE1α cLD dimer is ~80 kDa and thus is well above the size limit for conventional NMR approaches. We therefore used methyl transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (methyl-TROSY), a specific NMR method that allows to extract structural information from large proteins after selective isotopic labeling of side chain methyl groups with carbon-13 (<sup>13</sup>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tugarinov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tugarinov et al., 2007</xref>) in select amino acids including isoleucines. hIRE1α cLD has 12 isoleucines per monomer, which are evenly distributed throughout the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Here, we provide evidence that activation of human IRE1α occurs via direct recognition of unfolded proteins and that the mechanism of ER stress sensing is conserved from yeast to mammals. This conclusion is based on six independent lines of evidence. First, we found that hIRE1α cLD binds peptides with a characteristic amino acid bias. Second, NMR spectroscopy suggested that peptides bind to hIRE1α cLD’s MHC-like groove and induce a conformational change including the distant αB helix. In this way, occupation of the peptide-binding groove is allosterically communicated, which, we propose, culminates in the formation of a functional oligomerization interface corresponding to IF2<sup>L</sup> in yIRE1 cLD. Third, binding of minimal-length peptides induces formation of hIRE1α cLD oligomers as assessed by AUC analyses, further supporting this notion. Fourth, cross-linking experiments captured the oligomerization interfaces, which allowed identification of a functionally crucial hydrophobic patch at IF2<sup>L</sup>. Fifth, mutation of this patch uncoupled peptide binding from oligomerization but retained the allosteric coupling within the domain. Sixth, impairing the oligomerization of hIRE1α cLD abolished IRE1’s activity in living cells, attesting to the physiological relevance of the activation mechanism proposed here.</p><p>Taken together, our data converge on a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) in which unfolded protein-binding activates a switch in hIRE1α’s cLD, leading to rearrangements that render it compatible with the formation of IF2<sup>L</sup> and therefore stabilizing an active oligomeric conformation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). cLD-mediated oligomerization on the lumenal side of the ER, in turn, would juxtapose hIRE1α’s cytosolic kinase domains in the face-to-face confirmation allowing its <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation, followed by stacking of its RNase domains in back-to-back orientation. These conformational rearrangements then lead to RNase activation, and thus allowing information flow across the ER membrane. Interestingly, our data show that impairment of lumenal domain oligomerization diminished IRE1’s both RNase and kinase activities in cells.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30700.031</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of human IRE1 activation</title><p>Apo-hIRE1α LD dimers are found in equilibrium between closed and open conformations (Step 1) (note that for simplicity IRE1’s cytoplasmic kinase/RNase domains are not displayed in the model). Upon ER stress, unfolded proteins accumulating in the ER lumen bind hIRE1α LD. Unfolded protein binding stabilizes hIRE1α LD in the open conformation and induces a conformational change in the αB helix and the neighboring structural elements (Steps 2). This conformational change releases the block on oligomerization, thus leading to active hIRE1α oligomers by allowing the formation of an IF2<sup>L</sup>-like interface in hIRE1α LD (Step 3). Oligomerization driven by hIRE1α LD subsequently activates its kinase and RNase domains. When protein-folding homeostasis is achieved, the dynamic hIRE1α LD oligomers re-adopt the inactive hIRE1α LD conformation (Step 4).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-30700-fig9-v2"/></fig><p>Currently due to lack of biochemical and structural understanding of IRE1’s interaction with the ER-resident chaperone BiP, its role in regulating IRE1 activity remains unknown. Although it is clear that BiP is released from IRE1 upon ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>), current models proposing BiP as the primary regulator of IRE1 activity do not address how active IRE1 oligomers would form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). By contrast, our data indicate that peptide-binding is important for lumenal domain-driven IRE1 oligomerization, leading to its activation. We therefore consider it most plausible that BiP binding modulates the response via tuning IRE1’s oligomerization equilibrium, similar to what was shown for the yeast counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>). In this way, BiP binding would buffer IRE1 activity at the early stages of the ER stress when the chaperones are not overwhelmed by the unfolded protein load, and during the deactivation phase, when the protein folding homeostasis is achieved. In this scenario, unfolded protein accumulation exerts synergistic effects on IRE1 activation, simultaneously freeing more IRE1 from BiP upon ER stress and inducing IRE1’s oligomerization/activation through their direct binding to the sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Despite these profound similarities in the salient features of ER stress sensing and processing, yeast and human IRE1α cLD display some distinct oligomerization properties. Whereas yIRE1 cLD precipitously assembles into larger oligomers at concentrations that exceed its dimerization constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>), hIRE1α cLD forms discrete dimers, which in a concentration-dependent manner gradually assemble into tetramers. hIRE1α cLD oligomers are in a dynamic equilibrium of different states, apparent from our size exclusion chromatography and AUC analyses and hIRE1α cLD forms even larger oligomers when bound to peptides. These observations are consistent with the model that the αB helix, which may hinder formation of hIRE1α oligomers as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>) participates in conformational changes that release its block on oligomerization. At higher hIRE1α cLD concentrations, the conformational equilibrium of the αB helix is shifted towards the active state. Peptide binding allosterically releases this inhibition and stabilizes the active hIRE1α oligomers. We anticipate that the effect of peptide binding-induced oligomerization would be more pronounced under physiological conditions, where hIRE1α is tethered to ER-membrane with diffusion limited to two dimensions.</p><p>We speculate that the conformational change in the αB helix allows the incomplete β-propeller to form contacts with the residues from the flexible region, which is not resolved in the crystal structure (V307-Y358) forming the oligomerization interface in hIRE1α cLD. In this conformation, αB helix may provide additional contact sites contributing to the oligomerization interface. Interestingly, one of the symmetry mates captured by hIRE1α cLD crystal structure shows contacts of the αB helix with the hydrophobic stretch (<sup>359</sup>WLLI<sup>362</sup>), which we show to be important for oligomerization. We anticipate that in addition to this hydrophobic stretch, additional contacts contributed by these flexible parts may further facilitate oligomer formation.</p><p>hIRE1α cLD’s groove is enriched in aromatic residues and displays a negatively charged surface. In this way, the amino acids lining the groove chemically complement hIRE1α cLD binding peptides identified in our study, which are enriched in aromatics and arginines. In the crystal structure of hIRE1α cLD in the ‘closed’ conformation, the α-helices forming the MHC-like groove are close together and mask the residues on the β-sheet floor. When these helices are moved approximately 6 Å apart from one another, the groove deepens and exposes more hydrophobicity mostly contributed by newly exposed aromatic residues. Thus, opening the groove exposes surface chemistry that is conducive to IRE1 binding peptides. Our data support a model in which widening of the groove is allosterically coupled to the formation of the IF2<sup>L</sup>-like oligomerization interfaces.</p><p>We showed that a 12-mer peptide is the shortest derivative of MPZ1 peptide that binds hIRE1α cLD with undiminished affinity when compared to the original 21-mer peptide, indicating that a 12-mer provides maximal contact with cognate interfaces in hIRE1α cLD groove. It is plausible that similar to MHC molecules, select amino acids in unfolded polypeptides act as ‘anchor residues’ providing contact sites for hIRE1 α cLD binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fremont et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsumura et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson and Fremont, 1993</xref>). Notably, assuming an extended peptide backbone with an average length of 3.4 Å per peptide bond, a 12-mer peptide can fit without constraints into the 39 Å-long groove in the structural model presented here. This notion suggests that the groove ensures preferential binding of fully exposed, unfolded 39Å-stretch of a polypeptide chain. This recognition principle is therefore similar to that of Hsp70-type chaperones, where the structural constraints in the cavity of the substrate-binding domain allow interaction with the substrates only in their extended, unfolded conformation, although Hsp70 only binds a seven amino acids stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rüdiger et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rüdiger et al., 1997b</xref>).</p><p>Supporting the notion of mechanistic similarities in unfolded protein recognition between chaperone proteins and IRE1, hIRE1α cLD and the ER-resident chaperone BiP bind partially overlapping as well as distinct sets of peptides tested in our peptide arrays, as previously shown for the orthologous yeast proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>). Importantly, the presence of distinct hIRE1α cLD binding peptides liberates IRE1 from an otherwise inevitable failure to compete with highly abundant BiP for binding sites in unfolded proteins. hIRE1α cLD’s affinity for peptides measured here varied between 5 and 30 µM, which is within the same order of magnitude but at the lower range of those reported for most chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karagöz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marcinowski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Street et al., 2011</xref>). For example, hIRE1α cLD binds the IgG’s C<sub>H</sub>1 unfolded domain with ~30 µM affinity whereas BiP was shown to bind the same protein with ~7 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marcinowski et al., 2011</xref>). We surmise that this difference has been selected in evolution to set the threshold for unfolded protein recognition slightly higher for the UPR sensors when compared to that of chaperones so that the UPR is not triggered until a critical concentration of unfolded proteins accumulates. Moreover, our data with the MPZ1-N-2X peptide suggested that IRE1 could display higher affinity for select polypeptides that present more than a single IRE1 binding site.</p><p>IRE1 dysfunction contributes to the development of numerous diseases, including cancer (such as multiple myeloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mimura et al., 2012</xref>]), metabolic disorders (such as obesity and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fonseca et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hotamisligil, 2010</xref>]) and neurodegenerative diseases (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Hungtinton’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hetz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vidal et al., 2012</xref>]). Depending on the disease context, IRE1 makes life or death decisions in response to altered ER function manifested in these pathological conditions (Walter P. and D., 2011). Our data showing that unfolded proteins stabilize a distinct IRE1 conformation suggest novel approaches to manipulate IRE1 pharmacologically. For example, it will be promising to design or screen for small molecule modulators that lock IRE1’s groove in the open or closed conformation based on the chemical signature of the IRE1 binding peptides identified here. Such compounds could act as agonists or antagonists of IRE1 activity. As such, it should be possible to develop new classes of pharmaceuticals to induce or inhibit the IRE1 branch of the UPR, driving the desired IRE1 output depending on the disease context.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Synthetic peptides were ordered from Elim Biosciences and GenScript at &gt;95% purity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein purification</title><p>To express MBP-hIRE1α cLD (aa 24–389), human IRE1α cDNA sequences were cloned into a pMalC2p vector to create a hIRE1α cLD fused on its N-terminus to MBP.

The tiling arrays were composed of 18-mer peptides that were tiled along the CPY*, MPZ, insulin, lysozyme and PTIP sequences with a three amino acid shift between adjacent spots. In the mutational arrays, peptides were synthesized to systematically mutate each amino acid in the core region of the CPY*-derived peptide. The arrays were incubated in 100% methanol for 10 min, then in Binding Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20, 2 mM DTT) three times for 10 min each. For BiP experiments, ADP and MgCl<sub>2</sub> were added to the binding buffer to final concentrations of 1 mM and 5 mM, respectively. The arrays were then incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with 500 nM MBP-hIRE1α cLD or His<sub>10</sub>-BiP and washed again three times with 10 min incubation in between the washes in Binding Buffer to remove any unbound protein. Using a semi-dry transfer apparatus, the bound protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and detected with anti-MBP antiserum (NEB) or anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibody (Abcam). The contribution of each amino acid to hIRE1α cLD and BiP binding was calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>). The peptide arrays were quantified using Max Quant. The binding intensity in each spot was normalized to max signal intensity in the peptide array.

This value is normalized to their abundance in the arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Binding affinities of hIRE1α cLD or IRE1 mutants to FAM-labeled peptides were measured by the change in fluorescence anisotropy on a Spectramax-M5 plate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 525 nm with increasing concentrations of hIRE1α cLD. Fluorescently labeled peptides were used in a concentration range of 50–100 nM. The reaction volume of each data point was 20 µL and the measurements were performed in 384-well, black flat-bottomed plates after incubation of peptide with hIRE1α cLD or its mutants for 30 min at 25<sup>o</sup> C.

The labeled peptide was then dialyzed in a Slide-a-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 2 kDa cut-off to remove the excess spin-label and to exchange the buffer to deuterated buffer (25 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT) for NMR experiments. Control samples used in the reference experiments contained (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate spin-label that was treated the same way as the proxyl-labeled peptide. Wild type hIRE1α cLD and quadruple mutant hIRE1α cLD (Leu186Ile, Ile326/334/362Val) and single mutant Leu186Ile were used in PRE experiments at 75 µM and 100 µM protein concentration respectively, in the presence and absence of equimolar concentrations of MPZ1-proxyl peptide.

The experimental evidence of structural changes on the basis of the NMR experiments are weak. Since it is important to ascertain that the mechanism of IRE1 activation in eukaryotes is conserved, other well established biophysical techniques should be considered to obtain more compelling and conclusive data. Based on the data presented, it is not possible to conclude that the mechanism of substrate binding induces activation of IRE1. We would, however, encourage you to consider submission of a new paper when you are able to address the concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Karagoz et al. reports a study on the mammalian homolog of the ER stress sensor IRE1. IRE1 is a membrane protein conserved from yeast to humans, which signals protein folding stress in the ER lumen to the nucleus. This occurs by a cascade of events, with oligomerization of IRE1 as the first crucial step. Displacement of the ER-resident Hsp70 molecular chaperone (BiP) from IRE1 was implicated in oligomerization. However, the group of Peter Walter also convincingly showed binding of misfolded proteins can directly activate yeast IRE1. The crystal structure of the ER-lumenal domain of yeast IRE1 (yIRE1 cLD) exhibited a hydrophobic groove across a dimer interface and yIRE1 cLD was shown to bind a peptide of the misfolding mutant protein carboxypeptidase Y (CPY*). Structural data for such an interaction is however missing. Furthermore, the crystal structure of human IRE1 exhibited a cleft too narrow for a peptide substrate, among other structural differences, challenging the model that hIRE1 uses a similar activation mechanism as yIRE1. The present study uses peptide arrays and NMR to demonstrate that the mechanism of IRE1 oligomerization and hence activation by unfolded protein is conserved in hIRE1.</p><p>The presented data on the IRE1 substrate selectivity appears solid. The experimental evidence for structural changes in IRE1 are consistent with but are not conclusive for the proposed model of substrate binding induced activation of IRE1. Since it is important to ascertain that the mechanism of IRE1 activation in eukaryotes is conserved, more direct evidence is required, for example by introducing FRET probes into the helices lining the proposed binding cleft to monitor the closed to open transition as proposed in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments could also provide a more comprehensive picture. Another approach would be to screen for a peptide that binds stably to the luminal domain of IRE1, and then to determine the crystal structure of the complex. This approach has been successful for molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 and GroEL.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) From their peptide array analyses, the authors deduce a preference of hIRE1 for hydrophobic peptides enriched in tyrosine, tryptophan and arginine, similar to yeast IRE1. The minimum peptide length appears to be 12 residues. The dissociation constants for two model peptides (MPZ1 and 8ab1) are rather high (24 and 5 μM, respectively). A peptide of 12 residues binding in an extended conformation in the 40 Å long groove of yeast IRE1 is expected to have a considerably higher affinity, given the extensive surface area that would become buried – the more limited Hsp70-peptide interaction with the NRLLLTG peptide is two orders of magnitude tighter. Surprisingly, the dissociation constants for two model substrate proteins are in the same range. It thus remains unclear how IRE1 saturation can be reached under physiological conditions, where concentrations are presumably lower.</p><p>2) To support and validate the proposed mechanism for substrate binding and hIRE1 oligomerization, the authors use NMR spectroscopy of derivatives of the hIRE1 cLD in which the γ-methyl groups of isoleucine are 13C-labeled. Unfortunately, the NMR signals of 6 out of 12 isoleucine methyl groups overlap and cannot be assigned. The mutant L186I provides an additional probe. Still, with only six probe positions, the sampling for the 40 kDa large protein is quite sparse. All NMR signals exhibit broad line width, consistent with chemical exchange on the NMR time scale resulting from hIRE1 cLD forming dimers and tetramers. Binding of the model peptides (MPZ1 or 8ab1) and the model unfolded substrate (CH1) slightly shifts the NMR signals of a subset of the methyl groups. Substrate binding also results in the formation of higher oligomeric states of hIRE1 cLD, suggesting that the shifts observed in the NMR peaks might not only be due to substrate binding but also as a result of oligomerization (conformational changes). The suppression of signals of methyl groups close to the putative peptide-binding groove by a nitroxide spin label in MPZ1 is interpreted as indication that MPZ1-proxyl binds in the center of the groove in hIRE1 cLD. Since optimal range by the PRE effect is 10-25 Å, NOE signals, which have a much narrower range to 5 Å distance, between a labeled peptide and the IRE1 methyl sites could prove the postulated binding mode beyond a reasonable doubt. Photo-crosslinking combined with mass spectrometry could be an alternative approach. Although, mutations at the bottom of the putative binding cleft increased the peptide dissociation constant, the effect was relatively minor (factor of two). Again, this could be due to indirect effects of conformational changes in hIRE1.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1) Subsection “Peptide recognition by hIRE1 cLD relies on specific interactions”, first paragraph. The amino acid sequences of the peptides MPZ1 and 8ab1 should be stated when first mentioned. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the sequence of MPZ1 but the sequence of the peptide 8ab1 is not stated anywhere in the manuscript.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. There seems to be some divergence in the binding intensities for hIRE1 and yIRE1 in the middle part of CPY*. hIRE1 seems to be more sticky than yIRE1.</p><p>3) Legend <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. I assume the peptide sequences with binding scores in the upper 10% segment were selected for the amino acid frequency analysis. This is not clear in the text.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, the dimeric peak did not change in the absence or presence of a peptide, while the tetrameric peak declined with the concomitant appearance of larger oligomers. Is it possible that tetramers and not dimers, bind peptides? What is the effect on the oligomeric state of 5 μM hIRE1 cLD in the presence of peptide? For example, does 8ab1 peptide (KD of 5 μM) induce more oligomerization in the AUC assay than MPZ1 peptide (KD of 24 μM)?</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it is shown that mutations in the groove decrease the binding affinity of peptides. AUC analysis of the mutants (5 and 75 μM) in the absence and presence of the peptides MPZ1 and 8ab1 would be important to exclude that the mutations have not in any way altered the characteristics of hIRE1 cLD. Furthermore, this analysis will demonstrate that the oligomerization of these mutants in presence of MPZ1-N peptide is inefficient, consistent with the low binding affinity of mutant proteins to MPZ1-N peptide.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting paper that uses both biochemical and biophysical approaches to address mechanistic aspects of function of IRE1 activation. One model suggests that binding of unfolded polypeptides leads to oligomerization that in turn activates function while a second model suggests that other chaperones are released from IREI that leads to regulation. The authors establish conclusively that unfolded molecules are substrates for mammalian IREI and go on to further characterize the substrate sequence preferences. They then show that while there is some sequence preference overlap for BIP and IREI there are also differences that are important given the concentration differences of these two molecules in the cell.</p><p>1) Can the authors refute the BiP binding model by showing that it does not interact with IRE1 by NMR or is there known to be an interaction? Given that they have suitably labeled samples this seems like an easy experiment.</p><p>2) If the cLDs of human and yeast are functionally interchangeable does this not lend support to the fact that there is a similar mechanism for both human and yeast forms, even without doing any experiments, although I agree that the experiments done do support this much more strongly?</p><p>3) Interestingly the authors show that unfolded proteins binding with similar affinity as peptides. I might have assumed there to be a higher affinity for the proteins. If similar microscopic binding affinities for different sites are found then increasing the number of these sites should increase affinity by avidity. I would assume that protein substrates would have more potential binding sites.</p><p>I am concerned about some of the conclusions that the authors make on the basis of NMR data. The data is rather marginal and the changes upon binding are small.</p><p>4) I could not find whether the authors used 2H protein. While more expensive to produce this will significantly influence the quality of spectra. A molecular weight of 80 kDa is not very large for the methyl-TROSY experiments and yet the spectra look relatively poor.</p><p>5) Given that at NMR concentrations there appears to be an equilibrium between different populations might the authors wish to work at higher concentrations so as to push the equilibrium to a more stable state? Would this increase the affinity for substrate, as the active state is &quot;preformed&quot; (because the shifts upon substrate binding seem to mirror those upon increasing the protein concentration)? Given the similarities in the shifts in both cases, can the authors speculate where the tetramerization interface is (is it consistent with the IF2<sup>L</sup> site). Would one not expect difference in the shifts between concentration and binding as well due to local effects?</p><p>6) How do the authors distinguish between stabilization of a discrete higher molecular weight species (i.e., equilibrium shift perhaps to a tetramer) from minimizing excursions between different states within the dimer structure of the cLD. Could the authors perform 2H spin relaxation experiments that are sensitive to size but not chemical exchange to show an oligomerization process. Additionally from the AUC trace it looks like large oligomers are formed (not just tetramers) upon binding unfolded substrate. So I might have thought that the NMR spectrum would get worse. Please clarify. In this context what about making mutations at the putative IF2 site and showing that the spectra get much better and that affinity for peptide is lower (presumably since it is not accompanied by a shift in equilibrium that supports binding). This would be a powerful experiment to show that indeed there is a dynamic equilibrium between oligomer states.</p><p>7) The authors write: &quot;Interestingly, the isoleucine peaks corresponding to Ile52 and Ile263 shifted in the same direction and to a similar extent when hIRE1 cLD bound to MPZ1-N peptide (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).&quot;</p><p>Unfortunately the shifts are very tiny and hard to quantify. For I52 it looks like one sees peaks from 2 states (dimer, tetramer) in the 25 μm IRE1 cLD sample, yet for I263 there is only 1 peak in the free form? For I264 it is very hard to see that the shifts are similar upon increasing concentration and upon binding, again reflecting such small shifts in the first place. To conclude that the structures of the &quot;oligomers&quot; are similar in both cases from such small CSPs and from such few probes seems a stretch to me.</p><p>8) The authors write: &quot;Ile128 and Ile52 peaks were slightly affected by the binding of MPZ1-proxyl peptide, supporting the idea that these isoleucines rearrange upon peptide binding&quot;.</p><p>Why? They can simply be further away from the spin label and show smaller effects. Given the 1/r^6 nature of the PRE small changes in distances can have rather large changes in intensities.</p><p>9) The authors use mutagenesis to confirm the importance of certain residues in the binding. Although mutations do change affinities by 2 fold or so (16 μm to 32 μm for example) this is very little difference in DG. One might have expected more. Does this mean that there is a highly dynamic complex with contributions from many sites? Might some insight be obtained by doing reverse experiments whereby the amide spectrum of the substrate is recorded to see if there are dynamics visible from this end? It is noteworthy that single point mutants in the substrate can impair binding yet corresponding point mutants in the cLD seem to have a small effect on free energy differences.</p><p>10) A concluding point is &quot;Second, NMR spectroscopy revealed that peptides bind to hIRE1 cLD's MHC446 like groove and induce a conformational change including the distant αB helix,…&quot;</p><p>Not sure I see this. Seems like the data is not of sufficient quality to support this. How many probes are in helix B (I could find only one in the text).</p><p>11) &quot;Taken together, our data converge on a model, which poses that unfolded protein-binding activates a switch in IRE1's cLD, stabilizing its active conformation, which is prone to oligomerization after rearrangements that render it compatible with the formation of IL2L&quot;</p><p>Yet what are the rearrangements?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors characterized the direct binding of unfolded protein model substrates to the MHC-like groove in human IRE1 ER-lumenal domain and the conformational switch occurring within the domain. As there is an outstanding debate on IRE1 sensing mechanism from ER stress, the authors compared the binding preferences of IRE1 core-lumenal domain (IRE1 cLD) and BiP to a peptide array derived from different protein substrates. IRE1 cLD and BiP exhibited distinctive binding preferences. Next, they demonstrated that IRE1 cLD can bind peptides derived from protein substrates with an affinity similar to chaperone-unfolded protein interaction. These indicate that IRE1 cLD is capable of directly binding unfolded proteins and thus suggesting it might directly sense the accumulation of unfolded proteins in vivo. To further characterize IRE1 sensing mechanism from unfolded proteins, the authors employed advanced NMR techniques to determine substrate binding and conformation changes that occur within IRE1 cLD by labeling specific residues detectable by NMR. They also used size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity to quantify IRE1 cLD oligomeric states. From these experiments, the authors concluded that ( et al., 2010) IRE1 cLD forms larger oligomers in a concentration dependent manner as well as in the presence of substrates; (2) substrate binding induces IRE1 cLD conformation changes; (3) the substrate binding site is localized to the centre of IRE1 MHC-like groove.</p><p>The major advance for the fields, from their findings, is the characterization of substrate binding to IRE1 cLD. This will add very strong weight on the model where IRE1 can directly senses the accumulation of unfolded protein instead of being activated by the detachment of BiP through IRE1 lumenal domain. They have accumulated extensive and rigorous in vitro data to support their model. Overall, their experiments are clean and very well thought. Their study will definitely be of great interest in the ER stress field and beyond. I highly recommend the manuscript to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are few points that should be clarified by the authors.</p><p>1) They identified and used, throughout the study, a specific short peptide of mouse MPZ protein (MPZ1-N) which strongly binds hIRE1 cLD. MPZ1-N is part of the cytosolic domain of ER stress model substrate MPZ suggesting hIRE1 will never bind MPZ1-N in vivo. Similarly, BiP seems to bind only the cytosolic domain of MPZ from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. These peptides can be seen as model substrates but the authors should address this discrepancy not to give the impression that the UPR is activated through IRE1 by recognizing the cytosolic domain of unfolded MPZ as suggested in the subsection “The lumenal domain of human IRE1 binds peptides”.</p><p>2) hIRE1 cLD is proposed to form large oligomers in the presence of MPZ1-N but the authors don't address the issue of how the dimers associate to form higher order oligomers in vitro.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Karagoz, Chen and Walter explores the hypothesis that human IRE1 responds to ER stress through direct binding of unfolded substrate proteins, as has been proposed for yeast IRE1. Differences in the crystal forms of these two proteins brought the generality of the hypothesis proposed based on the presence of a possible substrate binding cleft in the yeast protein, but absent in the human, into question. The authors have some compelling data, but these are mixed with some less compelling observations (at best), and some findings that are very complicated to interpret, in this reviewer's estimation. It would seem advisable to present the data that can be straightforwardly interpreted and are necessary to make the authors' case (i.e., that hIRE1 binds substrates), and to remove some of the weaker and more confusing experiments. In addition to the complexity of the system, there are several examples of sloppiness in the data presentation that detract from this potentially interesting and provocative paper. These must be rectified. As summarized in the points raised below, the uneven quality of the data in this study and the complexity of the proposed equilibria weaken this paper; the structural hypothesis is attractive and it would be nice to have a more compelling test of it.</p><p>1) The binding of peptides in arrays prepared from several potential substrates is a straightforward and well analyzed result. It is provocative and physiologically interesting that there is a preference for sequences and residues that is similar but not identical to that of BiP. It is puzzling, however, that the authors didn't compare the yeast and human IRE1 proteins on the same arrays.</p><p>2) The authors present binding curves for many of the peptides and confirm that a couple of proteins bind as well. They report Kd's. However, in the next breath they show that the human IRE1 luminal domain equilibrates between a dimer and a tetramer and upon peptide binding shifts to higher order oligomers. What then is the meaning of the binding data? How do they know which species the peptide is binding? How is the apparent affinity interpreted when an allosteric quaternary structure shift accompanies the binding? In my opinion, they should show the substrate-dependent oligomerization and develop their hypothesis for its origin and its importance, and skip the quantitative binding analysis, which is likely not valid. [Note: Panel A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> does not belong in that figure, as it shows binding of a protein substrate, and nothing to do with oligomerization, the theme of the figure.]</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, there are insufficient labels on panel D, and the concentration is not given for the NMR spectrum. Would it not be informative to run the NMR spectrum at different concentrations to see the shifts that are associated with oligomerization? The broadening is really a challenging aspect of the analysis of the NMR data.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the Ile methyl data are very confusing. The spectra in black are supposed to be the apo-protein, but they are not the same for the columns for two different substrates. Why not? And the chemical shifts are confusing. In one case (Ile 128), they go down from the top of the y axis to the bottom, but in all other cases they go up. Also, the labeling of the axes should be done in a more reasonable way with the same labeling across (the same Ile) or up (the same peptide).</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel D is also confusing because the amount of dimer seems not to be changing, but the tetramer seems to go towards higher order oligomers. This is not the scheme presented in the authors' model.</p><p>6) The chemical shift perturbation data clearly show that Ile128 experiences a much larger shift than the others, but the coloring on the structure suggests anything above the threshold is equally perturbed. More gradations are needed. More importantly, how are shifts from the associated with oligomerization distinguished from those due to binding? The more compelling data come from the spin labeled peptide, which clearly shows binding to occur near Ile186. However, the weak signals from several Ile peaks make these data a bit sketchy. Certainly some error bars should be given. [Where is the other Ile128 peak?]</p><p>7) I am not persuaded by the changes in affinity due to mutation, given the complexity of the equilibria going on – both oligomerization and binding – and the small changes in the binding curves.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An unfolded protein-induced conformational switch activates mammalian IRE1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The consensus was that this revision takes into account a majority of the concerns associated with the initial submission, although there are a number of outstanding issues that we would like addressed in a further revision. Additional experiments are not required. It was felt that there is some degree of over-interpretation of the NMR data, as the perturbations to chemical shifts were extremely small. Additional discussion as to this limitation should be given in a revised manuscript. Further, more discussion about the role of the BiP chaperone should be provided, including a discussion about the possibility of a model which involves both BiP and unfolded proteins playing a role in activating IRE1.</p><p>1) A major concern remains with the interpretation of some of the NMR data. The shifts are small and this places certain limits on what can be said. The data do support the notion of peptide binding and are consistent with binding occurring in the MHC-like groove. Yet the authors use a PRE approach to help establish a conformational change that accompanies binding, suggesting that such a change occurs and is allosteric in nature. With the level of s/n present in these experiments it is clear that 186 is close to the label and perhaps 124 (although s/n is really poor here). In the supplementary figures it even seems like the spin-label spectra has cross-peaks with more intensity but this must be due to the fact that the spectra are not plotted properly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> for peaks other than 186). It is not clear how one can conclude from this that there are conformational changes. It seems that the authors should confront the problem head-on by saying that while the NMR data does not allow one to establish conformational changes to the structure, the observation of the large PRE to 186 supports the notion of binding to the MHC groove which is only possible if there is a change in conformation. A couple of more points about this topic:</p><p>A) Is there a mistake in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>? Is the assignment of 124 correct or do you mean 128?</p><p>B) I wonder if your approach to normalize the PREs by surface accessibility is a wise one. Of course residues at the surface can have larger PREs than a proximal but buried residue. But the net result is that in your <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> there is little dynamic range. It is not immediately obvious how to interpret these numbers – a value of 0.13 for 124 is much more significant than 0.2 for 52?</p><p>C) In the subsection “Oligomerization leads to global conformational changes in hIRE1α cLD”, second paragraph, it speaks about the chemical shift changes to 124 and 128 as indicative of conformational changes. This seems questionable. In the first paragraph of the Discussion, it speaks about binding of peptides inducing conformational changes to distant helices. Again, the changes are tiny.</p><p>2) It seems that the field of ER stress seeks to have one or the other model of regulation of the unfolded protein response win out. Why is it not possible that Ire1 responds both to BiP concentration and unfolded protein load?</p><p>3) The binding studies conducted by the authors involved peptides. Can the authors comment on binding of intact proteins as well?</p><p>4) A number of concerns were raised concerning the identification of human Ire1 binding sequences. There were no sequences in the MPZ lumenal domain that interacted with recombinant Ire1α-cLD, whereas the sequence that was used for the bulk of experiments is located in the cytosolic domain. Although this doesn't interfere with the conclusion that human Ire can bind peptides, the conclusions about the type of sequences that it can bind may not be reliable, since this protein does induce a UPR in mammalian cells. A second point involves the Sars-CoV, 8ab protein. The paper cited for this protein demonstrates that it binds to ATF6 and induces its cleavage but has no effect on Ire1 or PERK activation. So if a peptide from this protein can bind to Ire1, it is not sufficient to activate it. Lastly, the CH1 domain produced by Marcinowski et al. was oxidized, which resulted in BiP binding to it with BiP's lid in a much more open conformation than when peptides bound to it. Do the authors find that the perturbation of Ire1 luminal domain is much greater in order to accommodate this client than when peptides are used in the NMR studies?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30700.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) From their peptide array analyses, the authors deduce a preference of hIRE1 for hydrophobic peptides enriched in tyrosine, tryptophan and arginine, similar to yeast IRE1.

We now clarified the issue in the Discussion. It is clearly possible that not all amino acids of the peptide form contacts with the groove. Instead it seems more plausible that certain side chains act as anchor residues similar to peptide binding to MHC molecules. Unlike ATP regulated Hsp70s, IRE1 LD’s interaction with unfolded proteins is intrinsically dynamic. Importantly, we now show that MPZ1-N-2X peptide that harbors two IRE1 binding sites, binds tightly to hIRE1 cLD due to increased avidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). Moreover, we anticipate that when protein folding homeostasis is disrupted in the ER, the critical concentration for this interaction would be met at the ER-membrane where the co-translational folding events take place.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To support and validate the proposed mechanism for substrate binding and hIRE1 oligomerization, the authors use NMR spectroscopy of derivatives of the hIRE1 cLD in which the γ-methyl groups of isoleucine are 13C-labeled.

The suppression of signals of methyl groups close to the putative peptide-binding groove by a nitroxide spin label in MPZ1 is interpreted as indication that MPZ1-proxyl binds in the center of the groove in hIRE1 cLD. Since optimal range by the PRE effect is 10-25 Å, NOE signals, which have a much narrower range to 5 Å distance, between a labeled peptide and the IRE1 methyl sites could prove the postulated binding mode beyond a reasonable doubt.

The peaks are low intensity due to the line broadening caused by the chemical exchange. These properties make hIRE1 cLD inaccessible to NOE type of experiments. Yet, even though we have limited number of probes in the NMR measurements, this non-invasive method provides very precise information about the conformational changes in the molecule at atomic resolution. We now could follow the conformational changes in this large and heterogeneous molecule upon peptide binding and oligomerization. The isoleucines are mostly buried in the protein so that they are not as sensitive to binding events. We and others have seen similar phenomena in different systems using this approach (Karagoz et al., PNAS, 2011 and Cell 2014, Rosenzweig et al., Science 2013, Stoffregen et al., Structure, 2012).</p><p>Supporting this notion, we see larger shifts of threonine peaks upon peptide binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

For example, does 8ab1 peptide (KD of 5 μM) induce more oligomerization in the AUC assay than MPZ1 peptide (KD of 24 μM)?</p></disp-quote><p>We now identified a mutation that impaired the oligomerization of hIRE1α cLD (hIRE1α cLD IF2<sup>L</sup> mutant), and this mutant binds to peptides with a very similar affinity as to wild type hIRE1α cLD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

I might have assumed there to be a higher affinity for the proteins. If similar microscopic binding affinities for different sites are found then increasing the number of these sites should increase affinity by avidity. I would assume that protein substrates would have more potential binding sites.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. As mentioned above, to test this possibility, we now designed a peptide by repeating the MPZ1-N sequence twice in a peptide sequence (called this peptide MPZ1-N-2X).

The data is rather marginal and the changes upon binding are small.</p></disp-quote><p>The shifts of the isoleucine peaks are small mainly due to two properties: i) they are buried in the structure and ii) hIRE1 cLD exists as a conformational equilibrium in solution. As we can experimentally control only the latter, we now included experiments where we either uncoupled the oligomerization from peptide binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) or compared the concentrations of hIRE1 cLD where it only formed dimers with high concentrations where large fraction of it formed oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-E</xref>). In both conditions, we observed larger shifts in isoleucine peaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I could not find whether the authors used 2H protein. While more expensive to produce this will significantly influence the quality of spectra.

We used D<sub>2</sub>O and deuterated glucose during expression to make a highly deuterated sample. Unfortunately, this did not yield high spectral quality because the line broadening is mainly due to chemical exchange in the intermediate exchange regime, not due to relaxation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Given that at NMR concentrations there appears to be an equilibrium between different populations might the authors wish to work at higher concentrations so as to push the equilibrium to a more stable state? Would this increase the affinity for substrate, as the active state is &quot;preformed&quot; (because the shifts upon substrate binding seem to mirror those upon increasing the protein concentration)?</p></disp-quote><p>Increasing the concentration of the protein results in poorer spectral quality, due to higher conformational heterogeneity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). The hIRE1 cLD mutant, which we impaired oligomerization by mutations (called IF2<sup>L</sup> mutant) showed similar peptide binding curves as wild type protein, therefore suggesting that tetramers are not better binders. This is addressed in the text (subsection “The peptide-induced allosteric switch remains intact in IF2<sup>L</sup> mutant hIRE1α cLD”, first paragraph) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the similarities in the shifts in both cases, can the authors speculate where the tetramerization interface is (is it consistent with the IF2<sup>L</sup> site).</p></disp-quote><p>We now employed crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry to map the oligomerization interface in hIRE1 cLD and included a paragraph describing the tetramerization interface based on the NMR and crosslinking data (subsection “Identifying the oligomerization interface of hIRE1α cLD”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would one not expect difference in the shifts between concentration and binding as well due to local effects?</p></disp-quote><p>That is an important point. Definitely peptide binding both modulates the equilibrium between dimers and oligomers and changes hIRE1 cLD conformation. Our data suggest that Ile52 and Ile263 are far from the peptide binding site and that is why the peptide binding induced changes which lead to hIRE1 cLD oligomerization are very similar to the concentration-dependent oligomerization events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) How do the authors distinguish between stabilization of a discrete higher molecular weight species (i.e., equilibrium shift perhaps to a tetramer) from minimizing excursions between different states within the dimer structure of the cLD. Could the authors perform 2H spin relaxation experiments that are sensitive to size but not chemical exchange to show an oligomerization process. Additionally from the AUC trace it looks like large oligomers are formed (not just tetramers) upon binding unfolded substrate. So I might have thought that the NMR spectrum would get worse. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The AUC experiments that are performed at NMR concentrations address the very same question. Methyl-TROSY experiments are optimized for much larger proteins. Therefore, the spectrum does not get worse upon formation of larger oligomers. The poor spectral quality of hIRE1 cLD is not due to relaxation but the conformational heterogeneity intrinsic to the biology of the protein. We see improvement of the spectrum when hIRE1cLD binds to peptides, because the binding stabilizes distinct states of hIRE1cLD oligomers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this context what about making mutations at the putative IF2 site and showing that the spectra get much better and that affinity for peptide is lower (presumably since it is not accompanied by a shift in equilibrium that supports binding). This would be a powerful experiment to show that indeed there is a dynamic equilibrium between oligomer states.</p></disp-quote><p>The hIRE1cLD IF2<sup>L</sup> mutant, where we impaired hIRE1 cLD oligomerization improved the spectral quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4B</xref>), however most isoleucine peaks are still very broad suggesting that the exchange between monomer-dimer states is also very prominent, which is strongly supported by the AUC and gel filtration experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> and Figure Supp. 6b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors write: &quot;Interestingly, the isoleucine peaks corresponding to Ile52 and Ile263 shifted in the same direction and to a similar extent when hIRE1 cLD bound to MPZ1-N peptide (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).&quot;</p><p>Unfortunately the shifts are very tiny and hard to quantify. For I52 it looks like one sees peaks from 2 states (dimer, tetramer) in the 25 μm IRE1 cLD sample, yet for I263 there is only 1 peak in the free form? For I264 it is very hard to see that the shifts are similar upon increasing concentration and upon binding, again reflecting such small shifts in the first place. To conclude that the structures of the &quot;oligomers&quot; are similar in both cases from such small CSPs and from such few probes seems a stretch to me.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the shifts are tiny due to conformational heterogeneity. We now added an experiment comparing mainly dimeric hIRE1 cLD (5 µM) with 50 µM and the shifts are much more prominent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, D</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors write: &quot;Ile128 and Ile52 peaks were slightly affected by the binding of MPZ1-proxyl peptide, supporting the idea that these isoleucines rearrange upon peptide binding&quot;.</p><p>Why? They can simply be further away from the spin label and show smaller effects.

The point we wanted to make is exactly what the reviewer suggests. We made the change in the text accordingly (see subsection “Peptide binding maps to the MHC-like groove in hIRE1α cLD”).</p><p>9) The authors use mutagenesis to confirm the importance of certain residues in the binding. Although mutations do change affinities by 2 fold or so (16 μm to 32 μm for example) this is very little difference in DG. One might have expected more. Does this mean that there is a highly dynamic complex with contributions from many sites?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point and omitted these data. Please see above in response to reviewer #1, point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Might some insight be obtained by doing reverse experiments whereby the amide spectrum of the substrate is recorded to see if there are dynamics visible from this end? It is noteworthy that single point mutants in the substrate can impair binding yet corresponding point mutants in the cLD seem to have a small effect on free energy differences.</p></disp-quote><p>Compared to large protein surface, short peptides can provide limited possible compensatory contacts when a crucial amino acid for binding is mutated. The experiments that monitor the backbone amide groups are not suitable for studying large complexes, as they result in signal loss due to relaxation.

Differences in the crystal forms of these two proteins brought the generality of the hypothesis proposed based on the presence of a possible substrate binding cleft in the yeast protein, but absent in the human, into question. The authors have some compelling data, but these are mixed with some less compelling observations (at best), and some findings that are very complicated to interpret, in this reviewer's estimation. It would seem advisable to present the data that can be straightforwardly interpreted and are necessary to make the authors' case (i.e., that hIRE1 binds substrates), and to remove some of the weaker and more confusing experiments. In addition to the complexity of the system, there are several examples of sloppiness in the data presentation that detract from this potentially interesting and provocative paper. These must be rectified. As summarized in the points raised below, the uneven quality of the data in this study and the complexity of the proposed equilibria weaken this paper; the structural hypothesis is attractive and it would be nice to have a more compelling test of it.</p><p>1) The binding of peptides in arrays prepared from several potential substrates is a straightforward and well analyzed result.

What then is the meaning of the binding data? How do they know which species the peptide is binding? How is the apparent affinity interpreted when an allosteric quaternary structure shift accompanies the binding?</p></disp-quote><p>That is an important point, we now addressed this in the text (Results section).

The splitting of peaks in different spectra is due to differences in the concentration of the apo protein in different experiments.

More gradations are needed. More importantly, how are shifts from the associated with oligomerization distinguished from those due to binding? The more compelling data come from the spin labeled peptide, which clearly shows binding to occur near Ile186. However, the weak signals from several Ile peaks make these data a bit sketchy.

Additional experiments are not required. It was felt that there is some degree of over-interpretation of the NMR data, as the perturbations to chemical shifts were extremely small. Additional discussion as to this limitation should be given in a revised manuscript. Further, more discussion about the role of the BiP chaperone should be provided, including a discussion about the possibility of a model which involves both BiP and unfolded proteins playing a role in activating IRE1.</p><p>1) A major concern remains with the interpretation of some of the NMR data. The shifts are small and this places certain limits on what can be said. The data do support the notion of peptide binding and are consistent with binding occurring in the MHC-like groove. Yet the authors use a PRE approach to help establish a conformational change that accompanies binding, suggesting that such a change occurs and is allosteric in nature. With the level of s/n present in these experiments it is clear that 186 is close to the label and perhaps 124 (although s/n is really poor here). In the supplementary figures it even seems like the spin-label spectra has cross-peaks with more intensity but this must be due to the fact that the spectra are not plotted properly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> for peaks other than 186). It is not clear how one can conclude from this that there are conformational changes. It seems that the authors should confront the problem head-on by saying that while the NMR data does not allow one to establish conformational changes to the structure, the observation of the large PRE to 186 supports the notion of binding to the MHC groove which is only possible if there is a change in conformation. A couple of more points about this topic:</p></disp-quote><p>Here, we used chemical shift perturbation analyses to monitor conformational changes in hIRE1 cLD upon peptide binding by using isoleucines and threonines as NMR visible probes. The chemical perturbation experiments show that peptide binding changes the environment of select residues for both isoleucines and threonines for different peptides and a model unfolded protein. To substantiate our findings, we complemented the chemical shift mapping with PRE approach, where we attach a spin label to a peptide to identify residues in the vicinity of the peptide-binding site. The PRE experiments together with the chemical shift perturbation analyses with the wild type IRE1 and IF2 mutant made it possible to define the isoleucines that are in close proximity to the binding site and the ones that are further away and yet shifting due to peptide induced conformational changes. As we described earlier, the changes in isoleucines are not very large as these isoleucines are mostly buried and less sensitive to binding events, we now clarified this point in the manuscript (subsection “Peptide binding stabilizes the open conformation of hIRE1α cLD”). To increase the number of NMR probes and provide additional evidence, we used threonines as NMR markers. Even though these residues are not assigned, threonine peaks display larger shifts upon peptide binding and support a peptide induced conformational change in hIRE1 cLD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A) Is there a mistake in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>? Is the assignment of 124 correct or do you mean 128?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this was a typo in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. We have corrected the mistake. Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) I wonder if your approach to normalize the PREs by surface accessibility is a wise one. Of course residues at the surface can have larger PREs than a proximal but buried residue. But the net result is that in your <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> there is little dynamic range. It is not immediately obvious how to interpret these numbers – a value of 0.13 for 124 is much more significant than 0.2 for 52?</p></disp-quote><p>Unlike most of the studies where PRE experiments are used for mapping intact protein-protein interactions, we find the normalization of the surface exposure to be important for the experiments conducted with peptides. To address the reviewer’s concern about the significance of the broadening of Ile124 versus Ile52, we now placed a more stringent cut off in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, which placed Ile124 in the same category as Ile128 and Ile52.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) In the subsection “Oligomerization leads to global conformational changes in hIRE1α cLD”, second paragraph, it speaks about the chemical shift changes to 124 and 128 as indicative of conformational changes.

Again, the changes are tiny.</p></disp-quote><p>The chemical shifts upon formation of hIRE1 cLD oligomers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, especially the chemical shift of Ile128 is significant and large (please see quantifications in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting a change in the environment of Ile128 due to a conformational change.</p><p>While we observe a smaller chemical shift for Ile263 peak upon peptide binding, this peak shifts reproducibly in various experiments where we monitor binding of different peptides and unfolded proteins.

Why is it not possible that Ire1 responds both to BiP concentration and unfolded protein load?</p></disp-quote><p>The current manuscript focuses on the unfolded protein induced activation of mammalian IRE1 providing evidence that BiP is not the sole/primary regulator of the response in higher eukaryotes. We and others showed clearly for the yeast Ire1 that the interaction with the BiP ortholog Kar2 is dispensable for Ire1 activation and instead it modulates deactivation dynamics of Ire1. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we remain that it is most plausible that a conserved mechanism is in place for mammalian IRE1 to tune the response. We added discussion to clarify our point, please see the Discussion section, third paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The binding studies conducted by the authors involved peptides. Can the authors comment on binding of intact proteins as well?</p></disp-quote><p>We already showed binding of intact CH1 domain of IgG and Staphylococcus nuclease mutant D131D as model unfolded proteins in this study, please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and subsection “hIRE1α cLD binds to unfolded proteins”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A number of concerns were raised concerning the identification of human Ire1 binding sequences. There were no sequences in the MPZ lumenal domain that interacted with recombinant Ire1α-cLD, whereas the sequence that was used for the bulk of experiments is located in the cytosolic domain. Although this doesn't interfere with the conclusion that human Ire can bind peptides, the conclusions about the type of sequences that it can bind may not be reliable, since this protein does induce a UPR in mammalian cells. A second point involves the Sars-CoV, 8ab protein. The paper cited for this protein demonstrates that it binds to ATF6 and induces its cleavage but has no effect on Ire1 or PERK activation. So if a peptide from this protein can bind to Ire1, it is not sufficient to activate it. Lastly, the CH1 domain produced by Marcinowski et al. was oxidized, which resulted in BiP binding to it with BiP's lid in a much more open conformation than when peptides bound to it. Do the authors find that the perturbation of Ire1 luminal domain is much greater in order to accommodate this client than when peptides are used in the NMR studies?</p></disp-quote><p>The tiling arrays for the MPZ protein show that both IRE1 cLD and BiP also binds peptides derived from its lumenal domain, albeit less strongly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Yet, even though peptide arrays are powerful in identifying the binding motifs in the context of short peptide sequences, they might not be predictive of interactions in the context of a 3D structure or physiological membrane topology. Therefore it is important to view these results in their intended context, namely as a tool to identify the peptide binding preferences of hIRE1α cLD and BiP, rather than identifying physiologically meaningful interaction within these model proteins. We modified the text accordingly to clarify this point, please see subsection “The lumenal domain of human IRE1α binds unfolded polypeptides”.</p><p>We purified CH1 under reducing conditions according to the protocol described in Feige et al. where they showed the binding of BiP to the reduced form of CH1 is slightly stronger than that of the oxidized form. We now clarified this in the Materials and methods section. We do not see the perturbations to be greater upon CH1 binding compared to peptides, indicating that an exposed portion of CH1 contacts hIRE1 cLD in a similar way as our peptide surrogates.</p></body></sub-article></article>
