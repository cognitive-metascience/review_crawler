neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hallberg and Palmer, 2013</xref>). Vertebrate ALK has been considered to be an orphan receptor and the identity of the ALK ligand(s) is a critical issue. Here we show that FAM150A and FAM150B are potent ligands for human ALK that bind to the extracellular domain of ALK and in addition to activation of wild-type ALK are able to drive 'superactivation' of activated ALK mutants from neuroblastoma. In conclusion, our data show that ALK is robustly activated by the FAM150A/B ligands and provide an opportunity to develop ALK-targeted therapies in situations where ALK is overexpressed/activated or mutated in the context of the full length receptor.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09811.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09811.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09811.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells have receptor proteins on their surface that enable them to detect changes in their environment and communicate with other cells. Signal molecules bind to a segment of the receptor called the extracellular domain that faces out from the cell. This can result in the activation of another domain in the receptor that is just inside the cell, which, in turn, activates signaling pathways that relay the information around the cell.</p><p>However, these communication systems are often disrupted in cancer cells. This helps the cells to override the strict growth controls imposed upon them by other (healthy) cells in the body. The gene that encodes a receptor protein called Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (or ALK for short) is often mutated in some types of human cancer so that the protein is always active. However, we still do not know what signal molecules bind to the ALK protein to activate it in normal cells.</p><p>Guan, Umapathy et al. used a variety of cell biology and biochemical techniques to study the role of ALK. The experiments show that when either of two proteins called FAM150A and FAM150B are produced in rat nerve cells alongside ALK, the nerve cells rapidly respond and form outgrowths. Experiments using cancer cells derived from human nerve cells also yielded similar results. Guan, Umapathy et al. found that the extracellular domain of ALK can physically interact with FAM150A and FAM150B.</p><p>The eyes of fruit flies that had been genetically modified to produce the human ALK protein alongside either FAM150A or FAM150B grew more than normal, giving the eyes an abnormal &quot;rough&quot; appearance. Further experiments showed that FAM150A and FAM150B are also able to increase the level of activation of an ALK mutant protein that is already active. Therefore, in future, the development of drugs that stop FAM150A and FAM150B from binding to ALK may be useful for treating cancers that are driven by high levels of ALK activity. Many challenging questions lie ahead to better understand how FAM150A and FAM150B interact with ALK.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09811.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09811.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neuroblastoma</kwd><kwd>ligand</kwd><kwd>FAM150</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>LTK</kwd><kwd>ALK</kwd><kwd>Anaplastic lymphoma kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden (Swedish Cancer Society)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12-0796</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palmer</surname><given-names>Ruth H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>621-2011-5181</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palmer</surname><given-names>Ruth H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006313</institution-id><institution>Barncancerfonden (Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13/0049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palmer</surname><given-names>Ruth H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001729</institution-id><institution>Stiftelsen för Strategisk Forskning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13-0204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hallberg</surname><given-names>Bengt</given-names></name><name><surname>Palmer</surname><given-names>Ruth H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden (Swedish Cancer Society)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12-0722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hallberg</surname><given-names>Bengt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>521-2012-2831</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hallberg</surname><given-names>Bengt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006313</institution-id><institution>Barncancerfonden (Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14/150</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hallberg</surname><given-names>Bengt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The secreted molecules FAM150A and FAM150B bind to the ALK RTK extracellular domain, potently activating the receptor activation and driving downstream signaling events.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Activation of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is commonly due to fusion of the ALK kinase domain with a dimerization partner that drives activation, however, ALK activation also occurs in the context of the full length receptor, for example, as activating point mutations in neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Maris et al., 2007</xref>;

In many additional tumor types ALK overexpression and activation has been described, and it is unclear whether this is dependent on the activity of a ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hallberg and Palmer 2013</xref>). The ALK receptors in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic> have well defined ligands – Jeb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Englund et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stute et al., 2004</xref>) and HEN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ishihara et al., 2002</xref>), respectively. In contrast, vertebrate ALK has long been considered as an orphan receptor.</p><p>The human <italic>ALK</italic> locus encodes a classical receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) comprising a unique extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hallberg and Palmer, 2013</xref>). The extracellular portion of ALK which contains two MAM domains (named after meprin, A-5 protein and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase μ), a glycine-rich region (GR) and a LDLa domain, is unique among the RTKs. ALK, and the related leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) RTK, share kinase domain similarities as well as a GR in the membrane proximal portion of their extracellular domains (ECDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Iwahara et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Morris et al., 1997</xref>). Recent screening of the extracellular proteome identified two novel secreted proteins as ligands for LTK – family with sequence similarity 150A (FAM150A) and family with sequence similarity 150B (FAM150B). Both bind to the ECD of the receptor leading to activation of downstream signaling in cell culture models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). FAM150A and FAM150B are unique, displaying homology only with one another but not with any other proteins in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we found the reported strong expression of FAM150B in the human adrenal gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) intriguing, given the role of ALK in neuroblastoma.</p><p>Here we report the identification of FAM150A and FAM150B as potent ligands for human ALK. We investigated ALK activation by FAM150A and FAM150B proteins in PC12 cell neurite outgrowth assays where we observed a strong activation of ALK signaling. Conditioned medium containing either FAM150A or FAM150B was able to activate endogenous ALK signaling in neuroblastoma cells. We also employed the model organism <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as a readout for activation of ALK by FAM150A and FAM150B, showing that FAM150 proteins are able to robustly drive human ALK activation when ectopically coexpressed in the fly. FAM150A and FAM150B bind to the ECD of ALK and, in addition to activation of wild-type ALK, are able to drive ‘superactivation’ of activated ALK mutants from neuroblastoma. The GR of the ALK receptor ECD is important for FAM150 activation, and monoclonal antibodies (mAb) recognizing the GR of ALK are able to inhibit activation of ALK by FAM150A. In conclusion, our data show that ALK is robustly activated by FAM150A/B finally providing an answer to the identity of the elusive ligands for this RTK.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>ALK and the related LTK share similarity in their membrane proximal ECD in the form of a glycine-rich domain that is ∼250 amino acids in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, GR depicted in grey). This domain contains multiple runs of up to eight glycine residues, and is unique to ALK and LTK within the human genome.

Expression of either FAM150A, or FAM150B or ALK alone, did not lead to activation. This was in contrast to the strong activation seen with the positive control ALK-F1174L which is a well characterized constitutively active ALK neuroblastoma mutation. However, coexpression with either FAM150A or FAM150B led to robust activation of ALK neurite outgrowth activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1D</xref>). This ALK activation was visualized by phosphorylation of Y1604 in the tail of the ALK intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and was further associated with stimulation of downstream signaling such as the phosphorylation of the downstream target ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). Thus in PC12 cells FAM150A and FAM150B act to stimulate signaling via the wild-type ALK receptor, in a manner that leads to phosphorylation of the ALK receptor.</p><p>We next tested the ability of exogenously produced FAM150A or FAM150B to activate ALK, employing medium conditioned with FAM150A or FAM150B to activate PC12 cells expressing ALK. Addition of conditioned medium from cells expressing FAM150A or FAM150B led to strong activation of ALK in receiving cells that expressed ALK, as measured by neurite outgrowth and activation of downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>).

Once again, we observed robust activation of ALK by the addition of either FAM150A-containing or FAM150B-containing conditioned medium, employing pALK-Y1604 and pERK1/2 as readout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The activation of ALK and downstream signaling events in IMR-32 cells were effectively blocked by the addition of 250 nM crizotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The activation of exogenous ALK in PC12 cells or endogenous ALK in IMR-32 cells was reproduced with the addition of recombinant FAM150A purified from Sf21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

This response was observed at the level of ALK receptor phosphorylation (pALK-Y1604), and with downstream pERK5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Umapathy et al., 2014</xref>) and pERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>).

Thus we observed that exogenously produced FAM150A and FAM150B proteins stimulate ALK signaling in both PC12 cells and IMR-32 cells. We also examined potential modulation of ALK activation by FAM150A/B upon addition of heparin, which has recently been reported to activate ALK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murray et al., 2015</xref>).

These antibodies were next tested for their ability to modulate the activation of ALK by purified FAM150A. While mAb135 had no effect on FAM150A activation of ALK, we observed that mAb13 exhibited strong inhibition of FAM150A-induced ALK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), while mAb48 robustly activated ALK in the absence of FAM150A ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Taken together, these data strongly support a role for the GR in the activation of ALK by FAM150 proteins.</p><p>In cell lines as well as in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, we observed extremely high levels of ALK activation when compared even with highly active ALK mutants such as ALK-F1174S, suggesting the possibility that these already active mutants can be activated to a higher level in the presence of a potent ligand. Therefore, we examined the ability of either FAM150A or FAM150B to ‘superactivate’ already active ALK mutants as described in neuroblastoma. In PC12 cells we indeed observed activation of the ALK-R1275Q mutant to a higher level, as evidenced by increased pERK1/2 and in neurite outgrowth assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). A similar effect was observed with the ALK-F1174L mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). This increased activity was also seen in CLB-GAR cells, which endogenously express the ALK-R1275Q mutant, with increased activation of ERK1/2 upon the addition of either FAM150A or FAM150B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our work identifies FAM150A and FAM150B as novel ligands that bind and activate the human ALK RTK. The identity of a ligand(s) for vertebrate ALK has been an evolving question for many years, with a number of reports over the past 15 years examining the role of the small heparin binding growth factors MDK and PTN as ligands for vertebrate ALK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stoica et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stoica et al., 2002</xref>). However, a number of independent studies including our own work have presented convincing evidence that MDK and PTN do not activate ALK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Motegi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Moog-Lutz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mourali et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mathivet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hugosson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murray et al., 2015</xref>). The recent identification of long chain heparins as activators of ALK in neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murray et al., 2015</xref>) and the interplay of this with ALK activation by FAM150A and FAM150B will require further work. FAM150A and FAM150B are very basic proteins; FAM150A has a predicted pI of 10.6, while FAM150B has one of 9.75, and we show here that FAM150A exhibits heparin binding properties, however we have not observed a cooperative role of heparin and the FAM150 ligands in ALK activation as has been described for the fibroblast growth factor receptors and FGF. Our data also suggest that FAM150 ligands can bind an ALK-LTK heterodimer complex. While the physiological significance of such an interaction is currently unclear, ALK and LTK have been reported to be coexpressed in some tissues, such as the mouse hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Weiss et al., 2012</xref>), where such an interaction may be important.</p><p>FAM150 proteins do not seem to be conserved outside the vertebrates. In zebrafish there are three FAM150 proteins (FAM150ba, FAM150bb and FAM150A), while in mouse and humans only FAM150A and FAM150B exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). In invertebrate model organisms the ALK ligands, Jeb in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and HEN-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, do not appear to resemble the FAM150A/B ligands. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Jeb ligand is unable to activate either mouse or human ALK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yang et al., 2007</xref>), and to date, no Jeb-like ligand for vertebrate ALKs has been reported. The evolution of the FAM150 proteins as ALK ligands is an interesting topic for further investigation.</p><p>In the case of ALK mutations that are ligand dependent, as well as in situations where the ALK receptor is overexpressed, such as in neuroblastoma, the mechanisms by which ALK is activated is fundamental for understanding their role in tumor development. Here the identification of ALK ligands will allow a more rigorous interrogation of ALK signaling in these scenarios. The finding that FAM150A and FAM150B are not only able to activate the wild-type receptor, but also to ‘superactivate’ mutant ALK receptors, is important in this context. These findings, together with the observed expression pattern of FAM150A and FAM150B in adrenal gland and thyroid and the inhibition of ALK activation by FAM150A with monoclonal antibodies shown here, suggest that a future potential therapeutic arm may involve agents that interfere with FAM150A/B activation of ALK offering additional therapeutic approaches in patients with neuroblastoma for which single drug treatments targeting ALK have had limited effect to date.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Antibodies and inhibitors</title><p>The primary antibodies used were anti-pan-ERK (1:10,000; BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-ALK (for immunofluorescence 1:1000; ab4061, Abcam), anti-ALK (D5F3, 1:5000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-ALK mAb135 (1:2000; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Witek et al., 2015</xref>]), anti-pERK5 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-pALK-Y1278 (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-pALK-Y1604 (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-pERK1/2-T202/Y204 (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-FAM150A (1:4000, Atlas Antibodies), anti-HA (1:1000 for immunofluorescence, 1:6000 for immunoblotting; 16B12, Covance).

The authors previously showed that FAM150A and FAM150B bind LTK. Based on similarity between LTK and ALK in the membrane proximal domain, the authors hypothesized that FAM150A and FAM150B also bind ALK. They demonstrate that conditioned medium containing FAM150A and FAM150B can activate ALK, that FAM150A and ALK co-IP when overexpressed, that expression of FAM150A and FAM150B and ALK in fly eyes induces a phenotype consistent with an interaction and biophysical studies that suggest that FAM150A and ALK bind.</p><p>The identification of ligands for the ALK RTK is important, particularly because of the involvement of ALK mutations in human cancer. The authors present some evidence that is consistent with the conclusion that FAM150A and FAM150B act as ALK ligands. However, the presented evidence falls short of definitively supporting this conclusion.</p><p>1) The structure of the paper should be revised. There is no Introduction and the first paragraph of the Results section represents an extended abstract. Moreover, the findings should be presented in the past tense.</p><p>2) The authors' premise for these studies is that the membrane proximal Gly-rich extracellular region of ALK represents the FAM150A/B binding site based on homology with LTK.

Moreover, from Figure 3—figure supplement 1, it appears as if the affinity of FAM150A is about 50-fold higher for binding to LTK than for binding to ALK. Is the rather low affinity interaction between FAM150 and ALK of physiological importance?

This should be tested directly. </italic></p><p>As suggested, the importance of the glycine-rich region of ALK in the interaction with FAM150A/B has been examined. Although we are concerned that deletion of such a large portion of the ALK ECD will have serious repercussions for the receptor we have tested the ability of either FAM150A or FAM150B to bind to a glycine-rich region deletion mutant of ALK (ALK-DelGR). We were surprised to find that the binding of FAM150B to ALK-DelGR was severely impaired, while FAM150A is still able to bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Further experiments, outlined in more detail in points 3 and 4 below, strongly support an important role of the glycine-rich domain in the binding and activation of ALK by the FAM150 proteins. Firstly (related to point 3 below), mutation of individual glycines in the ALK ECD abolishes binding FAM150B to ALK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Once again, as we would predict from the analysis of the ALK glycine-rich deletion mutant, interaction of FAM150A with ALK single glycine mutations is still observed. Secondly (related to point 4 below), we were able to identify antibodies recognizing the ALK glycine-rich domain which block activation of ALK by FAM150A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Do mutations of conserved glycines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) reduce FAM150A/B binding? </italic></p><p>To perform this experiment we mutated each of the four conserved glycines in the human ALK ECD that are known to result in a loss of function ALK receptor in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Lorén et al., 2003). In the human ALK receptor these residues are G740, G823, G893 and G934. We show that while FAM150A binding to ALK is still observed in the glycine mutants as well as the WT ALK receptor, the binding of FAM150B is abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Currently we do not understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the discrepancy between FAM150A and FAM150B binding that we observe; however these data suggest that there are differences in FAM150A and FAM150B interactions with the ALK.</p><p><italic>4) Do available agonist/antagonist ALK antibodies interfere with FAM150A/B binding? </italic></p><p>We have investigated this in the revised manuscript. We have a number of antibodies generated towards the ALK ECD (Moog-Lutz, JBC, 2005, Witek, PLoS ONE, 2015) which we have tested. Initially we examined which of these were able to recognize the ALK glycine-rich region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). These were then further tested for their ability to interfere with the activation of ALK by FAM150A/B. We were able to identify one anti-ALK mAb (mAb13) that bound to the glycine-rich region of ALK and effectively blocks activation of endogenous ALK by FAM150A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This was not exclusive to one cell neuroblastoma cell line, as we could show this inhibition of ALK activation by FAM150A in both IMR-32 and NB1 cells.</p><p><italic>5) The authors state that heparin was recently described as an activating ligand for ALK and speculate that heparin and FAM150 may act synergistically. This possibility should be tested experimentally using purified FAM150. </italic></p><p>We have investigated the activation of ALK by heparin, in the presence and absence of either FAM150A/B. We have examined this in PC12 cells transfected with ALK as well as in NB1 and IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell lines that express WT ALK. We have been unable to show either activation of ALK by heparin alone, nor any synergistic effect of heparin together with the FAM150A/B ligands. We have tried this in cells with (i) FAM150A/B conditioned medium, (ii) purified FAM150A proteins, and additional with experiments in which cells were plated on heparin coated plates. In all cases we saw a slight inhibition of FAM150A/B activation upon addition of heparin, rather than a synergistic activation. We also examined the effect of heparin in ELISA, where there was comparable binding of FAM150A with the addition of heparin (data not shown). Some of this data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. Thus, at the present time we are unable to show activation of WT ALK with heparin, however, we have observed a strong interaction between the FAM150 proteins and heparin, with both FAM150A and FAM150B binding strongly to heparin-agarose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since the FAM150A and FAM150B proteins are very basic in nature, with a predicted pI of 10.6 for FAM150A and 9.75 for FAM150B), we suspect that heparin, or heparin modified proteoglycans may be involved in the activation of ALK by FAM150 proteins. This will clearly be an important issue to clarify in the future.</p><p><italic>6) The authors determined the Kd for binding of FAM150A to ALK to be approximately 20 nM, which is a rather low affinity compared to most other RTK-ligand interactions. Moreover, from Figure 3—figure supplement 1, it appears as if the affinity of FAM150A is about 50-fold higher for binding to LTK than for binding to ALK. Is the rather low affinity interaction between FAM150 and ALK of physiological importance? Is there a co-factor involved (see point 5 above)? </italic></p><p>A range of ligand affinities for different RTKs and their ligands have been reported, often higher that the 20nM we report here for ALK and FAM150A. One of the most studied ligand-RTK receptor pair examples is EGF-EGFR, where one published estimate is a binding affinity of 6nM (Ozcan et al., PNAS, 2006). The reviewer is correct that the affinity of ALK for the FAM150A proteins is significantly lower than for LTK. In our experiments we consistently note that FAM150B is a very strong activator and binder of ALK, and suspect that FAM150B may bind ALK very strongly. Unfortunately we have been unable to produce purified FAM150B protein and thus have not been able to directly measure affinity of the FAM150B-ALK interaction. This is something that we hope to be able to address in the future, but are currently unable to do so due to technical difficulties.</p><p>Based on these results, and the comment from the reviewer, we examined the interplay between FAM150A, ALK and LTK. We show that both FAM150A and ALK are immunoprecipitated with LTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, we suggest in the revised version of the manuscript that ALK and LTK are potentially able to form a complex binding to FAM150A. Indeed, these proteins are known to be co-expressed in some neural tissues, such as the mouse hippocampus (Weiss et al., Pharmacol, Biochem Behav, 2011), and such an interaction may be of important in this context. This observation will require further studies to understand the physiological significance of such an interaction.</p><p><italic>7) Can endogenous interactions between FAM150A/B and ALK be demonstrated? If not, this should be noted as a deficiency of the study. </italic></p><p>Despite extensive efforts we are unable to show endogenous interaction between FAM150A/B. We are hesitant to agree that this should be noted as a deficiency of the study since very few studies show interaction of a secreted peptide ligand for a receptor tyrosine kinase through immunoprecipitation with its ligand at the level of endogenous proteins. Furthermore, while we have excellent ALK antibodies, we have no antibody that recognizes FAM150B, and our FAM150A antibodies work only on immunoblotting. Thus, while we have attempted to show endogenous interaction, we do not currently have the optimal tools to test this robustly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
