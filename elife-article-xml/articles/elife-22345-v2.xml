Maternally inherited factors play a key role in this critical developmental process, which occurs at the 2-cell stage in mice. We investigated the function of the maternally inherited factor Stella (encoded by <italic>Dppa3</italic>) using single-cell/embryo approaches. We show that loss of maternal Stella results in widespread transcriptional mis-regulation and a partial failure of MZT. Strikingly, activation of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) is significantly impaired in Stella maternal/zygotic knockout embryos, which in turn leads to a failure to upregulate chimeric transcripts. Amongst ERVs, MuERV-L activation is particularly affected by the absence of Stella, and direct in vivo knockdown of MuERV-L impacts the developmental potential of the embryo. We propose that Stella is involved in ensuring activation of ERVs, which themselves play a potentially key role during early development, either directly or through influencing embryonic gene expression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22345.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22345.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22345.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a sperm cell fertilizes an egg cell, this creates a single-celled embryo called a zygote that will go on to divide repeatedly throughout development. The zygote inherits the contents of the egg including many important proteins that initially control how the embryo develops. In mice, the embryo takes over control of development once the zygote has divided to form a two-celled embryo. This transition of control destroys the maternally inherited proteins and selectively activates zygotic genes and some DNA sequences called transposable elements that evolved from virus DNA.</p><p>One of the proteins inherited from the egg cell is called Stella. Embryos that lack Stella die within the first few cell divisions, which suggests that the protein is needed during the earliest stages of development. However, it is not clear what Stella's role in the early embryo is.</p><p>Huang, Kim et al. decided to investigate how Stella might affect the genes that are switched on during development by using a technique called RNA-seq to study egg cells and early embryos from mice. Two-celled embryos that lacked Stella could not activate a number of genes that produce proteins that are critical for development. They also failed to activate a group of transposable elements called endogenous retroviruses. In particular, a lack of Stella significantly reduced the activity of an endogenous retrovirus called MuERV-L.</p><p>Further experiments showed that MuERV-L is needed for normal embryonic development, and so suggests that transposable elements play important roles in this process. Future studies will aim to explore these roles in more detail. It will also be important to identify the genes that Stella targets in embryos, and to investigate the roles that similar maternally inherited proteins play in early embryonic development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22345.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22345.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maternally inherited factors in the zygote play a critical role during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ancelin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wasson et al., 2016</xref>). The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) marks the time of transfer of developmental control to the embryo following activation of the zygotic genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2013</xref>). In mice, the major wave of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs at the late 2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golbus et al., 1973</xref>). The earliest zygotically transcribed genes are preferentially enriched in essential processes such as transcription, RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamatani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). Other events that characterise early pre-implantation development include extensive erasure of global DNA methylation and dynamic changes in histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cantone and Fisher, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that Stella, encoded by the <italic>Dppa3</italic> gene locus, is a maternally inherited factor that is required for normal pre-implantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bortvin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Payer et al., 2003</xref>). Stella is a small basic protein with a putative SAP-like domain and splicing-like factor; it also contains nuclear localisation and export signal and has the potential to bind to DNA and RNA in-vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Payer et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Expression of Stella is high in oocytes, continues through pre-implantation development, and subsequently occurs specifically in primordial germ cells. Stella is also expressed in naïve embryonic stem cells, but is downregulated upon exit from pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayashi et al., 2008</xref>). Lack of maternal inheritance of Stella results in developmental defects; these manifest from the 2-cell stage onwards, and result in only a small proportion of embryos developing to the blastocyst stage. Notably, a maternally inherited pool of Stella in zygotic Stella knockout embryos, derived from Stella heterozygous females, allows development to progress normally. This indicates Stella has a key role during the earliest developmental events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Payer et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Stella was suggested to protect maternal pronuclei (PN) from TET3 mediated active DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the absence of Stella, zygotes display enrichment of 5hmC in both parental PN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wossidlo et al., 2011</xref>), and an aberrant accumulation of γH2AX in maternal chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakatani et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, Stella protects DNA methylation levels at selected imprinted genes and transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>). However, embryos depleted of maternal effect proteins known to regulate imprinted genes only exhibit developmental defects post-implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denomme and Mann, 2013</xref>), implying that the 2-cell phenotype in Stella maternal/zygotic knockout (Stella M/Z KO) embryos is not primarily linked with imprint defects. Moreover, TET3 only partially contributes to DNA demethylation and its absence is compatible with embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amouroux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsukada et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, what impairs pre-implantation embryonic development in the absence of maternal Stella remains unclear.</p><p>A significant number of transposable elements (TEs) are preferentially activated during early development and in a sub-population of mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gifford et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rowe and Trono, 2011</xref>). Notably, at the 2-cell (2C) stage in mouse development, there is selective upregulation of endogenous retrovirus (ERVs), which are a subset of TEs characterised by the presence of LTRs that mediate expression and retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kigami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ribet et al., 2008</xref>). Growing evidence suggests that activation of some TEs has important biological functions during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beraldi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kigami et al., 2003</xref>). TEs can regulate tissue-specific gene expression or splicing through their exaptation as gene regulatory elements, and may also play a key role during speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Böhne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gifford et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rebollo et al., 2012</xref>). TEs additionally drive expression of genes directly by acting as alternative promoters that generate chimeric transcripts, which include both TE and protein-coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peaston et al., 2004</xref>). Thus the expression of TEs may be functionally important during early embryo development and understanding the regulation of TEs themselves is therefore of great interest.</p><p>We adopted an unbiased approach to investigate the role of Stella during mouse maternal-to-zygotic transition, using single-cell/embryo RNA-seq analysis of mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xue et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). We find Stella M/Z KO 2-cell embryos fail to upregulate key zygotic genes involved in regulation of ribosome and RNA processing. Furthermore, the absence of Stella results in widespread misregulation of TEs and of chimeric transcripts that are derived from these TEs. In particular, Stella M/Z KO embryos exhibit a general failure to upregulate MuERV-L transcripts and protein at the 2-cell stage. Our perturbation data is consistent with MuERV-L playing a functionally important role during pre-implantation embryonic development, implying that MuERV-L is amongst the critical factors affected by Stella in early embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stella M/Z KO embryos are transcriptionally distinct from wild type embryos</title><p>We used Stella knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Payer et al., 2003</xref>), to collect mutant oocytes and embryos for single-cell/embryo RNA-seq with modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2010</xref>).

The largest separation is observed between oocyte/1-cell and 2-cell embryos, consistent with the degradation of maternal transcripts and activation of the zygotic genome at MZT. The second and third PCs capture the separation between WT and KO samples, suggesting distinct genome-wide gene expression changes between WT and KO embryos. Furthermore, although KO oocytes and 1-cell embryos exhibit some separation from their WT counterparts, the difference is more clearly pronounced at the 2-cell stage. Notably, Stella M/Z KO 1-cell and 2-cell embryos clustered separately from each other, suggesting that Stella M/Z KO defects at the 2-cell stage are not simply due to delayed developmental progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis between WT and KO samples identified 5881 misregulated genes (adjusted p-value&lt;0.05) across the developmental stages with 360 genes overlapping across all stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stella M/Z KO embryos are impaired in maternal-to-zygotic transition</title><p>Next, we compared the differentially expressed genes (DEG) against a public database of early mouse embryonic transcriptomes (DBTMEE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2015</xref>). This dataset categorises genes by specific expression pattern at any developmental stage. Strikingly, we found significant enrichment of maternal transcripts (maternal RNA, minor zygotic genome activation and 1-cell transient genes) and depletion of zygotic transcripts (major zygotic genome activation, 2-cell transient and mid pre-implantation activation) in the Stella M/Z KO 2-cell embryos compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While Stella KO oocytes are transcriptionally distinct from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), Stella KO oocytes do not exhibit overt abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bortvin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Payer et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, the apparent enrichment in maternal transcripts only manifests at the 2-cell stage, suggesting the observed transcriptional differences are not inherited from aberrant transcripts in the Stella KO oocyte but are likely linked to failed downregulation of these maternal transcripts.</p><p>To independently characterise differences in gene expression dynamics between WT and KO embryos during MZT, genes were clustered based on their pattern of expression in WT oocytes, 1-cell and 2-cell embryos. We identified a cluster of maternal transcripts (ED), defined as highly expressed in WT oocytes and 1-cell and with reduced expression at the 2-cell stage, that are differentially expressed in KO samples (n = 849, adjusted p-value&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). Of these genes, 37.7% did not show the expected reduction in expression in Stella M/Z KO 2-cell embryos. Furthermore, we detected a group of zygotically activated genes (ZAG) (EU) with low expression in WT oocytes and 1-cell embryos and increased expression in 2-cell embryos, which are differentially expressed in KO samples (n = 698, adjusted p-value&lt;0.05). Moreover, 39.5% of this group of genes exhibited significantly dampened 2-cell activation in the absence of maternal and zygotic Stella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>).

Genes regulating essential processes such as RNA processing are depleted in Stella M/Z KO 2-cell embryos and <italic>Dppa3</italic> exhibits positive expression correlation with genes enriched in these processes. Notably, most genes however do undergo appropriate MZT changes in mutant embryos, arguing against a general developmental delay. Taken together, this supports a hypothesis whereby Stella plays an important role in upregulating the expression of a subset of genes that are essential during zygotic genome activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Expression of TEs are dysregulated in Stella KO oocytes and Stella M/Z KO embryos</title><p>Stella has been shown to affect the DNA methylation of particular TEs in zygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>) and primordial germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakashima et al., 2013</xref>). Since many TEs are specifically activated during early development, we investigated their expression in WT and KO oocytes and embryos. We remapped the single-cell/embryo RNA sequencing data to obtain read counts for class I TEs (retrotransposons) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">2</xref>). To get an overview of the extent of TE activation, we calculated the fraction of transcripts mapped to TEs as a ratio of total mapped reads. We found a dramatic increase in the ratio of reads mapped to TEs, primarily of the LTR class, at the 2-cell stage compared to oocyte and 1-cell, suggesting widespread TE activation coincident with MZT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

To characterise the disparities between TE expression in WT and KO, we compared differentially expressed TEs at the 2-cell stage, with maternal and zygotic TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Strikingly, TEs upregulated in Stella M/Z KO 2-cells are significantly enriched for maternal TEs while TEs downregulated in Stella M/Z KO 2-cells are associated with zygotic TEs. Furthermore, Stella M/Z KO 2-cell embryos display lower activation of LTR, specifically the endogenous retrovirus (LTR-ERVL) family, with small relative enrichment for LINE and SINE classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>A particular element of interest is MuERV-L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kigami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ribet et al., 2008</xref>), which encodes a canonical retroviral <italic>Gag</italic> and <italic>Pol</italic>, flanked by 5’ and 3’ LTR (also known as MT2_Mm). We observed a selective upregulation of MuERV-L-Int and MT2_Mm transcripts at the 2-cell stage, but this was significantly reduced in Stella M/Z KO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Many MuERV-L elements have an open reading frame and we therefore tested protein levels using a MuERV-L Gag antibody. This antibody was validated by showing staining overlaps well with a MuERV-L reporter ESC line – 2C::tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>), and is specific to 2-cell embryos whilst not detected in metaphase II oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Strikingly, immunofluorescence (IF) staining showed a significantly lower signal and loss of perinuclear localisation of MuERV-L Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ribet et al., 2008</xref>) in Stella M/Z KO 2-cell embryos compared to WT, implying Stella influences both transcript and protein levels of MuERV-L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether Stella directly binds to specific transcripts / TEs we turned to ESC since obtaining sufficient 2-cell embryos for this analysis is intractable. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq (ChIP-seq) of HA-tagged Stella resulted in minimal peak calls (n = 56) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), implying Stella does not efficiently bind DNA (including MuERV-L) in ESC. Consistently, neither overexpression nor knockdown of <italic>Dppa3</italic> in mESC had a marked effect on the expression of MuERV-L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that Stella-mediated control of MuERV-L is likely specific to the unique chromatin/cellular context of early embryos. Notably Stella has the potential to bind both RNA and DNA and could thus affect TEs through multiple modes. Overall, our data suggests Stella plays a key role in regulating a subset of TEs specifically in 2-cell embryos, which includes promoting strong activation of MuERV-L elements.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Expression of a subset of TEs is positively correlated with their nearest gene</title><p>Next we explored the relationship between TE and protein-coding gene expression in WT and KO samples. First, we considered the intersection between differentially expressed genes and genes that are neighbours of misregulated TEs at the 2-cell stage, and discovered a highly significant overlap of 12% between the two populations (p=3.19 × 10<sup>−87</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Notably, a greater number of TEs downregulated in KO 2-cell embryos are located within 10 kb of the transcriptional start site of zygotically activated genes (ZAG, n = 698) than expected by chance (p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Altogether, this suggests perturbations in TE expression may be linked to neighbouring mRNA expression levels in Stella M/Z KO embryos. To determine if this relationship is applicable genome-wide, we performed global expression correlation analysis between a TE and its nearest gene. To eliminate confounding factors, we excluded TEs that overlap directly with an exon. Notably, we detected 387 TEs whose expression levels were positively correlated with their nearest gene (Spearman’s correlation &gt;0.7) while 224 TEs were negatively correlated (Spearman’s correlation &lt;−0.7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This relationship was validated using single-embryo qRT-PCR at four genomic loci, which demonstrated a significant correlation between the expression of a TE and its downstream gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These loci were selected to represent a range of LTR class elements; RMER19A, ORR1A2-Int and MT2B are further categorised into ERVK, ERVL-MaLR and ERVL families respectively.

One possibility is the establishment of alternative splicing events, which create a junction between an expressed TE and a downstream gene exon, thus leading to the formation of a chimeric transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peaston et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, MuERV-L has been shown to form such fusion transcripts with 307 genes at the 2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we find Stella M/Z KO embryos with the lowest MuERV-L expression also express lower levels of genes that make a chimeric junction with MuERV-L elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, the KO embryo with the highest MuERV-L expression expresses higher levels of these genes. Importantly, we next identified and validated a number of chimeric transcripts that are expressed in 2-cell embryos by PCR and sequenced across the chimeric junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Single-embryo qRT-PCR shows most of these chimeric transcripts are expressed at lower levels in KO compared to WT 2-cell embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These chimeric transcripts include <italic>Snrpc</italic>, which encodes for a component of the ribonucleoprotein required for the formation of the spliceosome, and the RNA binding protein, <italic>Rmb8a</italic>. Our data implies a link between activation of some TEs and the emergent gene expression network, which is perturbed in Stella M/Z KO embryos due to altered TE expression. This is, in part, mediated by TEs directly regulating gene expression through chimeric transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>MuERV-L plays a functional role during pre-implantation development</title><p>We propose that the dysregulation in TE expression might directly contribute to the abnormal pre-implantation phenotype observed in Stella M/Z KO embryos.

We considered that attenuated MuERV-L activation in Stella M/Z KO embryos could in turn disrupt activation of associated 2-cell transcripts driven by their LTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Alternatively, MuERV-L mRNA/protein itself may also have a functional role during early embryonic development.</p><p>We detected 583 copies of the full-length MuERV-L element, containing the complete <italic>gag</italic> and <italic>pol</italic> genes, in the genome. This makes it experimentally challenging to completely eliminate MuERV-L activation in early embryos. Nevertheless, we utilised siRNA to knockdown the expression of MuERV-L elements in 1-cell embryos and monitored the effects on embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We designed siRNA to target the consensus sequence of MuERV-L from the Dfam database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hubley et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Maternally inherited factors such as Stella play a role in this transition in mouse oocytes but the difficulties of obtaining sufficient materials has hindered investigations on how they contribute to MZT. Here, we use single-cell/embryo approaches and find that deletion of maternal and zygotic Stella affects MZT. Furthermore, we observed a failure to activate endogenous retrovirus (LTR-ERVL), and specifically MuERV-L elements. In parallel there is an accumulation of maternal transcripts and a failure to upregulate many zygotic transcripts. These events appear to be partially coupled, with altered LTR promoter activity leading to changes in gene expression, for example through the modulation of chimeric transcripts. In addition, we reveal the biological relevance of TE expression as knockdown of MuERV-L at the 2-cell stage hinders developmental progression, which likely contributes to the phenotype observed following loss of Stella.</p><p>Maternal mRNA degradation and zygotic genome activation are critical aspects during MZT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Maternal mRNA clearance plays both a permissive and instructive role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>), while ZGA also promotes the final degradation of maternal transcripts. Stella has the potential to function as an RNA binding protein, which might facilitate the degradation of maternal transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Payer et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, Stella KO oocytes exhibit transcriptional differences compared to WT oocytes. This is consistent with a previous study showing Stella KO oocytes are defective in transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), which may be needed for dosage regulation of critical maternally inherited transcripts. Stella has also however been demonstrated to be required beyond oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>). Maternally inherited factors likely influence the timing and specificity of gene expression during ZGA, which is essentially determined by interplay between the transcriptional machinery and histone modifications that influences chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The failure of zygotic transcript activation may be linked to the failure of zygotic TE activation. We detected extensive changes in global TE expression during MZT. This is accompanied by strong upregulation of the LTR-ERVL family in 2-cell embryos, which is consistent with a recent study showing that the chromatin surrounding ERVL is in a highly accessible state at the 2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). LTR-ERVL upregulation is significantly reduced in the absence of maternal Stella, suggesting that Stella may facilitate the activation of many ERVs. The expression changes are validated at the protein level for a specific LTR-ERVL element, MuERV-L. Importantly, the decrease in MuERV-L is unlikely to be a secondary effect of 2-cell embryonic arrest, as maternal <italic>Kdm1a</italic> (LSD1) mutant embryos, which result in pan 2-cell arrest maintain normal MuERV-L transcript expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ancelin et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, whilst many epigenetic mechanisms have been identified for the suppression of ERVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gifford et al., 2013</xref>), we have identified a factor associated with the activation of a subset of ERVs during mammalian MZT.</p><p>The question remains, how does Stella regulate TE expression? In primordial germ cells, Stella directly binds to LINE1 and IAP elements to facilitate DNA demethylation of these targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakashima et al., 2013</xref>). Whilst experimentally challenging, it would be pertinent to determine potential DNA binding targets of Stella in 2-cell embryos. At the same time, function of Stella at the RNA level cannot be excluded, or it could act by altering the epigenetic status of cells at this time. For example, the H3K9 methyltransferase <italic>Setdb1</italic> is aberrantly enriched in Stella M/Z KO 2-cell embryos, and this has been shown to suppress ERVs and chimeric transcripts expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eymery et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karimi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Since a human orthologue of <italic>Dppa3</italic> is expressed in ESCs, germ cells and pre-implantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowles et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Payer et al., 2003</xref>), it would be of interest to know whether <italic>DPPA3</italic> plays a similar role during human pre-implantation development; for example, on the stage specific activation endogenous retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Göke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grow et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>TEs have evidently been co-opted for the regulation of mammalian development as exemplified by the domestication of the retroviral <italic>env</italic> gene, which is essential for placental development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dupressoir et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we have shown that the expression of a subset of TEs are intimately linked to its nearest gene during early embryonic development. As we have shown in several cases, TEs could regulate gene expression through chimeric transcripts, which are misregulated in the absence of Stella. The impact of transcriptional inhibition of ERV programme and associated chimeric transcripts during MZT, and their subsequent effects on development merits further investigation. Intriguingly, we discovered that reducing MuERV-L mRNA/ protein levels at the 2-cell stage affects development. This could suggest that the presence of MuERV-L Gag protein has a functional role during early mouse development, similar to a recent report illustrating a role of endogenous LTR viral-like particles in human blastocyst development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grow et al., 2015</xref>). It is also possible that MuERV-L siRNA KD may downregulate a critical subset of chimeric transcripts that include MuERV-L sequence or, could feedback to target transcriptional repression to MuERV-L loci through small RNA pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castel and Martienssen, 2013</xref>). Disentangling these possibilities warrants further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, we have revealed that Stella is involved in orchestrating the transcriptional changes and activation of endogenous retroviral (ERV) elements during maternal-to-zygotic transition. The appropriate expression of LTR-ERV driven zygotic genes and specific ERV elements (MuERV-L) in turn contribute towards normal early embryonic development in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental methods</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Collection of mouse oocytes and embryos</title><p>All husbandry and experiments involving mice were carried out according to the Home Office guidelines and the local ethics committee.

From the GTF file of RepeatMasker we used for TE counts, we extracted all MERVL-int elements overlapped with the alignments to the <italic>gag</italic> and <italic>pol</italic> genes (<italic>n = 583</italic>). To calculate the specificity of MuERV-L siRNA, we mapped the sequence of MuERV-L siRNA to the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> genome (GRCm38) using Bowtie2 (version 2.3.0) with options ‘-a -N 1 -L 10’. We stratified the SAM alignments into perfect match, one mismatch, and two mismatches by examining the ‘XM:i:&lt;N&gt;' field and counted the alignments overlapped with the full-length MERVL-int elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-12"><title>Confocal acquisition and image analysis</title><p>Full projections of images were taken every 0.5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) or 1.5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and G</xref>) along the z-axis with an inverted Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. For MuERV-L staining in 2-cell embryos, image analysis was carried out using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Measurements of fluorescent intensity were automated using a custom ImageJ macro to create a Huang thresholded 3D cell mask from the fluorescent signal and measure the mean intensity inside each embryo. For measurements of the number of DAPI<sup>+</sup> cells in day five blastocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), we generated a Jython script. To allow reliable counting of clustered cells with widely varying amounts of labelling, a hierarchical k-means segmentation algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dufour et al., 2008</xref>) was implemented to generate a 3D mask, and the ImageJ 3D Object Counter plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>) was used to determine how many separated objects were present by binary connexity analysis.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Richard Butler for his support on the confocal imaging analysis, Charles Bradshaw for bioinformatic support, Todd S Macfarlan and Samuel L Pfaff for the 2C::tdTomato ESCs.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Robb Krumlauf as the Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Didier Trono (Reviewer #1) and Todd S Macfarlan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study presents an interesting set of findings. The strength of this paper is in the genomic analyses, primarily single cell RNA-sequencing approaches and data analysis. They convincingly show failure in MZT of maternal Stella mutants, which is a significant and important finding, although not entirely surprising, since embryogenesis has been previously shown to be impaired in these mutants. There are however two major weaknesses to the work. The first shortcoming is a failure to provide mechanistic insight on how Stella might affect MERVL transcription and regulates MZT genes. The second relates to the lack of clarity of the proposed connection between Stella, MERVL, 2-cell stage-specific genes and MZT. The loss-of-function experiments (via RNAi) of MERVL elements is not entirely convincing. The knockdown as performed should not affect the expression of MuERVL LTR-driven ZGA genes, which are also controlled by STELLA. This offers no mechanistic insight into how the expression of MERVL elements is important for developmental progression. Thus more mechanistic insights would greatly improve the manuscript. However, we realize that extra work showing the requirement of MuERV-L for development might take an extended period that would prevent a timely submission. The authors could change to this conclusion and instead focus on what is regulated by Stella. Hence, as a minimum, there is a need for an enhanced discussion with plausible mechanisms of both Stella and MERVLs role in early development. Furthermore there is a need for controls to address concerns about the interpretation of the MERVL siRNA experiment tests.</p><p>Major specific points:</p><p>1) Mechanism of Stella action. The authors don't attempt any experiment to address how Stella regulates MZT, other than looking at effects on transcription. No data is shown to demonstrate that these effects are direct. It is unlikely that Stella binds both to maternal mRNAs aiding in their destruction while simultaneously activation MERVL promoters like a transcription factor. As a starting point, it would be interesting if the authors could &quot;rescue&quot; the maternal mutants by injecting Stella cDNAs containing mutations in some of its putative domains to tease out domains that might be important for the observed MZT defects. Likewise, the Introduction would benefit from a description of the Stella protein and its known domains.</p><p>2) MERVL loss-of-function experiments. The authors use a siRNA against the MEVL GAG region, which will target some but not all full-length MERVL elements. The authors should provide a list of the genomic MERVL elements (or the percentage) that should be perfect targets, one mismatch, two mismatch, etc. to the siRNA. In other words, provide the reader with the fraction of full-length MERVL elements that should be affected by the siRNA. Additionally, the IF images, even if very carefully performed, can be easily misinterpreted since the embryos are imaged separately. Western blots with the same Gag antibody should also be included. This is achievable since Heidmann's lab reported westerns from 2C embryos over a decade ago.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, it looks like the scramble siRNA reduces MERVL expression relative to uninjected embryos. Is this significant? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and 5H</xref>, the authors should include uninjected embryos for comparison and include statistics. There is a concern that the different phenotypes between scramble siRNA and MERVL siRNA are much less than the difference between uninjected and scramble siRNA. Thus, the reader should be provided this control. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and H</xref> . Given the title, replicating this a few more times to get higher certainty in the effect of MuERV-L knockdown would be appropriate. If this work would be substantial, a change in title and claims about development potential needs to be considered.</p><p>4) There is no mechanistic insight into how knocking down MERVL transcripts (and Gag positive virus particles) affects development and the discussion on this topic is not adequate. In the Discussion, the authors state they found &quot;that reducing MERVL activation at the 2C stage affects development&quot;, but this is misleading, since knocking down MERVL transcripts with an siRNA is not the same as preventing the expression of MERVL elements and the broad open chromatin domains this likely causes. This is testable and one might expect that MERVL siRNAs have little effect on the embryonic transcriptome or chromatin state surrounding MERVLs. A better experiment with this aim would be CRISPRi. It is nonetheless interesting that MERVL element mRNA/proteins seem to be important for development, but there is no experiment that addresses mechanism, or even discussion on a plausible mechanism. For example, might the viral particles themselves be important, similar to the roles proposed for HERVK particles in human embryos (Grow et al., 2015). Since this is a major claim of the paper, it either needs to be softened or it should be supported with more compelling data such as rescue experiments.</p><p>5) It would be interesting to test if the MERVL LOF phenotype is more severe if a portion of the M2t_mm LTR is targeted by an siRNA, since this could potentially target chimeric transcripts in addition to the full-length elements. Was this experiment attempted?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> nicely demonstrates that a subset of MZT genes fails to become activated in Stella KO embryos. The GO analysis illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> further reveals that a lot of different pathways are affected, although none stands out as particularly responsible for the observed phenotype. Panels in 2C and 2D provide useful validations of the RNA seq analyses, yet do not add any specific information hence could be presented as Supplementary Data.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> depicts the dysregulation of TEs expression in Stella KO embryos. How many cells are included for each stage in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> should be indicated. The authors should verify levels of MERVL expression by qPCR, using consensus primers spanning the sequence of this element. They further suggest that a zinc finger protein, ZFP143, might be involved in regulating MERVL, as its levels increase slightly upon passage from the 1-cell to the 2-cell stage, and are higher in the absence of Stella. The upper graph needs more information: how many cells assessed? Statistical significance? Normalization? Furthermore, there is no reference regarding the putative ZFP143-binding sequence, the location of which within MERVL (and other TEs observed to be upregulated in the absence of Stella) should be indicated. As well, to support their incrimination of ZFP153 in the control of MERVL, the authors could overexpress it or knock it down in mESC, a small fraction of which upregulates MERVL at any given time in tissue culture (McFarlan et al., 2012). As well, the effect of Stella and ZFP143 overexpression on MERVL LTR-driven reporters could be tested in this or other heterologous systems.</p><p>8) In line with the decreased upregulation of MERVL elements and their MT2_mm LTRs in the absence of Stella, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> reveals that the expression of genes driven from these transcriptional units is also reduced in this setting, suggesting that Stella regulates the transcriptional activity of the MERVL promoter. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> the authors demonstrate that depletion by siRNA of MERVL transcripts from early embryos leads to a phenotype closely similar to that induced by the depletion of Stella. However, the siRNA used in these experiments targets the gag sequence of MERVL, hence should trigger the degradation of only a subset of MERVL RNAs, and not those where the LTR drives chimeric transcripts, and drives MZT genes, as those illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. It might be interpreted as suggesting that the lethal phenotype induces by Stella depletion results from the lack of MERVL transcripts, not from the modulation of MZT genes. The authors should definitely address this paradox, for instance by i) quantifying the expression of MZT genes (as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) upon MERVL depletion, and ii) injecting MERVL transcripts in the zygote of Stella KO embryos to see whether they rescue lethality.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> illustrates 4 examples of genes, the expression trend of which matches that of neighboring TEs. In only one case (ZFP54) is this TE a MERVL-related element, whereas in the other 3 they are other types of TEs. The nature of these TEs should be better described (LTRs? Internal sequences? Orientation?). Were chimeric transcripts detected in any of these cases? Were there other TEs in the intervening sequences (between TEs mentioned here and genes and their TSS -genes orientation should also be indicated).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;STELLA modulates transcriptional and endogenous retrovirus programs during maternal-to-zygotic transition&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below by reviewer 1. The major issues that need to be addressed relate to conclusions of MERVL depletion in early embryos reducing level of 2C specific genes and the relevance of Figure 5—figure supplement 5A.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Most of the concerns we raised in our previous review have been satisfactorily addressed in the new version of the manuscript. However, the experiments aimed at exposing the importance and role of MERVL transcripts in MZT still raise questions, and need further clarification or dampening of the related claims.</p><p>In the manuscript and rebuttal letter, the authors state that MERVL depletion in early embryos leads to decreased expression of 2C-specific genes, but the data do not fully support this claim. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows qRT-PCR analysis for 4 2C-specific genes driven by the MT2_mm MERVL LTR in embryos injected with MERVL-targeting or scramble siRNA. According to the authors' model, they should be downregulated upon knocking down MERVL transcripts. Yet two (Tcstv1, Gm4340) are upregulated, one (Gpbp1l1) unchanged, and only one (Sp110) downregulated, similar to the targeted MERVL transcripts themselves. It would have been useful to examine the siRNA-sensitivity of some other of the 200 or so MZT genes, including ones not driven by a MERVL-associated LTR but either by the LTR of another transposable element (e.g. Eif1a-like genes) or their own promoter (e.g. Zscan4).</p><p>As well, the experiment described in Figure 5—figure supplement 5A (could not find where it is specifically described in the text) does not add much, since the downregulation from the injection of an siRNA targeting the MT2_mm part of chimeric transcripts is significant for only 2 out of 6 of tested here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22345.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major specific points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Mechanism of Stella action.

We have therefore attempted to identify direct targets of Stella in mESCs, using a published protocol with modifications (Nakamura et al., 2012) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>). We tagged hemagglutinin (HA) to the C-terminus of Stella and used the high affinity HA antibody to pull down Stella bound chromatin. The Stella+HA construct was over-expressed in the absence of endogenous Stella by using StellaM/Z KO ESCs, with NANOG-HA and eGFP-HA as positive and negative controls, respectively; expression was confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1A and 1B</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22345.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Stella-HA ChIP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of Stella and HA.

However, there was little or no enrichment of Stella at its previously reported binding sites (Mage-a2, Wfdc15a1) (Nakamura et al., 2012), nor could we detect Stella binding to other regions in the genome (n=56) (subsection “Stella is associated with the expression of specific TE “, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In addition, neither over-expression nor knockdown of <italic>Dppa3</italic> affected MuERV-L expression in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that Stella does not bind to zygotic genes / MuERV-L elements in mESCs, with the caveat that mESC might not accurately reflect the cellular/chromatin context of 2-cell embryos, where these experiments are intractable. Nonetheless, we felt the attempt was worthwhile partly because published reports indicated that ESCs cycle through a 2C-like state (Macfarlan et al., 2012).</p><p><italic>As a starting point, it would be interesting if the authors could &quot;rescue&quot; the maternal mutants by injecting Stella cDNAs containing mutations in some of its putative domains to tease out domains that might be important for the observed MZT defects.</italic> </p><p>We considered this point previously by comparing maternal- and zygotic- only mutants. Briefly, maternal Stella persists until ~E1.5, followed by zygotic Stella expression at ~E2.5 embryos (Payer et al. 2003). Evidence suggests that maternal Stella is critical for development, but zygotic Stella is largely dispensable, implying that reintroduction of Stella in the early embryo cannot rescue the effects of maternal loss (Payer et al., 2003, Bortvin et al., 2004, Nakamura et al., 2007). This emphasizes the critical role of Stella at the earliest developmental stages. Thus, it is doubtful that attempts to conduct ‘rescue’ experiments would be effective since Stella protein is unlikely to accumulate to sufficient levels to have an effect. Note also that these experiments are very challenging since this would require a large number of mutant oocytes.</p><p><italic>Likewise, the Introduction would benefit from a description of the Stella protein and its known domains.</italic> </p><p>We provide the information together with a schematic diagram in the Introduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) MERVL loss-of-function experiments. The authors use a siRNA against the MEVL GAG region, which will target some but not all full-length MERVL elements. The authors should provide a list of the genomic MERVL elements (or the percentage) that should be perfect targets, one mismatch, two mismatch, etc. to the siRNA. In other words, provide the reader with the fraction of full-length MERVL elements that should be affected by the siRNA.</italic> </p><p>This is an important point that we had overlooked. We have now performed the additional bioinformatics analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) as suggested by the reviewers. We identified 583 full-length MuERV-L elements that fully encode the <italic>gag</italic> and <italic>pol</italic> proteins in the genome. MuERV-L siRNA targets 80.5% of full-length MuERV-L elements with perfect match and 99.5% of full-length MuERV-L elements with 2 mismatches or less. This is an informative result given the minimum number of predicted off-targets with 2 mismatches or less. Furthermore, scramble siRNA did not have any predicted targets with 2 mismatches or less.</p><p><italic>Additionally, the IF images, even if very carefully performed, can be easily misinterpreted since the embryos are imaged separately. Western blots with the same Gag antibody should also be included. This is achievable since Heidmann's lab reported westerns from 2C embryos over a decade ago.</italic> </p><p>While we acknowledge this point, the western blots would require approximately 40 – 100 2-cell embryos per sample (Kang et al., 2014, Komatsu et al., 2014, Mu et al., 2011). Note also that the experiments require microinjections, with a ~50% survival rate. Finally our MuERV-L antibody is different from that used by Heidmann’s lab (Ribet et al., 2008), and we have no access to it. For these reasons, we chose IF to validate MuERV-L protein knockdown. The analysis was carried with care using our outstanding core imaging facility at the Gurdon Institute, with high technical expertise. Our facility has designed a custom ImageJ macro plugin to measure IF signals; we used this to asses MuERV-L (GFP) intensity in 2-cell embryos using the Fiji image software.</p><p>Accordingly, we took extra precautions ensuring that all the control and experimental samples were treated simultaneously and identically, and on the same day with identical microscope settings; representative images for each condition are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. The quantification of the GFP intensity is however meant to provide changes in relative levels in MuERV-L protein, and not precise levels of the protein. This procedure for IF images was used recently by our imaging core on another study on pre-implantation mouse embryos (Goolam et al.Cell, 2016).</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, it looks like the scramble siRNA reduces MERVL expression relative to uninjected embryos. Is this significant?</italic> </p><p>MuERV-L pol expression is not significantly reduced in scramble siRNA compared to uninjected embryos as judged by the two-sided Wilcoxson rank sum test and this is now labeled as n.s.

However, only 60% of MuERV-L siRNA injected embryos reached the blastocyst stage, which narrowly below significance (p=0.065). There were no other statistically significant differences between uninjected, scramble or MuERV-L siRNA treated embryos in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. Statistical significance is now stated for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>.</p><p>We agree that at 80<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>M concentration, siRNA itself may have a negative effect on embryo development compared to uninjected embryos. This might in part be due to some non-specific effects, which we acknowledged in the manuscript (subsection “MuERV-L plays a functional role during pre-implantation development “). On the other hand, there are 583 full-length copies of MuERV-L elements in the genome, which are highly upregulated at the 2-cell stage, comprising ~3% of the transcriprome. This likely requires a higher concentration of siRNA to achieve a significant knockdown compared to what is normally the case for a single copy gene. To accommodate the conflicting experimental drawbacks, we decided to present both 20<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>M and 80<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>M; they both show a similar effect, with the latter having a greater effect accepting the appropriate caveats.</p><p><italic>Given the title, replicating this a few more times to get higher certainty in the effect of MuERV-L knockdown would be appropriate.

Obtaining enough mutant embryos is very challenging besides the experiments themselves. We have therefore changed the title and moderated the claims in the manuscript. The revised title is below, which we hope will be acceptable.</p><p>“Stella modulates transcriptional and endogenous retrovirus programs during maternal-to-zygotic transition”</p><p><italic>4) There is no mechanistic insight into how knocking down MERVL transcripts (and Gag positive virus particles) affects development and the discussion on this topic is not adequate. In the Discussion, the authors state they found &quot;that reducing MERVL activation at the 2C stage affects development&quot;, but this is misleading, since knocking down MERVL transcripts with an siRNA is not the same as preventing the expression of MERVL elements and the broad open chromatin domains this likely causes. This is testable and one might expect that MERVL siRNAs have little effect on the embryonic transcriptome or chromatin state surrounding MERVLs. A better experiment with this aim would be CRISPRi. It is nonetheless interesting that MERVL element mRNA/proteins seem to be important for development, but there is no experiment that addresses mechanism, or even discussion on a plausible mechanism. For example, might the viral particles themselves be important, similar to the roles proposed for HERVK particles in human embryos (Grow et al., Nature). Since this is a major claim of the paper, it either needs to be softened or it should be supported with more compelling data such as rescue experiments.</italic> </p><p>As we pointed out earlier, we have moderated our claims based on the reviewers’ comments, with respect to the siRNA effects on MuERV-L transcript and protein. Also in response to points 4 and point 8, we have performed additional qRT-PCR analysis on 2-cell embryos, which revealed that MuERV-L knockdown does affect the expression of chimeric transcripts and 2-cell specific genes, which may contribute to the reduced embryonic potential of MuERV-L knockdown embryos. Importantly, this suggests siRNA targeting is one relevant approach to investigate the biological significance of gene expression derived from MuERV-L.</p><p>The use of CRISPRi is a potentially interesting and complementary approach to address whether LTR-driven zygotic gene expression is important during development. However, it will be difficult to generate a gRNA library capable of targeting most of the LTR promoters without significant indirect effects on protein-coding genes, as many solo or non-functional LTRs have integrated into 5’ and 3’UTRs, which would be targeted despite little or no influence on the expression of their host gene. Thus developing this CRISPRi system would require extensive optimization, including efficient delivery into the zygote.</p><p>A potential role of viral particles in mouse development seems less likely, because we previously showed that knockout of <underline>all</underline> interferon response genes (IFITM) family members has no detectable effect on mouse development (Lange et al., 2008). Furthermore, while HERVK and virus-like particles were indicated in human hypomethylated epiblast cells in blastocysts (Grow et al., 2015), we did not detect them in highly hypomethylated human primordial germ cells that were predicted in the paper by Grow (W.Tang et al., unpublished). We have included discussion of this and additional possible mechanisms by which MuERV-L mRNA / protein may function during pre-implantation development (Discussion section paragraph five).</p><p><italic>5) It would be interesting to test if the MERVL LOF phenotype is more severe if a portion of the M2t_mm LTR is targeted by an siRNA, since this could potentially target chimeric transcripts in addition to the full-length elements. Was this experiment attempted?</italic> </p><p>We have preliminary data regarding this specific comment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref>). We designed siRNA against MT2_Mm and MT2 elements (MT2A, MT2B, MT2B1, MT2B2, MT2C, MT2C_Mm); these LTRs were also significantly depleted in Stella M/Z KO 2-cell embryos. The phenotype we observed for MT2_Mm knockdown was in fact similar to MuERV-L knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2A</xref>).

For this reason we opted for IF validation, which showed robust reduction of MuERV-L Gag protein level in KO 2-cell embryos, and corroborated the unbiased RNA-seq, which showed a comparable reduction.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22345.029</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>MERVL RNA-sequencing versus qRT-PCR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The first dot plot shows MERVL-Int expression in WT and KO 2-cell embryos.

The upper graph needs more information: how many cells assessed? Statistical significance? Normalization? Furthermore, there is no reference regarding the putative ZFP143-binding sequence, the location of which within MERVL (and other TEs observed to be upregulated in the absence of Stella) should be indicated. As well, to support their incrimination of ZFP153 in the control of MERVL, the authors could overexpress it or knock it down in mESC, a small fraction of which upregulates MERVL at any given time in tissue culture (McFarlan et al., 2012). As well, the effect of Stella and ZFP143 overexpression on MERVL LTR-driven reporters could be tested in this or other heterologous systems.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for your comments and interest on ZFP143 as a potential candidate regulating MuERV-L elements. We illustrated ZFP143 as an example of a motif enriched in differentially expressed TEs between WT and KO samples, but this is not the main focus here. As we do not have sufficient experimental evidence or bioinformatics analysis to suggest ZFP143 directly regulates TEs / MuERV-L elements, we have removed this from the manuscript.</p><p><italic>8) In line with the decreased upregulation of MERVL elements and their MT2_mm LTRs in the absence of Stella, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> reveals that the expression of genes driven from these transcriptional units is also reduced in this setting, suggesting that Stella regulates the transcriptional activity of the MERVL promoter. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> the authors demonstrate that depletion by siRNA of MERVL transcripts from early embryos leads to a phenotype closely similar to that induced by the depletion of Stella. However, the siRNA used in these experiments targets the gag sequence of MERVL, hence should trigger the degradation of only a subset of MERVL RNAs, and not those where the LTR drives chimeric transcripts, and drives MZT genes, as those illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. It might be interpreted as suggesting that the lethal phenotype induces by Stella depletion results from the lack of MERVL transcripts, not from the modulation of MZT genes. The authors should definitely address this paradox, for instance by i) quantifying the expression of MZT genes (as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) upon MERVL depletion, and ii) injecting MERVL transcripts in the zygote of Stella KO embryos to see whether they rescue lethality.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing out the contradictory messages in the manuscript. We have attempted to address this as suggested by the reviewers (i), by quantifying transcript expression in uninjected, 80 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>M scramble and 80 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>M MuERV-L siRNA 2-cell embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, we observed MuERV-L knockdown results in significantly reduced expression of 2/6 of chimeric transcripts (<italic>Rbm8a, GM12617</italic>), and in a 2-cell specific gene – <italic>Sp110</italic>. Furthermore, <italic>GM12617</italic> is also significantly depleted in StellaM/Z KO 2-cell embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). This suggests that defects in transcript expression may partially contribute to the reduced developmental potential of MuERV-L knockdown embryos.</p><p>In response to the second experiment proposed (ii), while MuERV-L transcripts are significantly depleted in StellaM/Z KO 2-cell embryos, we have also identified 2560 misregulated genes. We believe the aberrant ERV programme (including MuERV-L) may have contributed towards gene misregulation, however, MuERV-L transcript alone will likely not be sufficient to rescue the embryonic lethality observed in StellaM/Z KO embryos.</p><p><italic>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> illustrates 4 examples of genes, the expression trend of which matches that of neighboring TEs. In only one case (ZFP54) is this TE a MERVL-related element, whereas in the other 3 they are other types of TEs. The nature of these TEs should be better described (LTRs? Internal sequences? Orientation?). Were chimeric transcripts detected in any of these cases? Were there other TEs in the intervening sequences (between TEs mentioned here and genes and their TSS -genes orientation should also be indicated).</italic> </p><p>The nature of the 4 TE types are mentioned in the manuscript (subsection “Expression of a subset of TEs is positively correlated with their nearest gene “) and the orientations of the TEs and genes are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> now. ZFP54-MT2B is a chimeric transcript (Macfarlan et al., 2012), but the other 3 pairs of TE/gene are not. These candidates were chosen based on a genome-wide expression correlation analysis between a TE and its nearest gene. While there may be other TEs in the intervening sequences between some pairs of TE/gene, these intervening TEs are not robustly expressed in 2-cell embryos.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Most of the concerns we raised in our previous review have been satisfactorily addressed in the new version of the manuscript. However, the experiments aimed at exposing the importance and role of MERVL transcripts in MZT still raise questions, and need further clarification or dampening of the related claims.</italic> </p><p><italic>In the manuscript and rebuttal letter, the authors state that MERVL depletion in early embryos leads to decreased expression of 2C-specific genes, but the data do not fully support this claim. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows qRT-PCR analysis for 4 2C-specific genes driven by the MT2_mm MERVL LTR in embryos injected with MERVL-targeting or scramble siRNA. According to the authors' model, they should be downregulated upon knocking down MERVL transcripts. Yet two (Tcstv1, Gm4340) are upregulated, one (Gpbp1l1) unchanged, and only one (Sp110) downregulated, similar to the targeted MERVL transcripts themselves. It would have been useful to examine the siRNA-sensitivity of some other of the 200 or so MZT genes, including ones not driven by a MERVL-associated LTR but either by the LTR of another transposable element (e.g. Eif1a-like genes) or their own promoter (e.g. Zscan4).</italic> </p><p><italic>As well, the experiment described in Figure 5—figure supplement 5A (could not find where it is specifically described in the text) does not add much, since the downregulation from the injection of an siRNA targeting the MT2_mm part of chimeric transcripts is significant for only 2 out of 6 of tested here.</italic></p><p>Concerning MuERV-L KD gene expression analysis, we had attempted to characterize the effect on a small sub-set of 2C specific genes; this showed some variable effects.
