populations of interneurons that set the strength and rhythmicity of behaviors such as locomotion. A small cluster of cholinergic interneurons, expressing the transcription factor Pitx2, modulates the intensity of muscle activation via ‘C-bouton’ inputs to motoneurons. However, the synaptic mechanisms underlying this neuromodulation remain unclear. Here, we confirm in mice that Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons are active during fictive locomotion and that their chemogenetic inhibition reduces the amplitude of motor output. Furthermore, after genetic ablation of cholinergic Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons, M2 receptor-dependent regulation of the intensity of locomotor output is lost. Conversely, chemogenetic stimulation of Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons leads to activation of M2 receptors on motoneurons, regulation of Kv2.1 channels and greater motoneuron output due to an increase in the inter-spike afterhyperpolarization and a reduction in spike half-width. Our findings elucidate synaptic mechanisms by which cholinergic spinal interneurons modulate the final common pathway for motor output.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>motoneuron</kwd><kwd>central pattern generator</kwd><kwd>C-bouton</kwd><kwd>Kv2.1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alfred Dunhill Links Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nascimento</surname><given-names>Filipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M021793/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Broadhead</surname><given-names>Matthew James</given-names></name><name><surname>Miles</surname><given-names>Gareth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Foundation Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsape</surname><given-names>Eirini</given-names></name><name><surname>Zagoraiou</surname><given-names>Laskaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The pairing of chemogenetic and electrophysiological approaches reveals mechanisms by which cholinergic synapses modulate the final motor output of the nervous system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Locomotion is controlled by neuronal networks of the spinal cord, referred to as central pattern generators (CPGs), which can generate and sustain rhythmic patterns of muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gosgnach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goulding, 2009</xref>). The CPG for locomotion is located within the spinal cord and is formed by genetically distinct classes of interneurons that drive motoneuron activity in coordinated sequences that cause precise muscle activation necessary for behaviors such as walking or swimming. These spinal neurons are functionally diverse, as evidenced by the variety of different inhibitory, excitatory and modulatory transmitters they release to shape the pattern and frequency of motoneuron firing. Knowledge of the varying synaptic mechanisms by which interneuron subtypes participate in spinal circuits is crucial to better understand the flexibility and adaptability of spinal circuits in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goulding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miles and Sillar, 2011</xref>).</p><p>There are four broad, genetically distinct classes of spinal interneurons born in the ventral horn that are involved in motor function: V0, V1, V2 and V3 interneurons. V0 interneurons are derived from progenitors that express the developing brain homeobox protein 1 (Dbx-1) and can be further subdivided into V0<sub>V</sub> (ventral) or V0<sub>D</sub> (dorsal) interneurons based on the expression or absence, respectively, of the postmitotic determinant homeodomain protein even-skipped homeobox 1 (Evx1). V0 interneurons play an important role in left-right coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moran-Rivard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lanuza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pierani et al., 2001</xref>). Less than 10% of the V0 neurons constitute a subpopulation of interneurons identified by expression of the Paired-like homeodomain 2 (Pitx2) transcription factor. Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons are preferentially clustered around the central canal and can be further subdivided into cholinergic (V0c) and glutamatergic (V0g) subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>). V0c interneurons, receive excitatory inputs from spinal pathways involved in locomotion and innervate spinal motoneurons, forming 80–100 large synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>), termed C-boutons, on each motoneuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 1995</xref>). Recently, Rozani et al demonstrated that C-boutons of brainstem motoneurons also derive from Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rozani et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Unlike other V0-derived interneurons, V0c interneurons are not involved in left-right or extensor-flexor coordination. Instead, they seem to be important for modulating the amplitude of motor output. In wild-type mice, the activation of specific hindlimb muscles is increased when animals switch from walking to swimming. However, when cholinergic transmission at C-boutons is genetically perturbed, this task-dependent increase in muscle activation is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>). These findings support that V0c interneurons and their C-bouton inputs to motoneurons provide task-dependent modulation of motor output by enhancing motoneuron firing when greater muscle activation is required.</p><p>A range of postsynaptic proteins, including M2 muscarinic receptors, Kv2.1 channels and SK channels, are clustered at C-bouton synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deardorff et al., 2014</xref>). Previous work indicated that activation of M2 receptors in spinal cord slices increases motor output through M2 receptor-mediated inhibition of SK channels, which reduces the medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP) allowing increased motoneuron firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miles et al., 2007</xref>). Recent work utilizing Kv2.1 channel blockers has demonstrated that Kv2.1 currents also regulate the repetitive firing of motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romer et al., 2019</xref>). However, the exact mechanisms by which V0c-derived C-boutons modulate motor output remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deardorff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Witts et al., 2014</xref>). Given the important role of V0c interneurons in motor control, and data implicating C-boutons as therapeutic targets for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and peripheral nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Salvany et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herron and Miles, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Landoni et al., 2019</xref>), we sought to identify the cellular mechanisms through which this distinct class of cholinergic neurons modulates motor output.</p><p>In this study, we employed a combination of genetic, pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches to determine the synaptic mechanisms by which V0c interneurons and their C-boutons modulate motor output. Using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we show that populations of lumbar Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons are rhythmically active during fictive locomotion. Chemogenetic inhibition of Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons during fictive locomotion, using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), decreased the strength of motor output in an M2 receptor-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of V0c interneurons confirmed that C-boutons increase the amplitude, but do not affect rhythmicity, of locomotor output. Chemogenetic excitation of Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons showed that activation of M2 receptors and subsequent regulation of Kv2.1 channels at C-boutons increases motor output by decreasing motoneuron spike half-width and increasing the inter-spike AHP. Together, our findings provide the first direct evidence of the synaptic and cellular mechanisms involved in C-bouton-mediated modulation of spinal locomotor circuitry. Furthermore, we reveal a high degree of specificity within the modulatory control of spinal motor circuits, with discrete modulatory units likely to be devoted to the modulation of specific network output parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pitx2<sup>+</sup> INs are rhythmically active during fictive locomotion</title><p>We first confirmed that Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons exhibit rhythmic activity that is phase locked to spinal locomotor network output.

In these mice, Pitx2<sup>+</sup> cells express both the hM4Di inhibitory receptor and the tdTomato red fluorescent reporter, which allowed them to be identified for single-cell electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

We have now extended these analyses to a population level by imaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations in groups of lumbar Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons during locomotor network activity. We find that a high proportion of Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons exhibit rhythmic activity that is phase locked to bursts of locomotor-related activity recorded from ventral roots. Similar to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>), we found that the strength of the relationship between Pitx2<sup>+</sup> cell activity and locomotor output was more robust in upper compared with lower lumbar regions. This may reflect rostro-caudal differences in the density of V0c and V0g interneurons in the lumbar spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Enjin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Following the demonstration that Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons are rhythmically active during locomotor network activity, we next investigated their modulatory actions on locomotor-related output by using Cre-dependent expression of DREADDs to manipulate their activity. We first verified the effectiveness and specificity of our DREADD-based approach by showing that single-cell properties and baseline network output did not differ between DREADD and control mice prior to the application of CNO (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Both high doses of CNO (10 µM) and the CNO derivative clozapine, which is only likely to be produced at significant levels when administered in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacLaren et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pirmohamed et al., 1995</xref>), can exhibit off-target effects on endogenous receptors, including 5-HT receptors known to contribute to the control of locomotor networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore also verified that CNO (1 µM) had no detectable effects on ventral root output, single motoneuron firing, or subthreshold motoneuron properties when applied to preparations obtained from animals that do not express DREADD receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Having verified our DREADD approach, we first assessed the effects of inhibiting Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons on ongoing locomotor-related activity. DREADD-mediated inhibition revealed that Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons modulate the amplitude of locomotor-related output in an M2 muscarinic receptor-dependent manner. This finding is consistent with previous reports of a reduction in the amplitude of locomotor-related bursts when applying antagonists of M2-type muscarinic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nascimento et al., 2019</xref>). We next addressed whether cholinergic V0c interneurons, and their C-bouton inputs to motoneurons, were solely responsible for the modulation of motor output we observed. In preparations from animals in which V0c cells had been genetically ablated, blockade of M2 receptors no longer affected the amplitude of locomotor-related output. Thus, Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneuron-dependent modulation of the intensity of motor output originates from cholinergic V0c interneurons and their C-bouton synapses on motoneurons. Despite previous evidence of a low density of V0c-derived synapses in the intermediate zone of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>), our findings demonstrate a primary role for V0c interneurons in the control of motoneuron output with little or no impact on locomotor CPG interneurons. Furthermore, although glutamatergic V0g interneurons are also known to project to the intermediate zone as well as the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>), the fact that locomotor-related activity was unaltered when Pitx2<sup>+</sup> cell activity was manipulated in the presence of muscarinic receptor blockers indicates that V0g interneurons do not contribute to the generation or modulation of locomotor network output and hence their functional roles remain elusive.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Intrinsic properties of lumbar motoneurons from <italic>hM3Dq</italic> and <italic>Pitx2::Cre; hM3Dq</italic> mice.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom"><italic>hM3Dq</italic></th><th valign="bottom"><italic>Pitx2::Cre; hM3Dq</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Resistance (MΩ)</td><td valign="bottom">63 ± 3</td><td valign="bottom">58 ± 4</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Capacitance (pF)</td><td valign="bottom">114 ± 7</td><td valign="bottom">113 ± 4</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Membrane potential (mV)</td><td valign="bottom">−60 ± 2</td><td valign="bottom">−62 ± 2</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Rheobase (pA)</td><td valign="bottom">263 ± 43</td><td valign="bottom">353 ± 43</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Depolarizing block (pA)</td><td valign="bottom">666 ± 44</td><td valign="bottom">817 ± 84</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Maximum firing (Hz)</td><td valign="bottom">26 ± 2</td><td valign="bottom">27 ± 2</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">n = 16</td><td valign="bottom">n = 23</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Intrinsic properties of Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons from control, excitatory and inhibitory DREADD mice.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th><italic>Pitx2::Cre;tdTomato</italic></th><th><italic>Pitx2::Cre;tdTomato;hM4Di</italic></th><th><italic>Pitx2::Cre;tdTomato;hM3Dq</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Resistance (MΩ)</td><td>336 ± 48</td><td>307 ± 30</td><td>320 ± 16</td></tr><tr><td>Capacitance (pF)</td><td>28 ± 2</td><td>35 ± 3</td><td>26 ± 4</td></tr><tr><td>Membrane potential (mV)</td><td>−52 ± 3</td><td>−52 ± 2</td><td>−53 ± 1</td></tr><tr><td>Spontaneous firing (Hz)</td><td>2.2 ± 0.6</td><td>1.8 ± 0.5</td><td>2.0 ± 0.4</td></tr><tr><td/><td>n = 11</td><td>n = 9</td><td>n = 9</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Ventral root burst frequency and duration measured in the presence of NMDA, 5-HT and DA from preparations obtained from <italic>hM4Di</italic> and <italic>Pitx2::Cre;hM4Di</italic> mice.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th><italic>hM4Di</italic></th><th><italic>Pitx2::Cre;hM4Di</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Burst frequency (Hz)</td><td>0.23 ± 0.03</td><td>0.21 ± 0.03</td></tr><tr><td>Burst duration (ms)</td><td>2049 ± 507</td><td>2393 ± 554</td></tr><tr><td/><td>n = 14</td><td>n = 19</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Recent studies have reported a diversity of muscarinic receptor-mediated effects on spinal locomotor circuits, as revealed by modulation of the frequency, duration and amplitude of locomotor-related output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nascimento et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jordan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Finkel et al., 2014</xref>). In keeping with these observations, when V0c interneurons were genetically ablated, pharmacological blockade of M2 receptors revealed V0c-independent muscarinic modulation of the frequency and duration of locomotor bursts. Given that M2 receptors are not only juxtaposed to C-boutons but are also widely distributed throughout motoneuron somata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hellström et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Welton et al., 1999</xref>) and on spinal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Höglund and Baghdoyan, 1997</xref>), it is likely that additional, as yet genetically undefined, neuronal sources of intraspinal acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertrand and Cazalets, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gillberg et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gillberg et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sherriff and Henderson, 1994</xref>) are responsible for these M2 receptor-dependent changes in the rhythm and pattern of locomotor output. Given the specific nature of the effects of V0c interneurons on spinal motor circuits, it will be interesting to investigate whether similarly discrete subsets of spinal cells fulfil the other modulatory roles uncovered by blockade of endogenous cholinergic signalling. Recent work suggests that such separate modulatory pathways may act in concert, via different muscarinic receptor subtypes, to ensure balanced motor circuit output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nascimento et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition of Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons during locomotor network activity was associated with both a reduction in population level motoneuron output, measured via ventral root recordings, and a reduction in motoneuron firing rates, evidenced by patch-clamp recordings from individual cells. We next took advantage of our genetic access to this specific population of interneurons, and our successful DREADD-based manipulation of their activity, to directly identify the synaptic and cellular mechanisms underlying the discrete modulatory pathway mediated by V0c interneurons.</p><p>DREADD-mediated excitation of V0c interneurons was associated with an M2 receptor-dependent increase in the excitability of motoneurons. This increased excitability was characterized by a decrease in rheobase due to hyperpolarization of the action potential threshold, greater resistance to depolarizing block, which allowed motoneurons to fire in response to greater amplitude stimuli, and an increase in maximum firing rates. Potential mediators of these effects include postsynaptic Kv2.1 potassium channels and SK-type calcium-dependent potassium channels, which are both clustered at C-boutons synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hellström et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muennich and Fyffe, 2004</xref>). Blockade of Kv2.1 channels during activation of V0c interneurons prevented the increased resistance to depolarizing block and the rise in maximum firing frequency, but not hyperpolarization of the action potential threshold. Given that recent modeling experiments indicate that blockade of SK channels depolarizes the action potential threshold in midbrain dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iyer et al., 2017</xref>), SK channels at C-bouton synapses may also play a role in controlling the spike threshold of motoneurons. This is supported further by previous work indicating that motoneurons that express the SK3 channel isoform might have reduced rheobase when compared to motoneurons that do not express this isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deardorff, 2013</xref>). In contrast, the other mechanisms leading to increased motoneuron excitability following activation of V0c interneurons appear to involve modulation of Kv2.1 channels, which are known to facilitate repetitive firing in a wide range of neuronal types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Bean, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malin and Nerbonne, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guan et al., 2013</xref>) and to play an important role in the repolarization phase of action potentials in motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao and Ziskind-Conhaim, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Our data, which support a predominant role for Kv2.1 channels in C-bouton-mediated modulation of motoneuron excitability, contrast previous work, which suggested modulation of SK channels and a reduction in the mAHP were responsible for increased motoneuron output upon C-bouton activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miles et al., 2007</xref>). However, this previous work relied on broad pharmacological manipulation of muscarinic receptors in spinal cord slices, prior to the discover of the C-bouton source cells, and therefore likely activated a wide population of receptors beyond those localized at C-bouton synapses. Given that activation of muscarinic receptors has a number of different effects on motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nascimento et al., 2019</xref>), it is plausible that M2 receptor-dependent reductions in mAHP amplitude involve receptors outside the territory of C-bouton synapses. SK channel clusters preferentially appose large cholinergic C-bouton terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deardorff, 2013</xref>). However, SK channels are also distributed throughout laminae VII and IX, and could therefore be present on more distal motoneuron dendrites where they might be subject to modulation by as yet uncharacterized, Pitx2-negative, populations of cholinergic spinal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertrand and Cazalets, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gillberg et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gillberg et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sherriff and Henderson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deardorff, 2013</xref>). Another possible explanation for the mechanistic differences reported in the present study is that there may be differential, state-dependent levels of involvement of specific components of the C-bouton synapse, depending on the activity levels of motoneurons and V0c interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deardorff et al., 2014</xref>). For example, Kv2.1 channel-mediated modulation might dominate at the level of V0c activity induced by our DREADD-based stimulation, but calcium-dependent potassium channels might contribute at different rates of V0c interneuron firing. Testing this hypothesis will require the development of methods that enable finer control of V0c interneuron activity than were possible using the current DREADD-based approach.</p><p>Interestingly, in the current study, we found that activation of V0c interneurons was associated with a small increase in both the mAHP measured after single spikes, and the inter-spike AHP measured during repetitive firing. Given that both effects were blocked by guangxitoxin-1E, we propose that this reflects greater recruitment of Kv2.1 channels. This mechanism contrasts previous reports of a substantial reduction in the mAHP due to modulation of calcium-dependent potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miles et al., 2007</xref>). However, as discussed above, these previous data were obtained using less direct, global activation of M2 receptors and reflected measurements of mAHPs evoked by single action potentials only. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether these effects reflect activation of M2 receptors at C-bouton synapses. If these effects are C bouton-mediated, perhaps under certain conditions large changes in the mAHP, due to SK channel modulation, reduce the refractory period to allow greater firing frequencies. Meanwhile, in the absence of such large reductions in the mAHP, smaller Kv2.1-mediated increases in the amplitude of the inter-spike AHP may facilitate the removal of inactivation of sodium channels, enabling sustained, higher frequency firing in response to depolarizing stimuli, as has been shown in other neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Bean, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>). This Kv2.1 channel-dependent mechanism is also supported by recent work in rat lumbar motoneurons, which has demonstrated that Kv2 channels permit greater motoneuron firing frequencies by maintaining hyperpolarized inter-spike membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romer et al., 2019</xref>). Another, likely linked, observation in our study was a Kv2.1 channel-dependent narrowing of action potentials following C-bouton activation. This is again consistent with recent reports of increased action potential half-width and a slowing of motoneuron firing when Kv2 channels are blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fletcher et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While our findings are consistent with previous work demonstrating that Kv2.1 channels help maintain appropriate levels of repetitive firing in motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fletcher et al., 2017</xref>), the intracellular mechanisms by which M2 receptor activation at C bouton synapses leads to changes in Kv2.1 channel function and motoneuron firing remain unclear. One potential pathway involves the calcineurin-meditated dephosphorylation of Kv2.1 channels. It has been proposed that inhibition of N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, known to be located at C-bouton synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>), by G<sub>i/0</sub>-dependent pathways following M2 receptor activation could lower the levels of local intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, thus reducing calcineurin-related dephosphorylation of Kv2.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deardorff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romer et al., 2019</xref>). Kv2.1 dephosphorylation in response to prolonged excitatory drive is thought to cause channel delustering in motoneurons, whilst reduced activity can increase Kv2.1 channel clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Romer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Romer et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, in motoneurons, declustering occurs in response to increased glutamatergic, but not cholinergic, input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romer et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, activation of C-boutons should not lead to declustering of Kv2.1 channels and has in fact been proposed to maintain Kv2.1 clusters and promote repetitive firing at physiological activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romer et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to effecting channel clustering, the phosphorylation state of Kv2.1 channels has been shown to influence their gating parameters. Although data are lacking for motoneurons, dephosphorylation of Kv2.1 channels leads to a hyperpolarizing shift in channel activation and inactivation properties in hippocampal neurons, which is thought to suppress action potential firing frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohapatra and Trimmer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mohapatra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Misonou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, it seems plausible that C-bouton activation helps maintain the phosphorylation state of Kv2.1 channels required to support motoneuron firing. It will therefore be interesting to directly test this, and other possible intracellular mechanisms, in future work. Regardless of the exact mechanisms, C-boutons appear well placed to ensure that motoneuron excitability and output is maintained or increased in a task or state-dependent manner, even in the face of elevated glutamatergic drive that would otherwise reduce motoneuron output via delustering of Kv2.1 channels.</p><p>An important consideration when interpreting our results is that our experiments were performed on neonatal tissue, because whole spinal cord preparations are not viable when obtained from older animals. Although our in vitro approach allows us to access, isolate and interrogate specific pathways, which are unlikely to be accessible or separable using in vivo approaches, an important caveat is the possibility of developmental changes in C-bouton signaling. The overall pre- and post-synaptic components of C-bouton synapses, including M2 receptors and Kv2.1 channels, appear to remain consistent from early neonatal stages into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>). Rather than changes in the major components, postnatal maturation of C-boutons involves increased clustering of Kv2.1 channels and M2 receptors along with an increase in the size of C-boutons until motor networks become functionally mature (~P15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Phelps et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wetts and Vaughn, 2001</xref>). Given that maturation of spinal networks is sometimes accompanied by changes in the effects of modulators (e.g. 5-HT and acetylcholine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jordan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmidt and Jordan, 2000</xref>]), we cannot exclude the possibility that the exact mechanisms of action at fully mature C-boutons differs from those revealed at neonatal stages. However, the fact that genetic perturbation of C-boutons in adult mice impairs the ability of motoneurons to increase muscle activation in response to behavioral demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>), supports a consistency in the cellular effects of the C-bouton system into adulthood. Recordings from adult motoneurons within in vivo preparations, and associated modelling studies, have shown state-dependent changes in motoneuron properties including a decrease in AHP amplitude, hyperpolarization of action potential threshold, and a small increase in action potential half-width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Power et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacDonell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krawitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brownstone et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2002</xref>). However, it is difficult to reconcile these results with those of the current study, since the in vivo findings reflect the net effect of multiple parallel modulatory processes and focusses on differences between quiescent states and baseline activity during locomotion or scratching, behavioral states during which the C-bouton system is unlikely to be strongly engaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>). It will therefore be important in future studies to establish methods for interrogating the specific actions and mechanisms of C-bouton-mediated modulation of adult motoneurons during motor tasks of varying intensities.</p><p>Cholinergic pathways within the nervous system process a variety of inputs which enable them to fulfil roles in attentional modulation, enhancing responses to stimuli in a state-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mena-Segovia, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wikman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herrero et al., 2008</xref>). The premotor, intraspinal cholinergic system, involving V0c interneurons and C-boutons, appears to parallel these supraspinal cholinergic systems. V0c interneurons receive synaptic inputs from a range of sources, including sensory pathways, supraspinal structures and CPG networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stepien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murray et al., 2018</xref>), which ‘mirror’ inputs received by motoneurons and are therefore relevant to desired motor output. The C-bouton system seems to be less active during regular motor tasks such as walking but is particularly important during locomotor behaviors that require increased muscle activation such as swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, V0c interneurons and their C-boutons are thought to provide task-dependent modulation of motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we report novel findings regarding both the organization and mechanisms of action of intraspinal cholinergic modulatory systems. We provide evidence in support of a modular architecture for spinal cholinergic systems, in line with that recently proposed for the locus coerleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Totah et al., 2018</xref>), where V0c interneurons represent one functionally distinct neuromodulatory module devoted to task-dependent control of the intensity of motor output. Meanwhile, we provide the first demonstration of the synaptic and cellular mode of action of C-bouton inputs to motoneurons, demonstrating a role in shaping the action potential and therefore firing patterns via modulation of Kv2.1 channels. Given similarities in the roles of supraspinal and spinal cholinergic modulatory systems in task or state-dependent modulation, the insight gained from our study is likely to provide new insight into cholinergic modulatory systems throughout the mammalian nervous system.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Mechanisms of V0c interneuron-mediated modulation of motor output.</title><p>V0c interneurons (red) form C-bouton synapses on motoneurons (green) and are known to received disynaptic inputs from sensory afferents (blue) as well as input from local CPG neurons (orange) and higher brain regions (yellow) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>). Activation of V0c interneurons will lead to release of acetylcholine at C-bouton synapses, activation of postsynaptic M2 muscarinic receptors on motoneurons, and subsequent facilitatory regulation of Kv2.1 channels via as yet uncharacterized signaling pathways (dotted blue line). This modulation leads to an increase in inter-spike AHP and a decrease in action potential duration, allowing for increased and sustained motoneuron firing output, which will translate into more intense muscle contraction (DRG = dorsal root ganglion).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54170-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal ethics</title><p>All the procedures performed on animals were conducted in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and were approved by the University of St Andrews Animal Welfare Ethics Committee.

All these animals were bred to a C57/BL6 background.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vitro Ca<sup>2+</sup>imaging</title><p>Imaging of hemisected spinal cords was performed at 20–24°C. Image acquisition was controlled with Andor Solis (Andor, Oxford Instruments) software. Images were acquired with a Zyla 4.2 scientific CMOS camera using a x40 water immersion objective lens (0.9 numerical aperture). Images were acquired with a rolling shutter at 5 Hz with a 50 ms exposure time. Illumination was provided by a 470 nm CoolLED system. Fictive locomotor output was recorded from L2/3 ventral roots during image acquisition (see below). Imaging and ventral root recordings were synchronized using a TTL pulse from the Digidata 1440 A/D to the CMOS camera.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vitro electrophysiology</title><p>Spinal cord slices or intact spinal cord preparations were immersed in a recording chamber perfused with recording aCSF (approximately 1 mL per second). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were established using borosilicated glass microelectrodes (2.5–6 MΩ) filled with intracellular solution. Signals were amplified and filtered (4 kHz low-pass Bessel filter) with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and acquired at ≥10 kHz using a Digidata 1440A A/D board and pClamp software (version 10.6, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).</p><p>Measurements of drug-induced currents and input resistance (using 2.5 mV steps from −75 to −52.5 mV) were conducted in voltage-clamp mode (V<sub>hold</sub>, −60 mV). Firing output was measured in current-clamp mode using either ‘gap-free’ acquisition for spontaneous firing, by injecting a series of 1 s square current pulses (from 10 pA, 50 pA increments) to induce repetitive firing, by applying 10 ms supramaximal pulses to evoke single action potentials, or via injection of a single supramaximal current ramp (1 s duration) to investigate firing threshold. In order to facilitate comparisons, a bias current was applied as necessary during current-clamp protocols to maintain the resting potential of neurons (~−60 mV).</p><p>Ventral root recordings were performed in whole or hemisected (in parallel with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging) spinal cords by attaching suction electrodes to the ventral roots (L1-L5). Rhythmic locomotor-related activity was induced by applying 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; 10 µM), <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 5 µM) and dopamine (DA, 50 µM). Signals were amplified and filtered (band-pass filter 30–3000 Hz, Qjin Design) and then acquired at a frequency of 6 kHz with a Digidata 1440A A/D board and pClamp software. Custom built amplifiers (Qjin design) allowed acquisition of raw signals with simultaneous online rectification and integration (50 ms time constant).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Drugs and solutions</title><p>The dissecting aCSF contained (in mM): 25 NaCl, 188 sucrose, 1.9 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 glucose and 1.5 kynurenic acid.

All drugs were dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was performed with FIJI software. Data were first converted to 8 bit and processed with a background subtraction and 3D smoothing. If required, a histogram-based bleach correction was performed, along with manual drift correction to control for tissue movement. Active cells were selected and delineated from the images, guided by a maximum intensity projected image to highlight high-intensity structures. Intensity measurements were converted to Δf/f0, calculated as: <italic>100 x (fluorescence value – baseline fluorescence ÷ baseline fluorescence).</italic> Baseline fluorescence was calculated as the mean intensity from 10 frames during a period of low-level activity for each cell within the first minute of recording. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons in hemisected spinal cords were detected and quantified using DataView software (courtesy of Dr W. J. Heitler, University of St Andrews). Circular phase plots were used to depict the coupling of cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity with ventral root bursts during fictive locomotion. The beginning of the locomotor cycle, marked as 0 at the top of circular plots, was defined as the onset of flexor-related bursts recorded from upper lumbar ventral roots. Rayleigh’s test for uniformity was used to statistically assess whether cells were significantly coupled to bursts of locomotor related activity.</p><p>In single-cell voltage clamp recordings, changes in holding current were calculated as the difference between the current value immediately before drug perfusion and the maximum change in current induced by the drug. Voltage-current relationships were used to calculate input resistance before and after drug perfusion. In current clamp experiments, rheobase was measured as the first current step eliciting firing. The current required to generate a depolarizing block was measured from the first step in which motoneurons stopped firing repetitively during the 1s-long pulse. This was defined as a ≥ 100 ms silent period following the establishment of repetitive firing during current injection. Maximum firing frequencies were measured from the current step eliciting the highest firing rate. The magnitude of the inter-spike afterhyperpolarization was calculated from the last five spikes of the step that elicited the maximum firing rate. For single action potential analysis, mAHP amplitude was calculated as the difference between the resting voltage before injecting the 10ms-long depolarizing current and the peak value of the mAHP (averaged across 15 traces). For these single spikes, a differential function (dV/dt) was calculated and the onset of the action potential was set when dV/dt reached 10 mV/ms, which was then used for the estimation of half-width. The voltage threshold for action potentials was calculated from the first action potential elicited by current ramps.</p><p>Ventral root bursts were analyzed offline using DataView software. Bursts were identified from the integrated/rectified trace from which frequency and duration were measured. Burst amplitude was calculated from the respective segment of the raw trace. Data were averaged in 0.5 min time bins and normalized to a 10 min pre-control period to construct time course plots. Statistical comparisons were made on raw data averaged over 5 min periods in each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are represented in the text as mean ± s.e.m. In the figures, values are depicted as box plots displaying the distribution of data as the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum value for each dataset. In patch-clamp and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments each ‘n’ corresponds to one cell whereas in ventral root recordings it corresponds to one whole spinal cord preparation. D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus tests were used to access normality. Repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test (for normal distributed data) or Friedman test with Dunns’ post-test (for non-normal distributed data) were used for the analysis of ventral root bursts between control, drug and washout. Rayleigh’s test was used to assess the mean phasing of Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneuron activity relative to ventral root bursting. Paired <italic>t</italic>-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare data from single-cell experiments between control and drug. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test was used to compare properties of Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons between DREADD and control mice. Unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test were used to compare data from Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, immunohistochemistry, ventral root duration and frequency, and properties of motoneurons from DREADD and control mice. Values of p&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>F Nascimento was supported by The Alfred Dunhill Links Foundation.

Pitx2<sup>+</sup> interneurons. The additional experiments and explanations provided to the revised manuscript nicely strengthened your claims.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Synaptic mechanisms underlying modulation of locomotor-related motoneuron output by premotor cholinergic interneurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Adam Deardorff (Reviewer #2); Larry Jordan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very nice study addressing fundamental questions regarding cholinergic neuromodulation within the mammalian spinal cord and, more specifically, cellular mechanisms underlying the state dependent regulation of motoneurons by C-boutons. The experiments are well designed and build upon prior investigations, several of which were performed in the authors' own laboratories. The data are robust, novel, and represent a significant contribution to the field of motoneuron/movement neuroscience and will be of broader interest to those studying neuromodulation and synaptic signaling.</p><p>In particular, this work provides novel information about the role of Pitx2 inter-neurons (the source of C terminals on motoneurons) using calcium imaging, chemogenetics to excite or inhibit these cells specifically, as well as a novel method to ablate V0c interneurons. The authors show that, in contrast to earlier work, the effect of specific manipulation of the Pitx2 neurons involves actions not only at the M2 receptor but also modulates the Kv2.1 channels located at C terminals. Instead of a decrease in mAHP, as shown before and used as a basis for C-terminal increases in motoneuron excitability, this genetic approach revealed increased AHP and narrowed spikes to explain the increased excitability. This is a marked change from the previously accepted basis for the increase in motoneuron excitability. The authors also showed that c-boutons hyperpolarize motoneuron threshold, another factor that could increase motoneuron excitability. They were able to distinguish effects of muscarinic receptors from those involving Kv2.1 using specific blockers.</p><p>Please read the list of essential revisions requested by the three reviewers below, address all points raised and resubmit your revised manuscript after completion of text edits and a moderate amount of experiments (mainly precisions and controls).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The authors do not fully explain how these opposite effects on mAHP can lead to the same result.</p><p>– The authors were fortunate that the affinity of CNO for 5-HT receptors involved in locomotion did not interfere with fictive locomotion, since the affinity of CNO for 5-HT receptors is roughly the same as its affinity for the DREADD receptors. Perhaps this issue could be addressed.</p><p>– Data from adult animals with the DREADD receptors would have been useful. There is evidence that the response to ACh in adults differs from that in neonatal animals, such that in adult spinal animals the effect of a muscarinic antagonist has the opposite effect to that observed in neonates. This issue might be discussed.</p><p>– Developmental changes in the effects of C terminal activation is especially relevant because all of the recordings from motoneurons in adult cats and rats (during fictive locomotion or scratch e.g., Brownstone, et al., 1992; MacDonell et al., 2015; Power et al., 2010) show a decrease in the AHP. The data on spike duration is shown in Krawitz et al., 2001, and modeling studies (Dai et al., 2002) showed that action potential shape changes occur with modeled alterations in the delayed rectifier. There seems to be no definitive work in adult animals showing a change in action potential width during fictive locomotion consistent with the current results, these results should be discussed. Changes in the effects of ACh and 5-HT during development have been observed. It is important to show in this study that the observations in the neonatal mouse persist into adulthood, otherwise the data is applicable only to motoneurons control during development. The importance of such a developmental role should be discussed, in the absence of recordings from adult animals to confirm that the observations here are relevant to adults.</p><p>– Substantive concerns: CNO may be converted into clozapine, a 5-HT2a antagonist (Thompson et al. ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci. 2018 Sep 14;1(1):61-72. doi: 10.1021/acsptsci.8b00012). Perhaps a few control experiments using C21, a compound that has been suggested to have less side-effects than CNO would be recommended, though the authors do make some control experiments where CNO is non-hM4Di expressing spinal cords are done. This important control is done sometimes but not for all experiments (e.g. recordings of motoneurons to CNO were not done in non-hM4Di spinal cords).</p><p>Fictive locomotion recordings show L2 activity. Since calcium imaging of Pitx2 neurons seems to suggest they are flexor related, were the effects observed only constrained to flexor-dominant L2 ventral roots and not extensor-dominant L5 ventral roots?</p><p>– The major finding is a prominent role for Kv2.1 in MN excitability, and that Kv2.1 is regulated by C-boutons. These data significantly advance prior studies, which are appropriately cited by the authors. I am concerned about one aspect of the interpretation. The authors state that calcium/calcineurin dependent Kv2.1 channel dephosphorylation results in &quot;reduced K<sup>+</sup> conductance&quot;. However, the cited studies by Trimmer and others show Kv2.1 channel dephosphorylation causes a leftward, hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation, such that the normalized conductance of dephosphorylated Kv2.1 is increased at a given membrane potential. Conversely, normalized conductance is reduced when Kv2.1 is phosphorylated. This should be corrected and the subsequent Discussion section revised to reflect this correction.</p><p>– Did the authors analyze the effects of GxTx alone on single action potentials? If not, could the authors comment on the specificity of GxTx for Kv2 vs. Kv4 channels as inhibition of an A current could also broaden AP half width.</p><p>– The authors state that C-bouton activation recruits Kv2.1 channels (Discussion, seventh paragraph), and Figure 9 implies a direct link between the m2 receptors and Kv2.1 channels. Some clarification here would be helpful. M2 receptors typically couple to Gi/Go coupled pathways that inhibit calcium channels (β subunit) or decrease cAMP/PKA activity (α subunit). Could the influence of m2 receptors on Kv.2.1 channels be via effects on intracellular calcium or other phosphorylation cascades? Or is there evidence that G protein α or β subunits directly activate Kv2.1 channels (in MNs or other cell types)?</p><p>– The result that V0c activity increases rather than decreases MN mAHP amplitude, and that this effect is blocked by methoctramine, is surprising given the author's prior work that local application of muscarine ablates the mAHP via m2 receptors (Miles et al., 2007). The authors should be lauded for publishing data which, on the surface, appears at odds with this highly cited study. Their suggestion that m2 receptor reduction in mAHP occurs via receptors &quot;outside the territory of C-bouton synapses&quot; is plausible and intriguing, but would be strengthened if the authors could briefly address 1) a possible mechanism by which SK channels are activated by more distant m2 receptors or evidence for similar findings in other cell types and 2) the functional utility of C-bouton postsynaptic SK expression if the channels are not involved in m2 mediated C-bouton signaling.</p><p>– Related to # above, m2 receptor labelling has been plagued by non-specific commercial antibodies. Though some studies cited by the authors describe a more uniform distribution of m2 receptors across the MN membrane (Welton et al., 1999; Hellstrom et al., 2003), a result suggested physiologically by the authors' prior work (Nascimento et al., 2019), other studies cited show a more clustered distribution of m2 receptors specifically localized to C-bouton postsynaptic sites (Wilson et al., 2004; Meunnich and Fyffe, 2004; Deardorff et al., 2014). The existence of extra synaptic m2 receptors is therefore not as definitive as the authors state (Discussion, fourth paragraph) – but again is certainly plausible.</p><p>– Are there changes in MN properties when Pitx2 cells are inhibited?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54170.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The authors do not fully explain how these opposite effects on mAHP can lead to the same result.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for recognising the importance of reporting these new findings despite the fact that they appear at odds with our previous work (mentioned below). Upon reflection, we realise we could have discussed this more thoroughly. We have therefore expanded our Discussion (eighth paragraph) of these differences, including whether or not previous mechanisms were of C-bouton origin and whether the different mechanisms are truly mutually exclusive or whether their relative influence could depend on neuronal/network states. We have also tried to better highlight potential differences between calcium-dependent mAHP and the Kv2.1 dependent effect on spike repolarisation and inter-spike AHP. In addition, we have tried to stress the likelihood that the most influential effect of Kv2.1 channel modulation may relate to changes in action potential kinetics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors were fortunate that the affinity of CNO for 5-HT receptors involved in locomotion did not interfere with fictive locomotion, since the affinity of CNO for 5-HT receptors is roughly the same as its affinity for the DREADD receptors. Perhaps this issue could be addressed.</p><p>We have now addressed this issue further in our Discussion (third paragraph). In addition to the previous data on controls for CNO on whole cord and motoneuron outputs (supplementary figures), we have also added some new additional data on controls for CNO on motoneuron mAHP and subthreshold properties in animals that do not express DREADD receptors (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><p>– Data from adult animals with the DREADD receptors would have been useful.

The importance of such a developmental role should be discussed, in the absence of recordings from adult animals to confirm that the observations here are relevant to adults.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that a major caveat of our in vitro approach is that it can only be conducted in neonatal tissue and that the exact mechanisms revealed here may change with development. As mentioned earlier (and now included in our Discussion), differences in the exact pathways engaged may also depend on the specific state of the network and its constituent neurons, which is also not easy to model in vitro. However, we believe that our in vitro approach comes with many important benefits, including providing the ability to more finely control and interrogate cellular mechanisms of action. For example, we have been able to focus on the specific actions of C-bouton activation, which is important due to the revelation that multiple spinal cholinergic pathways are likely to differentially effect motoneuron properties and output.</p><p>We have considered whether our experiments could be conducted in older tissue and have therefore consulted Prof Marco Beato (University College London), who routinely performs motoneuron recordings in young adult (P15-P25) mouse spinal cord preparations. Given the intersegmental projection patterns of V0c interneurons, our experiments required recordings in intact spinal cord preparations. However, the advice we have received, alongside our own experience, suggests that it would not be possible to perform these recordings in tissue obtained from young adult mice. This reflects a range of factors including difficulties in visualizing motoneurons because of the greater myelinization at this stage and poor motoneuron survival in older intact preparations where a hypoxic core is produced.</p><p>Given that experiments in older preparations are not yet possible, we have added a section to our Discussion in which we consider the developmental changes of C-boutons and spinal motor networks (tenth paragraph). Within this section we also highlight the fact that the synaptic structures we are studying are detectable at birth, and that they then undergo a maturation process, which mostly involves increased receptor/channel clustering, rather than any changes in the complement of proteins at the synapse. We believe this adds support to the notion that mechanisms of C-bouton modulation continue to involve M2 receptors and Kv2.1 channels in adulthood. In addition, we highlight that previous experiments in which C-boutons were genetically perturbed in adult mice support a consistent role for C-boutons in regulating the intensity of motoneuron output.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Substantive concerns: CNO may be converted into clozapine, a 5-HT2a antagonist (Thompson et al. ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci. 2018 Sep 14;1(1):61-72. doi: 10.1021/acsptsci.8b00012). Perhaps a few control experiments using C21, a compound that has been suggested to have less side-effects than CNO would be recommended, though the authors do make some control experiments where CNO is non-hM4Di expressing spinal cords are done. This important control is done sometimes but not for all experiments (e.g. recordings of motoneurons to CNO were not done in non-hM4Di spinal cords).</p></disp-quote><p>Although we agree that this is an important consideration, conversion of CNO to clozapine is only thought to occur in vivo, since hepatic enzymes are required for effective metabolization (MacLaren et al., 2016; Pirmohamed et al., 1995). We believe it is therefore unlikely that off-target effects of clozapine would affect our use of CNO within isolated spinal cord preparations. As mentioned above, we have now addressed this, and related issues, in our revised Discussion (third paragraph).</p><p>CNO has also been shown to significantly affect 5-HT2a receptors (~50% inhibition of binding) at a concentration of 10µM (Gomez et al., 2017). In our study we perfused CNO at a lower concentration (1µM). If CNO or CNO-related metabolites had off-target effects, such as on 5-HT2a receptors, we would expect changes in whole network or motoneuron output. However, we have included data showing that, in animals that do not express DREADD receptors, CNO (1µM) had no effect on locomotor-related ventral root output, single cell output, or subthreshold motoneuron properties (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1). We have also now added additional experimental data showing a lack of effect of CNO on the mAHP or input resistance of motoneurons in control mice (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Although we considered alternatives to CNO, a recent study has indicated that Cmp-21, despite being more selective than CNO in activating DREADD receptors (Thompson et al. ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci. 2018 doi: 10.1021/acsptsci.8b00012), also has off-target effects. This includes actions on 5-HT receptors and muscarinic receptors (including M2 receptors focused on in this study; Jendryka et al. 2019, Sci Rep, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41088-2).</p><p>Given the potential issues with alternatives and the fact that CNO applied at 1µM failed to elicit any detectable effects at single cell or whole network levels in non-GM in vitro preparations, we do not believe the potential benefits of repeating our experiments with a different agonist outweigh the animal costs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fictive locomotion recordings show L2 activity. Since calcium imaging of Pitx2 neurons seems to suggest they are flexor related, were the effects observed only constrained to flexor-dominant L2 ventral roots and not extensor-dominant L5 ventral roots?</p></disp-quote><p>In the Ca2+ imaging experiments we imaged all Pitx2+ interneurons (V0c and V0g) in the lumbar region while recording from L1-L3 ventral roots. In our discussion, we hypothesise that their bias in phasing to flexorrelated upper lumbar roots may be attributable to the differing density of V0c and V0g interneurons in the lumbar spinal, which is in agreement with previous reports (Zagoraiou et al., 2009 Neuron). Ventral root recordings performed as parts of DREADD-based and genetic ablation experiments included L1-L5 roots, since both upper and lower lumbar motoneurons are highly innervated by C-boutons. We have now emphasized that we have measured VR output from L1-L3 in the calcium imaging experiments (subsection “Pitx2+ INs are rhythmically active during fictive locomotion”) and L1-L5 in the pharmacological (subsection “Chemogenetic inhibition of Pitx2+ INs decreases the amplitude of locomotor output lines”and subsection “Ablation of V0c INs eliminates muscarinic modulation of the intensity of locomotor output”). Although we believe that C-bouton activity affects the output recorded from all lumbar roots, the possibility of differential effects on different ventral roots was not directly assessed in our experiments. Given that our experiments were not designed to focus on this question, we predominantly recorded from upper lumbar roots, which typically provide the most reliable output. We therefore do not have sufficient data to make comparisons between specific roots and would need a large number of new experiments to achieve this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The major finding is a prominent role for Kv2.1 in MN excitability, and that Kv2.1 is regulated by C-boutons.

However, the cited studies by Trimmer and others show Kv2.1 channel dephosphorylation causes a leftward, hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation, such that the normalized conductance of dephosphorylated Kv2.1 is increased at a given membrane potential. Conversely, normalized conductance is reduced when Kv2.1 is phosphorylated. This should be corrected and the subsequent Discussion section revised to reflect this correction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this error, which we have now corrected in the revised manuscript. We have also rewritten this section of the Discussion and highlighted that future work will need to be done to decipher the exact intracellular pathways involved (Discussion, ninth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Did the authors analyze the effects of GxTx alone on single action potentials? If not, could the authors comment on the specificity of GxTx for Kv2 vs. Kv4 channels as inhibition of an A current could also broaden AP half width.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not analyse the effects of GxTX-1E on motoneuron action potentials, although this has been done previously by Fletcher and colleagues (Fletcher et al., 2017). GxTX-1E is reported to be at least 8-times weaker on Kv4 versus Kv2 channels (Herrington et al., 2006). Previous data indicate that it effectively blocks Kv2 at 100nM but Kv4 at higher concentrations (Herrington et al., 2006). We therefore perfused GxTX-1E at 50nM which we believe will only mildly impact Kv4. Previous work has used 100nM of GxTX-1E to selectively block Kv2 channels in both the neonatal mouse spinal cord (Fletcher et al., 2017) and hippocampus (Liu and Bean, 2014). Liu and Bean, 2014, concluded that “…100 nM GxTX-1E as an optimal concentration to use in current-clamp experiments, with nearly saturating effects on Kv2 but minimal effects on IA…”. In addition, Fletcher et al., 2017, reported a lack of Kv4 expression on spinal motoneurons of neonatal mice. We have now included a statement regarding the specificity of GxTX-1E and the concentration used in our revised Results section (subsection “Chemogenetic excitation of Pitx2<sup>+</sup> INs reveals synaptic mechanisms at C-boutons”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors state that C-bouton activation recruits Kv2.1 channels (Discussion, seventh paragraph), and Figure 9 implies a direct link between the m2 receptors and Kv2.1 channels.

Given that we are unaware of any clear evidence of direct activation of Kv2.1 channels by M2 receptors, we have also amended Figure 9 and the respective legend, to better represent the unknown nature of this interaction and the likely involvement of intracellular signalling pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The result that V0c activity increases rather than decreases MN mAHP amplitude, and that this effect is blocked by methoctramine, is surprising given the author's prior work that local application of muscarine ablates the mAHP via m2 receptors (Miles et al., 2007).
