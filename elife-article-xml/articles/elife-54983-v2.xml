<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BirA enzymes such as BioID (BirA*) and TurboID is a key technology for identifying proteins that interact with a target protein in a cell or organism. However, there have been some improvements in the enzymes that are used for that purpose. Here, we demonstrate a novel BirA enzyme, AirID (ancestral BirA for proximity-dependent biotin identification), which was designed de novo using an ancestral enzyme reconstruction algorithm and metagenome data. AirID-fusion proteins such as AirID-p53 or AirID-IκBα indicated biotinylation of MDM2 or RelA, respectively, in vitro and in cells, respectively. AirID-CRBN showed the pomalidomide-dependent biotinylation of IKZF1 and SALL4 in vitro. AirID-CRBN biotinylated the endogenous CUL4 and RBX1 in the CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> complex based on the streptavidin pull-down assay. LC-MS/MS analysis of cells that were stably expressing AirID-IκBα showed top-level biotinylation of RelA proteins. These results indicate that AirID is a novel enzyme for analyzing protein–protein interactions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins in a cell need to interact with each other to perform the many tasks required for organisms to thrive. A technique called proximity biotinylation helps scientists to pinpoint the identity of the proteins that partner together. It relies on attaching an enzyme (either BioID or TurboID) to a protein of interest; when a partner protein comes in close contact with this construct, the enzyme can attach a chemical tag called biotin to it. The tagged proteins can then be identified, revealing which molecules interact with the protein of interest.</p><p>Although BioID and TurboID are useful tools, they have some limitations. Experiments using BioID take more than 16 hours to complete and require high levels of biotin to be added to the cells. TurboID is more active than BioID and is able to label proteins within ten minutes. However, under certain conditions, it is also more likely to be toxic for the cell, or to make mistakes and tag proteins that do not interact with the protein of interest.</p><p>To address these issues, Kido et al. developed AirID, a new enzyme for proximity biotinylation. Experiments were then conducted to test how well AirID would perform, using proteins of interest whose partners were already known. These confirm that AirID was able to label partner proteins in human cells; compared with TurboID, it was also less likely to mistakenly tag non-partners or to kill the cells, even over long periods.</p><p>The results by Kido et al. demonstrate that AirID is suitable for proximity biotinylation experiments in cells. Unlike BioID and TurboID, the enzyme may also have the potential to be used for long-lasting experiments in living organisms, since it is less toxic for cells over time.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BioID</kwd><kwd>cell-free</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interaction</kwd><kwd>enzymatic engineering</kwd><kwd>ancestral sequence reconstruction</kwd><kwd>proximity labeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP19am0101077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawasaki</surname><given-names>Tatsuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16H06579</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawasaki</surname><given-names>Tatsuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16H04729</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawasaki</surname><given-names>Tatsuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP19H03218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawasaki</surname><given-names>Tatsuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18KK0229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kosako</surname><given-names>Hidetaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H04966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kosako</surname><given-names>Hidetaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawasaki</surname><given-names>Tatsuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005623</institution-id><institution>University of Tokushima</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Joint Usage Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawasaki</surname><given-names>Tatsuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>AirID provides highly interaction-dependent biotinylation for analysis of protein–protein interaction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many cellular proteins function under the control of biological regulatory systems. Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) comprise part of the biological regulation system for proteins. Besides PPIs, biological protein function is post-translationally promoted by multiple modifications such as complex formation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. Therefore, it is very important to understand how proteins interact with target proteins. The identification of partner proteins has been carried out using several technologies such as the yeast two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>), mass spectrometry analysis after immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohshiro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2015</xref>), and cell-free-based protein arrays that we have previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nemoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). These methods provide many critical findings. As intracellular proteins are regulated by quite complicated systems, such as signaling transduction cascades, the use of multiple technologies can strongly promote our understanding of cellular protein regulation.</p><p>Proximity-labelling technology has been widely used to identify partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). As proximity labelling is thought to detect proteins that are very close together, it is expected to obtain more precise information about interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Currently, EMARS (enzyme-mediated activation of radical sources) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honke and Kotani, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kotani et al., 2008</xref>), APEX (engineered ascorbate peroxidase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">James et al., 2019</xref>), and BioID (the proximity-dependent biotin identification) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi-Rhee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roux et al., 2012</xref> have been developed as proximity-labelling technologies. EMARS and APEX methods produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a label (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kotani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martell et al., 2012</xref>). They can rapidly label protein, but H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is highly cytotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halliwell et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>At present, proximity biotinylation is based on the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> enzyme, BirA. BioID (proximity-dependent biotin identification) was first reported in 2004, and its main improvement was the single BirA mutation at R118G (BirA*) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi-Rhee et al., 2004</xref>). BioID generally has promiscuous activity and releases highly reactive and short-lived biotinoyl-5′-AMP. Released biotinoyl-5′-AMP modifies proximal proteins (within a distance of 10 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). BioID can be used by expressing the BioID-fusion protein and adding biotin. In cells expressing BioID-fusion bait protein, proteins with which the bait protein interacts are biotinylated and can be comprehensively analyzed using precipitation with streptavidin followed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). BioID can easily analyze the protein interactome in mild conditions. However, BioID takes a long time (&gt;16 hr) and requires a high biotin concentration to biotinylate interacting proteins. Therefore, it cannot easily detect short-term interactions and is difficult to use in vivo. Second, BioID was improved using R118S and 13 mutations via yeast-surface display; this yielded TurboID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). TurboID has extremely high activity and can biotinylate proteins in only ten minutes. However, TurboID caused non-specific biotinylation and cell toxicity when labeling times were increased and biotin concentrations were high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, a small BioID enzyme from <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> was reported as BioID2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). BiolD, TurboID, and BiolD2 are excellent enzymes, and they offer some improvements for the proximity biotinylation of cellular target proteins. Further improvement of BirA enzymes is an important goal that would enhance the convenience of proximity biotinylation in cells.</p><p>Evolutionary protein engineering using metagenome data have recently been used to improve enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakano and Asano, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakano et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we newly designed five ancestral BirA enzymes using an ancestral enzyme reconstruction algorithm and a large genome dataset. The combination of ancestral reconstruction and site-directed mutagenesis has provided a newly useful BirA enzyme, AirID (<underline>a</underline>ncestral B<underline>ir</underline>A for proximity-dependent biotin <underline>id</underline>entification), which functions in proximity biotinylation in vitro and in cells. Although the sequence similarity between BioID and AirID is 82%, AirID showed high biotinylation activity against interacting proteins. Our results indicate that AirID is a useful enzyme for analyzing protein–protein interactions in vitro and in cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstruction of ancestral BirA enzyme using metagenome data</title><p>BioID and TurboID were designed on the basis of the biotin ligase BirA from <italic>E. coli.</italic> Using a different approach, we attempted to reconstruct the ancestral BirA sequence. Five ancestral sequences were obtained using the following process. A comprehensive and curated sequence library was prepared querying the Blastp web server and using a custom Python script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>), which exhibited more than 30% sequence identity with <italic>E. coli </italic>BirA (EU08004.1). Next, further curation approaches were applied to the library as shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakano et al., 2019</xref>). The procedure consists of the following steps: 1) preparation of sequence pairs consisting of one of the submitted BirA sequences and one sequence (total 1275 genes) in the library, 2) sequence alignment of the all pairs, and 3) selection of sequences bearing ‘key residues’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In detail, we prepared the following four combinations of the key 26<sup>th</sup>, 124<sup>th</sup>, 171<sup>th</sup>, and 297<sup>th</sup> residues to classify the library: Ala, Val, Val, Ala (pattern 1, AVVA); Ala, Phe, Val, Ala (pattern 2, AFVA); Ala, His, Leu, Ala (pattern 3, AHLA); and Gly, Phe, Val, Ala (pattern 4, GFVA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After the selection, we classified the library as follows: the library could be divided into 17, 9, 9, or 66 genes depending on whether the key residues consisted of pattern 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Utilizing each of the classified genes, we designed four artificial sequences using the ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The designed sequences were named on the basis of the patterns; the sequences were classified using the patterns 1 to 4, which we refer to as AVVA, AFVA, AHLA, and GFVA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we added an ‘all’ BirA enzyme from the common ancestor of AVVA, AFVA, and GFVA. BirA enzymes of AVVA, AFVA, AHLA, and GFVA shared similarity with those in the <italic>Shewanella</italic> genus, the <italic>Frischella</italic> and <italic>Glliamella</italic> genera, the <italic>Thiobacillus</italic> and <italic>Betaproteobacteria</italic> genera, and multiple genera, respectively. When the AVVA, AFVA, AHLA, GFVA, and 'all' amino-acid sequences were compared to the sequence <italic>E. coli </italic>BirA they showed 45%, 58%, 42%, 82%, and 73% similarity, respectively, and the region including the active site (107–134 amino acids) was the same sequence throughout.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of novel BirA enzymes designed using metagenome data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A homolog library of BirA from <italic>E. coli</italic> (EcBirA) was generated using blastp and curated using an original python script.

To convert the designed proteins into DNA sequences, we used the codon usage profile from the plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the average genic AT content of which is nearly 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arabidopsis Genome Initiative, 2000</xref>). All ancestral BirA genes were fused an N-terminal AGIA tag, because this is a highly sensitive tag based on a rabbit monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yano et al., 2016</xref>). We synthesized these ancestral BirA proteins (AncBirAs) using a wheat cell-free protein production system to investigate their enzymatic potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sawasaki et al., 2002</xref>). Biotin ligase activity was subsequently checked as all ancestral BirA proteins were obtained as a soluble form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A His-bls-FLAG-GST protein with a N-terminal biotinylation site (bls) of GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE for <italic>E. coli</italic> BirA (EcBirA) was used as a substrate. Three ancestral BirA proteins—AFVA, GFVA, and 'all'—showed activity against the bls sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). GFVA had the greatest activity, similar to that of EcBirA, whereas AVVA and AHLA did not have activity.</p><p>In all of the designed ancestral BirA proteins, an arginine residue corresponding to R118 of EcBirA was conserved in an active site for biotinylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Because EcBirA gained proximity biotinylation activity as a result of the R118G mutation known as BioID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi-Rhee et al., 2004</xref>), each R residue in the five genes was substituted with glycine (RG mutants). To compare the proximity biotinylation activity among these genotypes, wild-type or RG mutant BirA gene was N-terminally fused to the p53 gene. The resulting BirA-p53 proteins were synthesized using the cell-free system before mixing with FLAG-GST(FG)-MDM2, because an interaction between p53 and MDM2 has been widely observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Momand et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michael and Oren, 2003</xref>). Immunoblotting revealed BirA-p53 biotinylation in EcBirA-RG (BioID), AVVA-WT, AVVA-RG, AFVA-RG, and GFVA-RG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). FG-MDM2 proximity biotinylation was detected under these conditions in three ancestral BirA-RG mutants—AVVA-RG, AFVA-RG, and GFVA-RG—indicating that they are candidate enzymes for proximity biotinylation.</p><p>AVVA-RG showed both the highest activity of proximity biotinylation and extra biotinylations in the lower size region (‘non-specific biotinylation’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) when compared to the three ancestral BirA-RG mutants. GFVA-RG indicated the highest biotinylation activity for a specific peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the lowest extra proximity biotinylation.

An interaction between N-terminal AGIA-BirA-fusion p53 (AGIA-BirA-p53) and FG-MDM2 was used to validate proximity biotinylation ability in vitro. Incubation time, biotinylation temperature, and biotin concentration were investigated as conditions for proximity biotinylation. Consequently, TurboID, AVVA-RG, AVVA-RS, and GFVA-RS showed higher proximity biotinylation activity after 3 hr than did BioID with a 16-hr incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In addition, GFP (green fluorescent protein) was terminally fused to MDM2 (GFP-MDM2(CS)) because the mobility size of this fusion protein on SDS-PAGE is very similar to that of BirA-fusion p53 and MDM2. AGIA-BirA-p53 fusions were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells with or without GFP-MDM2(CS), and they were compared with or without biotin supplement. GFVA-RS showed higher biotinylation of FG-MDM2 than did other enzymes under conditions without biotin supplementation (left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, GFVA-RS also indicated biotinylation of FG-MDM2 under biotin supplementation conditions (right panel). Taken together, these results indicated that an ancestral BirA with GFVA-RS is a good enzyme for analyzing protein–protein interactions both in vitro and in cells.

BioID and TurboID showed self biotinylation, and TurboID had the highest activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

As TurboID was selected as an enzyme by screening the yeast-surface display that showed the highest self-biotinylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branon et al., 2018</xref>), the highest activity from TurboID is reasonable. The lack of self-biotinylation activity in AirID may be caused by a property of AirID as the enzyme or by a lack of accessible lysine residues on AirID.</p><p>We next investigated the ability of the AirID enzyme to produce biotinoyl-5′-AMP.

Radio-isotope-labelled ATP [<sup>32</sup>P-α-ATP] was used according to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henke and Cronan, 2014</xref>) to detect biotinoyl-5′-AMP production by the enzymes. The ATP concentration reported by this assay was very low (final 1 µM) because of the use of labelled ATP. AirID and GFVA-RG produced biotinoyl-5′-AMP, and this activity was decreased by supplementing with His-bls-FLAG-GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). AMP was increased at the same time, indicating that biotinoyl-5′-AMP is produced by these enzymes and that AMP is released after biotinylation of His-bls-FLAG-GST.

AGIA-AirID-IκBα was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells under different biotin concentration conditions. Streptavidin-pull down assay of the cell lysates was carried out, and the biotinylated endogenous proteins were detected using immunoblotting with each specific antibody. Endogenous RelA protein was biotinylated without supplemental biotin by transiently expressing AGIA-AirID-IκBα in cells (IB: RelA, 0 µM biotin concentration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Biotin supplementation enhanced biotinylations of p50 or p105, which are known IκBα interactors (IB: p50/p105 and p50, 5 µM or 10 µM biotin concentration). These biotinylations were not found for AGIA-AirID alone. As the IκBα protein interacts with RelA, this result illustrated that biotinylated AGIA-AirID-IκBα may bring endogenous RelA without biotinylation. To confirm this, immunoprecipitation using a specific antibody recognizing endogenous RelA was performed in severe conditions after proteins were denatured with 1% SDS. Biotinylation of endogenous RelA recovered by immunoprecipitation was observed as a result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Tamavidin2-Rev can bind to biotin-labelled substances and can release them under high concentrations of free biotin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takakura et al., 2013</xref>). The biotinylated peptides were eluted using 2 mM biotin, and the eluted peptides were analyzed using LC-MS/MS.

Finally, we combined biochemical experiments and RS mutations to create AirID with high PPI proximity biotinylation. Classical evolutionary protein engineering used random mutations to improve the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the sequence similarity is extremely high because random mutations cannot provide dynamic sequence changes. However, sequence similarity between <italic>E. coli</italic> BirA and ancestral BirA was between 40% to 80%, indicating that a computational approach using large genome datasets can more dynamically design enzyme sequences. As another aspect to this approach, the BirA active region (<sub>115</sub>GRGRRG<sub>121</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwon and Beckett, 2000</xref>) was conserved, and RG and RS mutations introduced into ancestral BirA enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). In the present direction of computational protein evolution, dynamic changes to the backbone region of protein enzymes with a conserved active pocket would be acceptable. Further accumulation of knowledge about the enzyme function would be required to change the enzyme active region dynamically.</p><p>When we looked at BioID (BirA*), TurboID, and AirID, the proximal biotinylation activity of BioID (BirA*) was considerably lower than that of TurboID and AirID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, TurboID showed the highest proximate biotinylation activity in vitro and in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This enzyme could be used for biotinylation within one hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). However, the highest activity from TurboID provided extra biotinylation on unexpected proteins, such as like GFP or tubulin, in cells that were treated for a long incubation of more than six hours and higher biotin concentrations (such as 50 µM biotin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the first report describing TurboID, it was used as a biotin-labelling enzyme rather than as a proximal biotinylation enzyme for PPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). If it was used analyze PPI, TurboID would show the best performance under limiting conditions, such as a short treatment (1 hr) in cells.</p><p>In the case of AirID, GFP and tubulin biotinylations were not observed in the same conditions as those catalyzed by TurboID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Streptavidin-pull down assay and LC-MS/MS analysis also indicated that AirID-fusion proteins were able to biotinylate each well-known interactor accurately in the transient- and stable-expression cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The formation of biotinoyl-5′-AMP was greater for AirID than for TurboID in low ATP concentrations (1 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>), and it prefers lower concentrations of biotin (with 5 µM biotin or without biotin supplement) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, analysis of biotinylation sites from LC-MS/MS showed that AirID biotinylation happened with no special sequence preference on a proximate Lys residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, our AirID is expected to enhance PPI-dependent biotinylation accuracy, suggesting that AirID is suitable for PPI analysis in cells.</p><p>Inhibition of MDM2–p53 interaction by nutline-3 was detected using AirID biotinylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>), and several pomalidomide-dependent interactions between CRBN and neosubstrates were also detected by AirID biotinylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results indicate that AirID-dependent biotinylation would be useful for PPI analysis using chemical compounds. Furthermore, in vivo proximity biotinylation using BioID has been performed in many studies because the identification of in vivo partner proteins of target proteins is key for understanding biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Odeh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Motani and Kosako, 2018</xref>), and it has uncovered new PPIs. Stable expression of AirID-IκBα did not induce cell-growth inhibition even under biotin-supplementation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that AirID-fusion protein expression would have very low toxicity. Therefore, AirID could also be used for in vivo screening for protein interactors of a target protein. In conclusion, AirID is a novel enzyme providing proximity biotinylation for PPI analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

sequences, classified into four groups using the key residues, were aligned using MAFFT software 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katoh et al., 2002</xref>). Each of the aligned sequences was analyzed using MEGA6 software 3, and the phylogenetic tree was generated using the maximum likelihood method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tamura et al., 2013</xref>). Aligned sequences and phylogenetic tree data were submitted to FastML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashkenazy et al., 2012</xref>). The JTT empirical model was adopted for analysis. Finally, we obtained four ancestral BirA forms named AVVA, AFVA, AHLA, and GFVA. Furthermore, we applied the three designed sequences (AVVA, AFVA, and GFVA) and an identical procedure to design another ancestral BirA called ‘all’. All of the five designed sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>BioID (BirA*), TurboID, or ancestral BirAs (AncBirAs) were cloned into pcDNA3.1-AGIA or pEU-AGIA vectors using the BamH1 and Not1 restriction sites.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Volker Dötsch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor.

Biotinylation is still fundamental for molecular level analyses of proteins in vitro and in vivo. The authors successfully constructed a novel enzyme, which has been completely designed based on ancestral genes. The authors use different in vitro and in vivo tests to show that the new protein is fast but has less toxic effects than TurboID. By using different complexes they demonstrate that the expected interactions are found.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data of Figure 2C are unexpected and puzzling. The usual scenario is that the mutant BirA makes biotinoyl-5’-AMP that leaks from the active site. If so, it would not be present in the active site to modify the biotin ligation site. Figure 2C shows that addition of the biotin ligation site markedly stimulates AMP production indicating modification of the biotin ligation site. This argues that biotinoyl-5’-AMP remains in the active site rather than being in free solution to give BioID. If another protein (e.g., RelA) replaces the biotin ligation site do we see the same effect?</p><p>2) The data presented lack quantitation. Instead only a visual comparisons of a very large number of blots of gels many of which seem overexposed is presented. This paper could be put on a more quantitative basis by an experiment similar to that of the original proximity-dependent biotinylation report (Choi-Rhee, Schulman and Cronan, 2004). Proximity-dependent biotinylation by BirA R118G was detected by biotinylation of many proteins upon its expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This simple experiment would allow quantitative assessment of the activities of the various enzymes. Experiments in <italic>E. coli</italic> comparing biotinylation of a fusion protein fused to the enzymes to that seen when the fusion partner in independently expressed would measure biotinylation specificity.</p><p>Appropriate controls showing that the enzymes and target proteins are expressed similarly would be required (that is not clear in the present work).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54983.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data of Figure 2C are unexpected and puzzling.

From the result of Figure 2C, we considered that GFVA-RG and GFVA-RS (AirID) have two abilities: biotinylation on bls with its site recognition, and release of free biotinoyl-5’-AMP. However, in this figure, we would indicate whether AirID has the ability for releasing biotinoyl-5’-AMP, but not whether AirID can biotinylate on bls (Avitag). Pointing out from this reviewers’ comment, we thought that this figure provides the extra confusion. Therefore, we changed Figure 2C data into Figure 2—figure supplement 4C showing that AirID has the ability for releasing biotinoyl-5’-AMP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data presented lack quantitation.
