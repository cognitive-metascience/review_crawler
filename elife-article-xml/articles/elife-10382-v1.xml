arousal. Using transgenic mice in which channelrhdopsin-2 is selectively expressed in cholinergic neurons, we show that optical stimulation of cholinergic inputs to the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) activates local GABAergic neurons to promote sleep and protect non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. It does not affect REM sleep. Instead, direct activation of cholinergic input to the TRN shortens the time to sleep onset and generates spindle oscillations that correlate with NREM sleep. It does so by evoking excitatory postsynaptic currents via α7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and inducing bursts of action potentials in local GABAergic neurons. These findings stand in sharp contrast to previous reports of cholinergic activity driving arousal. Our results provide new insight into the mechanisms controlling sleep.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10382.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10382.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10382.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sleep is one of the most familiar activities in our lives and yet there are still many unanswered questions related to how it is regulated. The cholinergic system (or the part of the nervous system that sends signals using a chemical called acetylcholine) is thought to be important for the phase of sleep that is most similar to being awake, so-called REM sleep. This collection of nerve cells has also been implicated in the process of waking up from sleep. However, it remains unclear how the cholinergic system acts on sleep.</p> <p>Ni, Hou et al. have now used a technique called optogenetics to use light to stimulate the cholinergic system in specific areas in the brains of mice. These experiments found that the activation of the cholinergic system caused awake mice to fall asleep, and promoted more non-REM sleep in sleeping mice. As such, this discovery challenges the previously held view that cholinergic activity was linked to waking up.</p> <p>Acetylcholine affects cells in a similar way to nicotine from cigarettes. In the future, Ni, Hou et al. would like to explore how many nicotine-like substances are released by the cholinergic system in specific brain areas, and to further investigate when and how sleep is promoted.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10382.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10382.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>TRN</kwd><kwd>Cholinergic projections</kwd><kwd>Optogenetics</kwd><kwd>GABAergic neurons</kwd><kwd>Sleep</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Distinguished Young Scientists 81225007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiao-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key Project of the China National Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31430034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiao-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Major Plan of the National Natural Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91132714</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiao-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003999</institution-id><institution>Science Fund for Creative Research Groups</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81221003</award-id> <principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiao-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cholinergic system play an important role in waking-to-sleep cycles and in sleep stabilization.</meta-value> </custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and brainstem provide widespread projections to numerous brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and TRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mesulam et al., 1983</xref>). Abundant behavioral and electrophysiological data suggest that cholinergic neurons play critical roles in regulating paradoxical sleep and the sleep-waking cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koyama et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greco et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellingham and Funk, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boutrel and Koob, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darbra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2012</xref>), as well as in promoting arousal. Recently, it has been shown that selective activation of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain induces immediate transition from sleep to waking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The TRN serves as a gate for information flow between the cerebral cortex and thalamus due, in part, to its location near thalamic white matter and to the large numbers of GABAergic neurons it contains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Houser et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pinault, 2004</xref>). The TRN is important for supporting attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McAlonan et al., 2008</xref>), sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Steriade et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Espinosa et al., 2008</xref>), and sleep-dependent memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fogel and Smith, 2011</xref>). The physiological effects of cholinergic projections to the TRN, however, remain unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we took the advantage of the temporal precision and cell-type specificity of optogenetics to show that optical activation of cholinergic input to the TRN stimulates local GABAergic neurons by activating α7-containing nicotinic cholinergic receptors (α7-nAChRs). The resulting increase in GABAergic activity in the TRN shortens sleep onset time and extends NREM sleep duration. These unexpected findings are quite different from those previously reported for cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and brainstem, which support arousal and REM sleep. The present results indicate that cholinergic projections to the TRN normally promote sleep onset and protect NREM sleep. The behavioral outcome of cholinergic activity across brain regions, therefore, depends on the combination of pathways activated and targets stimulated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optical driving of cholinergic fibers in the TRN generates spindle oscillations</title><p>To research the function of cholinergic innervation in the TRN, we employed <italic>ChAT-ChR2</italic> mice in which channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) was selectively expressed in cholinergic neurons under the control of acetylcholinesterase promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). A 473 nm laser was employed to activate the cholinergic fibers through a 200 μm optical fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Histological imaging showed that the optical fiber was well implanted above the TRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then tested EEG from the skull in vivo and found that optical stimulation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN could induce spindle oscillations both in waking and sleep states. To determine which stimulation intensity was most effective for inducing spindle oscillations, we used four intensities of 20 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms, and 400 ms pulses, respectively. The visual inspection revealed increasing EEG power with increasing stimulation intensity. However, when the pulse intensity increased to 200 ms, the EEG power nearly reached the maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also compared the spindle co-occurrence evoked by 20 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms, and 400 ms, respectively, during awake and NREM states. The co-occurrence of spindle oscillation was greater than that in the waking stage (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, spindle co-occurrence increased as the pulse duration increased (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, there was no significant difference in co-occurrence between the 200 ms and 400 ms stimulation pulse-evoked spindle oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Next, we compared the evoked and natural spindle oscillations and found there was no significant difference in their frequencies, amplitudes or durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results demonstrate that the evoked spindle oscillation pattern mimicked the natural spindle oscillation pattern.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10382.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optical driving of cholinergic fibers in the TRN generated spindle oscillations.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Placement of optical fiber above the TRN in <italic>ChAT-ChR2</italic> mice.

After screening a range of conditions, this protocol appeared optimal and mimicked natural activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Combined EEG, EMG, and video recordings were used to determine the sleep-waking patterns and to examine sleep architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lupi et al., 2008</xref>). The stimulation protocol induced sleep onset in <italic>ChAT-ChR2</italic> mice (ChAT-ChR2-Sti) within 16 min, on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). This was 50–60% quicker (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) than in <italic>ChAT-ChR2</italic> mice without stimulation (ChAT-ChR2-NonSti) and in WT mice with stimulation (WT-Sti). There was no significant difference between WT-Sti mice and <italic>ChAT-ChR2</italic>-NonSti mice (<italic>P</italic> = 0.49).

To identify <italic>PV</italic>-positive neurons for mechanistic studies, we crossed <italic>ChAT-ChR2</italic> mice with B13 mice. This generated mice expressing both ChR2 in the cholinergic neurons and GFP in the <italic>PV</italic> neurons, permitting whole-cell recordings from GABAergic neurons while optically stimulating local cholinergic input. Immunostaining revealed numerous cholinergic fibers surrounding <italic>PV</italic>-positive neurons in the TRN of <italic>ChAT-ChR2</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). First, we stimulated cholinergic neurons and found that a 5-ms pulse could induce the firing of action potentials in the cholinergic neurons when stimulating cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We then tried 5-ms, 50-ms, 100-ms, and 200-ms light pulses to stimulate cholinergic fibers and recorded neuronal activity of GABAergic neurons in the TRN. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We found that light pulses of short duration, such as 5 ms and 50 ms, failed to induce bursts of action potentials in GABAergic neurons. A light pulse of at least 100 ms was required to induce bursts of action potentials and spindles. Whole-cell recording in voltage-clamp mode from <italic>PV</italic> neurons in the TRN-containing brain slice showed that pure light stimulation (without injection current) of a 200-ms pulse evoked fast excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, lower). They were accompanied by rhythmic high-frequency bursts of action potentials (APs) seen in current-clamp mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, upper). In vivo extracellular recording in the TRN of anesthetized <italic>ChAT-ChR2</italic> mice revealed that the optical stimulation of cholinergic fibers induced spikes in the GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results suggest that cholinergic projections to the TRN produce excitatory input sufficient to evoke bursts of APs in <italic>PV</italic>-containing TRN neurons. To determine which cholinergic projections mediated these results, we injected AAV9-CAG-DIO-EGFP-2A-TVA and AAV9-CAG-DIO-RV-G into the TRN. Three weeks later, EnvA-pseudotyped RV-ΔG-DsRed, which can infect efficiently and travel retrogradely, was injected into the same site. We found that the DsRed signal was detected in some cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nBM) in the basal forebrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) of the brain stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Furthermore, cholinergic fiber activation of GABAergic neurons in the TRN in vivo can promote sleep onset and increase the probability of spindle oscillation and duration of the NREM phase. Lastly, direct stimulation of GABAergic neurons in the TRN to elicit activity comparable to that induced by cholinergic input produces the same kinds of changes in sleep behavior seen following cholinergic activation of the neurons. These results demonstrate the capacity of cholinergic input, acting through GABAergic neurons in the TRN, to promote critical features of sleep.</p><p>Previous studies employing pharmacology, brain injury, and electrical stimulation revealed important contributions of cholinergic signaling to the regulation of the sleep-to-waking cycle and paradoxical sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sarter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamlin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sims et al., 2013</xref>). These earlier studies suggested that cholinergic input to the TRN neurons was primarily inhibitory, acting on M2 muscarinic ACh receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCormick and Prince, 1986</xref>). Local delivery of ACh to the TRN was seen to induce only a slow inhibitory response, leading to the conclusion that the ACh-induced bursts of APs observed were somehow the result of the GABAergic neurons in the TRN becoming hyperpolarized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCormick and Prince, 1986</xref>). Instead, we showed cholinergic input to the TRN stimulates the GABAergic neurons via α7-nAChRs, and that this input through α7-nAChRs induces bursts of action potentials and promotes/stabilizes sleep. Previous failures to detect an α7-nAChR response in the TRN were almost certainly caused by electrical stimulation methods, i.e. ACh perfusion. Because α7-nAChRs desensitize so quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giniatullin et al., 2005</xref>), their responses can be missed in experimental paradigms. Another group found that Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs) induced by electrical stimulation were blocked by dihydro-β-erythroidine (DhβE, 300 nM), indicating that the EPSPs were mediated by α4β2-containing nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). However, DhβE (300 nM) can block both α4β2- and α7 nAChR-mediated currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkondon and Albuquerque, 1993</xref>), and non-specific electrical stimulation may enable extrasynaptic transmitter release.</p><p>Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain send projections to many targets, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and TRN. Selective activation of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain has been shown to induce an immediate transition from sleep to waking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2014</xref>). The present study specifically activated cholinergic fibers locally in the TRN, which, surprisingly, showed the opposite effect. It induced transition from waking to sleep, indicating that direct cholinergic projections to the TRN promote sleep onset and sleep stabilization. GABAergic neurons of the TRN fire AP bursts mediating slow and spindle waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cain and Snutch, 2010</xref>). These bursts are very important for the generation of thalamocortical spindle waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">von Krosigk et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), and spindle rhythms play important roles in protecting sleep initiation and elevating arousal threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Steriade, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wimmer et al., 2012</xref>). We propose that excitation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN acts on GABAergic neurons through α7-nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roth et al., 2000</xref>) to depolarize the membrane sufficiently to induce bursts of APs. Our results demonstrate a significant positive relationship between spindle density and the promotion of the NREM state and sleep stabilization. Activation of the cholinergic neurons appears to play critical roles in the switch from waking to sleep and in the protection of sleep itself, especially by increasing the NREM state.</p><p>It is possible that stimulating axonal fibers may cause antidromic and collateral activation because TRN-projecting cholinergic neurons mainly involved in the nBM and PPTg also project to other brain areas. Cholinergic neurons in the nBM of the basal forebrain project to the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and TRN, and that in the PPTg of the brainstem project to the thalamus, new striatum, and basal forebrain. Activation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN may antidromically collaterally excite cell bodies, or collaterally act on other neurons, leading to the indirect effects on sleep. To address this question, we locally injected the α7 receptor blocker MLA in the TRN and found that sleep induced by cholinergic fiber stimulation was completely inhibited, suggesting that the possibility was small.</p><p>We found that unilateral stimulations and drug infusions had significant effects on behavior and phenotype. This did not exclude spontaneous behavior evoked by contralateral Ach release. Bilateral stimulation is better to clearly address the mechanisms.</p><p>The finding that optical stimulation of cholinergic projections to the TRN directly elicits EPSCs in the GABAergic neurons via α7-nAChRs is unexpected. Though α7-nAChRs are widely distributed in the brain, they are usually thought to provide a modulatory role. From presynaptic locations, the receptors can enhance transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McGehee et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 1996</xref>), while from post- or presynaptic locations they can modulate synaptic responses indirectly through calcium-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dajas-Bailador and Wonnacott, 2004</xref>). Rarely, if ever, have α7-nAChRs been shown to be the primary mediator of rapid, synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS). In the present study, the ability of MLA to block cholinergically-induced EPSCs in the TRN clearly implicates α7-nAChRs. Immunostaining corroborated the presence of α7-nAChRs in the GABAergic neurons of the TRN. The inability of CNQX, AP5, and PTX to block the EPSCs demonstrated that rapid glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission were not responsible for the EPSCs. The fact that α7-nAChRs have a high relative permeability to calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertrand et al., 1993</xref>) and trigger calcium release from internal stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dajas-Bailador and Wonnacott, 2004</xref>) may be relevant for the kinds of signaling effective at promoting spindle oscillations.</p><p>Our study provides critical insight into cholinergic roles in mediating biological rhythms. Cholinergic neurons play an important role in waking-to-sleep cycles and in sleep stabilization by activating GABAergic neurons in the TRN through α7-nAChRs. Although a great deal of work has been done to examine the roles of cholinergic systems in biological rhythms, previous experiments have mainly focused on the sleep-to-waking transition, and results have been limited by the experimental techniques used. Cholinergic projections from different brain areas to the TRN may have opposing effects, acting through different receptors and synaptic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everitt and Robbins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2003</xref>). The states of sleep and waking may be determined by the opposing inputs serving as a system of checks and balances. Because a number of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferrarelli and Tononi, 2011</xref>), show sleep disturbances and loss of spindle oscillation, the results reported here may also be useful in suggesting new targets for therapeutic intervention in these cases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice were housed in individual Plexiglass recording cages in temperature (24 ± 1°C) and humidity (40–60%) controlled recording chambers under a 12/12 hr light/dark cycle (starting at 08:00).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Selectively Driving Cholinergic Fibers Optically in the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus Promotes Sleep&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Joseph Takahashi) and a Senior Editor.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>It is commonly believed that cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and brainstem drive arousal and promote attention. In this study, Ni et al. report their surprising finding that stimulating cholinergic inputs to the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) facilitates sleep onset and protects non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, likely through increasing spindle oscillations of TRN neurons. In addition, cholinergic inputs directly evoke fast excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and elicit bursts of spike firing by targeting α7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These discoveries are significant because it challenges the dogma that cholinergic activity is positively associated with arousal. The finding of rapid cholinergic EPSCs is also novel because acetylcholine typically produces modulatory effects via volume transmission in the brain. The manuscript is well written and the figures are well organized.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>1) The stimulation conditions are arbitrary; 200 ms pulse duration is significantly longer than the average and could be inducing artifactual firing. A concern is how the stimulation parameters are related to the physiological activity patterns in behaving animals. To stimulate cholinergic fibers, the authors used laser pulses of different durations (20, 100, 200, and 400 ms) and found that 200 ms-long pulses were most effective. To stimulate TRN neurons, they used 8 Hz 10-ms pulses. Although these types of stimulations produced clear behavioral effects, they do make a reader wonder how a 200 ms-long light pulse or an 8 Hz train of short light pulses changes the firing rates of TRN-projecting cholinergic neurons or TRN neurons, respectively.</p> <p>2) In addition, it is unclear how the stimulation effects mimic neuron activity patterns before and during NREM sleep. Would it be possible that stimulating with a different parameter (tonic activation) actually promotes arousal? I understand that some of the questions are difficult to address experimentally. Nevertheless, the authors can test how the light pulses of different duration affect neuronal activity in brain slices and discuss the potential relevancy and caveats.</p> <p>3) The origin of cholinergic fibers is still unknown. I would suggest using viral injections in <italic>ChAT cre</italic> animals to map the source of TRN innervation.</p> <p>4) All sleep experiments should be accompanied by power spectral analysis to determine the quality of sleep induction.</p> <p>5) The authors should cite papers or provide experimental data on the source of cholinergic inputs to the TRN. Do TRN-projecting cholinergic neurons also project to other brain areas? If so, they should discuss the possibility that stimulating axonal fibers may cause antidromic and collateral activation.

A concern is how the stimulation parameters are related to the physiological activity patterns in behaving animals. To stimulate cholinergic fibers, the authors used laser pulses of different durations (20, 100, 200, and 400 ms) and found that 200 ms-long pulses were most effective. To stimulate TRN neurons, they used 8 Hz 10-ms pulses. Although these types of stimulations produced clear behavioral effects, they do make a reader wonder how a 200 ms-long light pulse or an 8 Hz train of short light pulses changes the firing rates of TRN-projecting cholinergic neurons or TRN neurons, respectively.</italic> </p> <p>We are very sorry we did not describe this point clearly in the original version of the manuscript. Thank you for the suggestions.</p> <p>In effect, we stimulated cholinergic neurons in the nBM and found that a 5 ms pulse could induce the firing of action potentials in cholinergic neurons (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, both 5 ms and 50 ms pulse stimulation of cholinergic terminals failed to induce bursts of action potentials and spindles in GABAergic neurons, with at least 100 ms required to induce bursts of action potentials and spindles related to NREM sleep duration (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We believe that the activation of the GABAergic neurons by cholinergic fiber stimulation might be an indirect effect via α7 cholinergic receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It requires a certain amount of Ach release to excite postsynaptic GABAergic neurons to fire action potentials and spindles. Light pulses of 5 ms or 50 ms are too short to induce the release of sufficient Ach, which evokes the burst of action potentials in postsynaptic GABAergic neurons and spindles.</p> <p>However, light-stimulation of GABAergic neurons in the TRN is direct, and only a short pulse of 10 ms (or even shorter) induced the burst of action potentials. The use of 8 Hz mimicked the frequency of spindles at which spindle induction was most effective.</p> <p> <italic>2) In addition, it is unclear how the stimulation effects mimic neuron activity patterns before and during NREM sleep. Would it be possible that stimulating with a different parameter (tonic activation) actually promotes arousal? I understand that some of the questions are difficult to address experimentally. Nevertheless, the authors can test how the light pulses of different duration affect neuronal activity in brain slices and discuss the potential relevancy and caveats.</italic> </p> <p>Thank you for your suggestion. We tried 5 ms, 50 ms, 100 ms, and 200 ms light pulses to stimulate the cholinergic fibers, and recorded neuronal activity of GABAergic neurons in the TRN (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We found that short duration light pulses, such as 5 ms and 50 ms, failed to induce bursts of action potentials in GABAergic neurons. A light pulse of at least 100 ms duration was required to induce bursts of action potentials and spindles. We believe that the activation of GABAergic neurons by cholinergic fiber stimulation might be an indirect effect via the α7 cholinergic receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It requires a certain amount of Ach release to excite postsynaptic GABAergic neurons to fire action potentials and spindles. Light pulses of 5 ms or 50 ms are too short to induce the release of sufficient Ach, which evokes the burst of action potentials in postsynaptic GABAergic neurons and spindles.</p> <p>Spindles induced by a 200 ms pulse were very similar to natural, in both frequency and amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). More importantly, the relevancy of spindle density and NREM duration was consistent with that of the natural ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <italic>ChAT-ChR2</italic>-NonSti).</p> <p>Whether tonic activation promotes arousal is a very good question. We will investigate this and mechanisms in our next project, and hope the reviewers understand that we could not address this problem in the current research.</p> <p> <italic>3) The origin of cholinergic fibers is still unknown. I would suggest using viral injections in ChAT cre animals to map the source of TRN innervation.</italic> </p> <p>Thank you for this suggestion. We injected the retrograde monosynaptic rabies virus with DsRed (please see revised methods) in PV-positive neurons of the TRN, with the DsRed signal then detected in cholinergic neurons of the nBM of the basal forebrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and of the PPTg of the brainstem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Statistical results showed that ~30% of cholinergic neurons (VAChT antibody labeled) were positive for mCherry (retrograde virus labeled) in the nBM, and 7% were positive for mCherry in the PPTg, suggesting that the TRN receives cholinergic projections from both the nBM and PPTg.</p> <p><italic>4) All sleep experiments should be accompanied by power spectral analysis to determine the quality of sleep induction.</italic> </p> <p>Thank you; the manuscript has been revised according to this suggestion.</p> <p><italic>5) The authors should cite papers or provide experimental data on the source of cholinergic inputs to the TRN. Do TRN-projecting cholinergic neurons also project to other brain areas? If so, they should discuss the possibility that stimulating axonal fibers may cause antidromic and collateral activation. The effect of the α7 blocker MLA partially addressed this concern.</italic> </p> <p>This is good suggestion, and related papers have been cited (see References). We also performed new experiments and found that the TRN receives cholinergic projections from both the nBM and PPTg (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p> <p>We agree with the reviewers. It is possible that stimulating axonal fibers may cause antidromic and collateral activation because TRN-projecting cholinergic neurons mainly involved in the nBM and PPN also project to other brain areas. Cholinergic neurons in the nBM of the basal forebrain project to the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and TRN, and that in the PPN of the brainstem project to the thalamus, new striatum, and basal forebrain. Activation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN may antidromically collaterally excite cell bodies, or collaterally act on other neurons, leading to the indirect effects on sleep. To address this question, we locally injected the α7 receptor blocker MLA in the TRN and found that sleep induced by stimulation of cholinergic fibers was completely inhibited, suggesting that the possibility was small.</p> <p>The manuscript has been revised according to reviewers’ suggestion. Please see the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p> <p> <italic>6) All stimulations and drug infusion appear to be applied unilaterally. The authors should clearly describe and discuss this potential limitation.</italic> </p> <p>Thank you for this very good suggestion. In effect, we found that unilateral stimulations and drug infusions had significant effects on behaviors and phenotypes. However, these may not exclude the spontaneous effects evoked by contralateral Ach release. Bilateral stimulation was better to clearly address the mechanisms, and has been discussed in the revised manuscript.</p> <p><italic>7) Group data are needed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. Moreover, this figure panel shows that 200 ms pulses elicited burst spike firing, which differs from the pattern of 8 Hz 10 ms pulses for TRN stimulation. This difference should be discussed.</italic> </p> <p>We have updated the original data with groups in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. When stimulating cholinergic fibers in the TRN, a 200 ms pulse was required to induce bursts of action potentials in GABAergic neurons. However, only a short pulse (such as 5 ms) induced the burst of action potentials in GABAergic neurons in the TRN when directly stimulating GABAergic neurons. In fact, both a short pulse (such as 20 ms) (Michael M Hlassa, et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2011) and short pulses (8 Hz 10 ms) (Angela Kim, et al., PNAS, 2012) can induce spindles. Here, we used 8 Hz for the purpose of inducing spindles most effectively. This difference has been clearly addressed in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of the revised manuscript.</p> <p><italic>8) The laser power was described either as 1.5 mW or 15 mW.
