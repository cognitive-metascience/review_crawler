One of its notorious members, the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, is a major health concern in developing nations, causingÂ ~500,000 deaths annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">White et al., 2014</xref>). Another member, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is a highly successful parasite infecting almost a third of the global human population and can be fatal in immunocompromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Torgerson and Mastroiacovo, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells. Due to its ability to form polymers, this cytoskeletal protein is involved in numerous processes such as cell motility, cytokinesis, organellar and vesicular transport, secretion and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Svitkina, 2018</xref>). Actins encoded by apicomplexan parasites are highly divergent compared to canonical actins from other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>In-vitro</italic>, apicomplexan actins form only short, unstable polymers due to different polymerisation kinetics, caused by variation of certain key amino acids otherwise conserved in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kumpula and Kursula, 2015</xref>). However, until recently, an analysis of filamentous actin (F-actin) localisation and dynamics in apicomplexan parasites was hindered by the unavailability of F-actin sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tardieux, 2017</xref>), a limitation recently overcome by the expression of F-actin binding chromobodies in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Periz et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, in this parasite, F-actin can form an extensive intra-vacuolar network that appears to be involved in material exchange and synchronisation of parasite division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Periz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Until recently, studies on apicomplexan F-actin focused on its critical role during host cell invasion and gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Soldati et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baum et al., 2008a</xref>), where it is believed to provide the force for both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">FrÃ©nal et al., 2017</xref>). However, recent studies using conditional mutants for <italic>actin-1</italic> in two apicomplexans, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic> highlight additional critical roles of F-actin during intracellular parasite development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Periz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Whitelaw et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, some functions, such as inheritance of the chloroplast-like organelle, the apicoplast, appear to be conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andenmatten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Egarter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Whitelaw et al., 2017</xref>), while differences for the dependency of F-actin can be observed for other critical steps of the asexual life cycle. For example, host cell invasion is possible without <italic>actin-1</italic> (albeit at highly reduced levels) in case of <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andenmatten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Egarter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Whitelaw et al., 2017</xref>), while it is completely blocked in case of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Das et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> does not require actin dynamics for egress from the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perrin et al., 2018</xref>), while it is essential for <italic>T. gondii.</italic> Additionally, completion of cytokinesis in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is dependent on actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Das et al., 2017</xref>), while no such dependency has been noted for <italic>T. gondii</italic>.

After invasion, the merozoite form of the parasite (similar to <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites) establishes itself within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV), loses its ovoid shape to become amoeboid and feeds on host haemoglobin creating a food vacuole (FV) where haem is detoxified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">GrÃ¼ring et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, actin has been implicated in transport/fusion of haemoglobin-filled vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elliott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smythe et al., 2008</xref>). The parasite then replicates by a process best described as internal budding, where daughter parasites develop within the mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Francia and Striepen, 2014</xref>). In the case of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, only two daughters are formed at a time in a process called endodyogeny. In contrast, malaria parasite replication within the erythrocyte, termed schizogony, results in the formation of 16â32 merozoites at once. Towards the end of a replicative cycle the parasite forms its invasion-related organelles de novo: the inner membrane complex (IMC), micronemes and rhoptries. In contrast, parasite mitochondria and the apicoplast undergo growth and division and are trafficked into each daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bannister et al., 2000</xref>). Although endodyogeny and schizogony appear different, it is believed that both processes use a conserved molecular machinery. Indeed, independent studies identified the same factors to be critical for both replicative modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Francia and Striepen, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite this, it could be assumed that differences, especially with respect to vesicular transport processes such as endocytosis and intra-vacuolar parasite communication, exist to adapt to different replication modes. This puts F-actin in the spotlight as it plays a central role in these processes in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Svitkina, 2018</xref>). We recently characterised a conditional mutant of PfACT1 and observed that in good agreement with the function of actin in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andenmatten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jacot et al., 2013</xref>), inheritance of the apicoplast is compromised during schizogony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Das et al., 2017</xref>). While the phenotypic analysis of conditional mutants is useful to identify conserved and unique functions of F-actin in apicomplexans, the inability to visualise F-actin in these parasites led to models, sometimes conflicting with each other and with the canonical behaviour of F-actin in other eukaryotes.</p><p>Common actin-labelling probes such as Phalloidin do not label apicomplexan actin and LifeAct could not be successfully expressed in these parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Periz et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, actin-binding single-domain nanobodies tagged to fluorescent probes, called actin-chromobodies, were successfully expressed in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and shown to have minimal effect on actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Periz et al., 2017</xref>), as also demonstrated in other eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rocchetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Panza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Melak et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, these chromobodies could faithfully label purified <italic>Plasmodium</italic> actin in <italic>in-vitro</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bookwalter et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here we adapted the actin-chromobody technology to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and demonstrate for the first time the localisation, dynamics and role of F-actin for parasite development in asexual stages. Interestingly, we find F-actin in proximity to the apicoplast throughout intracellular growth, leading to the question of which actin regulatory proteins are involved in this process. Most actin nucleation proteins such as the Arp2/3 complex and the WAVE/WASP complex, and actin cross-linkers such as Î±-actinin and fimbrin are missing in apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baum et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">SchÃ¼ler and Matuschewski, 2006</xref>). Two conserved nucleators found in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> are the formins, Formin-1 (PfFRM1) and Formin-2 (PfFRM2) which localise to distinct compartments in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baum et al., 2008b</xref>). Orthologs of both formins have been implicated in host cell invasion in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daher et al., 2010</xref>), with <italic>T. gondii</italic> Formin-2 (TgFRM2) also being implicated in apicoplast maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jacot et al., 2013</xref>) â leading to inconsistencies in reports and questions whether the two formins have conserved or divergent functions in both parasites. Indeed, a recent study, using the F-actin chromobody as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Periz et al., 2017</xref>), suggested distinct, non-overlapping functions for the three formins in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here we performed a careful comparison of the role of Formin-2 in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic> and demonstrate that it localises in close proximity to apicoplasts in both parasites.

We confirmed localisation of TgFRM2 adjacent to the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> upper panel).

Importantly, validation of this reagent using either F-actin modulating drugs or a conditional mutant for PfACT1 led to expected results and phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), demonstrating that F-actin dynamics are finely balanced in the parasite.</p><p>Super-resolution imaging revealed a complex F-actin network in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), similar to that observed in <italic>T.Â gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Periz et al., 2017</xref>) with extensive filaments around the FV â a location where the basal ends of the newly formed merozoites bud off during the end of schizogonic cytokinesis. We show that the primary nucleator of F-actin in intracellular <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is PfFRM2 and this protein also controls apicoplast inheritance and efficient cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Importantly, our previous characterisation of a conditional mutant for PfACT1 highlighted three primary functions of actin during the asexual life cycle of the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Das et al., 2017</xref>), which perfectly correlate to the localisation and dynamics found here using chromobody-expressing parasites. PfACT1 is essential for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion into erythrocytes and we show for the first time the temporal and spatial dynamics of actin polymerisation by live microscopy prior to invasion. Despite a growing body of evidence suggesting the importance of calcium signalling and phosphorylation of IMC proteins by kinases such as calcium-dependent protein kinase-1 (CDPK1) and protein kinase A (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>) during invasion, what triggers the polymerisation of actin is largely unknown. Our data suggest that early signalling events just after egress are a trigger for actin-polymerisation at the apical end. This is likely to be mediated by an apically resident nucleator of F-actin, a likely candidate being Formin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baum et al., 2008b</xref>), since PfFRM2 KO parasites could still polymerise actin at the apical end, as demonstrated in this study.</p><p>Therefore, the expression of chromobodies in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> allows us to phenotypically probe the state of the F-actin network <italic>in-vivo</italic> in a rapid and robust manner.

Using bioinformatic searches within alveolates, we found the presence of a PTEN-C2-like domain only in apicomplexan Formin-2 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This domain has been demonstrated in rice to be responsible for Formin-2 targeting to chloroplast membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>).

The YFP tag is superfolder YFP 2, and was sub-cloned from pSYFP2-C1 (gift from Dorus Gadella (Addgene plasmid # 22878; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene">http://n2t.net/addgene</ext-link>:22878; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_22878">Addgene_22878</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kremers et al., 2006</xref>). All C-terminal repair templates were pooled, purified using a PCR purification Kit (Blirt). Together with 10 Âµg Cas9 vector encoding the respective gRNA, 1 Ã 107 of freshly released RHÎku80DiCre tachyzoites (an improved version created by Dr Moritz TreeckÂ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hunt et al., 2019</xref> from the original; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andenmatten et al., 2013</xref>) were transfected using 4D AMAXA electroporation. 24 hr after transfection, parasites were mechanically released, filtered and sorted for transient YFP expression into 96 well plates using a FACS sorter (FACSARIA III, BD Biosciences). Individual plaques were screened by PCR and the C-terminus of TgFRM2 was sequenced (Eurofins Genomics). Into a clone with TgFRM2-YFP-LoxP, the upstream LoxP was introduced as described. Screening for upstream LoxP integration was performed by PCR with a primer binding at the junction of gRNA binding sequence and LoxP site. Using a different set of primers, the complete upstream LoxP site was amplified via PCR and verified by sequencing. Two distinct clones were obtained for LoxPTgFRM2-YFP-LoxP (clone A and B) and used for phenotypic characterisation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Induction of the conditional DiCre TgFRM2 KO parasites</title><p>To obtain TgFRM2-YFP KO parasites, the loxPTgFRM2-YFP-LoxP parental line was grown in 50 nM rapamycin containing media as described above until fixing.

Conditional CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out (cKO) mutants for actin1, adf and formin2 were obtained by adding 50 nM rapamycin to the parental lines expressing the conditional CRISPR/Cas9 system and a gene-specifc gRNA. Parasites were incubatedÂ withÂ rapamycin for 1 hr at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and,Â subsequently,Â cultured as described previously. For the CRSIPR/Cas9 actin1-cKO mutants, the culture medium was replaced by DMEM complete supplemented with 2.5% dextran sulphate after 24 hr to inhibit re-invasion of wild-type parasites. Disruption of the target genes was confirmed by sequencing (Eurofins Genomics).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Transient transfection of CB-EME into <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites</title><p>To have parasites transiently expressing CB-EME, 1 Ã 107 of freshly released TgFRM2-HA or loxPTgFRM2-YFP parasites were transfected with 20 Âµg DNA by AMAXA electroporation.

Subsequently, parasites were mechanically lysed and inoculated on glass bottom dishes (MaTek) for another 24 hr. RH-GFP parasites were inoculated on glass bottom dishes (MaTek) for 24 hr. Prior to live microscopy, the DMEM complete culturing media was replaced with FluoroBrite DMEM media supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 25 mg/mL gentamycin. The dish was then transferred to the DV Core microscope (AppliedPrecision, GE) and maintained under standard culturing conditions (37Â°C, 5%Â CO<sub>2</sub>). Images were taken using a 100x oil objective lens. Deconvolution was performed using SoftWoRx Suite 2.0 (Applied Precision, GE). Videos were processed using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Generation of colour-coded kymographs for particle dynamics analysis and time-averaged local intensity profiles</title><p>Colour-coded kymographs were generated by applying the ImageJ plugin âKymographClearâ as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mangeol et al., 2016</xref>). In short, we used this application to define a track on a maximum intensity image that was calculated from an image sequence.

Your article has been reviewed a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Isabelle Tardieux (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>This work builds on a previous study aimed at visualizing the actin cytoskeleton in Apicomplexa using chromobodies. As you will see from the reviewer reports appended below, both reviewers recognized the importance of the topic. The reviewers discussed your work in detail, and the consensus was that although the studied problem is challenging and the described work has some potential, in the current form the conclusions are not sufficiently supported by data, such as complementary approaches to provide sound evidence for the rather strong statements on the identity of the studied structures. Another strong point of criticism, on which both reviewers agreed, was the lack of quantitation throughout the paper. Since these concerns cannot be easily addressed within a short time frame, we advise you to seek publication elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Formin-2 drives polymerisation of actin filaments enabling segregation of apicoplasts in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic>&quot; by JF Stortz et al., reports on the use of actin chromobodies to detect F-actin structures in the two Apicomplexa <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> parasites, and on the involvement of these structures during parasite intracellular development. While the authors have already obtained <italic>T. gondii</italic> lines expressing the actin chromobodies (Periz et al., 2017), this is newly achieved for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Using this tool to characterize putative F actin structures, they then investigated how intracellular dividing parasites (<italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoite to schizont in the red blood cells) or <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites in nucleated mammalian cells) are affected when the actin1 gene is conditionally silenced using the DiCre recombinase/ lox system. They confirmed for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual erythrocytic stages that loss of actin impacts proper segregation of the apicoplast organelle, a finding already reported by the authors for <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites (Whitelaw et al., 2017). The manuscript is then centered on the key role of actin dynamics to promote apicoplast segregation. Given this observation the authors established an association between pools of actin chromobody-bound actin and apicoplasts using confocal and super resolution imaging. To start addressing how actin dynamics could control apicoplast, they raised the hypothesis that the actin nucleator Formin (here Formin-2) would be a relevant candidate. They showed using both epitope tagging at the endogenous locus and conditional silencing, that (i) main pools of Formin-2 are indeed juxtaposed to apicoplasts and (ii) loss of formin induces the breakdown of the F-actin structure and eventually apicoplast segregation defect.</p><p>It is noteworthy that this study relies on a combination of recently introduced but still challenging molecular genetics in the Apicomplexa field. The authors have engineered several lines of interest in both <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and this represents a valuable achievement. In addition, the view that Formin-2 could play a key role in controlling actin at specific locations during cell cycle is also quite interesting and rather convincingly documented. However, in my opinion the work should be strengthened by few additional datasets and by careful reevaluation of several statements prior to publication.</p><p>First and main point is the need to document in better detail how F-actin pools form/disorganize in space and time during the apicoplast segregation process in wild type parasites. Real time and static SR imaging should allow capturing the kinetics of the segregation process as well as spatial details (Z stacks thus 3D reconstitution will reveal them). Then, the use of conditional gene silencing will take all its power to support/contradict the scheme.</p><p>In Figure 2: it is very important that the authors do not refer to filopodia when observing fluctuations at the second time scale in the actin chromobody signals during the early stages (ring/trophozoite which should be indicated in the figures). If they want to characterize filopodia occurrence, they need to provide a marker for membrane and to analyze whether the parasite actin protrusions coincide with membrane projections.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This work continues some previous studies that showed in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> that one could get some visualisation of the actin biology by expressing fluorescent probes called chromobodies. Here the authors use this same technology to reanalyse the distribution of actin in both <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. The authors show some potentially interesting results â mainly built around interpretation of images relating to the apicoplast and implicating Formin-2 in the polymerisation of actin filaments that are known from previous work to be involved in apicoplast division.</p><p>At the heart of the work are some statements that define the fluorescent dots or areas of brightness as actin filamentous structures or apicoplasts etc. I absolutely recognise the difficulty of these visualisation experiments in terms of getting an expressed probe to be at a meaningful level of expression and then imaging its distribution and interpreting the results. I recognise that one is maybe not likely to expect to see huge filamentous actin cables such as one can see in even small cells such as yeast.</p><p>However, the essence of the matter is that I simply do not see that the authors have provided either direct evidence or complementary approaches (biochemistry or electron microscopy) to provide sound evidence for their rather strong statements of identity of the structure. I am sorry to say that I think this is an example of pushing one technology too far and not being realistic about how much one can rely on the interpretation of an image above background to be significant.</p><p>Starting early in the paper on Figure 1 there is a disconnect between the statements made and the images shown. Figure 1B contains images of CB-EME (and CB-HALO) on which the whole paper rests. The problem is that it is extremely difficult if not impossible to discern a filamentous structure in these images over background. There are a few patches of greater fluorescence than background but what allows one to say that these are filamentous? Second Cytochalasin B is supposed to depolymerise these F-actin filaments but there is still a lot of fluorescence in this cell. Is this merely CB-EME fluorescence not bound to actin (G-actin) or is it actin / CB-EME complex fluorescence? The authors want to use this to define that the reagent is specifically recognising actin filaments but I am unconvinced by these images. All of this can be bolstered (and surely must be?) by expressing the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> actin in vitro and doing some biochemistry. Does CB-EME etc. bind in vitro only to polymerised F-actin or does it also form a complex with G-actin? These patches could easily be localised unpolymerized G-actin.</p><p>Given the large background seen after Cytochalasin B as well as in the normal cells one needs some quantitative statements about comparative camera settings for image capture comparisons.</p><p>Figure 1C. The anti-actin antibody seems to give different staining and is deemed (subsection âChromobodies label F-actin structures in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual stages and in gametocytesâ) to recognise both G and F actin. There is no biochemistry on the antibody â (blot of whole cell extracts, IP, etc.) so specificity not known. I don't feel confident about this conclusion when I compare the images.</p><p>Subsection âChromobodies label F-actin structures in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual stages and in gametocytesâ. If chromobodies can bind to PfACT1 and actin2 (where is biochemical evidence?) then why conclude that the filaments could be built from both proteins? Why not of individual ones or a mix?</p><p>Subsection âHighly dynamic F-actin-rich filopodia-like structures extend outward from the periphery of growing parasitesâ. Structures are deemed to be highly dynamic and changing. This is very unscientific language given the data. What does it mean? Do the structures disappear and reappear? Do they move? Increase in size and decrease? Also, whatever they do can numbers not be given â time, number of events observed, number of types of events, etc.</p><p>Subsection âChromobodies label F-actin structures in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual stages and in gametocytesâ. &quot;passes through the whole cell&quot; â unfortunate use of English.</p><p>Subsection âChromobody labelled F-actin structures disappear upon disruption of PfACT1â. Figure 3F the authors speak about the close association of apicoplast with F actin. Actually, all one can see on this image is a large collection of dots. Why are there so many of different types if there should be only one apicoplast per cell?</p><p>Moreover, there is actually little coincidence by my eye of these dots. Surely the authors can quantify their statements by morphometric analysis. My conclusion is bolstered by the fact that there is very little yellow (overlapping green and red) on the merged image. Hence, their data don't justify their interpretation.</p><p>Subsection âChromobody labelled F-actin structures disappear upon disruption of PfACT1â. When disrupted they say that there is a consequential apicoplast segregation defect. I don't see this. In Figure 3F the apicoplast dots are smaller â why would this be if a segregation phenotype?</p><p>Again, there are no numbers in the manuscript, no sizes, counts or morphometric analyses of juxtapositions.</p><p>Subsection âDiCre-mediated conditional disruption of Formin-2 causes a defect in apicoplast segregation in <italic>P. falciparumâ.</italic> The authors speak about collapsed or morphologically aberrant apicoplasts? What is a collapsed apicoplast? No correlative EM is used. They speak about collapsed/intermediate/normal apicoplasts without any definition. All one can see are a series of dots. There is nothing to provide a definition that a particular dot represents a particular &quot;type&quot; of apicoplast. Again, no numbers, counts etc. No statistics. What is a collapsed apicoplast and what does it look like at a sensible resolution â i.e. use electron microscopy.</p><p>One can continue with this type of analysis in further experiments.</p><p>Actin filaments are known from previous work to be involved in apicoplast division and this paper seeks to implicate Formin in that process. This is a not unexpected factor to be involved. If the paper was to merit publication in such a journal it would need a stronger functional message based on more quantitative microscopy, some statistical analysis and some biochemistry. I am afraid this is a microscopy technique that seems to have overtaken the problem in a non-critical manner.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Formin-2 drives polymerisation of actin filaments enabling segregation of apicoplasts and cytokinesis in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We include below the individual reviews and hope that you will finding them helpful when revising your paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Filamentous actin has been notoriously difficult to detect in malaria parasites. In this paper the authors use chromobodies to visualise F-actin in live malaria parasites. They validate the observed structures to be F-actin using CytD and Jaspla and in a conditional actin KO. Next they generated a conditional Formin-2 KO and used the actin chromobody to assess the impact on actin. This permitted them to nicely link phenotypes of the Formin-2 KO with changes in F-actin pools in the cell. This is most convincing with the apicoplast which shows a segregation phenotype (fitting with the phenotype of the conditional actin KO that the authors previously showed in Das et al., 2017). The manuscript also shows that knocking out Formin-2 leads to loss of the F-actin network around the food vacuole. This network is present in late stage malaria parasites and likely is equivalent of the intravacuolar actin network in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites. The dependence of this network on Formin-2 is in contrast to the situation in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, where this network is dependent on a third formin that is not present in malaria parasites. These findings are shown in the last part of the manuscript where the authors analyse F-actin in a conditional Formin-2 KO in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. In part this overlaps with data from a recent report in <italic>eLife</italic> (Tosetti et al., 2019) that also used the actin chromobody of the authors of the present manuscript. Interestingly, the work here indicates bi-directional F-actin flows along the parasite periphery whereas the previous report by Tosetti et al., indicated unidirectional flow toward the basal end.</p><p>Together with other work, this paper leaves us with a good picture which formin drives different actin-mediated processes in plasmodium and toxoplasma parasites. It convincingly shows that Formin-2 plays a central role for most actin-dependent processes in malaria blood stages (including the functions of Formin3 in <italic>T. gondii</italic>) but not the invasion functions which are controlled by Formin-1. A highlight of the paper is the visualisation of F-actin in living malaria parasites, which is also demonstrated in a number of nice time-lapse movies. The actin chromobody will be an excellent tool for further functional studies in this parasite. Overall this is technically very challenging work that includes multiple conditional knock outs and is experimentally sound.</p><p>The only larger concern I have is the cytokinesis phenotype in the Formin-2 KO (but this may be solved by simply changing the text to allow other options). Can the authors exclude that other phenotypes in later trophozoites or early schizonts contribute to the phenotype? Many different cellular defects could lead to the reduced number of nuclei in Figure 6A. In fact, this figure most likely indicates a general developmental delay rather than a specific phenotype. Do the 'slower' cells with less than 5 nuclei in Figure 6A still make it to egress? Or do they have other defects that make them arrest earlier? If they do not reach the late schizont, it may not only be a cell division phenotype. Was Figure 6E done with purified late stages or with all parasites on/off RAP?</p><p>The subsequent experiments (Figure 6B etc.) are then done with purified late stage parasites which consists of the subfraction that makes it to that stage (maybe those parasites where Formin-2 levels dropped more slowly after excision of the gene?). These experiments are important, as they show that the merozoites produced from this subfraction are still invasive and show that the Formin-1 dependent functions are not affected. The experiments are also consistent with the author's conclusion that this signifies a role of Formin-2 in 'coordinate cytokinesis'. However, it does not exclude that Formin-2 may have earlier function in schizogony. Unless all cells on RAP eventually make it to that stage, this may be just one of the phenotypes. This should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is in principle a well performed study investigating actin dynamics in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood stages and <italic>T. gondii</italic> using a fluorescent antibody against actin filaments and a focus on the actin polymerizing protein Formin-2. The authors confirm and expand on recent work published in <italic>eLife</italic> and elsewhere introducing the chromobody, showing the importance of three different formins on actin polymerization in <italic>T. gondii</italic> as well as the finding that actin is important for apicoplast division. There is quite some overlap on the Formin-2 part with the recent paper from the Soldati group, but this should be covered by the scoop protection mechanism offered by <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors do a good job dissecting the differences in the roles of actin in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>.</p><p>This paper improves on the previously published <italic>eLife</italic> article of the same lab by examining for the first time actin dynamics with a chromobody in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and by providing enhanced image analysis, which led to the discovery of a bidirectional cytoplasmic flow of actin filaments.</p><p>I don't have suggestions for additional experiments but maybe the authors can reflect on/discuss the following points:</p><p>It would improve reading experience if the movies would be somehow fused into fewer total movies, if possible â e.g. Video 1, Video 2, Video 3 and Video 4 could be put back to back of each other into a single file.</p><p>Can the structures visualized by the chromobody be bleached to investigate their turnover?</p><p>Does the bi-directional flow observed here compare with the recently reported actin flow in oocysts by the Heisenberg lab (2019)? How does this fit to the data recently published in <italic>eLife</italic>, where actin flows only from front of <italic>T. gondii</italic> to their back?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes a technological breakthrough in the study of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, an organism of great clinical significance, as well as reveals novel details on this organism's actin cytoskeleton, and draws parallels and distinctions for the roles Formin-2 in this organism and the distantly related <italic>T. gondii</italic>. This appears to be the second round of reviews for this manuscript, although this is my first viewing of the manuscript. Overall, I am satisfied with the rigor shown, and with the major conclusions that the authors draw. In particular, I am comfortable with the authors' demonstration that the chromobodies (CB's) are indeed faithfully decorating actin-based structures, and based on their sensitivity to CytoD, agree that these structures are likely F-actin-based. As outlined below, my main concerns regarding this work are the specific wordings used at some places in the manuscript regarding &quot;dynamics&quot;, some omissions or gaps in the figure descriptions that cause confusion, and some missing information regarding the phylogenetic analysis.</p><p>1) The authors frequently use the term &quot;dynamics&quot; when describing actin-based structures. Based on their data, I would agree that many of the structures they view are dynamic in the sense that are mobile (e.g. subsection âF-actin in gametocytesâ). However, &quot;dynamic&quot; with regards to actin also often refers to the degree to which the actin filaments undergo turnover (rounds of polymerization and depolymerization). The authors should review their text and edit where it needs to be made clear which type of dynamics they are discussing. Related to this, the authors claim to show that &quot;islands of F-actin are stabilized upon jasplakinolide treatment (+JAS) (Figure 1C)&quot;, but this is documented only by a still image with large fluorescent bodies. The authors cite Video 3, but there is no +JAS movie on that video, only control and +CytoD. I agree that the authors could interpret their result as being consistent with stabilization of F-actin, but without showing that there is reduced turnover of actin in these structures, they should hedge on their wording some.</p><p>2) I also strongly recommend the authors supplement some of their figures/figure legends to help the reader better interpret the data. In particular:</p><p>For Figure 2Bii, the legend explains the significance of the bottom panels, but not the top four panels. Are they different time points?</p><p>For Figure 3G, the figure legend should provide some more information to help the reader understand the model. That is, &quot;syn&quot;, &quot;loxPint&quot;, and &quot;WR&quot; should be defined. It is a very elegant construct but requires a lot of flipping back and forth between the legend, text, and methods to deconstruct what is going on.</p><p>For Figure 3H, it currently gives the impression that Integrant 1 and Integrant 2 are being analyzed, when in fact it is transformant 1 and transformant 2 that are being analyzed, using a PCR reaction that probes for integration or the endogenous locus. I would suggest clarifying the labels, such as replacing &quot;Integrant&quot; and &quot;Endogen.&quot; with &quot;PCR(Int)&quot; and &quot;PCR(End)&quot; (with clarifications in the legend), and add the label &quot;Transformant:&quot; to the left of &quot;1 2 1 2&quot; above the gels.</p><p>For Figure 4C, the x-axis is confusing to me. Perhaps this is because I do not study <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, but that will be true of a large number of readers.</p><p>For Figure 4D, what are the units for the y-axis? Is it an arbitrary value? A ratio of HA signal to enolase?</p><p>For Figure 7âfigure supplement 1, reproduce the map shown in Figure 7A to help the reader to interpret the PCR results without needing to flip between two figures.</p><p>For Videos 9 â 11, multiple strains are shown simultaneously, but I could not observe any labels that identified which panel in a video corresponded to which strain. This was true when I viewed the movies directly from the website, and when I downloaded the mp4's.</p><p>3) Related to the phylogenetic analysis, Table T2, which lists the genomes that were searched for formins for the phylogenetic analysis, appears to be absent. Also, Figure 3B presents a single tree, but the Materials and methods section refers to &quot;trees&quot; (plural) that were constructed from &quot;this alignment (or subsets of it)&quot;. The authors should clarify this. It would also be appropriate to provide the aligned sequences as a supplementary text file, if possible.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49030.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[â¦] In addition, the view that Formin-2 could play a key role in controlling actin at specific locations during cell cycle is also quite interesting and rather convincingly documented.

All of this can be bolstered (and surely must be?) by expressing the Plasmodium actin</italic> in vitro <italic>and doing some biochemistry. Does CB-EME etc. bind</italic> in vitro <italic>only to polymerised F-actin or does it also form a complex with G-actin? These patches could easily be localised unpolymerized G-actin.</italic> </p><p>We provide several lines of evidence that CB recognises specifically F-actin. First, we use CD and JAS and demonstrate polymerisation and depolymerisation respectively. It can clearly be seen in Figure 1 and Video 3 that all filamentous structures disappear under CD. Second, we also use a genetic disruption of actin-1 and show that filaments disappear. We have now developed and provided a quantitative method (kymograph analysis and local time averaged intensity measurements) to study these actin filaments and the intensity profiles on the graphs in the WT are completely distinct from the intensity profiles of the mutant (see Figure 2F, Figure 8, Figure 2âfigure supplement 2, Figure 8âfigure supplement 2).</p><p>Although the reviewer points out some patches of greater fluorescence under CD treatment, this can easily be explained due to compression effects, since the parasite replicates within a tight parasitophorous vacuole that also contains a dense food vacuole. It is therefore not surprising that the cytosolic signal is not evenly distributed.</p><p>In the case of CB-Halo the background is furthermore increased, since a soluble ligand has to be added for staining that diffuses into the cell.</p><p>While we agree that CD (and Jas treatment) alone is no definite proof for specificity, we also use conditional Act1 and Formin-2 knockout lines and demonstrate that the entire F-actin signal disappears upon removal of the gene proving specificity of CB for F-actin.</p><p>Finally, we would like to point out that CB is a reagent that has been validated and tested in several eukaryotes including its binding to F-actin in the apicomplexan parasite <italic>T. gondii</italic> (see also Periz et al., 2017). This commercial reagent is a well-accepted F-actin sensor and applied in many diverse eukaryotes. It appears to be especially well suited to visualise highly dynamic F-actin structures, such as nuclear F-actin (see Melak et al., 2017) or apicomplexan F-actin (Periz et al., 2017; Tosetti et al., 2019).</p><p>As a final biochemical proof, in the study âReconstitution of the core of the malaria parasite glideosome with recombinant Plasmodium class XIV myosin A and Plasmodium actinâ by Bookwalter et al., (2017), the authors provide evidence for binding of Plasmodium actin filaments to actin-binding chromobodies.</p><p>In this respect, we would like to mention a recent, competing study, published in <italic>eLife</italic> that used our reagents (see acknowledgement of Tosetti et al., 2019), the CB in Toxoplasma and reaches similar conclusions regarding Formin-2 and F-actin dynamics in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (Tosetti et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the large background seen after Cytochalasin B as well as in the normal cells one needs some quantitative statements about comparative camera settings for image capture comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed cutting edge imaging and we did correct for background, used the same camera settings and exposure times.

Can the authors exclude that other phenotypes in later trophozoites or early schizonts contribute to the phenotype? Many different cellular defects could lead to the reduced number of nuclei in Figure 6A. In fact, this figure most likely indicates a general developmental delay rather than a specific phenotype. Do the 'slower' cells with less than 5 nuclei in Figure 6A still make it to egress? Or do they have other defects that make them arrest earlier? If they do not reach the late schizont, it may not only be a cell division phenotype. Was Figure 6E done with purified late stages or with all parasites on/off RAP?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments and the critical reading of the manuscript. Data in Figures 6D and E are from experiments done with purified late stage parasites. The sentence in subsection âDiCre-mediated disruption of Formin-2 abrogates the actin network in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> schizontsâ has been modified to clarify this. At this point we cannot rule out that additional defects in the late trophozoites cause a developmental delay. For example, it could be possible that actin plays a role in uptake of host cell material, as previously suggested. We are currently performing experiments to analyse this possibility in more detail and this will be subject to a later study.</p><p>We have changed the text to reflect this (see subsection âDiCre-mediated conditional disruption of Formin-2 affects daughter cell formation / cytokinesis in <italic>P. falciparumâ</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The subsequent experiments (Figure 6B etc.) are then done with purified late stage parasites which consists of the subfraction that makes it to that stage (maybe those parasites where Formin-2 levels dropped more slowly after excision of the gene?). These experiments are important, as they show that the merozoites produced from this subfraction are still invasive and show that the Formin-1 dependent functions are not affected. The experiments are also consistent with the author's conclusion that this signifies a role of Formin-2 in 'coordinate cytokinesis'. However, it does not exclude that Formin-2 may have earlier function in schizogony. Unless all cells on RAP eventually make it to that stage, this may be just one of the phenotypes. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added explanatory sentences that a role for PfFRM2 earlier in schizogony cannot be ruled out (subsection âDiCre-mediated conditional disruption of Formin-2 affects daughter cell formation / cytokinesis in <italic>P. falciparumâ</italic>).

It is conceivable that actin polymerization and hence flow derived forces set up by Formins aid in particle segregation, specifically as we observe for segregation of the apicoplast, and as has already been highlighted in our model in Figure 9. We have now added the Shamipour et al., reference to our Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How does this fit to the data recently published in eLife, where actin flows only from front of T. gondii to their back?</p></disp-quote><p>Most recently, Tosetti and co-workers published their investigation of the three actin nucleation factors in Toxoplasma (Tosetti et al., 2019). This study shows that TgFormin1 does not majorly contribute to intracellular actin dynamics. Instead, TgFormin1 appears critical for motility, invasion and egress of extracellular parasites. Results presented by Tosetti and colleagues regarding TgFormin-2 are in good agreement with data presented here.</p><p>TgFormin1-mediated actin nucleation was described to be critical for maintaining actin flow in extracellular parasites (Tosetti et al., 2019). According to live microscopy studies of moving and non-moving extracellular parasites, actin appears to accumulate at the basal end of the parasite, indicating actin flow from the apical to the basal pole. Tosetti and co-workers suggest that actin translocation to the basal pole happens along the parasite periphery (Tosetti et al., 2019). Our study provides experimental evidence that the parasite periphery represents one site of increased actin abundance during intracellular growth. Actin flow appears bi-directional along the periphery in intracellular parasites and is fuelled by TgFormin-2-mediated actin polymerisation.</p><p>In conclusion, it appears that the peripheral actin flow depends on TgFormin1 in extracellular parasites while depending strongly on TgFormin-2 in intracellular parasites. The one-directional actin flow to the basal end in extracellular parasites was proposed to mediate parasite motility (Tosetti et al., 2019). In intracellular parasites, when actin does not promote parasite movement, bi-directional actin flow could be involved in a vast variety of cellular processes. Research elucidating these processes is on-going in our laboratory. At this point of time, we are hypothesising that bi-directional actin flow might, amongst other things, allow for particle trafficking within replicating parasites.</p><p>We have already discussed this in various parts of the manuscript.

Based on their data, I would agree that many of the structures they view are dynamic in the sense that are mobile (e.g. subsection âF-actin in gametocytesâ). However, &quot;dynamic&quot; with regards to actin also often refers to the degree to which the actin filaments undergo turnover (rounds of polymerization and depolymerization). The authors should review their text and edit where it needs to be made clear which type of dynamics they are discussing. Related to this, the authors claim to show that &quot;islands of F-actin are stabilized upon jasplakinolide treatment (+JAS) (Figure 1C)&quot;, but this is documented only by a still image with large fluorescent bodies. The authors cite Video 3, but there is no +JAS movie on that video, only control and +CytoD. I agree that the authors could interpret their result as being consistent with stabilization of F-actin, but without showing that there is reduced turnover of actin in these structures, they should hedge on their wording some.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments.
