Here, we show that quantitative information about food abundance is encoded by combinatorial neuron-specific gene-expression of conserved TGFβ and serotonin pathway components in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Crosstalk and auto-regulation between these pathways alters the shape, dynamic range, and population variance of the gene-expression responses of <italic>daf-7</italic> (TGFβ) and <italic>tph-1</italic> (tryptophan hydroxylase) to food availability. These intricate regulatory features provide distinct mechanisms for TGFβ and serotonin signaling to tune the accuracy of this multi-neuron code: <italic>daf-7</italic> primarily regulates gene-expression variability, while <italic>tph-1</italic> primarily regulates the dynamic range of gene-expression responses. This code is functional because <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> mutations bidirectionally attenuate food level-dependent changes in lifespan. Our results reveal a neural code for food abundance and demonstrate that gene expression serves as an additional layer of information processing in the nervous system to control long-term physiology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06259.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06259.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06259.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To maximize their chances of survival, animals need to be able to sense changes in the abundance of food in their environment and respond in an appropriate manner. The nervous system is able to sense cues from the environment and coordinate responses in the whole organism, but it is not clear how this leads to long-term changes in the organism's biology.</p><p>In nematode worms, two genes called <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> appear to be involved in connecting the sensing of food availability with changes in the biology of the organism. The <italic>daf-7</italic> gene encodes a hormone, while <italic>tph-1</italic> encodes an enzyme that makes a neurochemical called serotonin.</p><p>Here, Entchev, Patel, Zhan et al. found that <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> genes are active in three pairs of neurons in nematode worms. The experiments show that these neurons collectively form a circuit that carries information about the abundance of food, which leads to changes in how long the worms live. When this circuit was disrupted by removing these genes, the worms' ability to adjust their lifespan in response to changes in the availability of food was weakened, likely because they were unable to sense food. The experiments also show that the circuit regulates itself, largely because <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> are able to control each-other's activity.</p><p>Together, these results suggest that changing the activity of certain genes in neurons enables nematode worms to alter their biology in response to changes in the availability of food. Neurons in the brain use electrical activity to communicate and process information and Entchev, Patel, Zhan et al.'s findings imply that gene activity can also perform a similar role.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06259.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06259.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neural code</kwd><kwd>dietary restriction</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>expression variability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Grant 087146</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ch'ng</surname><given-names>QueeLim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/H020500/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ch'ng</surname><given-names>QueeLim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NeuroAge 242666</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ch'ng</surname><given-names>QueeLim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM088333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0954578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG035317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0946809 GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhan</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P40 OD010440)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TGFβ and serotonin signaling in a neural circuit encodes food availability; these signals regulate the dynamic range and variability on the circuit to impact coding accuracy and lifespan responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All organisms need to accurately assess their environment to respond to changes that impact their survival. Environmental changes such as food availability can lead to alterations in organismal physiology, such as stress resistance and metabolic states that have consequences for clinically important outputs such as disease progression, health, fecundity and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Libert and Pletcher, 2007</xref>). Many conserved genetic mechanisms that govern these alterations to physiology have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Libert and Pletcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berthoud and Morrison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rother et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcedo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koch and Horvath, 2014</xref>). Yet, how these genetic pathways encode and process information about the environment to elicit physiological outputs in vivo is unclear at a quantitative and mechanistic level, despite their importance for health and disease.</p><p>In animals, the nervous system is the central site for processing sensory information and coordinates organism-wide responses to changing conditions. Food availability is a critical environmental variable that modulates metabolism and other physiological outputs via neuroendocrine circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berthoud and Morrison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rother et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcedo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koch and Horvath, 2014</xref>). In contrast to well-studied sensory modalities such as vision and olfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilson, 2013</xref>), where neural processing occurs on short timescales using electrical signals, how food availability is internally represented across a broad range of inputs to regulate long-term, food-related physiological responses remains virtually unknown. A particularly interesting food-related response is the role of dietary restriction (DR) in modulating lifespan in diverse species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mair and Dillin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fontana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alic and Partridge, 2011</xref>). DR occurs through changes that likely happen over long timescales (hours to days), unlike fast behavioral responses to visual or olfactory cues. Neural gene expression also occurs over long timescales (minutes to hours) and is thus well suited for functionally encoding food abundance during DR.</p><p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> are conserved components of neural TGFβ and serotonin signaling pathways, respectively, and are associated with food sensing and modulation of organismal physiology. <italic>daf-7</italic> encodes a TGFβ family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 1996</xref>), while <italic>tph-1</italic> encodes tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sze et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, TGFβ and serotonin signaling affect lifespan and metabolism, consistent with conserved roles from invertebrates to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sze et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashrafi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murakami and Murakami, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petrascheck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shaw et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown and Schneyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oury and Karsenty, 2011</xref>). <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> are expressed in an environmentally responsive manner in specific neurons with food-related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schackwitz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sze et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pocock and Hobert, 2010</xref>). <italic>daf-7</italic> is expressed in the ASI sensory neurons, whose activities are responsive to bacterial food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gallagher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zaslaver et al., 2015</xref>). Starvation reduces <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASI, and laser ablations of ASI extend lifespan, consistent with the role of <italic>daf-7</italic> and other ASI-expressed genes in modulating lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcedo and Kenyon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</xref>). <italic>tph-1</italic> is expressed in the NSM foregut neurons, the ADF sensory neurons, and the HSN motorneurons involved in egg-laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sze et al., 2000</xref>). Both serotonin signaling mutants and NSM ablation affect food-modulated locomotion, consistent with the idea that serotonin from NSM acts in this food-related response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>). In the food-responsive ADF neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zaslaver et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>tph-1</italic> expression is responsive to pathogenic bacteria and starvation, to respectively mediate aversive olfactory plasticity and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p><italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> are therefore strong candidates for mediating the link between environmental cues and longevity. Nonetheless, how these genes cooperate to quantitatively encode a broad range of food levels to modulate lifespan is unknown. Gene-expression responses to food cues have largely been studied as ON/OFF switches to the presence or absence of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zinke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baugh et al., 2009</xref>). Because food abundance is a continuous variable, we sought to understand how expression of <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> could allow animals to distinguish multiple food levels. Furthermore, gene expression is inherently variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eldar and Elowitz, 2010</xref>), but this property is rarely studied in vivo in multicellular animals; thus we also sought to determine how gene-expression variability affects the ability of the worm to encode its environment.</p><p>Here we show that <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> expression in three pairs of neurons forms a distributed circuit that quantitatively encodes food abundance and mediates dietary effects on lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Specific disruptions to this circuit resulted in corresponding attenuation in the ability to discriminate between food levels in both the gene-expression code and lifespan output. We found that this circuit tunes its own accuracy, largely via the regulation of the dynamic range and variability of food-responsive gene expression by <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> signalling, respectively. Our work suggests that neural regulation of gene expression in conserved pathways can couple environmental sensation to physiological output, and highlights a novel mechanism for information processing by the nervous system to impact physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two neuronal genes mediate bidirectional effects of DR on lifespan</title><p>During DR, lifespan increases as food levels are decreased from <italic>ad libitum</italic> conditions until reaching a maximum, beyond which further food reduction lowers lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mair and Dillin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fontana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alic and Partridge, 2011</xref>).

This graded response contrasts with many switch-like pathways, such as MAP kinase signalling, that produce outputs with a finite number of (usually two) stable states, where the population responds to changing environmental conditions by shifting sub-populations of cells from one state to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferrell, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Since gene expression may be used to internally represent environmental conditions and mediate long-term physiological outputs such as longevity, we next asked to what extent expression in individual neurons correlates with lifespan across food levels.

While the graded and non-monotonic encoding scheme may allow discrimination among certain intermediate food levels, the discriminatory ability was also limited by variation in the responses.</p><p>To determine if the accuracy of gene expression was suitable for modulating lifespan, we next assessed how accurately the lifespan distributions could be used to infer the food level using a similar decoding procedure. This analysis is important because the accuracy of the output sets constraints for the accuracy required in the internal representation. Ideally, the accuracy of both the representation and output should be similar, so that the representation carries sufficient information for the output. In this decoding analysis, we assessed whether lifespan could also be used to infer the food level experienced by an individual, using estimators based on the Weibull distribution of our survival data. Remarkably, the inferential accuracy of lifespan was similar to that of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that neuronal gene expression captured sufficient information about food levels to mediate corresponding lifespan outputs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Self- and cross-regulation between <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> shape gene-expression responses to food</title><p>Prior work suggested that <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> cross-regulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sze et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we explored the possibility that the internal representation based on <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in wildtype animals emerges from their mutual regulation. Because our reporter transgenes were distinct from the endogenous genes, we were able to measure reporter expression in <italic>tph-1(−)</italic> and <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> single and double mutants, which could reveal self- and cross-regulatory interactions. These measurements of reporter expression across six food levels uncovered new and extensive regulatory relationships between <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> that were neuron-specific and food-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). First, <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> and <italic>tph-1(−)</italic> mutants had non-redundant phenotypes, indicating that they acted in parallel pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Second, we observed crosstalk between <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic>. Loss of <italic>daf-7</italic> signalling affected <italic>tph-1</italic> expression in both NSM and ADF neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left and middle) while loss of <italic>tph-1</italic> affected <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASI neuron at higher bacterial concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right).

First, the regulation between <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> shaped their responses to food. The relatively monotonic increase in <italic>tph-1</italic> expression in ADF with bacterial concentration in wildtype animals was specified by <italic>daf-7</italic> regulation; in <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> mutants, the response of <italic>tph-1</italic> in ADF became more non-monotonic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, middle). The non-monotonic response of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASI was also altered by the loss of <italic>daf-7</italic> auto-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right). Since a non-monotonic encoding scheme provides theoretical advantages in representing the range of inputs (above), changes in the shape of these responses could impact how efficiently food is represented.</p><p>Second, these regulatory interactions also affected the dynamic range of the gene-expression profiles. Amplification of dynamic range may contribute to increased encoding capability by increasing separation of gene-expression signals. Compared to wildtype, mutations in <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> increased the dynamic range of <italic>tph-1</italic> expression in NSM but not in ADF, while the <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> mutation dramatically decreased the dynamic range of <italic>daf-7</italic> in ASI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>).</p><p>Third, besides affecting average gene expression, the <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> mutation also had a strong effect on the inter-individual variance of each gene-expression distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast to the effects of dynamic range, increasing inter-individual variation degrades encoding capability by increasing overlap between gene-expression signals. At several food levels, <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> mutants increased the variance of <italic>tph-1</italic> expression compared to the wildtype or the <italic>tph-1(−)</italic> single mutant, whilst the <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> mutation reduced the variance of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This result provided an interesting example of regulated inter-individual variability in gene expression that is associated with a physiological output in a metazoan. Thus, the shape, dynamic range and inter-individual variance of the gene-expression responses could all be regulated by interactions between <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Regulatory interactions between <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> tune encoding fidelity</title><p>To understand the multifaceted effects of <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> signalling on fidelity, we computed the encoding accuracy of neuronal gene expression in <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> and <italic>tph-1(−)</italic> mutants using the same maximum likelihood framework as applied to the wildtype animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>tph-1(−)</italic> mutants showed increased encoding capability in all readouts while <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> mutants demonstrated consistently diminished fidelity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), consistent with their respective effects on dynamic range and the variability of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>). The intermediate encoding capability of the double mutants reflects the additive effects of the mutations with regard to encoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5B,C, 6A</xref>). As with wildtype animals, combining information from multiple neurons tended to increase the accuracy in these mutants and <italic>tph-1</italic> expression in the NSM and ADF neurons accounted for the majority of this representational capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results showed that <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> served mechanistically distinct and opposing roles in modulating the fidelity of this food representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Whilst the transcriptional responses of <italic>daf-7</italic> itself added little encoding capability overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4D, 6B</xref>), its regulatory role in reducing gene-expression variability facilitated the encoding power of <italic>tph-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Conversely, <italic>tph-1</italic> outputs served a major encoding role in the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), but its regulatory effect decreased the dynamic range of transcriptional responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and limited the encoding accuracy of the system in wildtype animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

For example, in <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> mutants, <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASI did not yield a functional protein that could mediate physiological outputs. When we accounted for the loss of the corresponding functional genetic outputs in the mutants, the overall functional representational capability was consistently diminished in comparison to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The loss of representational capability in either <italic>tph-1(−)</italic> or <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> mutants confirms that these genes have non-redundant encoding functions via two distinct mechanisms. <italic>tph-1(−)</italic> mutants showed diminished functional representation primarily due to loss of <italic>tph-1</italic> as a functional output whereas <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> mutants showed diminished functional representation primarily due to increased variability in <italic>tph-1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B,E</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, we found corresponding decreases in the accuracy of both the functional representations and lifespan outputs when <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> were mutated (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). This result is consistent with the disruption in internal representation and the reduction in lifespan-responsiveness to food in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). We note that <italic>tph-1(−)</italic>; <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> double mutants retained some response to food levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig6">Figures 1C, 6F</xref>) indicating the existence of additional unknown gene(s) that encode food. Nonetheless, the significant and correlated effects of mutating <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> on the accuracy of both gene-expression and lifespan readouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>) strongly indicate that <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> act as a substantial part of a multi-neuron system linking environment to lifespan.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that food abundance is functionally encoded in vivo in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by the combinatorial expression of <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> in three neuron pairs. Lifespan increases and decreases as a function of food abundance. The phenotypes of <italic>tph-1(−)</italic> and <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> mutants reveal that rather than serving intrinsic roles in lifespan extension, serotonin and TGFβ are signals required for bidirectional food-dependent lifespan changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This bidirectional phenotype was only revealed by analysis of lifespan across a very broad range of food levels. Many genes have been implicated in lifespan modulation or DR-related responses; a systematic analysis under additional conditions may provide new insights on their roles in food-dependent responses. That <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> act in food-responsive sensory neurons, together with the bidirectional attenuation of lifespan responses in the single and double mutants suggests that loss of <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> impairs the ability to sense and/or convey information about food levels, leading to a flattened response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This interpretation is further supported by the observations that loss of <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> reduced the dynamic range of lifespan responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and lowered the accuracy of food level representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> have established functional connections to conserved pathways for regulating metabolism, cellular maintenance, reproduction and longevity, such as the insulin/IGF pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shaw et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Narasimhan et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, this internal perception of food availability may facilitate the coordination of energy utilization and appropriate physiological and behavioral responses to optimize survival in variable environments.</p><p>How much information is conveyed by <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic>? Several results indicate that <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> account for a substantial if not the majority of the food response in lifespan modulation. First, loss of both <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> reduced the dynamic range of the lifespan response to food by ∼60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Second, the decoding analysis, which systematically considers the overlap between multiple response distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), showed that much of the information about food levels is lost in the <italic>tph-1(−)</italic>; <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> double mutant: the predictive accuracy of the lifespan response drops to 5% above random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Third, the predictive accuracy of gene expression and lifespan are heterogeneous—certain food levels were correctly predicted with far higher accuracy (&gt;75%) than the average accuracy (see decoding matrices in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4D, 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This heterogeneous performance is due in part to non-monotonic expression responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), as some food levels lead to similar responses. Fourth, it is important to note that an encoding system only needs to match the accuracy of the output to be good enough for regulating a biological process. The mean accuracy of lifespan responses to food thus provides a biologically relevant limit on the required performance for encoding food levels. In this light, the comparable mean accuracy between <italic>daf-7</italic>/<italic>tph-1</italic> gene expression and lifespan indicates that the performance of the coding system is well suited to the accuracy of the process it modulates. Fifth, we found corresponding drops in the predictive accuracy of both gene expression and lifespan across <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> and <italic>tph-1(−)</italic> mutants (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). This result is particularly remarkable because the predictive accuracy depends on not just the means but also variances. While these results support the idea that <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> functionally encode significant information about food levels, the <italic>tph-1(−)</italic>; <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> double mutant still retains some information about food, as shown by its lifespan response to food and its predictive accuracy of food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig6">Figures 1C, 6F</xref>). Therefore additional molecule(s) exist that cooperate with <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> in food encoding. These may include previously characterized DR regulators or undiscovered genes.</p><p>Our findings provide a more nuanced view of the interactions between the serotoninergic and TGFβ neuroendocrine systems. Genetic epistasis between <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> had suggested that these two genes functioned in the same pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sze et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2006</xref>). Our results indicate that <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> are likely to act in parallel to modulate lifespan in response to food, and that their mutual regulation represents crosstalk between these two pathways. First, we found that their epistatic relationships are food-dependent rather than hard-wired. This result is reminiscent of another food-dependent epistasis between neuropeptide and catecholamine receptors (<italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>tyra-3</italic> respectively) that act in <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bendesky et al., 2011</xref>). Perhaps crosstalk during sensory processing leads to more complex genetic interactions. Second, <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> play distinct regulatory roles in shaping the food representation and tuning discriminatory power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5D, 6D</xref>; discussed below). Third, <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> show additive phenotypes in both gene-expression responses and predictive accuracy of lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5A, 6F</xref>). Since the predictive accuracy reflects the information content on food, the additive loss indicates that <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> carry non-redundant information about food abundance. Together, these results point to parallel rather than sequential signalling for serotonin and TGFβ.</p><p>Conceptually, the genetic regulation between serotonin and TGFβ is similar to feed-forward and feedback regulatory architectures that occur in other neural circuits operating on a shorter time-scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilson, 2013</xref>), and analogous mechanisms to regulate information transduction may be used for different sensory modalities. Different regulatory interactions between <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> modulate encoding capacity in specific ways, revealing novel system-level roles for these interactions. <italic>tph-1</italic> activity limits the dynamic range, and consequently the representative capacity of <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in response to food. It is possible that the increased dynamic range of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in <italic>tph-1(−)</italic> animals may partially compensate for the loss of <italic>tph-1</italic> as a major functional encoder. Surprisingly, <italic>tph-1</italic> self-regulation indicates that <italic>tph-1</italic> and serotonin signaling is likely to self-limit representative capacity by reducing the dynamic range. In contrast, the cross-regulatory effect of <italic>daf-7</italic> is necessary to reduce variability in <italic>tph-1</italic> expression, which represents a new component of <italic>tph-1</italic> expression that is regulated by <italic>daf-7</italic>. The parity in encoding performance between <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> expression and lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>), along with the attenuation of lifespan response in the mutants, suggests that this neuronal representation has major functional information-carrying capacity. Distributing a combinatorial code across multiple neurons with distinct responses ensures robustness of signal fidelity against variability in each neuron-type, analogous to population codes in certain sensory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singer and Gray, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, a distributed code enables multicellular organisms to implement additional layers of regulation unavailable to unicellular organisms.</p><p>Inter-individual variability in gene expression has been extensively studied in single cell systems where it plays key roles in diverse processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eldar and Elowitz, 2010</xref>). By measuring this variation in neurons using high-throughput quantitative microscopy, we highlight implications of this variability in encoding food levels in nervous system, which have not been extensively explored in intact animals and are likely to be generalizable to other neural processes. First, gene-expression variability limits the accuracy of neural food representations. Second, this variability can be regulated, as shown by the role of TGFβ in reducing variability in serotonin signaling to increase fidelity. Third, in this TGFβ and serotonin circuit, the effects of variability are tempered by the dynamic range of responses (which can reduce the overlap between broad distributions) and by the use of multiple neurons. Thus, the overall fidelity of information processing is shaped at least in part by an interplay of variability and other parameters.</p><p>Neural encoding has traditionally been studied in the context of short-term electrical activity. However, activity-dependent transcription has been studied in diverse forms of neural plasticity that impact behavior, learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flavell and Greenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pocock and Hobert, 2010</xref>). Our results suggest that gene expression in a multi-neuron system can also encode food abundance to tune physiological states at longer time scales. In general, the complexity of gene-expression responses, such as those observed in the songbird forebrain during song communication, suggest that such responses can perform computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clayton, 2013</xref>). It is likely that additional layers of computation in the nervous system, such as the gene-expression encoding shown here, are necessary to mediate longer-term behavior and physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain construction and transgenesis</title><p>The following parental strains were used to generate all other used in this study: N2 (wildtype), QL101 <italic>tph-1(n4622)</italic> II, QL282 <italic>daf-7(ok3125)</italic> III, EG6701 <italic>ttTi4348</italic> I; <italic>unc-119(ed3)</italic> III; <italic>oxEx1580</italic>, EG6699 <italic>ttTi5605</italic> II; <italic>unc-119(ed3)</italic> III; <italic>oxEx1578</italic>.

We used a recombineering pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sarov et al., 2006</xref>) to replace the coding sequence of the target gene in the fosmid with either mCherry or Venus.

The <italic>tph-1</italic> ADF- and NSM-expression constructs were from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al. (2005)</xref>.

The supplemental information in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al. (2006)</xref> showed that serotonin levels in ADF were reduced in animals starved for 8 hr. We further verified that serotonin levels in NSM of wild type adults were also reduced after food deprivation, in agreement with the behavior of the <italic>Ptph-1::mCherry</italic> reporter. The serotonin levels were determined by anti-serotonin immunofluorescence staining in 4 day old adult worms. Worms subjected to our DR protocol at two food levels (no food and 6 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml) were used for immunostaining using an anti-serotonin primary antibody (Immunostar Inc., Hudson, WI) and Alexa594 coupled secondary antibody as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loer and Kenyon, 1993</xref>). Day 4 adults deprived of bacteria showed less serotonin staining (1.19 ± 0.29 AU; n = 26) than those exposed to 6 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml of bacteria (1.94 ± 0.28 AU; n = 21); these differences were significant (p = 1.38 × 10<sup>−11</sup>; Students T-Test). <italic>daf-7</italic> reporters have been previously validated by experiments showing corresponding changes in both <italic>daf-7::GFP</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> mRNA when switching from starved to fed states, under pheromone induction of dauer, and during exit of dauer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 1996</xref>). In particular, <italic>daf-7</italic> is down-regulated upon starvation, and both <italic>daf-7::GFP</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> mRNA levels increase when starved animals are fed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 1996</xref>), consistent with our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>For expression studies in middle-aged adults used in this study, we found that using fluorescent reporters was the most reliable method. <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> are expressed in a small number of cells, resulting in very low mRNA levels that were not reliably measured by real-time quantitative PCR because the signals were close to background (data not shown). Furthermore, procedures for whole-mount immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loer and Kenyon, 1993</xref>) and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raj et al., 2008</xref>) resulted in high background fluorescence that precluded accurate measurements in older adults using these methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Bacterial cultures for DR</title><p>Our DR protocol was derived from two previously published methods for DR on agar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ching and Hsu, 2011</xref>). After growing of <italic>E. coli</italic> (OP50) overnight in LB at 37°C shaking, the bacterial cultures were shocked with streptomycin at 50 μg/ml for 30 min whilst shaking and then chilled on ice for 15 min before being centrifuged at 4500×<italic>g</italic> for 25 min. The supernatant was then decanted and the bacteria were resuspended in S Basal containing streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The volume of S Basal + streptomycin required for resuspension was determined by measuring the OD<sub>600</sub> of a 10-fold dilution of the overnight culture prior to centrifugation and then calculating the volume required to give the resuspended culture a theoretical OD<sub>600</sub> of 56, which corresponds to a total cell count (live + dead) of ∼1 × 10<sup>10</sup> cells/ml. Serial dilutions of this high-density stock were used to derive all subsequent bacterial concentrations. Stocks were stored at 4°C until plates were ready to seed. We used NGM plates supplemented with both streptomycin and carbenicillin, each at 50 μg/ml. The use of dual antibiotics ensured that bacteria were unable to proliferate on the agar plates. Plates were seeded with a dispensing pipette to ensure that all plates received an equal volume of liquid. Plates were typically seeded 2–3 days in advance to allow the bacterial lawns to dry out before worms were put on the plates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> culture for lifespans</title><p>Many <italic>C. elegans</italic> ageing studies use fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FuDR) to inhibit the germline of experimental animals in order to eliminate progeny that may otherwise confound analyses.

We observed similar lifespan responses for wildtype animals in experiments where <italic>egg-5(RNAi)</italic> was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, we also observed similar lifespan responses under dietary deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaeberlein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2006</xref>) and at the intermediate to high food levels where lifespans have been measured in other publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Greer and Brunet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greer et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Lifespan assays were performed on 6 cm CellStar (Greiner Bio-One, UK) plates at density of 15 worms that were passaged to fresh plates by manual transfer using a platinum wire pick. To avoid physical damage to the worms during transfer, animals were floated off the pick by immersing it into a 10 μl droplet of S Basal + streptomycin on the surface of the new plate. NGM agar plates containing carbenicillin and streptomycin were always seeded with a single 225 μl aliquot of the appropriate bacterial concentration resuspended in S Basal + streptomycin, while plates with 0 cells/ml, equivalent to dietary deprivation, were seeded with S Basal + streptomycin as a control.</p><p>Animals for all strains were raised on live OP50 bacteria for two generations at 20°C. Synchronized L4-stage progeny of the F2 parents were manually transferred to NGM plates supplemented with 1 mM IPTG and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin that were seeded with HT115 bacteria expressing dsRNA targeting <italic>egg-5</italic>. Animals were exposed to <italic>egg-5</italic> RNAi for 24 hr before being transferred to NGM + streptomycin + carbenicillin plates seeded with our baseline food concentration of 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/ml. On day 2 of adulthood, animals were shifted to the desired DR food level and temperature and then transferred at regular intervals to fresh plates until day 14 of adulthood according to a defined scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We initiated DR on day 2 adults because it had an intermediate effect on lifespan as compared to initiation on day 1, 3, and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We reasoned this intermediate effect served as a potentially more sensitive window to detect factors that modify food responses, as the effects of food were non-saturating (unlike the effect of day 3 DR initiation, which was indistinguishable from day 4 DR initiation). Animals were scored for movement upon gentle prodding with a wire pick; failure of response was scored as death. Animals were scored for death at every transfer point and then daily after the last transfer point. Lifespans were subjected to Kaplan–Meier analysis and significance was assessed using both Log-Rank and Wilcoxon tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> culture for imaging</title><p>Animals in imaging experiments were cultured on 10 cm CellStar (Greiner Bio-One) to allow for a higher number of worms (∼100) than lifespan assays. For quantitative imaging, animals were grown and subjected to DR under identical conditions to those assayed for lifespan, except that animals were washed from plate to plate with the same schedule instead of manual transfers. Due to the greater number of worms in these assays, animals were transferred between plates by washing with S Basal + streptomycin. 10 cm plates were seeded with five 225 μl aliquots of bacteria or S Basal + streptomycin in a cross-like formation.</p><p>In our initial imaging experiments using the <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> reporters in a wildtype background, L1-stage larvae were synchronized collecting animals that hatched in a 2-hr window and transferring them to fresh 10 cm NGM plates seeded with OP50 at 20°C. These animals were then harvested 36 hr later once they had reached the L4 stage and washed on to plates for <italic>egg-5</italic> RNAi. After 24 hr on the RNAi plates the animals were washed to the baseline food level of 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/ml for 1 day before the initiation of DR on the second day of adulthood.

Animals were suspended in S Basal + streptomycin on day 6 of adulthood and introduced into our custom microfluidic device via pressure driven flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crane et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, microfluidic devices were manufactured in polydimethylsiloxane using standard multilayer soft lithographic techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Unger et al., 2000</xref>) and covalently bonded to a glass coverslip via oxygen plasma treatment. On the device, individual animals were sequentially directed into and trapped within an imaging channel gated by pressure-driven on-chip valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Unger et al., 2000</xref>) under the control of custom LabVIEW software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Dense, 2-micron fluorescent z-stacks through head of each worm were collected using a standard epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope) with a 40× oil objective (1.3 NA) and a Hamamatsu Orca R2 camera. Red and green fluorescent intensities for each of our fluorescent reporters were collected simultaneously using an Optosplit II emission splitter and stored for analysis. We automated the image acquisition and image processing using custom LabVIEW and MATLAB scripts; the analysis software is deposited at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/meizhan/SVMelegans">https://github.com/meizhan/SVMelegans</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image processing</title><p>Z stacks from our quantitative imaging studies were loaded into MATLAB to be analyzed for single-cell expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To identify neuron-pairs and their locations within the imaging plane, maximum projections were computed and a thresholding algorithm was utilized to locate individual fluorescent cells. Identifications of the cells were then computed based on relative distances and locations within the worm head. For quantification, the three dimensional volume around each cellular location was extracted from the full z-stack and intensity was integrated over a consistent number of the brightest pixels, which fully encapsulate the entire cell in all cases. To avoid potential interference from condition-specific changes in the gut auto-fluorescence, the background intensity was calculated for cell pairs near the gut (ADF, ASI), via estimation of the mode of the intensity distribution in a volume around the neuron. This background intensity value was subtracted from the integrated fluorescence to obtain the final output.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Decoding analysis</title><p>To estimate the ability of our gene-expression readouts and lifespan responses to encode information about the food inputs, we applied a Bayes classifier with fivefold cross validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dayan and Abbott, 2005</xref>). To do this we randomly segmented the data into five test groups. For each test group, we computed expression or lifespan probability distributions for each food level based on the remaining data (the training set). We employed a multivariate Gaussian distribution to fit the expression data and a Weibull distribution for lifespan data. Using these probability distributions, we then calculated the conditional probability that each member of the test group had their particular expression or lifespan output if they had been subjected to each of the food levels. The accuracy of these raw probability values can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> panels A, C, E and G. To make a final inference about the food level each worm was subjected to, the animal was assumed to have come from the food level with the highest conditional probability. The encoding accuracy of this maximum likelihood model can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> panels B, D, F, and H. As with all measurements of variance, these accuracy estimates should be considered as lower bounds due to experimental noise.</p><p>In the decoding analysis for expression data, we limited the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> to animals with corresponding data from all three neuron pairs (<italic>N</italic> ≥ 726 for WT, <italic>N</italic> ≥ 110 for <italic>tph-1(−)</italic>, <italic>N</italic> ≥ 83 for <italic>daf-7(−)</italic> and <italic>N</italic> ≥ 54 for <italic>tph-1(−)</italic>;<italic>daf-7(−)</italic> for each food level).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Oliver Hobert (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your manuscript characterized the correlation between the abundance of environmental food availability, lifespan and neuronal expression levels of tryptophan hydroxylase gene <italic>tph-1</italic> and TGF-beta <italic>daf-7</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Neuronal influence on longevity is an important research area, thus this work is of significance. Although the effects of food signals on <italic>tph-1::gfp</italic> and <italic>daf-7::gfp</italic> expression and 5-HT and <italic>DAF-7</italic> on ageing have been studied before, this work provides several novel insights, by generating single copy <italic>tph-1::gfp</italic> and <italic>daf-7::gfp</italic> transgenic lines and systematically monitoring the expression levels in animals grown on a wide-range of <italic>E. coli</italic> food concentrations. The elegant experimental approach and detailed analysis are the strength of this paper.</p><p>However, there are a number of concerns about data interpretation that we ask you to fix in a revised version of the manuscript. In no order of importance:</p><p>1) One concern pertain to what seem to be modest phenotypic effects of <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> mutations on life span in the presence of food (with preservation of the bidirectional influence of varying food concentrations on life span), a relatively low predictive accuracy of reporter gene expression, and the low magnitude of changes in reporter gene expression observed (both in wild-type animals over the range of food concentrations tested and in <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> mutant animals compared to wild-type animals). These observations lead me to wonder if the authors are focusing on molecules that play an ancillary role in representing food abundance, to the exclusion of undiscovered molecules that are more central to this process. This should be discussed.</p><p>2) The authors repeatedly argued that 5-HT and <italic>DAF-7</italic> act in parallel to modulate the lifespan. However, a double mutation of <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> did not produce an additive ageing phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Please discuss.</p><p>3) The authors made great efforts to establish differential expression <italic>of tph-1::gfp</italic> in ADF and NSM, particularly when worms grown on very high concentrations of <italic>E. coli</italic> food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3-5</xref>). While the results are very interesting, the differential <italic>tph-1</italic> expression does not appear to play a central role in ageing. First, transgenic expression of <italic>tph-1</italic> in ADF or NSM restored the lifespan as a function of food availability. Second, there is no indication that the expression levels of those transgenes are modulated by food availability. Thus food restriction-induced changes in <italic>tph-1</italic> expression probably influence other 5-HT signaling pathways but not the ageing processes.</p><p>4) Why do <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> mutants cause extension of lifespan at some food concentrations but reduce it at others? Please discuss.</p><p>5) The sole reliance on gene expression, while a reasonable start, is arbitrary. After-all proper <italic>DAF-7</italic> and serotonin signal regulations depend on everything from gene expression to their secretions as well as additional regulatory steps when their cognate receptors are engaged. Therefore the claim that gene expression should be taken as a direct proxy of increased or reduced activations of these signaling cascades should be toned-down.</p><p>6) The authors claim that <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> define a new class of DR modulators (Results and Discussion) because they mediate a bidirectional lifespan response to DR. However, the other genes they highlight have not been studies in the same manner across multiple food concentrations, so it seems premature to make such a claim. Please rephrase.</p><p>7) At the beginning of the Discussion section, the authors state that “we have shown for the first time” that food abundance is functionally encoded in vivo by the combinatorial expression of <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic>. This seems to be more about semantics than a real advance. It was already known that <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> expressions are food responsive but they had not been analyzed across so many concentrations so carefully.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06259.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) One concern pertain to what seem to be modest phenotypic effects of</italic> tph-1 <italic>and</italic> daf-7 <italic>mutations on life span in the presence of food (with preservation of the bidirectional influence of varying food concentrations on life span), a relatively low predictive accuracy of reporter gene expression, and the low magnitude of changes in reporter gene expression observed (both in wild-type animals over the range of food concentrations tested and in</italic> tph-1 <italic>and</italic> daf-7 <italic>mutant animals compared to wild-type animals).

This should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the comment that <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> do not constitute the entire response, which we previously pointed out (Results) and which we now mention with greater prominence:</p><p>In the Discussion:</p><p>“While these results support the idea that <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> functionally encode significant information […] characterized DR regulators or undiscovered genes.”</p><p>Our results support the idea that <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic> encodes a substantial if not the majority of food information. Here, it is important to note the information contained within signalling systems are not only encoded in the response magnitude, but also on dynamic range and variance; all these parameters are regulated by the <italic>daf-7</italic>/<italic>tph-1</italic> circuit. We now emphasize these conclusions from our systematic analysis:</p><p>In the Discussion section:</p><p>“How much information is conveyed by <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>tph-1</italic>? […] This result is particularly remarkable because the predictive accuracy depends on not just the means but also variances.”</p><p>Regarding the magnitudes of gene expression and lifespan phenotypes, where comparable experiments have been published, the magnitude of our effects agree with those results, indicating reproducibility. We previously indicated similarities to published DR experiments (Results), and now we also mention similarities under dietary deprivation and in the mutants. Our gene expression responses might appear small for readers accustomed to on/off switches during cell fate specification, but they are consistent with precedents in the literature, such as Figure S4 in Liang et al., Cell Metabolism (2006), and Figure S1 Cunningham et al., Cell Metabolism (2012). Finally, we indicate the predictive accuracy should be considered a lower bound due to experimental noise:</p><p>In the Results:</p><p>“The longest lifespans occurred in the absence of bacteria, and the magnitudes of these effects are consistent with published dietary deprivation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaeberlein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2006</xref>).”</p><p>“The magnitude of lifespan changes we observed at high food levels (1x10<sup>10</sup> cells/ml) were comparable to prior studies performed at <italic>ad libitum</italic> food conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murakami and Murakami, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shaw et al., 2007</xref>).”</p><p>In the subsection headed “Decoding Analysis” of the Materials and methods:</p><p>“As with all measurements of variance, these accuracy estimates should be considered as lower bounds due to experimental noise.”</p><p><italic>2) The authors repeatedly argued that 5-HT and</italic> DAF-7 <italic>act in parallel to modulate the lifespan. However, a double mutation of</italic> tph-1 <italic>and</italic> daf-7 <italic>did not produce an additive ageing phenotype (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>). Please discuss</italic>.</p><p>We now elaborate this issue in the third paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“Our findings provide a more nuanced view of the interactions between the serotoninergic and TGFβ neuroendocrine systems. […] Together, these results point to parallel rather than sequential signalling for serotonin and TGFβ.”</p><p><italic>3) The authors made great efforts to establish differential expression of</italic> tph-1::gfp <italic>in ADF and NSM, particularly when worms grown on very high concentrations of</italic> E. coli <italic>food (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5"><italic>Figures 3-5</italic></xref><italic>). While the results are very interesting, the differential</italic> tph-1 <italic>expression does not appear to play a central role in ageing. First, transgenic expression of</italic> tph-1 <italic>in ADF or NSM restored the lifespan as a function of food availability. Second, there is no indication that the expression levels of those transgenes are modulated by food availability. Thus food restriction-induced changes in</italic> tph-1 <italic>expression probably influence other 5-HT signaling pathways but not the ageing processes</italic>.</p><p>Our experiments do not indicate rescue of lifespan as a function of food levels by non-food responsive expression of <italic>tph-1</italic> in ADF or NSM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>, we only performed <italic>tph-1</italic> rescue experiments on one food level (S Basal) where <italic>tph-1</italic> mutants showed the strongest phenotype. Instead, this result indicates that <italic>tph-1</italic> levels in ADF or NSM matter for lifespan, because lifespan changes when <italic>tph-1</italic> levels are shifted from zero (in the <italic>tph-1</italic> null mutant) to high (in the rescue lines which are overexpressed from multi-copy arrays).</p><p><italic>4) Why do</italic> daf-7 <italic>and</italic> tph-1 <italic>mutants cause extension of lifespan at some food concentrations but reduce it at others? Please discuss</italic>.</p><p>We now cover this issue at greater depth, particularly in the Discussion:</p><p>“The phenotypes of <italic>tph-1(-)</italic> and <italic>daf-7(-)</italic> mutants reveal that rather than serving intrinsic roles in lifespan extension […] and lowered the accuracy of food level representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>).”</p><p><italic>5) The sole reliance on gene expression, while a reasonable start, is arbitrary. After-all proper</italic> DAF-7 <italic>and serotonin signal regulations depend on everything from gene expression to their secretions as well as additional regulatory steps when their cognate receptors are engaged. Therefore the claim that gene expression should be taken as a direct proxy of increased or reduced activations of these signaling cascades should be toned-down</italic>.</p><p>We revised our text to indicate that the reporters are faithful readouts for gene expression, rather than pathway activation.</p><p>In the Results:</p><p>“These published results indicate that <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> reporters are faithful readouts for the expression of their respective genes (see Methods for additional details on reporter validation).”</p><p>Additionally, we used the term “signal” in certain context to mean “gene-expression signal”, since this was potentially confusing, we now clarify that in the text, in the Results section:</p><p>“Amplification of dynamic range may contribute to increased encoding capability by increasing separation of gene-expression signals.”</p><p>“In contrast to the effects of dynamic range, increasing inter-individual variation degrades encoding capability by increasing overlap between gene expression-signals.”</p><p><italic>6) The authors claim that</italic> daf-7 <italic>and</italic> tph-1 <italic>define a new class of DR modulators (Results and Discussion) because they mediate a bidirectional lifespan response to DR. However, the other genes they highlight have not been studies in the same manner across multiple food concentrations, so it seems premature to make such a claim. Please rephrase</italic>.</p><p>We have revised the text to indicate that this is a new phenotypic class and emphasize this comment made by the reviewers:</p><p>In the Results:</p><p>“Thus, <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> mutants reveal a previously unobserved DR phenotype, and our results suggest that these genes mediate a bidirectional lifespan response to DR.”</p><p>And in the Discussion:</p><p>“The phenotypes of <italic>tph-1(-)</italic> and <italic>daf-7(-)</italic> mutants reveal that rather than serving intrinsic roles in lifespan extension, serotonin and TGFβ are signals required for bidirectional food-dependent lifespan changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This bidirectional phenotype was only revealed by analysis of lifespan across a very broad range of food levels. Many genes have been implicated in lifespan modulation or DR-related responses; a systematic analysis under additional conditions may provide new insights on their roles in food-dependent responses.”</p><p><italic>7) At the beginning of the Discussion section, the authors state that “we have shown for the first time” that food abundance is functionally encoded in vivo by the combinatorial expression of</italic> tph-1 <italic>and</italic> daf-7. <italic>This seems to be more about semantics than a real advance. It was already known that tph-1 and daf-7 expressions are food responsive but they had not been analyzed across so many concentrations so carefully</italic>.</p><p>We have revised the text as follows:</p><p>“We have shown that food abundance is functionally encoded in vivo in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by the combinatorial expression of <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>daf-7</italic> in three neuron pairs.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
