The roles of the three proteins present in mice have been elucidated by KO models, but the function of the fourth component (ZP4), present in all other eutherian mammals studied so far, has remained elusive. Herein, we report that <italic>ZP4</italic> ablation impairs fertility in female rabbits. Ovulation, fertilization and in vitro development to blastocyst were not affected by <italic>ZP4</italic> ablation. However, in vivo development is severely impaired in embryos covered by a ZP4-devoided zona, suggesting a defective ZP protective capacity in the absence of ZP4. ZP4-null ZP was significantly thinner, more permeable, and exhibited a more disorganized and fenestrated structure. The evolutionary conservation of ZP4 in other mammals, including humans, suggests that the structural properties conferred by this protein are required to ensure proper embryo sheltering during in vivo preimplantation development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48904.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The egg cells of mammals, called oocytes, are encased in a protective layer called the zona pellucida.

However, the loss of ZP4 did not affect ovulation (i.e. the release of egg cells from an ovary), fertilization, or the early stages of development of embryos when studied in the laboratory. However, rabbits without ZP4 were much less fertile. Indeed, only one out of 10 female rabbits without ZP4 was able to deliver pups because in most cases the development of embryos in the womb failed.</p><p>These findings show that ZP4 has a structural role in the zona pellucida. Without ZP4 fertility is reduced. This work lays the ground for further investigation of the role of ZP4. It could also offer new insights into the causes of infertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>orycolagus

are surrounded by a glycoprotein shell termed zona pellucida (ZP) that serves important functions during folliculogenesis, species-specific fertilization and early development. In eutherian mammals, this glycoprotein shell is solely composed of 3 to 4 proteins depending on the species. The differences in ZP composition between eutherian mammals is the consequence of duplication and/or pseudogenization events during evolution. In all eutherian mammals studied so far ZP always contain ZP2 and ZP3 proteins, but ZP1 or ZP4 may be absent, as both are paralogous genes formed by duplication of a common ancestry gene (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goudet et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The functions of the three proteins (ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3) present in mouse ZP have been elucidated by gene ablation experiments. ZP1 serves a structural function, being dispensable for sperm binding or fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rankin et al., 1999</xref>). ZP1 null females display perturbed folliculogenesis and, although ovulation rates are not affected, both cleavage rate and litter size are reduced, likely due to ZP1-null zona being unable to protect the developing embryo. ZP2 ablation also results in structural defects, which are more severe, as the number of antral follicles is reduced and only few ZP-free oocytes and no two-cell embryos are recovered from <italic>Zp2</italic> knock-out (KO) females after mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rankin et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, <italic>Zp3</italic> KO mice are unable to form ZP, showing a drastic reduction in ovulation rates and also being unable to produce cleaved embryos after mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rankin et al., 1996</xref>). Given the lack of ZP on ovulated <italic>Zp2-</italic> or <italic>Zp3</italic>-null oocytes, these KO models could not assess the role of these proteins on sperm binding. To study that process, more complex gain-of-function transgenic mouse models have been generated. In particular, the generation of ZP composed of different combinations of human ZP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baibakov et al., 2012</xref>) or an heterologous ZP lacking mouse ZP2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avella et al., 2014</xref>) have uncovered a crucial role of ZP2 on mouse and human sperm recognition.</p><p>The fourth ZP protein component, ZP4, is absent in mice, which seems to be an exception for mammals, as ZP4 is present in multiple mammalian species including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hughes and Barratt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lefièvre et al., 2004</xref>), rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stetson et al., 2012</xref>), ungulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hedrick and Wardrip, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noguchi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Topper et al., 1997</xref>), carnivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moros-Nicolás et al., 2018</xref>) and other rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoodbhoy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Izquierdo-Rico et al., 2009</xref>). The lack of ZP4 in laboratory mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), the only species where KO models were readily available, has precluded the study of the role of this protein by of loss-of-function experiments. Gene ablation experiments are essential to unequivocally know the function of a gene, but were largely restricted to mice, given the technical difficulties to perform site-specific genome modification in other mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lamas-Toranzo et al., 2017</xref>). Luckily, the advent of site-specific endonucleases, and particularly CRISPR, the last technology to be developed and the easiest to tailor to its genomic target, allows direct KO generation in one step. Using this technology, we have generated <italic>ZP4</italic>-null rabbits uncovering that ZP4 confers structural properties to the ZP that are essential to protect the developing preimplantation embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of <italic>ZP4</italic> KO rabbits</title><p><italic>ZP4</italic> gene ablation was achieved by CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis at the zygote stage. For this aim, a sgRNA targeting the beginning of <italic>ZP4</italic> coding region was designed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cas9-coding capped polyadenylated mRNA and <italic>ZP4</italic>-targeting sgRNA were injected into the ooplasm at 100 and 25 ng/µl, respectively. Following microinjection, 50 embryos were transferred to the oviduct of two pseudopregnant recipients (20 and 30 embryos/female), resulting in the delivery of 12 pups (5 and 7, respectively). Genotyping was performed on ear biopsies and blood samples from each pup. Genome edition rates were assessed by sequencing a PCR product containing the target site. This initial screening revealed that all 12 pups were edited at the target site, but it did not allow to identify each mutated allele harbored by each individual. For this aim, clonal sequencing was performed, revealing that all pups but one male were mosaic, that is contained more than two alleles. This phenomenon appears when DNA replication precedes genome edition and has been commonly observed following zygote microinjection in different mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lamas-Toranzo et al., 2017</xref>), including rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Honda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lv et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Song et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Song et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>), where genome replication takes place shortly after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oprescu et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szollosi, 1966</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48904.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of <italic>ZP4</italic> KO rabbits.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A sgRNA was designed for a genomic target located at the beginning of the coding region. Upper sequence depicts wild-type sequence with the start codon underlined and CRISPR target sequence marked in bold letters.

As some of the indels generated do not alter the Open Reading Frame of the gene, only those individuals harboring frame-disrupting mutations in all alleles can be considered KO. None of the seven females generated in F0 were KO, as all contained at least one in-frame indel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This situation precluded the use of F0 generation for direct experimentation. Consequently, founders were breed to obtain wild-type (WT), heterozygous (Hz) or knock-out (KO) females in subsequent generations. A non-mosaic male containing two frame-disrupting indels was able to breed normally, as expected, given that ZP4 protein is exclusively expressed in ovaries. This male was crossed to mosaic females to generate KO animals (i.e., harboring two frame-disrupting indels) that were used for an initial fertility (pregnancy) screening. Subsequently, one of the KO alleles carried by that male and formed by a G insertion was selected in Hz (WT/KO) animals to maintain the line and generate WT, Hz and KO individuals for experiments. Off-target analysis revealed no genome edition in any of the five most probable off-target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Protein ablation in KO female individuals was confirmed by IHC in ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Proteomics analysis of solubilized extracts of ZP from oocytes obtained from KO and WT individuals by tandem mass spectrometry further confirmed the absence of ZP4 in KO individuals. <italic>ZP4</italic> ablation did not prevent the synthesis of all other three rabbit ZP proteins (ZP1-3), which were also detected in the solubilized extract of <italic>ZP4</italic> KO ZP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This analysis also provides a semi-quantitative estimation of the amount of ZP1-3 proteins based on the number of peptides detected for each protein, which were similar for KO and WT oocytes, thereby suggesting that ZP4 ablation does not induce major alterations in ZP1-3 synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ZP4 ablation leads to severely impaired fertility</title><p>The effect of <italic>ZP4</italic> ablation on female fertility was initially tested by crossing WT, Hz or KO females with fertile WT males. WT and Hz females delivered normal litter sizes, whereas only one out of 10 KO females, delivered a single litter of reduced size (four pups, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In order to elucidate the root for the reproductive failure caused by <italic>ZP4</italic> ablation, ovulation and embryonic cleavage rates were assessed in WT, Hz or KO females.

To further characterize the effect of <italic>ZP4</italic> ablation on ZP texture, we analysed WT or KO ZP from in vivo derived zygotes (~14–15 hr post-mating) by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). SEM images evidenced notable differences in textural properties between WT and ZP4 lacking ZP: while the former exhibited a smooth and compact texture, the latter displayed an uneven, rougher and porous aspect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This less compact structural organization can explain its higher deformability and the larger fenestrations could lead to increased permeability.

Gene ablation experiments have deciphered the functions of the three proteins present in mouse ZP, but the role of the fourth component (ZP4) has remained controversial. Previous studies have suggested that ZP4 may play a role during fertilization. Rabbit ZP4 was found to bind to rabbit sperm acrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prasad et al., 1996</xref>), although specific blocking by ZP4-antisera fragments could not be demonstrated. Similarly, other studies based on in vitro protein-binding assays have attributed sperm attachment to the zona matrix to ZP4 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiu et al., 2008</xref>) or to heterocomplexes of ZP4 and ZP3 in porcine and bovine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yurewicz et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast with this notion, the expression of human ZP4 in transgenic mouse ZP was not sufficient to support human sperm binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yauger et al., 2011</xref>). In this article, we have tested ZP4 role by gene ablation in a species where it is naturally present. Although we cannot assure that ZP4 ablation might reduce sperm binding, acrosome reaction or sperm penetration in vitro, our results unequivocally show that ZP4 does not play an essential role during the fertilization process in vivo, but serves a structural and mechanical function which is fundamental to protect the developing embryo prior to implantation. In agreement with our findings, a recent study on ZP characterization hypothesized a structural role of ZP4 on increasing CP thickness in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nishimura et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>ZP plays an essential protective role during preimplantation embryo development, as despite the exception of a single case report where zona-free embryos were developed in vitro up to blastocyst before transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shu et al., 2010</xref>), zona denuded embryos have been largely considered unable to complete in vivo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bronson and McLAREN, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Modliński, 1970</xref>). This protective function was severely impaired following ZP4 ablation, ultimately causing embryonic death and infertility. ZP4 ablation in rabbits lead to similar structural defects in ZP to those obtained when ZP1 is ablated in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rankin et al., 1999</xref>): reduction in ZP thickness and increased ZP porosity. However, the effects on fertility of <italic>Zp1</italic> KO were less severe than those caused by ZP4 ablation, as litter size was halved in <italic>Zp1</italic> KO female mice compared to WT mice, whereas ZP4 ablation abolished almost completely embryo development. A plausible explanation for this difference is that mouse embryos may demand a lesser degree of ZP protection during preimplantation development than other domestic mammals, including rabbits. The early blastocyst hatching occurring in mouse (3.5 days compared to more than 6 days in humans and most domestic mammalian species) and a reduced hydrostatic pressure in female reproductive tract motivated by its small body size may be partly responsible for this difference.</p><p>Remarkably, the laboratory mouse remain the only mammalian species studied so far where ZP4 is not present in ZP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moros-Nicolás et al., 2018</xref>), and mouse ZP is noticeably softer and more elastic compared to other mammalian ZPs containing ZP4 with or without ZP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu Sun et al., 2003</xref>). Further evidence for the fundamental structural role of ZP4 comes from transgenic mouse models producing humanized ZP: the expression of human ZP4 in mouse ZP was found to be able to recover the thickness and robustness lost following mouse ZP2 ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avella et al., 2014</xref>). In order to determine whether ZP4 deficiency could lead to infertility in women, we searched for loss-of-function mutations in the Genome Aggregation Database, which includes data from 141456 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lek et al., 2016</xref>). This search revealed 48 polymorphisms in <italic>ZP4</italic> coding region leading to premature stop codons (PTCs), which are the most evident loss-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The frequency of individuals carrying at least one of these PTC mutations in <italic>ZP4</italic> was 0.3% in the global population analysed, raising to 1% in the African dataset. Hence, in this population, roughly 1 into 40000 women would carry a PTC in both alleles, being thereby potentially infertile due to ZP4 deficiency. Mutations in ZP1-3 genes have been recently associated with women infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nishimura et al., 2019</xref>) but the association between these PTC mutations in <italic>ZP4</italic> and woman infertility remains to be explored.</p><p>The evolutionary conservation of ZP4 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hughes and Barratt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lefièvre et al., 2004</xref>) and many other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goudet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hedrick and Wardrip, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoodbhoy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Izquierdo-Rico et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moros-Nicolás et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noguchi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stetson et al., 2012</xref>) points towards a conserved role of this protein.

Rehydrated sections of 5 µm were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in TBS to block endogenous peroxidase activity and then in primary antibody solution (goat polyclonal anti-human ZP4 (Santa-Cruz sc-49586) dilution 1:2000 in TBS-1% BSA solution) for 1 hr at room temperature in a moist chamber. After a brief wash in TBS, sections were incubated in secondary antibody solution (ImmPRESS horse anti-goat IgG HRP, Vector Labs MP-7405) for 30 min at 37°C and immunoreaction was revealed with 3–3´diaminobencidine. Finally, sections were counterstained with Harry´s hematoxylin (Thermo Scientific), dehydrated, cleared and mounted. Positive immunoreaction was identified as a dark-brown precipitated. The images were collected with a Leica DM 6000 microscope and Software Leica Application Suite.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Proteomics analyses</title><p>Proteomics was performed on 50 grown oocytes/group recovered by slicing ovaries in PBS. ZP was solubilized by incubation at 75°C for 45 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Izquierdo-Rico et al., 2009</xref>) and analyses were carried out on one technical replicate with a HPLC/MS system consisting of an Agilent 1290 Infinity II Series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an Automated Multisampler module and a High Speed Binary Pump, and connected to an Agilent 6550 Q-TOF Mass Spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using an Agilent Jet Stream Dual electrospray (AJS-Dual ESI) interface. Experimental parameters for HPLC and Q-TOF were set in MassHunter Workstation Data Acquisition software (Agilent Technologies, Rev. B.08.00).

Ovulation in rabbits is induced by mating, allowing precise determination of embryo developmental timing. Zygotes were collected post-mortem 14 hr after mating by oviductal flushing with Dulbecco´s PBS media supplemented with 1% BSA (DPBS) in five independent replicates. Ovulation rates were assessed by counting corpora lutea. Embryo culture took place on 25 µl drops of TCM-199 media (Sigma) supplemented with 5% FCS at 38.5°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 5% O<sub>2</sub> water saturated atmosphere. Embryonic cleavage and development to blastocysts were assessed on Days 1 and 5 of culture, respectively.</p><p>Follicular counts were performed in histological sections of ovaries collected 14 hr after mating, fixed and stained with Haematoxylin-Eosin as detailed above (four sections per ovary, four animals per group). Pronuclear formation rates were analysed in the zygotes obtained from three females/group fixed 20 hr following mating as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bermejo-Alvarez et al., 2012</xref>). Pronuclei were stained by incubation in 1 µM SYTOX Green (Thermofisher) for 30 min and observed under fluorescent inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse).</p><p>To analyse in vivo development to Day 4 blastocyst, three females/group were sacrificed 4 days after mating and oviducts (where no structures were recovered) and uteri were independently flushed with DPBS. The number of structures recovered were counted and blastocysts were observed and measured under light estereomicroscopy (Zeiss V20 coupled with Hammamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 camera). A similar approach was followed to analyse in vivo development to Day 6 blastocysts, but in this case four females/group were used and only uteri were flushed. Corpora lutea and the number of structures were counted to determine recovery rates. The structures recovered were observed and measured under light estereomicroscopy (Zeiss Stemi 305 coupled with Izasa CMOS 1080P camera).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Structural analyses</title><p>Zona pellucida thickness was analysed in 30 fresh embryos/group 40–43 hr post-mating by inverted light microscopy (Nikon Eclipse) using the measurement tool of the software NIS (Nikon).</p><p>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed on five zygotes/group fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 2 hr at 4°C, washed in PBS and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 hr. After washing, the zygotes were dehydrated in increasing concentration of acetone and air dried. Finally, samples were sputter coated with gold and studied in Jeol-6100 scanning electron microscope.</p><p>ZP permeability test was performed by incubating fresh zygotes (3 replicates of 3 embryos/group) in 0.005% (1:1000 dilution) solutions of carboxylate-modified 505/515 Fluospheres (Invitrogen) of different sizes (20, 40 and 100 nm) for 30 min, using the culture media and atmosphere conditions detailed above. Immediately following incubation and washing, zygotes were observed under an inverted fluorescent microscope to assess the penetration of fluorescent particles. This test yields a binary result: green fluorescence can be detected inside ZP (ZP is permeable to that size of particle) or fluorescence cannot be detected inside ZP (particles do pass through ZP).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Genomic analysis</title><p>Loss of function ZP4 polymorphisms passing QC filters were queried online at (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/gene/ENSG00000116996">http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/gene/ENSG00000116996</ext-link>), and a cvs file was downloaded and manipulated with R v3.5.1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> was plotted taking as reference the protein sequence UniProt Q12836 and using the packages ggplot2 and drawproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brennan, 2018</xref>), which was customized to depict frameshift mutations.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;ZP4 confers structural properties to the zona pellucida essential for embryo development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Eisen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Véronique Duranthon (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The zona pellucida is an essential oocyte structure for fertilization and subsequent embryonic development. Yet, the composition of this structure is species-specific, hence the difficulty to make assumptions from one animal model to the other, and to humans ultimately. ZP4 is a glycoproteic component of the zona pellucida that exists in most eutherian mammals, except the mouse. The authors report here the first ablation (CRISPR-Cas9-driven) of the Zp4 gene in rabbits and its effect on development. The zona pellucida structure appears affected in absence of ZP4, presenting as thinner and more permeable compared to wildtype. Interestingly, compared to other Zp genes, ZP4 is not absolutely required for oocyte fertilization, but has post-fertilization effects in vivo and is essential for female fertility, while being dispensable for in vitro preimplantation development.</p><p>The reviewers agreed on the fact that this is an important work, with novel conclusions and interesting implication for humans. However, there was also consensus towards the conclusion that more work is needed to properly delineate the role of ZP4 for the embryo and that some of the conclusions are not fully supported by the data..</p><p>The reviewers are well aware that obtaining edited rabbits is challenging, so between essential points 1 and 2, a choice may have to be made, regarding the limited period of 2 months that <italic>eLife</italic> allows for revision. Personally, I think point 2 may be the more interesting – if equally feasible – to experimentally address, as it may point to the reason why embryonic development fails in absence of ZP4. But wherever experiments could not be carried out, conclusions should be toned down, according to the recommendations below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The lack of effect of the ZP4 mutation on the process of fertilization is not directly proven, only implied. The authors should be more cautious in their conclusion. Additional experimental work would be needed to exclude any effect on fertilization-related events per se, like sperm binding with the egg, acrosome reaction, sperm penetration etc. There are precedents in the literature of fertilization-related proteins whose role can be masked in vivo due to compensatory mechanisms. If more edited females can be obtained, in vitro fertilization needs to be performed and sperm binding, penetration, fertilization, and polyspermy quantified under clearly-defined conditions. If it is not feasible, then the conclusion that the fertilization step is not affected should be attenuated, by limiting the conclusion to a non-oriented statement of the results = cleavage is not affected and therefore ZP4 is not absolutely required for fertilization in vivo.</p><p>2) The discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro developmental outcome should be better addressed. Because blastocysts were lost at Day 6 of in vivo development, the authors concluded that the main function of ZP4 is to protect the preimplantation embryo. However, this is clearly not proven. If the authors want to prove that the phenotype at Day 6 is due to preimplantation loss, further investigations are required to show when the loss occurs and establish the phenotype of that loss. Moreover, the authors fail to mention the dynamics of the rabbit zona pellucida, which disappears in vivo between Day 3 and Day 4 to be replaced by a neozona (Denker et al., 1979). Such a modification does not occur in the in vitro culture conditions used in the paper (Fisher et al., 1991). Additionally, during embryo transit in the oviduct, a mucin coat covers the developing embryo and is replaced by a gloiolemma at Day 5-6. The lack of development observed in vivo could equally result from effects of ZP4 on the formation of the mucinous coat, or, on the replacement of the zona by the neozona, none of these changes of the extracellular matrix being recapitulated in vitro. Whether ZP4 mutation may have rabbit specific effects due to these features should be discussed.</p><p>3) About the part on human genetics of the ZP4 gene: the authors found 48 polymorphisms in ZP4 coding region leading to premature stop codons in human. They claim that ZP4 deficiencies could thus lead to infertility in human. As such, this conclusion seems overstated: only an enrichment for such mutations in infertile patients may have led to such a conclusion. This paragraph (subsection “ZP4-devoided zona show structural abnormalities”, last paragraph) should be moved in the Discussion section.</p><p>4) Statistical and quantitative analyses should be strengthened, information is often missing or incomplete.</p><p>- mention on each graph the numbers of embryos observed in each category and not only the percentages obtained (Figure 2C, 2D, 2G, 3A, 3B, 4A).</p><p>- Quantitative assessments on ovaries are needed to conclude that there was no effect on the development of oocytes.</p><p>- Same for the analysis of embryonic development. For example, was there any effect on inner cell mass development?</p><p>- Figure 2: Please mention in the legend the number of females involved. This is only mentioned in the Materials and methods section, which makes reading uneasy.</p><p>- Only a single example of the nanosphere experiment is shown, and no quantification is reported. A quantitative, rigorous analysis is needed, with statistical tests.</p><p>- The statistical analysis section of Materials and methods says analyses were done by ANOVA. However, ANOVA is not appropriate for only two groups (Figure 3), where a t-test should be used to compare means. ANOVA alone also cannot show comparisons among the treatment groups. A post-hoc test (e.g., Tukey's or Dunnet's) is needed. This should be specified. Also, was it confirmed that the data were normally distributed and ANOVA was appropriate? This seems unlikely for proportion data like in Figure 2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48904.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The lack of effect of the ZP4 mutation on the process of fertilization is not directly proven, only implied.

Rabbit sperm capacitation is difficult to achieve in vitro and, hence, rabbit IVF is particularly challenging. We routinely perform IVF in different mammalian species (bovine, mouse, sheep and pig), but to perform rabbit IVF we would need to develop a specific protocol which would not be ready to use in a reasonable time. As a result, we have toned down our conclusions by stating that these results prove that ZP4 is dispensable for fertilization in vivo (subsection “ZP4 ablation leads to severely impaired fertility” and Discussion), as similar pronuclear formation (i.e., similar monospermic sperm penetration) and embryonic cleavage (oocyte activation following sperm penetration) rates were obtained following in vivofertilization of WT and KO females (Figure 2 C, G and H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro developmental outcome should be better addressed.

To exclude any possible effect attributable to the formation of neozona or to mucin coat substitution, we have recovered embryos fertilized and developed in vivoon Day 4. At that stage the original zona pellucida has disappeared and the embryo is only surrounded by mucin coat, as neozona will be formed later (Day 5). As it can be seen in the new Figure 3, embryos derived from WT or KO females were covered by mucin and ZP was dissolved in the developing embryos surrounded by KO ZP. ZP was present in degenerated embryos as ZP dissolution requires from embryo development (Fisher et al., 1991). However despite mucin coating was normal and ZP without ZP4 could be dissolved, a clear reduction in development to blastocyst and in blastocysts size can be already noticed by that day (i.e. before mucin-gloiolemma exchange and neozona formation). Degenerated embryos and even some blastocyst trying to expand show a crunched appearance compatible with a mechanical damage occurring in the absence of ZP4. We have included a new figure with these results (Figure 3) and have modified the Results section (subsection “ZP4 ablation leads to severely impaired fertility”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) About the part on human genetics of the ZP4 gene: the authors found 48 polymorphisms in ZP4 coding region leading to premature stop codons in human. They claim that ZP4 deficiencies could thus lead to infertility in human. As such, this conclusion seems overstated: only an enrichment for such mutations in infertile patients may have led to such a conclusion. This paragraph (subsection “ZP4-devoided zona show structural abnormalities”, last paragraph) should be moved in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved the paragraph to the Discussion section (third paragraph) and stated more clearly that we have not proved the association between the PTC mutations identified by our analysis in <italic>ZP4</italic> with women infertility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Statistical and quantitative analyses should be strengthened, information is often missing or incomplete.</p><p>- Mention on each graph the numbers of embryos observed in each category and not only the percentages obtained (Figure 2C, 2D, 2G, 3A, 3B, 4A).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not providing earlier that information in the figures, it was included in the <italic>eLife</italic>´s transparent reporting form, but it will be definitely more accessible to the readers in the columns.

Similar numbers of antral and preantral follicles were obtained (Figure 2E-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Same for the analysis of embryonic development. For example, was there any effect on inner cell mass development?</p></disp-quote><p>in vitro produced blastocysts were morphologically similar in both groups, and all blastocysts develop ICM. However, in vivodevelopment was impaired: more than half of the embryos were not able to develop to blastocyst on Day 4. Those reaching the blastocyst stage in the KO group do develop ICM, but those ICM were smaller, as the rest of the embryo. Later on development (Day 6) the developmental impairment of the KO group was more evident, but again, those embryos developing to slightly expanded blastocyst do show embryonic disc, although it was less developed than that found in the WT group (as the rest of the embryo). In other words, it seems that the damage did not affect preferentially the ICM: both TE and ICM development were reduced when ZP4 was absent from ZP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2: Please mention in the legend the number of females involved. This is only mentioned in the Materials and methods section, which makes reading uneasy.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information to the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Only a single example of the nanosphere experiment is shown, and no quantification is reported. A quantitative, rigorous analysis is needed, with statistical tests.</p></disp-quote><p>We should have provided more details for this test. This assay yields a binary result: green fluorescence detected inside ZP (permeable) or no fluorescence detected inside ZP (not permeable). All WT embryos (9) analysed following incubation with 40 or 20 nm nanospheres lacked fluorescence inside the ZP and all KO embryos (9) showed fluorescence. We have modified the subsections “ZP4-devoided zona show structural abnormalities” and “Structural analyses” to explain better this test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The statistical analysis section of Materials and methods says analyses were done by ANOVA. However, ANOVA is not appropriate for only two groups (Figure 3), where a t-test should be used to compare means. ANOVA alone also cannot show comparisons among the treatment groups. A post-hoc test (e.g., Tukey's or Dunnet's) is needed. This should be specified. Also, was it confirmed that the data were normally distributed and ANOVA was appropriate? This seems unlikely for proportion data like in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed t-test when 2 groups are compared. Regarding to ANOVA, the statistical software we use automatically perform ANOVA on ranks followed by Tukey´s when normalcy test fail, as it was the case for pregnancy data (Figure 2A). We have modified figure legend and Materials and methods accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
