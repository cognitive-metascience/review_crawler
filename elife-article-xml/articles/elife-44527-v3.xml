We hypothesized that increasing hunger intensity would curb expression of social behaviors such as mating or territorial aggression; we further hypothesized social interactions, reciprocally, would influence food consumption. We assessed competition between these motivations from both perspectives of mice within a resident-intruder paradigm. We found that as hunger state escalated, resident animal social interactions with either a female or male intruder decreased. Furthermore, intense hunger states, especially those evoked via AgRP photoactivation, fundamentally altered sequences of behavioral choice; effects dependent on food availibility. Additionally, female, but not male, intrusion attenuated resident mouse feeding. Lastly, we noted environmental context-dependent gating of food intake in intruding mice, suggesting a dynamic influence of context cues on the expression of feeding behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>competition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIADK075087-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krashes</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIADK075090-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krashes</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A rich behavioral data set reveals the complex interactions and influence motivational systems have on one another, driving competition and optimal expression of behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A motivated behavior is purposive in attaining an explicit goal, aroused through internal representations acting in concert with the presence of incentive stimuli and learned associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bindra, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Toates, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Toates, 1981</xref>). Due to the intricacy of these motivational systems, they are often simplified and studied in a behavioral vacuum, encouraging subjects to express goal-seeking behavior toward one objective. Yet, individual systems likely never operate in isolation from one another; instead they compete for expression. When animals harbor rival incentives and only mutually exclusive courses of action will satisfy those incentives, they are forced to make a choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sherrington, 1906</xref>). Therefore, neural computations must weigh the ramifications of these stimuli for optimal behavioral choice.</p><p>As an entry point into the control of feeding, we used Agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and evaluated their capacity to regulate food intake in discrete, ethologically-relevant contexts. ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> neurons are sensitive to a number of circulating endocrine signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahashi and Cone, 2005</xref>) and display appetite-state and calorie-dependent dynamic activity changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Stimulation of these neurons before or during food accessibility drives motivated feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, inhibition of ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> activity directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vardy et al., 2015</xref>) or via activation of upstream inhibitory populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garfield et al., 2016</xref>) attenuates feeding, while postnatal ablation induces starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gropp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luquet et al., 2005</xref>). Recent studies demonstrated ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> neurons have the capacity to orchestrate food-seeking to the exclusion of self-preservation and social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dietrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Padilla et al., 2016</xref>), but deeper behavioral analyses are needed to fully understand this relationship. Therefore, we investigated how varying degrees of natural and ARC<sup>AgRP</sup>-evoked hunger impact this interface.</p><p>We discovered a complicated interplay between these motivation systems. First, we found hunger had a profound effect on a resident male’s copulatory advances towards a female conspecific, but only if food was present. Similarly, when exposed to a subordinate male intruder, residents displayed less aggression in more intense hunger states; especially when food was present. However, in contrast to the reduced food intake of resident males in the presence of a female intruder compared to no intruder, resident male feeding remained intact in the presence of a male intruder compared to no intrusion. Sequence analyses of behavioral transitions revealed distinct patterns of behavior in hungry animals in the presence of food, driven primarily by caloric consumption, with the highest degree of behavioral sequence disruption observed during unnatural ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> stimulation. Remarkably, all states of hunger exhibited comparable patterns of behavior in the absence of food. Additionally, we found that intruding receptive females and subordinate males reduced food consumption, independent of appetite state, in an empty or occupied territorialized cage compared to food intake in their homecages. Meanwhile, extreme physiological, but not artificially-induced hunger, abrogated female receptivity to male advances while male intruders’ defensive behavior remained analogous across appetite condition. Together, these findings paint a complicated picture of real-time behavioral decision-making that cannot easily be captured in more canonical assays of motivated behavior that sacrifice ecological validity for tighter experimenter control. We argue that experimental designs addressing roles of competing motivational drives more accurately reflect the need to integrate multiple, disparate streams of information from real-world stimuli to mold appropriate behavior. Thus application of such paradigms is critical for our ultimate understanding of behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prolonged food-deprivation leads to more pronounced changes in rodent physiology</title><p>Although hunger is often considered a stable construct, whole body physiology undergoes robust alterations in response to lengthening periods of food deprivation, which likely contribute to shaping behavioral output.

In addition to studying physiological satiety versus hunger, we investigated artificial ‘hunger’ induced by selective activation of ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> neurons in sated animals; this ectopic activation is often used to assess ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> neurons’ sufficiency to recapitulate behavior patterns observed during natural hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhadeff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dietrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Padilla et al., 2016</xref>).

Accordingly, subjects’ latency to consume 0.1 grams or five pellets, a metric used to determine homeostatic feeding (see Materials and methods), showed similar timescales across all hunger states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When a female intruder was present, residents displayed similar grades of food consumption dependent on satiety state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>): hunger provoked residents to consume more food at a faster rate than the same mice in the Fed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, food intake was significantly attenuated in the presence, compared to the absence, of a female intruder, regardless of appetite condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–F</xref>).

Therefore, in both physiological and non-physiologically-induced hunger states, access to a receptive female readjusts goal-seeking and blunts food intake. We found that resident food intake was significantly enhanced during the Post-Phase after the intruder female was removed compared to the same mice during this period without prior exposure to the female intruder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–F</xref>), indicating the delay in the replenishment of caloric balance in the presence of a female intruder is rescued after removal of the female.</p><p>We next sought to determine whether the attenuation of resident animal feeding was the result of behaviors directed toward the female intruder. We observed that the total duration of mating behaviors, including pursuit, attempted mounting, mounting and intromission decreased with natural hunger intensity in the presence of food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Cumulative curves to initial mounting attempt also depicted higher latencies and a lower number of total animals reaching threshold in the Fasted (48 hr) and Fed<sup>AgRP CS</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).

Indeed, duration of mating behavior was significantly, negatively correlated with the amount of food consumed during the 20 min Trial-Phase across grouped animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Grooming often follows mating behavior, particularly after ejaculation, and we observed a positive correlation between mating and grooming across grouped animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

A greater cosine distance from the Fed state indicates a greater difference in the overall patterns of behavior.

In natural settings, however, multiple motivations must compete in real time for expression through goal-directed behaviors. As some motivations take precedence over others, animals must adjust their behavior to optimize survival on a moment-to-moment basis. Here, we demonstrate this phenomenon using hunger and intraspecific social interactions as two orthogonal motivations requiring animals to entertain one or both motives over time. We demonstrate that as caloric need rises, animals shift their behavior away from social interaction with female or male conspecifics in favor of feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-C</xref>). We also show that optogenetically driving ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> activity in calorically-replete animals during these interactions deters residents from social interactions with either sex, again in favor of feeding. However, the protocol used to evoke ARC<sup>AgRP</sup>-mediated hunger (concurrent- versus pre-stimulation) leads to distinctive changes in behavioral architecture (see Discussion below).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44527.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary Model: Feeding and social interactions/cues dynamically compete for behavioral expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) When resident male mice are presented with a singular external incentive (food), they express feeding based on internal state (hunger intensity).

For example, we are more likely to consume food not only when our energy stores are low and food becomes accessible, but if our past encounters with food sources revive memories representing an innocuous relationship, or better, one of positive energy gain with no negative consequences. This relationship can be applied across motivational systems. For example, conspecifics of the opposite sex serve as incentive stimuli and arouse a motivation state to approach/mate; this drive intensifies with longer deprivation (period since the last ejaculation). Furthermore, a male’s tendency to converge upon a female and copulate is stronger if such behavior in the past resulted in ejaculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kagan, 1955</xref>). Similarly, territorial aggression is amplified in dominant animals if attacks result in successful subordination of rival conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archer, 1976</xref>). Thus, we potentiated responses of our experimental animals through experience, leading to learned representations regarding chow intake (restoration of calories), receptive female intrusion (copulation/ejaculation) and subordinate male intrusion (social dominance) before the assays were conducted.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dichotomy between resident interactions with female versus male intruders</title><p>With respect to feeding, we observed an interesting division between resident interactions toward an intruding receptive female or subordinate male: while residents suppressed feeding upon exposure to a female intruder in all states investigated, they did not, for the most part, upon exposure to a male. It is possible female intrusion in general induces more robust arousal in the resident which could potentially displace food intake. More likely, the time spent engaging in stereotyped, sex-specific social behavior underlies this difference. Female-directed behaviors took quantitatively longer to evolve: total amount of time residents spent in pursuit of and mating with a female were lengthier than time spent aggressing an intruding male (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2H</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5H</xref>). It is possible that the amount of time remaining in the male intruder paradigm permitted the resident to eat comparable quantities of food as the same animals in the absence of a male intruder.</p><p>Furthermore, satiation of these needs culminate in disparate ways: motivation to reproduce is achieved by ejaculation, while motivation to aggress a male intruder ends in social defeat of the intruder. While these satiation points occur on highly variable timescales based on individual animal propensities for either motivation, actions leading to intromission/ejaculation are often more time-consuming than the establishment of dominance in a territorialized domain. After either of these points, interaction with either sex is disincentivized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collias, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGill, 1962</xref>), allowing residents to engage in other behaviors throughout the rest of the trial (such as feeding). Thus, it is possible these differences result from the sheer limitation of the trial period we used.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Variation in the sensitivity of mating and aggression to hunger state depends on food accessibility</title><p>Just as social behaviors shape feeding responses, hunger shows a profound effect on social interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In concert with previous findings, we observed a robust decrease in the motivation to engage in reproductive or aggressive behaviors in animals subjected to prolonged food restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inaba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Padilla et al., 2016</xref>). We demonstrate that ramping intensity of hunger states has scaled effects on metabolic endocrinology, which may in turn drive an exclusive set of behaviors. Past research indicates that hormones governing sexual and aggressive behaviors drop in calorically-deprived states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nikol'skaya et al., 2016</xref>), leading to decreased reproductive behaviors in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burns-Cusato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shah and Nyby, 2010</xref>), rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones and Wade, 2002</xref>), and other rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 1994</xref>), as well as diminished aggression toward other males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Padilla et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the commonly used term ‘hangry’ to describe a state of agitation while hungry, aggression research is mixed on the effects of hunger in potentiating aggression. Earlier research cites hunger as a catalyst for increased aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keys, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rohles and Wilson, 1974</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown across species that levels of aggression are amplified in the presence of a depletable food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lim et al., 2014</xref>). However, we found that as caloric need escalated, the drive to mate or aggress intruders dwindled. This subdual of social interactions could be the result of energy conservation or alternatively, a shift away from social behavior toward food consumption.</p><p>Arguing for the latter, we found that suppression of mating and aggression behaviors in hungry resident animals was reversed when food was absent (Figure 8C). Thus, by eliminating the option to sate hunger through food consumption, resident animals were able to devote more time to pursuing attainable incentives such as reproductive and territorial-defensive behaviors. Importantly, the absence of food to hungry mice, even those receiving ARC<sup>AgRP</sup>-photoactivation, failed to lock animals into foraging programs in exclusion of competing need states. This makes sense on the level of ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> neural activity, which is suppressed by caloric information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Su et al., 2017</xref>) but may not exhibit a homogeneous response to intruder animals in the absence of food. This result underscores the need for more comprehensive in vivo imaging of these neurons – and their downstream terminal fields – during interactions in various contexts. Promising targets include the medial amygdala (MeA), a region previously implicated in ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> suppression of aggression and self-preservation behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Padilla et al., 2016</xref>), as well the paraventricular thalamus (PVT), a downstream site where ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> activity is sufficient to drive feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betley et al., 2015</xref>) and influence cue valence processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Livneh et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, elucidating the putative influence caloric need acts on the endogenous activity patterns of canonical cell-types underlying social interaction will enhance our understanding of the dynamic interaction between motivational states.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Behavioral choice sequence disrupted by extreme natural hunger and artificial ‘hunger’ induction</title><p>Due to the richness of our data set, we also sought to address disparities in sequential behavioral choice that emerged in our residents across hunger states. Transition matrices reporting the evolution from each scored behavior to another scored behavior revealed that while all hunger states showed differences from the Fed state in the presence of food, the starkest distinction belonged to the Fed<sup>AgRP CS</sup> condition. This finding is largely due not only to the patterns and sequences of behaviors but the frequency in which they occur. For example, resident animals in the Fed<sup>AgRP CS</sup> condition displayed reduced (but still present) mating advances and aggressive behaviors and engaged in greater food intake than other appetite states. This disruption in behavioral sequences was eliminated when food was inaccessible, further demonstrating the power that external incentive availability, combined with internal state, exert on the optimal expression of behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A deeper investigation into ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> photoactivation</title><p>Although remote stimulation of ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> neurons reliably evokes food intake comparable to fasted animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>), the activity of this neural subset is inhibited in the presence of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, optogenetically locking animals into this artificial state fails to mimic endogenous ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> activity in the presence of food, and thus is not an accurate representation of real-time network dynamics and ensuing behavior. However, every study to date has shown that concurrent ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> activation recapitulates behaviors observed in physiological hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhadeff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dietrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Padilla et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steculorum et al., 2016</xref>), albeit many of these were performed in the absence of food. It was recently described that priming ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> neurons, via prestimulation in the absence of food, drives subsequent food intake upon availability at comparable levels as physiological or concurrent ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), presenting a closer model of the dynamics of ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> neurons during natural hunger.</p><p>Therefore we tested our mice under both optogenetic protocols, revealing key differences in ARC<sup>AgRP</sup>-evoked behavior, particularly when animals were forced to decide between feeding and social interactions. While animals in both conditions presented similar magnitudes of food intake with no intruder present, animals’ real-time behavior during intruder trials varied wildly. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, we uncovered the first instances when Fed<sup>AgRP CS</sup> failed to phenocopy the behavior observed in physiologically fasted animals: resident males in the Fed<sup>AgRP CS</sup> condition demonstrated lower levels of mating and aggression behaviors toward intruders in the presence of food, when ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> activity should be silenced. Furthermore, although feeding was restrained in the presence of a female intruder, intake was not suppressed to the same degree as in all other appetite states tested. Along these lines, we report that the pattern of behavioral sequences varied more in this Fed<sup>AgRP CS</sup> condition compared to all other states tested, an effect that was rescued in the absence of food when natural ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> activity would remain elevated. Finally, the amount of food consumed by intruders in an occupied resident cage differed between the Fasted (48 hr) and Fed<sup>AgRP CS</sup> conditions suggesting additional alterations in physiology may be necessary to promote food seeking apart from ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> activity under this specific context. Thus, caution must be applied to interpreting function through artificial stimulation strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Environmental context can alter intruder behavior regardless of how hunger is elicited</title><p>Our study also identified comparable, but different, effects of territorial context on the execution of feeding behaviors during varying intensities of hunger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D-F</xref>). We observed a robust decrease in food intake upon entry into an unknown resident’s territory in both female and male mice across all hunger states compared to baseline feeding responses recorded in their homecage; this decrease was exacerbated by the resident occupancy. Accounts of natural mouse behavior indicate that dominant animals patrol and aggressively defend marked territory in the face of intrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crowcroft, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crowcroft, 1966</xref>). Moreover, cage switch experiments where animals are placed in a dirty cage containing soiled bedding of another conspecific elevates body temperature and locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Piñol et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, abrogation of intruder food intake is likely driven primarily by stress-induced changes in physiology independent of sex. We suspect the stress of entering a resident’s territory also overrides concurrent ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> stimulation as past work suggests the timing of ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> activation onset influences behaviors oriented towards threat avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jikomes et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We also detailed a dichotomy in intruder responses to resident interactions: in females subjected to intense fasting conditions (Fasted 48 hr), we observed marked reductions in receptivity to mating advances, while we saw no differences in male intruder defense or escape behaviors across hunger states. A similar reduction was not revealed in the Fed<sup>AgRP CS</sup> condition, further substantiating key differences among natural versus artificially-induced hunger states. We draw several conclusions from this pattern of results. First, female intruders have more agency over an interaction with a male resident: they can choose to display or reject a male’s advances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johansen et al., 2008</xref>), while subordinate male intruders must endure resident attacks regardless of their resistance. Second, this effect is likely influenced by hormones: akin to male sex hormones, those regulating female reproductive behavior show well-documented decreases in calorically-deprived states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranowska et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Olofsson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wade and Schneider, 1992</xref>). Long starvation periods can also cause overall disruption of the estrous cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Judd, 1998</xref>) and reduced reproductive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), effects that can be simulated by chronic ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Padilla et al., 2017</xref>). Male intruder escape and defensive behaviors remain constant across all appetite states, suggesting that even calorically-deprived or ARC<sup>AgRP</sup>-evoked animals will defend themselves when residents attack. It is clear both female- and male resident-intruder interactions are highly driven by the resident animals’ behavior towards the intruder, regardless of intruder hunger condition.</p><p>Overall, we have demonstrated more dynamic interaction between two mutually exclusive motivations – hunger and social interaction – than has previously been appreciated in recent neuroscience research. We have shown that in rodents, the context of a social interaction, including territorial ownership and hunger state, can prominently guide how behavioral encounters will unfold. Subsequent research should further address the neurophysiology of homeostatic feeding circuitry both upstream and downstream of ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> neurons that may principally alter the interplay of these two orthogonal motivations and their behavioral expression in real time. Furthermore, future high-level modeling of decision-making will advance the field’s understanding of computational choice behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Agrp-ires-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tong et al., 2008</xref>) mice (The Jackson Laboratory; Stock No: 012899) were generated and maintained as previously described.

A pulled-glass pipette with 20–40 mm tip diameter was inserted into the brain and virus was injected by an air pressure system. A micromanipulator (Grass Technologies, Model S48 Stimulator) was used to control injection speed at 25 nl min<sup>−1</sup> and the pipette was withdrawn 5 min after injection. AAV10-CAG-FLEX-ChR2(H134R)-tdTomato (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; titer 1.3 × 10<sup>13</sup> genome copies per ml) was unilaterally injected into the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC; 200–300 nl, bregma: AP: –1.44 mm, DV: −5.70 mm, ML: ±0.25 mm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optic fiber implantation</title><p>Optical fibers (200 µm diameter core; BFH37-200 Multimode; NA 0.37; Thor Labs) were implanted unilaterally over the ARC (bregma: AP: −1.45 mm, DV: −5.45 mm, ML: −0.20 mm). Fibers were fixed to the skull using C and B Metabond Quick Cement and dental acrylic and mice were allowed 2 weeks for recovery before acclimatization investigator handling for 1 week before experiments. Following implantation, resident animals were singly-housed while intruder animals were put back into their grouped-cages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Photostimulation protocol</title><p>Fiber optic cables (1 m long, 200 mm diameter; Doric Lenses) were firmly attached to the implanted fiber optic cannulae with zirconia sleeves (Doric Lenses) and coupled to lasers via a fiber-optic rotary joint (Doric Lenses). During photostimulation experiments, light pulse trains (5 ms pulses of 20 Hz; 2 s on, 2 s off) were programmed using a waveform generator (PCGU100; Valleman Instruments or Arduino electronics platform) that provided input to a blue light laser (473 nm; Laserglow). We adjusted the light power of the laser such that the light power exiting the fiber optic cable was 10–12 mW using an online light transmission calculator for brain tissue <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/cgi-bin/graph/chart.php">http://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/cgi-bin/graph/chart.php</ext-link>. We estimated the light power at the ARC at 4.99 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. Note that this is likely a high estimation because some light was probably lost at the interface between the fiber optic cable and the implanted fiber optic cannula.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Screening protocols</title><p>Screening for all animals receiving ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> optogenetic stimulation was conducted at ZT2-3 (9-10AM; near the beginning of the light cycle when baseline food intake is low) and occurred after experimenter handling acclimation, at least 3 weeks after surgical procedures. Animals to be used for intruder trials were singly-housed overnight before screening to ensure accurate measurement of food intake. On the day of the protocol, animals were tethered to a fiber-optic cable and allowed to acclimate for 10–20 min. The animals were given <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to 20 mg chow pellets (TestDiet) during a 20 min baseline, after which the number of pellets eaten was recorded. Following this baseline period, photostimulation was initiated for 20 min, and food intake was again measured after at the conclusion of this period. Only animals that consumed &gt;0.30 g food intake (singly-housed residents) or &gt;0.20 g (group-housed residents moved temporarily to single-housing for screening) were used for further experimentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Social interaction assay: Resident analyses</title><p>All trials probing social interaction were conducted in a PhenoTyper (Noldus, Inc) home cage apparatus. The apparatus contained an overhead camera for trial monitoring and an automated pellet-dispenser, or Feeding Experimentation Device (F.E.D., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>), which dispensed 20 mg grain pellets (TestDiet). Resident animals only had access to standard chow pellets (Teklad F6 Rodent Diet 8664, see Animals above) and <italic>ad libitum</italic> water when trials were not in progress. All residents lived in the apparatus for at least two weeks before trials, allowing for sufficient time to mark the cage with urine and feces and establish territorial domain. Residents used for the female-intruder assay were co-housed overnight with a female intruder mouse no less than 3 times during this 2 week acclimation period to provide male residents with sexual experience. Importantly, residents used for the female-intruder assay were sexually-deprived &gt;48 hr. Residents used for male-intruder assay were co-housed with a female before and after trials. Critically, residents used for the male-intruder assay were challenged with five novel, younger, smaller, group-housed male conspecific intruders during this 2 week acclimation period to provide experience aggressing male intruder mice.</p><p>Animals were tested in all experiments at ZT4-5 (10-11AM). Trials proceeded in three 20 min phases: Pre-Phase, Trial-Phase, and Post-Phase. During the Pre-Phase, all residents were attached to a fiber-optic cable (even if they were not receiving or going to be receiving photostimulation) and allowed to acclimate to attachment to the fiber. Notably, food was no accessible during this period. Resident mice in the ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> prestimulation group (Fed<sup>AgRP PS</sup>) received 20 min of photostimulation at this time.</p><p>While residents were being acclimated to the fiber-optic cable, intruders were selected. Intruders were all aged 6–14 weeks from group-housing environments; all animals of both sexes were virgins. To determine female intruder eligibility, vaginal cytology was assessed for estrous state (see Vaginal cytology below); only females in the estrous phase were used.</p><p>The 20 min Trial Phase took on three distinct variations. Resident mice were either provided 1) <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to the F.E.D. in the absence of an intruder 2) <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to the F.E.D. in the presence of an intruder or 3) no access to the F.E.D. in the presence of an intruder. Animals were allowed to interact uninterrupted for 20 min.</p><p>Finally, during the 20 min Post-Trial period, intruder animals were removed from the apparatus, weighed, and quickly euthanized via carbon-dioxide inhalation. Resident animals remained in their homecages and were given 20 min <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to the F.E.D.</p><p>Pellets taken from the F.E.D. were automatically registered in the software but were verified via video to determine which specific animal consumed the food. We used the latency to consume 0.1 grams or five pellets as a metric to determine homeostatic feeding based on pellet consumption during the sated condition. Importantly, standard ~4 gram chow pieces were provided to all animals between experiments. Thus, exposure to the 20 mg chow pellets is limited to the experimental assays. On average, residents consumed ~5 pellets in the Fed state with less than 50% of the cohort meeting this threshold, demonstrating that this consumption was not physiologically necessary given they had <italic>ad lib</italic> food availability up until the start of the trial. Therefore, any income above five pellets consumed in the Fed state is likely a result stemming from the intermittent access to the 20 mg food pellets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Social interaction assay: Intruder analyses</title><p>Intruder behavior analysis occurred in the same apparatus as resident behavior analyses (see above). Intruder feeding was tested in three different contexts: in the home cage, in a resident-territorialized PhenoTyper cage, and in a territorialized cage while the cage’s resident is present.</p><p>For home cage feeding, intruders were separated into single-housing cages containing a ramekin dish for one dark cycle. At ZT4-5 (10-11AM), the mice were provided with <italic>ad</italic> libitum access to 20 mg chow pellets and food intake was assessed over a 20 min period.</p><p>For empty resident cage intake assessment, residents and their female cohabiters were moved to a holding cage until after the trial. Intruders were tethered to a fiber-optic and allowed to acclimate to experimental handling (Fed<sup>AgRP PS</sup> received prestimulation during this time). The animals were then introduced to the empty resident cage with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to the F.E.D. and feeding was assessed after a 20 min period.</p><p>For the occupied resident cage intake assessment, intruders were introduced into the resident’s cage and provided with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to the F.E.D. in the presence of a dominant male resident. All female intruders tested positive for estrus state the morning they were used for the intruder behavior trials.</p><p>After a 20 min interaction period, the residents were removed, weighed, and moved to a holding cage until the end of the intruders’ 20 min Post-Trial phase where the intruder was provided with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to the F.E.D. in the absence of the dominant resident. Finally, after the Post-Trial phase, intruders were removed from the cages, weighed, and quickly euthanized via carbon-dioxide inhalation. Resident animals were returned to their cages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Behavioral analyses</title><p>All trials were video recorded with a ceiling-mounted camera and used to score behaviors. All mice were scored for three individual behaviors: drinking, grooming and eating. Each mouse was also scored for four interactive behaviors: nose-to-nose chemoinvestigation and anogenital chemoinvestigation independent of sex or resident/intruder status. Resident males were scored for attempted mating/pursuit and mounting/intromission in the presence of a female intruder and chasing and aggressive attack behavior in the presence of a male intruder. Female intruders were scored for escape/attempted escape and sexual receptivity, while male intruders were scored for flight/escape and defensive postures including rearing and being attacked. All behaviors were manually scored using JWatcher 1.0 (Daniel T Blumenstein, Janice C Daniel, and Christopher S Evans, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jwatcher.ucla.edu/">http://www.jwatcher.ucla.edu/</ext-link>). Data was collected every second across the 20 min trial and if the animal performed one of these scored behaviors it was time-stamped and color-coded appropriately. Raster plots or behavioral barcodes were generated for each animal to provide a raw data snapshot of the animals sequence of behavior during the trials. Of note, we only scored discernable, easily-identifiable behaviors to verify reproducibility. Therefore, if the animals were performing other behaviors separate from our designated repertoire of actions, those particular actions went unaccounted for in our analyses. Importantly, the exact moment an animal took a pellet from the F.E.D. was automatically recorded, however video footage was used to (1) confirm the animal ate the pellet and (2) determine which animal retrieved and consumed the pellet in the case when multiple animals were occupying the cage.</p><p>Inter-rater reliability measures were conducted using confusion matrices directly comparing person-to-person scoring methods. Similarity of overall behavior scoring averaged greater than 70% coherence, as has been previously cited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jhuang et al., 2010</xref>), and overall durations of behaviors scored show no significant differences between scorers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>For each individual subject, in each behavioral state, sequences coded in JWatcher (see Behavioral Analyses) were extracted using custom Python scripts (Ilona Szczot, Science Exchange, Inc; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>). Sequences were analyzed time-agnostically, meaning that inter-behavioral intervals and total duration of individual behavior bouts were not considered for this analysis. Using MATLAB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode2">Source code 2</xref>), we analyzed the normalized frequency of transitions from each behavior to the following behavior for each animal as follows. First, the total number of bouts was normalized within each animal, thus removing inter-animal variability in number of behavioral bouts. A frequency proportion was calculated for each behavioral transition pair. Values close to 0 represented transitions that were infrequent or absent, and values near 1.0 represented sequences that occurred with high frequency. Within each feeding state, these transition frequency values were then arranged into multidimensional vectors. For each subject, we calculated the distance between the vector representing each individual’s Fed state transition frequency and their natural or artificial hunger transition averages (producing one cosine distance calculation for each hunger state), thus providing within-subject data to be compared across conditions. To calculate this distance, we used the cosine method because it takes into account the overall pattern of averaged transitions across animals, constrains the average values between 0 and 1, and allows for more sensitive detection of differences than the more standard Euclidean distance measurement. Resultant cosine distance values were then compared using standard hypothesis-testing statistical analysis in GraphPad Prism 7.0 (see Statistical Analysis).</p><p>Transition matrices represent the average of transitions across animals within individual hunger states calculated as described above. Heat maps displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> display across subject averages of each individual frequency, with lighter colors showing lesser frequency and darker colors greater frequency.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Vaginal cytology</title><p>Sample collection and estrous cycle determination protocols were adapted from previous methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byers et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, we inserted a pipette tip 1 mm inside the vagina of restrained female mice, then gently flushed 10 μL of 0.9% saline inside. The saline was then deposited onto a microscope slide (Fisher Scientific, Inc) and observed under a light microscope for cell contents in the saline drop before the drop was allowed to fully dry. We determined mice were in the estrous phase if almost all cells observed were cornified epithelial cells.</p><p>To stain cells for visualization, slides were allowed to fully dry before beginning staining. Slides were thoroughly rinsed in 1X phosphatase-buffered saline (PBS), then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min. After fixing, slides were washed thoroughly in deionized water. Cells were stained in a 0.1% Toluidine Blue O solution (1% Toluidine Blue O in 70% ethanol, diluted to working concentration with 0.9% saline) for 3 min, then thoroughly rinsed in deionized water. Slides were then rapidly dehydrated in ramping in a step of 90% ethanol solution, then two steps of 100% ethanol. Samples were then cleared in two steps of 100% xylene for 3 min each step. Slides were then covered and imaged under light microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7.0 (GraphPad) software.

They used multidisciplinary approaches including behavior and optogenetics. The authors performed detailed behavioral analysis to determine how satiety states alter the expression of ethologically relevant social behaviors such as mating and territorial aggression. The major finding of the paper is that different degrees of food deprivation dramatically alter behavioral patterns within mice when competing motivationally relevant stimuli are present in the environment. Collectively, the studies are well described and provide novel observations that will be of wide interest. Several technical and presentation issues need to be addressed. Moreover, the flow and presentation of data is sometimes long and hard to follow. Potentially streamlining the results would make the article easier to digest for a larger audience.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript as written is difficult to digest. It seems that the manuscript has been written for a different journal format. For example, the Results section includes a lot of commentary that may be better suited for the Discussion. That being said the Discussion is a bit long.</p><p>The authors are to be commended for including all of the data. However, the figures are quite dense and routinely have panels from A-N. At a minimum, the individual panels are too small for my old eyes. The authors are encouraged to use the <italic>eLife</italic> figure format which allows supplements to figures that should allow some of the panels in a given figure to be supplements to that figure, so all of the data are there, but each part of the figure can be simpler and bigger.</p><p>For a journal with wide readership, a summary model figure would be helpful to convey the big picture to the readers.</p><p>The authors could expand the Discussion slightly to address how they think competing needs are processed at the neurocircuit level. Is there evidence from the literature that certain circuits become disengaged by changes in the hormonal state or under conditions of different types of deprivation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44527.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript as written is difficult to digest.

We have scaled back visual data presentation and restricted our interpretation of results and saved this for the Discussion/Materials and methods section to make it easier to read. In addition, we have also tightened up the Discussion section to address several of the main takeaways of the study and integrate reviewer suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors are to be commended for including all of the data.

In many instances, several graphs have been combined into one plot, inviting direct comparisons to be made more easily across conditions. Other pieces of main figures have also been moved to supplementary material. Furthermore, we removed the original Supplementary Figures 5 and 10 from the resubmission as we found these results redundant with the results as portrayed in the matrices of Figures 3 and 6, respectively. Similarly, data that was previously presented such as individual appetite state correlations or trial+post food intake measurements were removed due to the redundancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For a journal with wide readership, a summary model figure would be helpful to convey the big picture to the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have provided a summary model figure as a final main figure (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors could expand the Discussion slightly to address how they think competing needs are processed at the neurocircuit level.

However, it is our opinion that this integration of binary choice behavior is extremely complex and will not occur at a singular loci in the brain. We have also emphasized previous literature that have explored the inhibition of competing behaviors such as pain perception, anxiety-related behavior, parental care, arousal, threat detection, compulsive behavior and social interactions by hunger intensity.</p><p>Although not discussed in detail due to space limitations, we would like to point out that hormones and circulating factors likely have dynamic effects regulating activity of neural circuits regulating feeding behaviors and social interactions. Ample evidence has investigated crossover effects of “conventional” hormone systems. Sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen, for example, have dynamic, sex-dimorphic differences on energy metabolism (reviewed by Morford and Mauvais-Jarvis, 2016; Kelly and Jones, 2015); oxytocin also may act as an anorectic, as direct CNS infusion (Arletti et al., 1989) and intranasal treatments in humans (reviewed by Olszewski et al., 2017) can suppress food intake. In clinical populations, obesity’s interrelationship with other conditions is very clear: patients struggling with obesity exhibit a broad array of comorbid conditions, including low testosterone (Morford and Mauvais-Jarvis, 2016) and affective disorders (Luppino et al., 2010).</p><p>Much less is known, however, about specific locations at which these effects may occur, but we have some clues. The ARC, for example, densely expresses estrogen receptors (Esr1). Downstream regions of ARC<sup>AgRP</sup> neurons, including the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), express oxytocin receptors and putatively play main roles in social interaction behaviors. Conversely, circulating factors signaling hunger or satiety such as leptin, insulin, and any number of gastrointestinal peptides likely act in multiple regions of the brain, especially in other nuclei of the hypothalamus.</p></body></sub-article></article>
