impaired skeletal muscle development. We developed human <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> -driven zebrafish models of tumorigenesis and found that <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> exhibits discrete cell lineage susceptibility and transformation. Tumors developed by 1.6–19 months and were primitive neuroectodermal tumors or rhabdomyosarcoma. We applied this <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> transgenic zebrafish model to study how <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> leverages early developmental pathways for oncogenesis and found that <italic>her3</italic> is a unique target. Ectopic expression of the <italic>her3</italic> human ortholog, <italic>HES3</italic>, inhibits myogenesis in zebrafish and mammalian cells, recapitulating the arrested muscle development characteristic of rhabdomyosarcoma. In patients, <italic>HES3</italic> is overexpressed in fusion-positive versus fusion-negative tumors. Finally, <italic>HES3</italic> overexpression is associated with reduced survival in patients in the context of the fusion. Our novel zebrafish rhabdomyosarcoma model identifies a new <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> target, <italic>her3</italic>/<italic>HES3</italic>, that contributes to impaired myogenic differentiation and has prognostic significance in human disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33800.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the most common cancers in children and adolescents is rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer of soft tissue such as muscle, tendon or cartilage. The fusion of DNA on two different chromosomes causes the most aggressive form of rhabdomyosarcoma. The fused DNA produces an abnormal protein called PAX3-FOXO1. During normal muscle development, a subset of rapidly growing cells eventually slow down and form mature, working muscle cells. It is still unclear how exactly rhabdomyosarcoma develops, but it is thought that PAX3-FOXO1 stops muscle cells from maturing and the cells that grow out of control result in a tumor. Learning how PAX3-FOXO1 hijacks normal muscle development could lead to new treatments for rhabdomyosarcoma.</p><p>One treatment approach is to slow the growth of a tumor and force the cells to mature. Then, young patients might avoid chemotherapy or radiation treatments and their side effects. Efforts to improve treatment for this type of cancer face several obstacles. Currently, only one vertebrate animal model of the disease is available to test drugs, and it is still not known how PAX3-FOXO1 causes healthy cells to become cancerous. It is also hard to turn off PAX3-FOXO1 itself, so scientists must find additional proteins that collaborate with it to target with drugs.</p><p>Now, Kendall et al. show that genetically engineered zebrafish with human PAX3-FOXO1 develop rhabdomyosarcoma-like tumors. Experiments on these zebrafish showed that the protein turns on a gene called her3. Humans have a similar gene called HES3. In zebrafish or mouse cells, human HES3 interferes with muscle-cell maturation and allows cells that acquire PAX3-FOXO1 to persist during development instead of dying. It also increases the cell growth and cancerous behavior in human tumor cells. Kendall et al. further looked at HES3 levels in tumors collected from patients with rhabdomyosarcoma and found that having higher levels of HES3 increased the risk of death from the cancer.</p><p>Human rhabdomyosarcoma tumors with high HES3 levels were also more likely to have certain cell-growth and cell-differentiation related proteins. Drugs that turn off or modify the activity of these proteins already exist. Testing these drugs that target processes such as cell growth in the zebrafish with rhabdomyosarcoma-like tumors may help scientists determine if they reduce tumor growth. If they do, additional trials could determine if they would help patients with rhabdomyosarcoma.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rhabdomyosarcoma</kwd><kwd>fusion oncogene</kwd><kwd>PAX3-FOXO1</kwd><kwd>sarcoma</kwd><kwd>HES3</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP120685-P3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amatruda</surname><given-names>James F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000043</institution-id><institution>American Association for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QuadW Foundation-AACR Fellowship for Clinical/Translational Sarcoma Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kendall</surname><given-names>Genevieve C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001445</institution-id><institution>Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation for Childhood Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kendall</surname><given-names>Genevieve C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006792</institution-id><institution>Hartwell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kendall</surname><given-names>Genevieve C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ligue National Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delattre</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, HES3, acts downstream of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion oncogene to impair muscle differentiation and promote tumorigenesis in rhabdomyosarcoma, a childhood muscle cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) presents as a solid tumor that displays characteristics of primitive skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parham and Ellison, 2006</xref>). There are two major histological subtypes, embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), with ARMS being more aggressive and particularly prone to metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williamson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skapek et al., 2013</xref>). At the genomic level, ERMS is characterized by frequent alterations affecting <italic>RAS</italic> signaling, although this still represents a minority of the cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stratton et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langenau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martinelli et al., 2009</xref>). The defining oncogenic event in ARMS is a t(1;13) or t(2;13) chromosomal translocation in which the <italic>PAX7</italic> or <italic>PAX3</italic> DNA-binding domain, respectively, is fused to the <italic>FOXO1</italic> transactivation domain to create a <italic>PAX3/7-FOXO1</italic> chimeric oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galili et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shapiro et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 1994</xref>). The <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> fusion is the most prevalent fusion in the disease, and functions as an aberrant transcription factor that is expressed in the nucleus and deregulates gene expression signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">del Peso et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fredericks et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 1999</xref>). This activity is the predominant cellular insult required for transformation.</p><p>The <italic>PAX3/7-FOXO1</italic> oncogenes remain intractable to therapeutic targeting, impeding the development of effective precision medicine therapies. Fusions are notoriously difficult to model in animals, hence the limited availability of vertebrate animal models of this disease. Furthermore, there is a narrow understanding of the cellular origin of RMS, making it difficult to define the expression pattern required for tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hettmer and Wagers, 2010</xref>). Zebrafish are a complementary model system that can address these genetic and cellular issues. Advantages of zebrafish systems are two-fold: (1) they provide insight into the underlying biology of how cancer genes behave in a complex environment and (2) provide a platform for translational drug discovery efforts. Such strengths are intrinsically important for translational models of pediatric disease.</p><p>Here, we describe human <italic>PAX3-FOXO1-</italic>driven zebrafish models. We implemented our zebrafish models to provide the appropriate context to understand the behavior of <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> during development and tumorigenesis. The tumor presentation spectrum identified three distinct cellular contexts that are susceptible to transformation, generating insight into basic mechanisms of <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> tumorigenesis and human rhabdomyosarcoma. By applying our zebrafish RMS model, we found a novel <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> target, <italic>her3/HES3. HES3</italic> is a member of the HES family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, which function as direct or indirect transcriptional activators or repressors, thus regulating gene expression and epigenetic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kageyama et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>HES3</italic> is expressed in the developing brain and inhibits differentiation of neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hatakeyama et al., 2004</xref>). In cancer, <italic>HES3</italic> is expressed in glioblastoma cell culture, and co-localizes with additional markers of stemness in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katoh and Katoh, 2007</xref>). However, its role as a cooperating gene in <italic>PAX3/7-FOXO1</italic> fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma has never been described. Taken together, this model represents a novel strategy to identify new targets and biomarkers in the context of human disease and contributes to our understanding of RMS biology by defining the earliest tumor initiation events.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A transgenic zebrafish model of human <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> driven tumorigenesis</title><p>To develop a new vertebrate model of <italic>PAX3-FOXO1-</italic>dependent tumorigenesis, we performed a survey of promoters driving <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> expression. These promoters represent ubiquitous (beta actin, CMV, ubiquitin), hematologic (fli1), muscle (unc503), neural crest (mitfa) expression, and a gene trap approach. Selected promoters were chosen because of their relevance in the disease as implicated lineages for the cell of origin or for their capacity to drive <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> at high levels of expression. Further, all promoters had been previously validated as functional in zebrafish, with data from our group underscoring the beta actin promoter as a successful expression system for <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> transgenic models of Ewing sarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leacock et al., 2012</xref>).

This results in equimolar expression of both genes on the same mRNA transcript, yet translation as independent proteins. Zebrafish were monitored for up to 19 months.

To identify activity unique to <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> versus the normal <italic>PAX3</italic> transcription factor, we performed a detailed analysis of the functional effects of their expression during zebrafish development. We utilized a mosaic model system, in which plasmid DNAs containing the beta actin promoter driving GFP, or GFP-tagged <italic>PAX3</italic> or <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> were injected into developing zebrafish using the Tol2 transposon system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To achieve these higher levels of transcription and transformation, we opted to utilize high-level promoters. This threshold was likely not reached with the <italic>fli1</italic>, <italic>mitfa,</italic> and <italic>unc503</italic> endogenous promoters, or, the lineages and/or temporal kinetic of transgene expression are not relevant to the disease.</p><p>In our zebrafish model, the relevant <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> RMS cell type is supportive of CMV-mediated gene expression and requires a <italic>tp53</italic> mutation. These observations are substantiated by the mouse <italic>Pax3-Foxo1</italic> RMS model, in which deletion of <italic>Tp53</italic> or <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> is required for tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller et al., 2004</xref>). In our zebrafish ARMS model, <italic>tp53</italic> mutations allow for <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> + cells to survive during embryogenesis by inhibiting apoptosis resulting in later tumor formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). This may represent a unique necessity in animal models as both fusion-positive RMS vertebrate models of the disease require that <italic>tp53</italic> is mutant or lost. In zebrafish, beta-actin-driven <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> is sufficient for tumorigenesis, providing a cleaner background for its functional assessment and greater conservation with the genetics of the human disease. One possible explanation is that zebrafish do not have p14 ARF orthologs, making it an unique model to understand the function of the fusion alone. Therefore, we pursued embryonic analyses of <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> function using both the beta actin and CMV promoters due to their tumorigenic effects and unique genetic requirements. We found by performing analogous studies with BetaActin-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> and CMV-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> that these expression constructs behaved comparably in an embryonic environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). Focusing on robust and conserved early oncogenic mechanisms that are consistent across multiple promoter models limited the possibility of artifactual observations.</p><p>By studying <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> signaling in a complex developmental context, we identified a novel fusion-positive RMS biomarker, <italic>her3</italic>/<italic>HES3</italic>, that predicts more aggressive disease. <italic>her3</italic> is a transcription factor that contains a DNA-binding domain, an orange domain, and a tetrapeptide motif at the C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hans et al., 2004</xref>). In zebrafish and mouse models, <italic>her3</italic> is expressed in the neuroepithelial stem cells of the neural plate and inhibits their premature differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hatakeyama et al., 2004</xref>). The human ortholog of <italic>her3, HES3,</italic> is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family, which includes <italic>MYOD1</italic> and <italic>MYOG</italic>, that are known to be transcriptionally targeted by <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> (14, 33). <italic>HES3</italic> acts as both a transcriptional repressor and activator, by indirectly or directly influencing transcription depending on its sub-cellular localization. <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> regulation of <italic>HES3</italic> is likely indirect. Chip-seq data from rhabdomyosarcoma cell culture indicates that <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> does not bind the <italic>HES3</italic> promoter; however, these results may differ in a dynamic developmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2010</xref>). Copy number analysis of fusion-positive patient RMS tumors finds no amplification of <italic>HES3</italic>, indicating up-regulation is at the transcriptional level. Our data suggest that <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> and <italic>HES3</italic> function linearly, with <italic>HES3</italic> being downstream of <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic>. The exact mechanisms of regulation will be addressed in future studies.</p><p><italic>HES3</italic> contributes to more aggressive disease in patients when overexpressed in the context of the <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> fusion, likely by a multi-variate platform of: (1) inhibiting terminal muscle differentiation, (2) modifying cellular plasticity to make cells that acquire the <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> fusion more tolerant of its expression, and (3) inducing additional transcriptional changes. <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> induction of <italic>HES3</italic> expression in a mesodermal lineage is ectopic, and <italic>HES3</italic> plays no known role in normal somitogenesis or myogenesis. We have found that mis-expression of <italic>HES3</italic> during embryonic development inhibits muscle differentiation. We note that <italic>HES3</italic> allows for <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> cells to inappropriately persist during embryogenesis independently of inhibiting apoptosis. In human fusion-positive RMS, which typically lack <italic>TP53</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shern et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>HES3</italic> overexpression could represent an alternative mechanism to facilitate <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> + cell persistence and tumor initiation events. This role for <italic>HES3</italic> promoting <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> + embryonic persistence is suggestive of <italic>HES3</italic>’s capacity in normal development to alter cellular plasticity. <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> in combination with <italic>HES3</italic> could be challenging the epigenetic identity of mutated cells. Finally, we provide evidence that <italic>HES3</italic> may induce a more aggressive and/or metastatic program in <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> + patient RMS, including the down-regulation of <italic>MTSS1</italic> and up-regulation of <italic>MMP3</italic> and <italic>MMP9</italic> (34, 35). Previous studies indicate that <italic>MTSS1</italic> is a target of the <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ebauer et al., 2007</xref>); therefore, the modification of <italic>MTSS1</italic> expression, and additional genes integral in cell invasion could occur in part through <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> induction of <italic>HES3</italic>. Most significantly, stratifying patient tumor data between <italic>HES3</italic> high and low expressing RMS elucidated translational molecular targets with immediate potential applications in the clinic such as co-expression of <italic>FGFR4</italic>, <italic>ALK</italic>, and <italic>PARP1</italic>.</p><p>Overall, this new <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> zebrafish model of rhabdomyosarcoma identifies <italic>her3</italic>/<italic>HES3</italic> as a mediator of tumorigenesis. Further application of this model determined mechanisms of <italic>PAX3FOXO1/HES3</italic> cooperation that result in more aggressive disease. Given the strengths of the zebrafish system, we can now apply it for drug screening and repurposing efforts. We envision the utility of our zebrafish <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> RMS model being applied for transplant experiments, where generated tumors can be propagated and grafted into adult zebrafish and in developing zebrafish embryos for further study. Zebrafish embryos containing <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> + tumor cells can be exposed to single or combinations of small molecules that effectively couple efficacy for tumor elimination with toxicity data in a vertebrate whole animal model. Additionally, zebrafish cancer models are a complementary approach to ongoing sequencing efforts of patient tumors. The functional significance of cooperating genetic mutations can be determined quickly and robustly. In our study, we find that human <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> and <italic>HES3</italic> are active in zebrafish, and that biomarkers identified in this system are relevant in the human disease. We anticipate that additional application of this new <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> driven tumor model will elucidate novel tumorigenic mechanisms and avenues for treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> transgenic zebrafish models identify <italic>HES3</italic> as a mediator of rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Kendall et al. present data showing the development of a new RMS model in zebrafish. overexpress the human <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> transgene found in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma under a series of tissue specific and ubiquitous promoters to generate germline transgenic zebrafish that differentially develop tumors at different time points. Transient β-actin driven constructs expressing either <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> or <italic>PAX3</italic> are employed to study the impact on zebrafish embryonic development and individual cell viability. <italic>her3 (HES3</italic> homolog) is identified as a differentially upregulated gene in <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> zebrafish cells. Overexpression of <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> or human <italic>HES3</italic> impairs mature muscle gene expression in zebrafish and overexpression of both increases cell survival. <italic>HES3</italic> overexpression also impairs mammalian muscle development, accelerates human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line proliferation and is found in patient tumors associated with poorer survival. Overall, this is an interesting and timely study that will add to our understanding of this disease. There are several issues raised by the three reviewers that would significantly strengthen the work:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The role of p53 and apoptosis in the observed phenotypesa) If <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> results in increased cellular apoptosis (Figure 2E and I) then how do these cells survive to contribute to tumorigenesis? Is this apoptosis p53 dependent, thus the tumors develop only in the context of mutant p53? The authors do not directly address this and should examine apoptosis (e.g. TUNEL staining) in the context of mutant p53. <italic>her3/HES3</italic> may also be contributing as illustrated in Figure 4. Moreover, <italic>PAX3</italic> injected fish had reduced fluorescence compared with GFP or mCherry controls (32% vs. 70%) – is <italic>PAX3</italic> itself contributing to apoptosis? TUNEL staining or other bona fide apoptosis assays should be included to assess if <italic>her3/HES3</italic> or <italic>PAX3</italic> itself is specifically contributing to cell survival through an anti-apoptotic mechanism.</p><p>b) In Figure 2, the survival curves and representative embryos are convincing for the effects of the translocation. Have you examined the effect of adding in the p53 mutant in terms of survival from these transgenes? What is the onset of the RMS tumors driven by the CMV promoter in the <italic>tp53</italic> mutant background? Tumour presentation of 1.6-19 months of age is a huge range. This should be addressed – is it due to the different promoters or other factors? Were any fish followed beyond 19 months? If so, did any additional tumors develop? At a minimum, the authors should provide a table that summarizes each transgenic, type of tumor and onset.</p><p>2) The role of <italic>HES3</italic>a) Have you been able to identify any cell lines that have the <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> translocation along with very high levels of <italic>HES3</italic>, and then tried to knock <italic>HES3</italic> down in that context? Does that affect tumorigenic behaviors? This would help give insight into how central <italic>HES3</italic> is, or whether it cooperates with the other genes you identified in Figure 3D (which seems likely). If such cell lines do not exist, could you speculate why <italic>HES3</italic> expression might be disfavored in the development of RMS cell lines?</p><p>b) As the authors point out, <italic>HES3</italic> is likely a transcriptional repressor, which would suggest that it is likely turning off a number of downstream pathways. From their original microarray studies in Figure 3, have they performed any type of analysis to indicate what signaling pathways might represent potential therapeutic targets in this situation? Even though therapeutic targeting is beyond the scope of this paper, it would be useful for the field to know what things they might go after in <italic>HES3</italic>+ tumors, and these pathways would be useful to bring up in the Discussion.</p><p>3) The effect of <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> on muscle biology and embryo developmenta) <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> is shown to be more toxic to developing embryos than <italic>PAX3</italic> alone (Figure 2H). For Figure 3 microarrays on whole embryos, could the gene expression differences be more indicative of cell populations lost in <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic>-expressing embryos? Do we know that the actual cells overexpressing either of these constructs are being assessed for alterations in <italic>HES3</italic> expression (i.e. is this a cell autonomous effect?).</p><p>b) Given that <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> makes cells &quot;sick&quot; (Figure 2) and the fusion exerts some of its effects through <italic>HES3</italic>, could the decreased ability of myofibers to fuse with <italic>HES3</italic> overexpression in Figure 5 be nonspecific (i.e. are the cells unable to engage a specific differentiation program, or is this effect found with mis-expression of other, perhaps many, transcription factors?)</p><p>c) Along the same lines, while qPCR data suggests that <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> zebrafish do not have muscle maturation by demonstrating low myoD expression levels, this is difficult to interpret in the context of mosaic animals and post-translational modifications of myoD. Thus, the zebrafish qPCR data should be supplemented with myoD immunofluorescence studies. Similarly, studies of myoD at the protein level (e.g. myoD and phospho-myoD by Western blot) should be done in the murine cell lines.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33800.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The role of p53 and apoptosis in the observed phenotypesa) If PAX3-FOXO1 results in increased cellular apoptosis (Figure 2E and I) then how do these cells survive to contribute to tumorigenesis?

However, in the BetaActin-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> model a sufficient number of cells escape to generate tumors (Figure 1B, F). In the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1, we explored whether this was true for the CMV-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> model which differs from BetaActin-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> in that it requires a <italic>p53</italic> mutation to generate RMS. We found that when injecting mosaic CMV-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> into wildtype or <italic>p53</italic> mutant zebrafish that <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic>+ cells were more abundant in the <italic>p53</italic> mutant background. This was not true for other injected groups including the GFP controls and GFP-<italic>PAX3</italic>.</p><p>We next performed TUNEL to test whether this abundance of <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic>+ cells was due to a dysregulation of <italic>p53</italic>-mediated apoptosis. We found that in control GFP injected groups and <italic>PAX3</italic> injected groups there was no significant difference in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis when comparing wildtype and <italic>p53</italic> mutant zebrafish. However, there was a trend of increased apoptosis in the context of <italic>PAX3</italic> injections in wildtype zebrafish versus <italic>p53</italic> mutant zebrafish. These experiments underscored that <italic>PAX3</italic> is contributing in-part to an increase in embryonic apoptosis, but that the observed effect does not account for the entire spectrum of apoptosis that is induced by the <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> fusion. In <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> injected groups there was a significant decrease in apoptosis in <italic>p53</italic> mutant zebrafish as compared to their wildtype counterparts. Therefore, in the CMV-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> model, the <italic>p53</italic> mutation is a sensitizer that allows these cells to survive and thus generate tumors later on. This model is outlined in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. This may represent a unique necessity in animal models; as both fusion-positive RMS vertebrate models of the disease (zebrafish presented here, and the <italic>Pax3-Foxo1</italic> mouse model), require that <italic>p53</italic> is mutant or lost for the generation of disease.</p><p>We detailed in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 how overexpression of human <italic>HES3</italic> contributed to the apoptosis phenotype in our CMV-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> injected zebrafish embryonic model. We co-injected zebrafish with the following experimental design: 1) <italic>HES3</italic>+control, 2) <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic>+control, and 3) <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic>+<italic>HES3</italic>. Consistent with our previous data in the BetaActin-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> model (Figure 4D-F) <italic>HES3</italic> overexpression allowed for GFP-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic>+ cells to persist. This trend was not true for GFP controls, <italic>HES3</italic> alone, or <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> injected alone. We then performed TUNEL assays to determine if apoptotic inhibition was accounting for this increase in <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic>+ cells. This is not the case as <italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic>+<italic>HES3</italic> does not ameliorate the apoptosis phenotype. This model is detailed in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. However, these experiments did confirm that <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> significantly increases apoptosis in the context of the CMV promoter, and that <italic>HES3</italic> alone does not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In Figure 2, the survival curves and representative embryos are convincing for the effects of the translocation. Have you examined the effect of adding in the p53 mutant in terms of survival from these transgenes? What is the onset of the RMS tumors driven by the CMV promoter in the tp53 mutant background? Tumour presentation of 1.6-19 months of age is a huge range. This should be addressed – is it due to the different promoters or other factors? Were any fish followed beyond 19 months? If so, did any additional tumors develop? At a minimum, the authors should provide a table that summarizes each transgenic, type of tumor and onset.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the proposed survival experiment in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B. We found that injected CMV-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> significantly decreased survival over three days of life in <italic>p53</italic> mutant embryos as compared to a wildtype background. CMV-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> survival in a <italic>p53</italic> mutant background was also significantly different from <italic>PAX3</italic> injected into a <italic>p53</italic> or wildtype background, indicating that the observed activity is due in large part to the oncogenic fusion. These data suggest that <italic>p53</italic> mutants are unable to mount the appropriate response to an oncogenic insult, thus facilitating a more amenable environment for <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic>+ cellular survival and subsequent tumor development in those embryos that do survive.</p><p>The tumor incidence curve for RMS tumors in the <italic>p53</italic> mutant background is presented in Figure 1G. The tumor spectrum, onset, and details for all presented promoters and collected zebrafish tumors are presented in Supplementary files 1 and 2. We agree that the tumor spectrum and onset vary between the BetaActin-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> and CMV-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> models and attribute this discrepancy to being a mosaic model in which <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> is under the control of different promoters in different genetic contexts. Every mosaic injection encompasses a different cellular context in which <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> is being exposed to developmental cues. We have revised the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The role of HES3a) Have you been able to identify any cell lines that have the PAX3-FOXO1 translocation along with very high levels of HES3, and then tried to knock HES3 down in that context? Does that affect tumorigenic behaviors? This would help give insight into how central HES3 is, or whether it cooperates with the other genes you identified in Figure 3D (which seems likely). If such cell lines do not exist, could you speculate why HES3 expression might be disfavored in the development of RMS cell lines?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that such experiments would delineate how essential <italic>HES3</italic> is to RMS cell survival. To identify HES3 expressing cell lines we have surveyed a panel of fusion-positive and fusion-negative RMS cell lines for <italic>HES3</italic> mRNA expression and HES3 protein expression. <italic>HES3</italic> mRNA is expressed at low levels and <italic>HES3</italic> protein is undetectable (data not shown). During normal development, <italic>HES3</italic> inhibits differentiation of neural stem cell populations. We discovered <italic>her3/HES3’s</italic> importance in the disease in a dynamic vertebrate developmental model system and have shown that <italic>HES3</italic> marks a less differentiated cellular population. We suspect <italic>HES3</italic> is lost during cell culture passaging over time due the artificial nature of culture conditions and the lack of developmental cues. Therefore, we will be exploring alternative models for studying <italic>HES3</italic> in culture systems including 3D cultures or primary patient xenografts. We anticipate 3D cultures and patient xenografts will more faithfully recapitulate <italic>HES3</italic>’s role in the development of RMS, will be a useful tool to identify novel markers of the disease, and will assess how stringently these models recapitulate each other and the patient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) As the authors point out, HES3 is likely a transcriptional repressor, which would suggest that it is likely turning off a number of downstream pathways. From their original microarray studies in Figure 3, have they performed any type of analysis to indicate what signaling pathways might represent potential therapeutic targets in this situation? Even though therapeutic targeting is beyond the scope of this paper, it would be useful for the field to know what things they might go after in HES3+ tumors, and these pathways would be useful to bring up in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. To address potential druggable targets we have analyzed RMS primary patient tumors and identified genes that are up and down-regulated in the context of <italic>HES3</italic> overexpression (Figure 7E). This analysis has identified a subset of druggable molecular targets with therapeutic implications; namely, the identification of <italic>FGFR4, PARP1</italic>, and <italic>ALK</italic> as being significantly overexpressed in <italic>HES3</italic>+ RMS. There are also targets that are downregulated which may be supplemented such as <italic>DNAJC6</italic>. We anticipate future studies will define the mechanistic contributions of these targetable genes as therapeutic strategies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The effect of PAX3-FOXO1 on muscle biology and embryo developmenta) PAX3-FOXO1 is shown to be more toxic to developing embryos than PAX3 alone (Figure 2H). For Figure 3 microarrays on whole embryos, could the gene expression differences be more indicative of cell populations lost in PAX3-FOXO1-expressing embryos? Do we know that the actual cells overexpressing either of these constructs are being assessed for alterations in HES3 expression (i.e. is this a cell autonomous effect?).</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3 the microarray was performed on RNA isolated from FACS sorted GFP positive cells from injected zebrafish embryos. Therefore, we are confident the observed expression changes are cell-autonomous events and that <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic> is upregulating <italic>her3</italic> expression within the same cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Given that PAX3-FOXO1 makes cells &quot;sick&quot; (Figure 2) and the fusion exerts some of its effects through HES3, could the decreased ability of myofibers to fuse with HES3 overexpression in Figure 5 be nonspecific (i.e. are the cells unable to engage a specific differentiation program, or is this effect found with mis-expression of other, perhaps many, transcription factors?)</p></disp-quote><p><italic>HES3</italic> is well tolerated in our overexpression systems including zebrafish models and stable cell lines. This indicates that <italic>HES3</italic> exerts a specific effect when it comes to dysregulating the engagement of myogenic differentiation. C2C12 or other myoblast fusion assays are established assays to determine genes that interfere with the fusion process. Such assays can distinguish between transcription factors or co-factors that inhibit or promote fusion. This has been the basis for high-throughput screens to identify specifically transcription factors that act as modifiers of the differentiation process (1). This strategy identified a subset of transcription factors that enhanced myogenic fusion, inhibited myogenic fusion, and a number that had no effect suggesting a specificity to the results. We have complemented our C2C12 mouse myoblast data with zebrafish developmental data in which <italic>HES3</italic> overexpression inhibits myogenesis in vivo (Figure 3C). We believe that <italic>HES3</italic> does not make the embryos sick, but rather likely promotes a modified differentiation state, and that this differentiation state is more capable of tolerating the oncogenic insult of the <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic>+ fusion. Therefore, since C2C12 myoblasts are healthy with <italic>HES3</italic> overexpression, and are capable of differentiating in some capacity after fusion induction, our interpretation is that <italic>HES3</italic> overexpression is engaging and inhibiting the differentiation program. The mechanism for this inhibition is likely indicative of <italic>HES3</italic>’s in vivo activity in combination with <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Along the same lines, while qPCR data suggests that PAX3-FOXO1 zebrafish do not have muscle maturation by demonstrating low myoD expression levels, this is difficult to interpret in the context of mosaic animals and post-translational modifications of myoD. Thus, the zebrafish qPCR data should be supplemented with myoD immunofluorescence studies. Similarly, studies of myoD at the protein level (e.g. myoD and phospho-myoD by Western blot) should be done in the murine cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4C expression of <italic>PAX3-FOXO1, HES3</italic>, and <italic>PAX3-FOXO1</italic>+<italic>HES3</italic> had no significant effect on zebrafish <italic>myod</italic> or <italic>myog</italic> expression as compared to injected controls. We tested numerous antibodies that could potentially recognize zebrafish myoD, but no antibodies cross-reacted or faithfully recapitulated its known embryonic expression patterns. Therefore, in Figure 4B we have added a panel indicating that our mosaic injected transgenes do overlay with myosin protein, one of the muscle genes assayed in Figure 4C.</p><p>This data was supplemented with MyoD protein levels in C2C12 cells overexpressing HES3. We found that there was no difference in MyoD expression during the early initiation of differentiation; however, there was a trend towards decreased MyoD expression during terminal differentiation (Figure 5—figure supplements 1-2). Therefore, we concluded that in zebrafish and mammalian systems HES3 is not acting as a dominant negative on MyoD, but perhaps is inhibiting differentiation via engaging a different mechanism.</p><p>We have found that observations made from mosaic zebrafish are predictive of results from fluorescent cell populations that are sorted from embryos. For example, in Figure 3D GFP-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic>+ cells were FACS sorted from developing embryos, and <italic>her3</italic> exhibited a 21 fold up-regulation of expression. In Figure 3E we utilized zebrafish embryos injected with mosaic GFP-<italic>PAX3FOXO1</italic> and the entire embryo was implemented for RNA isolation and qRT-PCR of <italic>her3</italic> expression levels. In this context, <italic>her3</italic> exhibited ~5 fold increase in expression as compared to controls. Therefore, the mosaic expression system is sufficient to identify meaningful differences, but the effect might be muted in comparison to cell populations that are FACS sorted.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Bakke J, Wright WC, Zamora AE, Ong SS, Wang YM, Hoyer JD, et al.
