Parkin E3 ligase activity, involving phosphorylation of ubiquitin and the Parkin ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain <italic>via</italic> as yet poorly understood mechanisms. hPINK1 is unusual amongst kinases due to the presence of three loop insertions of unknown function. We report the structure of <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> PINK1 (<italic>Tc</italic>PINK1), revealing several unique extensions to the canonical protein kinase fold. The third insertion, together with autophosphorylation at residue Ser205, contributes to formation of a bowl-shaped binding site for ubiquitin. We also define a novel structural element within the second insertion that is held together by a distal loop that is critical for <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 activity. The structure of <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 explains how PD-linked mutations that lie within the kinase domain result in hPINK1 loss-of-function and provides a platform for the exploration of small molecule modulators of hPINK1.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29985.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Estimates suggest that more than 10 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson’s disease. This condition, which is incurable, is characterised by the death of brain cells leading to tremors and loss of motor control. So far scientists have been able to link mutations in nearly 20 different genes to Parkinson’s disease. This includes the gene that codes for an enzyme called PINK1. Mutations that affect PINK1 are often seen in people with early-onset Parkinson’s disease and cases that are inherited through families.</p><p>Changes to PINK1 affects the ability of cells to keep producing energy. Without enough energy to power biochemical processes, affected cells will eventually die. Understanding why PINK1 has this effect and how to prevent it could be helpful in treating Parkinson’s disease. One way to understand the role of PINK1 is to study the three-dimensional structure of the protein to examine how it interacts with other molecules. The PINK1 protein from the flour beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> is easier to produce than human PINK1; this makes it easier to study its structure in the laboratory.</p><p>Using flour beetle PINK1 and a technique called X-ray crystallography, Kumar, Tamjar, Waddell et al. made a detailed three-dimensional model of the structure of the PINK1 protein. This revealed new details of the structure including a region at one end called the “C-terminal extension”, which is involved in PINK1’s enzyme activities. The structure also highlighted the purposes of two loop regions, one that controls PINK1 activity and one that affects its interactions with other proteins. Further examination of some of these features showed that they are also part of human PINK1 proteins.</p><p>Using this new protein structure, Kumar et al. went on to examine 20 mutations that are found in patients with Parkinson’s disease and have been able to show the effect that these changes have on PINK1 at a molecular level. It may now be possible to begin designing drugs to prevent or reverse these changes, which could lead to new treatments for Parkinson’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PINK1</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd><kwd>tribolium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waddell</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Council (BBSRC) [grant number BB/M010996/1]</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000304</institution-id><institution>Parkinson's UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G-1506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muqit</surname><given-names>Miratul MK</given-names></name><name><surname>van Aalten</surname><given-names>Daan MF</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101022/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muqit</surname><given-names>Miratul MK</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Aalten</surname><given-names>Daan MF</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of human PINK1 explains structural regulation and clarity on the impact of loss of function disease-associated mutations, which may stimulate future drug discovery efforts for both familial and idiopathic Parkinson's disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autosomal recessive inherited loss-of-function mutations in human PTEN-induced kinase 1 (hPINK1), represent the second most frequent cause of early-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Valente et al., 2004</xref>). hPINK1 has been proposed to act as a master regulator of mitochondrial quality control, promoting the elimination of damaged mitochondria via autophagy known as mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McWilliams and Muqit, 2017</xref>). In response to mitochondrial depolarisation, hPINK1 is activated and phosphorylates ubiquitin at Serine65 (Ser65). Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin then binds to the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin with high affinity, serving to prime Parkin for phosphorylation by hPINK1 at an equivalent Ser65 residue that lies within its N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kondapalli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kazlauskaite et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koyano et al., 2014</xref>). This chain of phosphorylation events stimulates maximal activation of Parkin E3 ligase activity, resulting in ubiquitylation of multiple substrates at the outer mitochondrial membrane and represents a critical upstream step in the induction of mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McWilliams and Muqit, 2017</xref>). The molecular mechanisms of hPINK1 activation and substrate recognition are poorly understood. hPINK1 is distinct from other protein kinases due to the presence of three unique insertions (Ins1, Ins2 and Ins3) within the kinase domain and a C-terminal extension (CTE) of unknown function that bears no homology to any known protein domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Nearly, 30 missense and nonsense hPINK1 mutations have been reported in patients worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deas et al., 2009</xref>), located predominantly within the kinase domain or predicted to truncate the CTE. However, the molecular mechanism by which they disrupt hPINK1 catalysis and/or recognition of its physiological substrates ubiquitin and Parkin is unknown. We have previously identified a hPINK1 orthologue in <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (<italic>Tc</italic>PINK1), which in contrast to human hPINK1, almost entirely lacks the first kinase domain insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woodroof et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 exhibits constitutive catalytic activity towards ubiquitin, Parkin and generic substrates in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woodroof et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kazlauskaite et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the motor defects of <italic>Drosophila</italic> PINK1 null flies can be efficiently rescued in vivo by crossing lines that over-express <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woodroof et al., 2011</xref>). Herein, we report the crystal structure of <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1, revealing structural insights into the CTE and kinase domain loop insertions. In particular, we show that the third insertion contributes to formation of a bowl-shaped binding site for ubiquitin that is critical for either <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 or hPINK1 mediated ubiquitin and Parkin Ubl phosphorylation. Furthermore, we have elaborated an important regulatory role for <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 autophosphorylation of Serine205 (Ser205), which together with the third insertion, aids in physiological substrate recognition. Overall, these findings provide molecular insights into the mechanisms of hPINK1 kinase activity, ubiquitin substrate recognition, and define the molecular basis of Parkinson’s disease-causing mutations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29985.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overall structure of <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain architecture of <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 showing kinase domain (150-486); location of Ins2, Ins3, catalytic motif (HRD) and activation loop motifs (DFG; APE) and CTE (487-570).

The crystal structure of <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 reveals core secondary structure elements of a typical protein kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hanks and Hunter, 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woodroof et al., 2011</xref>), the N-lobe of the <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 kinase domain contains three insertions: Lys182–Pro192 (Ins1), Glu221–Ala253 (Ins2), and Leu260–Met288 (Ins3) and in contrast to hPINK1, Ins1 exists as a loop remnant in <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Ins2 forms a small domain containing a βi-strand (222-226) and an αi-helix (231-242) followed by a loop (243-253). Ins3 is disordered and is not included in the final model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Finally, the majority of the <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 CTE (Ala487–Leu556) is α-helical in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), and rather than forming a separate domain, is tightly packed on the E, G and H α-helices of the C-lobe of the kinase domain (3747 Å<sup>2</sup> buried surface area), supporting previous data on the importance of this region for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woodroof et al., 2011</xref>). A DALI structure similarity search revealed that Ins2 and the CTE structural elements are unique to <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 and not found in the almost thousand kinase structures solved to date. Although <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 was crystallised without ATP, the kinase domain appears to adopt an active, closed conformation, based on the positioning of the αC helix, activation segment conformation, and the ‘in’ position of the DFG motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nolen et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A model of the ATP was included by superposition with the conformationally similar cAMP dependent protein kinase-ATP complex (RMSD 3.2 Å on 252 equivalent Cα atoms). This suggested that residues Ala194, Lys196, Leu344, Tyr297 and Glu217 are critical for ATP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In agreement with this, biochemical analysis revealed that the Ala194Asp, Lys196Ala and Glu217Lys <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 mutants prevented phosphorylation of its physiological substrates, ubiquitin and the Parkin Ubl domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, inspection of the structure indicates that the conformation of residues forming two conserved hydrophobic networks (the ‘R-spine’ comprising residues Ile253, Val219, Phe360, His335 and Asp410, and the ‘C-spine’ residues Val176, Leu301, Leu343, Leu344, Leu345, ILe421 and Ile417) is compatible with an active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kornev et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ins3 forms the ubiquitin binding pocket</title><p>hPINK1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser65 on ubiquitin and the Ubl domain of Parkin is critical for maximal Parkin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). However, the regions of hPINK1 that recognize and bind its substrates remain unknown. Via DALI structure similarity search, we identified the LIM kinase-cofilin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hamill et al., 2016</xref>) as being conformationally similar to <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 (RMSD 2.8 Å on 298 equivalenced Cα atoms). Using the phosphopeptide in this complex as an anchor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we superimposed Ser65 of ubiquitin onto the <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 active site, resulting in a model of the <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1-ubiquitin complex, free of steric clashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Using this model, we explored the key structural elements in <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 that may contribute to recognition of ubiquitin. Although Ins3 in the <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 kinase domain is mostly disordered and could not be built as part of the structure; its predicted location places it proximal to the ubiquitin in the model of the complex and therefore we hypothesized that it is likely to contribute a critical role towards substrate recognition and binding. To test this, we deleted 10 residues (residues 261–270, equivalent to the deletion used in the crystallisation construct) of Ins3 and measured <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 catalytic activity using multiple physiological readouts, including <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 catalysed phosphorylation of ubiquitin and the Parkin Ubl domain, and transphosphorylation of a kinase-inactive (D359A) <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 fragment (residues 125–570; His-SUMO cleaved) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We therefore hypothesized that autophosphorylation of Ser205 may influence and/or contribute to ubiquitin recognition and binding mediated by Ins3. Therefore, to test the effect of Ser205 phosphorylation in substrate recognition, we performed parallel assays with ubiquitin, Parkin Ubl domain and transphosphorylation of kinase-inactive <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 as performed for the Ins3 deletion.

Since the <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 kinase domain adopts an active conformation in our crystal structure, we sought to exploit this knowledge to probe possible mechanisms of hPINK1 activation. Activation loop phosphorylation is the most common mechanism of protein kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hanks and Hunter, 1995</xref>), with phosphorylation stabilising the active conformation via electrostatic interaction between the phospho-serine/threonine residue and a basic pocket consisting of the arginine in the HRD motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nolen et al., 2004</xref>). Previous mass spectrometry analysis of <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 did not identify activation loop phosphorylation, and furthermore, alanine mutation of a candidate T-loop phosphorylation site residue, Ser377, did not impair <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woodroof et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this, we do not observe phosphorylation of Ser377 in the <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 structure and furthermore, Ser377 is located too distant (12.2 Å) from Arg336 of the HRD motif to form an electrostatic interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Instead the <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 structure reveals that a highly conserved aspartate (Asp381) within the activation loop, an arginine residue (Arg336) of the HRD motif and an arginine residue (Arg216) in the αC-helix, form an equivalent interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which is further stabilized via interaction with basic residues (Lys212 on the αC-helix; Arg240 and Arg241 in Ins2) and another conserved aspartate (Asp366). To explore which residues were important for <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 catalysed phosphorylation of its substrates, we investigated point mutants of residues lying within this region. The Asp366Ala <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 mutant was unstable under our expression conditions and was not assessed. Importantly, our data revealed that mutants in this region, particularly the Asp381Ala and Arg240Ala mutants, were associated with a significant reduction in <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 catalytic kinase activity towards ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Although Asp381 and Asp366 are conserved in hPINK1, Lys212 and Arg216 form a basic patch on the αC-helix that is conserved among the insect orthologues but not in hPINK1, where the equivalent residues are Asn235 and Gln239. Furthermore, Arg240 and Arg241 of <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 are replaced by Gly264 and Pro265 in hPINK1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This interaction is reminiscent of the activation mechanism of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), whereby intermolecular stabilization of the CDK αC-helix occurs due to interactions with the cyclin α5-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jeffrey et al., 1995</xref>). The <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 αi-helix (residues 231–242) of Ins2 (residues 221–253) occupies a similar position to cyclin, inducing a displacement of the αC-helix and allowing formation of the key salt bridge between the conserved Glu217 on the αC-helix and the conserved Lys196 on the N-lobe, maintaining the kinase in an active conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Akin to the intermolecular CDK-cyclin interaction, the <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 αC-helix-αi-helix intramolecular interface also consists of hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Whilst the overall conservation of Ins2 (residues 221–253) is low, the C-terminal/distal region (243-253) of Ins2 remains highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), forming a loop (Ins2 loop) which tethers the proximal region of Ins2 (βi-strand and αi-helix) with the rest of the C-lobe mediated by interactions between His247 and Asn249 of Ins2 and Ser545 of CTE and Gln320 of the C-lobe, respectively. Furthermore, a hydrophobic core is formed between Leu244 and Ile250 of Ins2 with Phe360 of the ‘DFG motif’ and Ile357 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, deletion of the αi-helix (residues 231–242) alone or in combination with the βi-strand (residues 222–242) region of Ins2 does not affect the catalytic activity of <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1.

Therefore, our analysis suggests a critical role for the Ins2 loop (243-253) as an anchor, to maintaining the kinase domain in an active state, although the function of the proximal region of Ins2 (222-242) remains to be fully elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Translating structural insights to hPINK1</title><p>Sequence alignment of hPINK1 and <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 reveals an overall high degree of conservation with the exception of the relative absence of Ins1 in <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For overexpression, 1 L of Terrific broth (TB) medium was inoculated with 10 ml of overnight culture. Cultures were propagated in a shaking incubator (Infors HT) at 37°C and 200 rpm until OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.6–0.8. Temperature was then reduced to 16°C upon which cultures were supplemented with 100 µM IPTG and grown overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 25 min (Beckman coulter J6-Mi centrifuge). Cell pellets were carefully resuspended in ~4 × cell volume of lysis buffer (50 mM EPPS pH 8.6, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 3% sucrose, 5 mM imidazole) at 12°C by gentle shaking (150 rpm). Before lysis, 0.5 mM TCEP pH 7.5 (from Apollo Scientific, United Kingdom), 0.1 mM Pefabloc (Sigma Aldrich, United Kingdom), and 10 µM Leupeptin (Apollo Scientific) were added to the mixture. Cells were then lysed by sonication (6 × 10 s pulses at 10 s intervals, 45% amplitude) and to remove the cell debris, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 25 min at 4°C (Beckman Avanti J-30 I centrifuge).</p><p>For protein purification, the supernatant was incubated with Nickel sepharose beads previously equilibrated with 10 CV binding buffer (50 mM EPPS pH 8.6, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 3% sucrose, 5 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, pH 7.5) for 1 hr at 4°C on a roller. Thereafter, the beads were collected by filtration and washed thoroughly (800 ml −1 L) with binding buffer containing 30 mM imidazole. The protein was then eluted from the beads using the elution buffer (50 mM EPPS pH 8.6, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 3% sucrose, 400 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, pH 7.5). The eluted protein was mixed with His-SENP1 protease (1 mg of His-SENP1 per 25 mg of <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1) to cleave off the SUMO tag and dialyzed into 30 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 3% sucrose, 0.25 mM TCEP, pH 7.5 at 4°C overnight (using 3.5 kDa SnakeSkin dialysis tubing; Thermo Fisher). The dialyzed mixture was subjected to negative pull down using Nickel sepharose resin to remove the His-SUMO and <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 was concentrated to ~5 ml. Reductive methylation of lysine residues was then performed (as described in Hampton Research Protocols) before loading onto a gel filtration column (HiLoad Superdex 16/600, GE Healthcare), previously equilibrated with the gel filtration buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 3% sucrose, 2 mM TCEP, pH 7.5).

For overexpression, purification and methylation of selenomethionine (SeMet) <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 derivatives, an identical protocol was used (using MD12-500 kit from Molecular Dimensions to incorporate selenomethionine). Native and selenomethionine derivatised <italic>Tc</italic>PINK1 was crystallised using 5 mg/ml of protein mixing with 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 20% PEG 6000 and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> or 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 25% PEG 3350 and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, respectively, under vapor diffusion sitting drop method. Crystals were flash frozen using 20% of glycerol with mother liquor. Data were collected at ESRF, with a SeMet anomalous data set collected at the selenium absorption edge. Selenomethionine-incorporated and native crystals diffracted to 3.4 Å and 2.8 Å, respectively. Data were processed using XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kabsch, 2014</xref>) and AIMLESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Winn et al., 2011</xref>).

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structure and activation mechanism of the Parkinson's disease kinase PINK1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tony Hunter as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kalle Gehring (Reviewer #1); Stefan Knapp (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers all found this description of a first structure of a member of the PINK1 family of kinases to represent an exciting advance in the field, but had a number of suggestions for improvement and reorganization.</p><p>The main points to be taken into account in a revised version are as follows:</p><p>1) You need to stress in the title, Abstract and throughout the paper that the structure is that of TcPINK1. Otherwise, the reader may be led to believe that the paper describes the structure of the human PINK1 catalytic domain. In addition, since you have not established the mechanism of activation of human PINK1, &quot;activation mechanism&quot; should be removed from the title.</p><p>2) Since TcPINK1 is constitutively active, you should be more cautious about what this catalytic domain structure tells us about the activation mechanism of human PINK1, i.e. you need to state/discuss more explicitly what regulatory mechanisms derived from the structure of TcPINK1 are relevant to hPINK1 and what aspects of hPINK1 regulation might be different.</p><p>3) Your proposal that Ins2 activates the catalytic domain through a cyclin-like interaction with the C-helix is intriguing and novel, but, although you carried out mutagenesis experiments to define the ATP-binding pocket, you did not conduct any direct mutagenesis experiments to verify that an interaction between Ins2 and the C-helix is important for activity of the catalytic domain. As you indicate, you have previously reported that the H271Q mutation, which lies in Ins2, reduces TcPINK1 kinase activity (Woodroof et al., 2011), but there is no discussion of why this mutation should be deleterious, and the H271 residue and its contacts are not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Ideally, you need to analyze the effects of mutating a C-helix interface residue in Ins2 predicted by your structure to be inactivating to bolster the conclusion that Ins2 activates TcPINK1 by a cyclin-like contact with the C-helix.</p><p>4) Both human and TcPINK1 have been shown to be activated by phosphorylation of Ser228 (human)/Ser205 (TcPINK1), but this site is not discussed at all. Instead, you describe the contacts and supposed regulatory importance of the Ins2 region but with no indication of how those contacts would be modified as part of a regulatory mechanism. The argument in the Results and Discussion that human PINK1 is regulated and TcPINK1 constitutive is unproven. An equally plausible explanation is that the human protein is unstable when purified and/or inherently less active. Related to this, the statement that the authors were &quot;we were unable to confirm […] by mutagenesis&quot; the significance of the amino acid differences between human and TcPINK1 (subsection “Mechanisms of PINK1 autoactivation”) needs to be better explained. Was it a negative result or was the experiment unsuccessful?</p><p><italic>eLife</italic> revise decision letters normally do not provide the full reviews, but only a summary of the main issues that need to be addressed. However, in this case, we have decided to provide the three reviews in full so that you can see all the concerns, and revise the paper accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic> </p><p>Kumar and colleagues report the structure of PINK1, a kinase involved in mitochondrial autophagy and a recessive early-onset form of Parkinson's disease. The discovery three years ago of phosphorylation of ubiquitin by PINK1 has generated intense interest in the kinase and its potential as a drug target. The authors have determined the structure of an insect orthologue and modeled its interaction with its substrates, ubiquitin and ATP. Using the structure, they have generated a mutant that is defective for ubiquitin phosphorylation but retains activity for autophosphorylation and myelin basic protein.</p><p>The main problem with the manuscript is its presentation. The figures are poorly conceived and repetitive and the order of presentation of the results is confusing. From a scientific standpoint, the article is outstanding and a significant, major contribution to the field.</p><p>1) The presentation of the structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> will be more easily understood by the large kinase community if the standard orientation is used: the N-lobe above the C-lobe and the activation loop toward the reader. The activation loop should be indicated in the figure and the model of ATP binding derived from the LIM kinase structure removed. I suggest moving <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. While I understand the authors' motivation for showing the ATP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it is a bit confusing since i) it is a model and not part of the crystal structure determined and ii) the DALI search that identifies the LIM kinase structure isn't presented until much later in the paper. To add to the confusion, the figure does not show AMP-PNP. Instead, there appears to be a sulfur on the γ phosphate. (As an aside, I'll point out that given that it is a model, there is no reason to show AMP-PNP rather than ATP. The authors should also make sure that the font sizes are consistent across the different panels and aim to keep the figures as simple and easy to interpret as possible.)</p><p>2) As an alternative to the current organization, the authors might consider putting all of the enzymatic kinase assays into a single figure. My suggestion would be the structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> with location of PD mutations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and possibly the modeled ATP. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> could be the kinase assays and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> could present the comparison with LIMK1 and docking of ubiquitin. This should help to remove some of the duplications. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref> would be combined and only shown once.</p><p>3) Move <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> to the supplemental material and Figure S3 should be part of the kinase activity figure in the main manuscript.</p><p>4) Add paragraph breaks to the Introduction to improve the legibility.</p><p>5) The text in the Results and Discussion should explain the use S205E phosphomimetic referencing the Woodroof 2011 paper. I found it curious that there was no discussion of the importance of this residue for kinase activity when it reportedly has a greater effect on activity than loss of S207. E205 is shown in the example electron density but no reference is made to its interactions with other residues. S207 and E205 might be hidden somewhere in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>/2 but I couldn't find them.</p><p>6) The explanation of the activation of PINK1 in the subsection “Mechanisms of PINK1 autoactivation” was confusing. Since the TcPINK1 kinase domain adopts an active conformation, it wasn't clear how to interpret the intermolecular interactions listed. Do the authors expect that these will be lost in human PINK1? If so, how is human PINK1 activated? The kinase assays show TcPINK1 autophosphorylates. Where is the phosphorylation site? Does this regulate its activity or is TcPINK1 constitutively active?</p><p>7) The authors should expand the discussion of the relationship of PINK1 to other kinases. Sequence analysis (BLAST) shows much greater similarity to calmodulin kinases than LIMK1 so the observation of LIMK1 as the top hit is unexpected. What were the other DALI hits? Is LIMK1 really the best model for positioning of the ATP?</p><p>8) In the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, it isn't clear which are confirmed effects of the mutations and which are predicted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Kumar et al. entitled &quot;Structure and activation mechanism of the Parkinson's disease kinase PINK1&quot;reports the crystal structure of the catalytic and C-terminal domain of <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> homologue of the kinase PINK1. The structure revealed a canonical catalytic domain fold with a helical C-terminal domain. From the three inserts present in human PINK1 the first insert is missing in TcPINK1, the second insert was deleted and the third insert was present but unstructured. The authors report that similar to the cyclin interaction in CDKs an α helical motif stabilizes the active state. In addition, the disordered third insert motif seems to be important for substrate recognition (ubiquitin) and a molecular model of the PINK1 substrate interaction was constructed based on the recently published LIMK substrate (cofilin) complex. Finally the authors analyze the effect of mutations found in PD revealing that many mutations are in positions that are important for PINK1 catalytic function such as the ATP binding pocket.</p><p>Human PINK1 is a structurally very diverse kinase with a strong link to the development of PD. To date structural studies on the human enzyme have been hampered due to difficulties expressing stable and large amounts of this unusual kinase. A structural model that provides insights into the regulation of PINK1, the role of its unusual inserts and the consequences of PD mutations is therefore very welcome and informative. However, I had to read until the end of the Introduction to find out that the presented structure is actually based on the TcPINK1 sequence. I think therefore that this should be highlighted in the title, Abstract and impact statement. Also a more detailed sequence comparison would be helpful to judge how this model can help to provide insight on the regulation of the human enzyme (maybe as supplemental material). How high is the overall sequence homology? In addition, the deletion of loop regions and mutations aiding crystallization should be annotated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>It seems that there are clear differences in the activation of TcPINK and human PINK1. For instance the first large insert is missing. Is this insert required for human PINK1 function? In addition, TcPINK1 is constitutively active whereas the human enzyme may require activation. While certain aspects of PINK1 regulation (e.g. the substrate recognition) may be shared between TcPINK1 and hPINK1 there seems to be clear differences in the regulation of this enzyme in higher eukaryotes. Despite these limitations I think however that the presented structural data are very useful and informative and based on the interested in the role of PINK1 in PD the article may trigger functional studies on the human enzyme and it will be widely read. My recommendation is therefore to simply make the paper more transparent and to highlight the limitation of the current structural model more clearly in the revised version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript reports the crystal structure of PINK1, a Ser/Thr protein kinase involved in regulation (phosphorylation) of ubiquitin. The authors crystallized a <italic>T. castaneum</italic> orthologue of human PINK1 (TcPINK1 and hPINK1), the construct of which included, in addition to the kinase domain, N-terminal domains Ins2 and Ins3 and C-terminal domain CTE. The structure was determined at 2.8 Å resolution (not 2.7 Å, as reported in Results) and reveals the structure of the kinase domain, Ins2, and the CTE. The kinase domain is observed to be in an active state, with the alphaC-beta3 salt bridge intact and a DFG-in activation loop configuration. Ins2 and the CTE make interactions with the kinase domain that are probably important for kinase regulation.</p><p>Major concern:</p><p>Contrary to their claim in the Title and Abstract, the authors do not really reveal the activation mechanisms of hPINK1. They state that TcPINK1 is active in vitro (the crystal structure evidently shows why), but hPINK1 is not active in vitro. Why hPINK1 is not active and how it becomes activated are not explored.</p><p>Other substantive concerns:</p><p>1) The authors speculate from the TcPINK1 crystal structure that Ins2 activates the kinase domain via a cyclin-CDK mechanism (involving αC). While this seems quite plausible based on the structure (and is arguably the most important feature of the structure), the authors did not perform any mutagenesis experiments to verify this.</p><p>2) The authors speculate that Ins3, which is just upstream of the kinase domain and which is disordered in their crystal structure, interacts with ubiquitin to provide substrate specificity. To test this, they make a 10-residue deletion construct of Ins3 in TcPINK1 and show that ubiquitin phosphorylation is abrogated, whereas MBP phosphorylation (non-specific substrate, negative control) is less affected. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, though, MBP phosphorylation is down over 5-fold, indicating that the Ins3 deletion is probably affecting PINK1 stability, in addition to affecting (possibly) specific ubiquitin phosphorylation. A generic peptide substrate might serve as a better negative control.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29985.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers all found this description of a first structure of a member of the PINK1 family of kinases to represent an exciting advance in the field, but had a number of suggestions for improvement and reorganization.</p><p>The main points to be taken into account in a revised version are as follows:</p><p>1) You need to stress in the title, Abstract and throughout the paper that the structure is that of TcPINK1.

Exploiting the TcPINK1 structure, we have now included cell based experimental analysis of hPINK1 to show that the ATP-binding and ubiquitin substrate recognition mechanisms are conserved between hPINK1 and TcPINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Employing cell based assays of hPINK1 we show that Ins1 (that is not conserved in TcPINK1) does not play any role in the regulation of hPINK1-directed phosphorylation of substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>We have included new functional data showing the importance of the basic patch of residues around the catalytic pocket of TcPINK1 for activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

We further highlight that H247 lies within a highly conserved C-terminal loop of Ins2 (residues 243-253) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Mutational analysis of distinct truncations of Ins2 indicate that this C-terminal loop (243-253) of Ins2, where H247 resides, is crucial for PINK1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly we find that deletion of the αi-helix (231-242) alone or the combined βi-strand and αi-helix (222-242) region of Ins2 does not significantly affect the kinase activity of TcPINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) or hPINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) under the assay conditions used. Therefore, the role of the proximal region of Ins2 remains uncertain and requires further investigation. We have substantially revised the text to explain these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Both human and TcPINK1 have been shown to be activated by phosphorylation of Ser228 (human)/Ser205 (TcPINK1), but this site is not discussed at all.

We now include new data on Ser205 that has revealed an exciting and functionally important contribution of Ser205 phosphorylation in PINK1 activity towards substrates.

We have also studied the role of another phosphorylation site, Ser207, that was captured in the crystal structure, but this lies on the surface and apparently does not affect PINK1 phosphorylation of ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We have included a detailed sequence alignment between TcPINK1 and hPINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), alongside our previous multiple sequence alignment between various organism highlighting important regions around the αC-helix, Ins2 and the activation loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the basic patch residues within the catalytic pocket of TcPINK1, we have now explained the differences between hPINK1 and TcPINK1 as follows “To explore which residues were critical for PINK1 catalysed phosphorylation of its substrates we investigated point mutants of residues lying within this region.

In addition, the deletion of loop regions and mutations aiding crystallization should be annotated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these points separately above in the response to the Editor’s comments (comments 1-4) including change of title, highlighting that the study is based upon TcPINK1 in the Abstract, inclusion of detailed sequence comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and describing the crystallisation construct in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems that there are clear differences in the activation of TcPINK and human PINK1. For instance the first large insert is missing. Is this insert required for human PINK1 function? In addition, TcPINK1 is constitutively active whereas the human enzyme may require activation. While certain aspects of PINK1 regulation (e.g. the substrate recognition) may be shared between TcPINK1 and hPINK1 there seems to be clear differences in the regulation of this enzyme in higher eukaryotes. Despite these limitations I think however that the presented structural data are very useful and informative and based on the interested in the role of PINK1 in PD the article may trigger functional studies on the human enzyme and it will be widely read. My recommendation is therefore to simply make the paper more transparent and to highlight the limitation of the current structural model more clearly in the revised version.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these points separately above in the response to the Editor’s comments (comments 1-4)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>[…] Major concern:</p><p>Contrary to their claim in the Title and Abstract, the authors do not really reveal the activation mechanisms of hPINK1. They state that TcPINK1 is active in vitro (the crystal structure evidently shows why), but hPINK1 is not active in vitro. Why hPINK1 is not active and how it becomes activated are not explored.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comments that the reasons for the inactivity of hPINK1 enzyme are still not clear and may be due to instability as also pointed by another referee. Therefore, we have removed the “activation mechanism” from the title and Abstract. We have also included new experiments in the revised manuscript including mutational analyses in hPINK1 enzyme as described above separately in response to Editor’s comments. We agree that understanding how hPINK1 is activated is interesting but further work will be required to decipher the activation mechanism for hPINK1 and is beyond the scope of this report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other substantive concerns:</p><p>1) The authors speculate from the TcPINK1 crystal structure that Ins2 activates the kinase domain via a cyclin-CDK mechanism (involving αC). While this seems quite plausible based on the structure (and is arguably the most important feature of the structure), the authors did not perform any mutagenesis experiments to verify this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed and included the assay results for testing the effect of Ins2 deletions on PINK1 activity in the revised manuscript. This is stated in more detail above in the response to the Editor’s comments (comments 1-4)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors speculate that Ins3, which is just upstream of the kinase domain and which is disordered in their crystal structure, interacts with ubiquitin to provide substrate specificity. To test this, they make a 10-residue deletion construct of Ins3 in TcPINK1 and show that ubiquitin phosphorylation is abrogated, whereas MBP phosphorylation (non-specific substrate, negative control) is less affected. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, though, MBP phosphorylation is down over 5-fold, indicating that the Ins3 deletion is probably affecting PINK1 stability, in addition to affecting (possibly) specific ubiquitin phosphorylation. A generic peptide substrate might serve as a better negative control.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern about PINK1 stability, therefore, we have performed thermal denaturation assays on the mutants. The thermal shift assay data does not show any significant changes in the stability of mutants suggesting that the effect of Ins3 on substrate recognition is not due to instability of the mutant enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Furthermore, we have established that TcPINK1 can trans-phosphorylate other TcPINK1 molecules (kinase-inactive variants) and used this assay to show that Ins3 deletion does not impact on TcPINK1 trans-phosphorylation but does prevent ubiquitin phosphorylation. We think that the TcPINK1 trans-phosphorylation is more physiological than generic substrates and peptides and have presented this in the final analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Thermal shift assay of TcPINK1 mutants</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29985-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
