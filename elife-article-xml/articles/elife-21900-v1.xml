How the extent of gene conversions is regulated is unknown. Here we show that the budding yeast mismatch repair related MutLβ complex, Mlh1-Mlh2, specifically interacts with the conserved meiotic Mer3 helicase, which recruits it to recombination hotspots, independently of mismatch recognition. This recruitment is essential to limit gene conversion tract lengths genome-wide, without affecting crossover formation. Contrary to expectations, Mer3 helicase activity, proposed to extend the displacement loop (D-loop) recombination intermediate, does not influence the length of gene conversion events, revealing non-catalytical roles of Mer3. In addition, both purified Mer3 and MutLβ preferentially recognize D-loops, providing a mechanism for limiting gene conversion in vivo. These findings show that MutLβ is an integral part of a new regulatory step of meiotic recombination, which has implications to prevent rapid allele fixation and hotspot erosion in populations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21900.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21900.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

promotes genome diversification in sexually reproducing organisms. Recombination shuffles parental genomes through genetic exchanges leading to crossovers (COs) or noncrossovers (NCOs). During meiotic prophase, repair of Spo11-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by recombination into COs is crucial for the formation of gametes with normal chromosome content. Indeed, COs ensure a physical link between homologs that allows them to properly segregate to opposite poles during meiosis I division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hunter, 2015</xref>). DSBs occur in excess over COs, so many DSBs repaired as noncrossovers (NCOs), without exchange of flanking sequences.</p><p>Both COs and NCOs involve the formation of heteroduplex DNA, which can yield gene conversions after mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Gene conversions consist of the unidirectional transfer of genetic information from one parental chromosome to the other. Gene conversions therefore result in non-Mendelian segregation and transmission distortion, and also largely contribute to the extinction of recombination-promoting sequences (hotspots) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the importance of gene conversion in promoting genetic diversity, the factors that regulate the extent of sequences converted at each recombination site are not known.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21900.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of gene conversion during meiotic recombination on allele shuffling and erosion of cis-acting hotspot sequences.</title><p>Two homologous chromatids are shown in red and blue, the red one having a DSB formed by Spo11. A, B and C represent alleles, with the b allele being present on the red homolog. The star represents a cis-acting hotspot promoting sequence. Following DNA end resection and strand invasion of the intact DNA duplex, the red homolog sequences are copied from the blue one, creating heteroduplexes (indicated by a green square), that are next corrected by mismatch repair, leading either to gene conversion or restoration. After gene conversion, the b allele on the broken chromosome has been converted to the B allele, and the hotspot promoting sequence has been converted to the blue sequence.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21900.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21900.002</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-21900-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>To repair a subset of DSBs into COs, cells mainly employ a meiosis-specific pathway that ensures an even distribution of COs across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). For this, after the initial strand invasion of a homologous DNA template by the 3’ end of the resected DSB, the resulting D-loop intermediate is stabilized by a group of proteins called ‘ZMM’, that lead to the single-end invasion (SEI) intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Börner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter and Kleckner, 2001</xref>). The ZMM proteins in budding yeast comprise Zip1, Zip2, Zip3, Zip4, Spo16, the Mer3 helicase, and the Msh4-Msh5 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lynn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shinohara et al., 2008</xref>). A proposed function of the ZMM proteins is to protect recombination intermediates from the action of helicases, such as Sgs1 in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jessop et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oh et al., 2007</xref>), which may dismantle the joint molecules, leading to synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) resulting in non-crossovers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These ZMM- stabilized intermediates then mature in double Holliday junctions, which are specifically resolved into COs at the pachytene stage, likely by MutLγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allers and Lichten, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter and Kleckner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zakharyevich et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>MutLγ (Mlh1-Mlh3), a heterodimer related to the bacterial mismatch repair MutL complex, forms foci on pachytene mouse, human or plant chromosomes in numbers that correspond to CO numbers. In the absence of MutLγ, CO frequency is reduced in mouse meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edelmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guillon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lipkin et al., 2002</xref>) as well as in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunter and Borts, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nishant et al., 2008</xref>). CO remaining in the absence of MutLγ likely result from cleavage of recombination intermediates by alternate structure-specific nucleases (Mus81, Yen1, Slx1-4) that normally play a minor role and are only activated late in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Muyt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zakharyevich et al., 2012</xref>). The integrity of the nuclease active site of Mlh3 is required for MutLγ function in CO formation, and MutLγ has thus been proposed to cleave and resolve double Holliday junctions into crossovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nishant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ranjha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rogacheva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zakharyevich et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In mismatch repair (MMR), the MutS homologs (Msh2-Msh3 and Msh2-Msh6) are involved in mismatch recognition and recruit either of two MutL heterodimers, MutLα (Mlh1-Pms1 in yeast, MLH1-PMS2 in human) and to a lesser degree MutLγ (Mlh1-Mlh3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li and Modrich, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lipkin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Räschle et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 1999</xref>). Both MutLα and to a lesser degree MutLγ bear an endonuclease activity that is involved in MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gueneau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>). MMR corrects bases misincorporated during replication, but also mismatches formed during homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The third MutL heterodimer, Mlh1-Mlh2 (MLH1-PMS1 in mammals) or MutLβ, has an elusive function. No biochemical activity has been described, and the human MutLβ has no MMR activity in in vitro complementation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Räschle et al., 1999</xref>). Consistently, in mammalian cells, PMS1 deficiency leads to a very small increase in mutation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prolla et al., 1998</xref>). Yeast <italic>mlh2∆</italic> cells show no increase in mutation rates, except a slight defect in the repair of a subset of frameshift mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campbell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harfe et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, Mlh2 forms spontaneous Msh2-dependent foci in S-phase that partially co-localize with Pms1, suggesting that MutLβ may be a non-essential accessory factor of MutLα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campbell et al., 2014</xref>). PMS1-/- mice are fertile, suggesting no gross defect in meiotic recombination, contrary to MLH1-/- or MLH3-/- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prolla et al., 1998</xref>). In yeast meiosis, <italic>mlh2∆</italic> cells show normal spore viability. However, an increase in conversion of markers flanking several recombination hotspots was observed in <italic>mlh2∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used a proteomic approach to identify meiotic partners of Mlh1 in budding yeast. We discovered that MutLβ controls a new regulatory step of meiotic recombination that limits the length of meiotic gene conversion tracts associated with COs and NCOs. This regulation requires a physical interaction between the MutLβ complex and the meiosis-specific helicase, Mer3.

To obtain a functional tagged allele of Mlh1, we used the crystal structure of the yeast Mlh1-Pms1 C-terminal domain that we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gueneau et al., 2013</xref>), and chose a solvent accessible loop in the Mlh1 C-terminal domain remote from the endonuclease site and from the Exo1 binding site to insert internal tags and perform molecular studies of Mlh1 complexes during meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The resulting Flag- and HA- <italic>MLH1</italic> tagged alleles were fully functional in mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In addition, in meiosis, both alleles conferred full spore viability, contrary to <italic>mlh1∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Finally, both His-Flag- and HA- internally tagged <italic>MLH1</italic> alleles produced wild-type frequencies of crossing over at the <italic>HIS4LEU2</italic> meiotic recombination hotspot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

However, in meiotic cells, Mlh1 interaction was still observed with Mer3 deleted of its C-terminal part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>, Mer3∆C). Instead, the Mer3 protein deleted for its IG-like domain (Mer3∆IG) no longer interacted with Mlh1 in meiotic cells, suggesting that a third protein interacting with this region may bridge the in vivo interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mer3 interacts with the MutLβ (Mlh1-Mlh2) complex both in vitro and in meiotic cells</title><p>To identify the factor that may help bridge the interaction between Mer3 and Mlh1 in vivo, we performed a Mer3-Flag pulldown from synchronous meiotic cells. Mer3 not only pulled down Mlh1, but also Mlh2, the Mlh1 partner in the MutLβ heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). We found that Mlh2 was important to mediate the interaction between Mlh1 and Mer3 in vivo, indicating formation of a tripartite complex between Mer3 and Mlh1-Mlh2 (MutLβ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).</p><p>To extend this observation, we further tested for direct interactions using purified proteins. Recombinant Mer3 strongly interacted in vitro with the purified MutLβ complex, showing that the interaction is direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

In contrast, for mouse proteins, the interaction between HFM1 and MLH1 is very strong, compared to that between HFM1 and PMS1. In both systems however, Mer3/HFM1 forms a complex with the MutLβ heterodimer.</p><p>As anticipated from a protein interacting with Mer3, Mlh2 associated with meiotic DSB hotspot sites, at the time of recombination, in a Spo11 DSB-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c and d</xref>). Remarkably, Mlh2 association with the <italic>BUD23</italic> and <italic>GAT1</italic> hotspots no longer occurred in the <italic>mer3R893E</italic> mutant, implying that Mer3 recruits Mlh2 to these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Surprisingly, Mlh2 recruitment to the <italic>HIS4LEU2</italic> hotspot was reduced, but not eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). The <italic>HIS4LEU2</italic> hotspot contains one base polymorphism between the two alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter and Kleckner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martini et al., 2006</xref>), which potentially creates a mismatch during interhomolog recombination and the formation of a D-loop intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>).

Although the Mer3 helicase activity seems to be involved in promoting normal CO frequency, we reveal that Mer3’s ZMM function is largely non-catalytical, and may involve the recruitment of additional ZMM proteins to stabilize recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Börner et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A molecular function for the MutLβ complex, independent of mismatch recognition</title><p>MutLβ is recruited to recombination sites through mismatch recognition and Mer3. However, these recruitment modes are not redundant. Recruitment through mismatches does not restrain GC tract length as seen in the <italic>mer3R893E</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>), and MutLβ efficiently restrains GC tract length in the absence of Msh2. This shows that MutLβ participates in two distinct processes at recombination sites. The novel structural rather than catalytical role of MutLβ that we described here is in contrast with its MutLα and γ relatives, which require nuclease activities for their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kadyrov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nishant et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, our findings provide a role for MutLβ, which has been elusive for almost 30 years, and show that MutLβ is the only MutL complex that functions independently of a MutS-related heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manhart and Alani, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, a recent comparative genomics study revealed that Mlh2 is lost concomitantly with the ZMM proteins in the <italic>Lachancea</italic> budding yeast clade, consistent with the functional connection we describe here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vakirlis et al., 2016</xref>). It is also interesting that in vegetative budding yeast cells, <italic>mlh2∆</italic> mutants show higher resistance to DNA damaging drugs, which led to the proposal that MutLβ could inhibit Rad51-dependent recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durant et al., 1999</xref>). Perhaps a mechanism similar to the one we describe for meiosis is at play, in which MutLβ limits the formation of early recombination intermediates. Its deletion would favor the stabilization of early recombination intermediates and homologous recombination. It is worth noticing that in human cells, PMS1 (the Mlh2 homolog) interacts with several helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannavo et al., 2007</xref>). The functionality of these interactions has not been determined yet.</p><p>Finally, our study reinforces the tight links that exist between homologous recombination and mismatch repair related MutL complexes. It is fascinating that two of the three MutL complexes are an integral part of the meiotic homologous recombination process. Since MutLβ and MutLγ both contain Mlh1, our results also reveal an unprecedented early role of Mlh1 at meiotic recombination intermediates, within the MutLβ complex. Mlh1 is classically used as a cytological marker of crossovers in several organisms such as mammals, where it forms foci on synapsed homologs, but given the conserved interaction between Mer3 and MutLβ in mammals, careful examination may reveal earlier Mlh1 foci on meiotic chromosomes, as early as in leptotene/zygotene stage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Control of the length of gene conversions: a new regulatory step of meiotic recombination</title><p>We did not detect a pronounced effect of the over-extended recombination intermediates on CO frequency. Regarding the proposed role of extending the D-loop into a single-end intermediate for promoting COs, one could have expected <italic>mlh2∆</italic> or <italic>mer3R893E</italic> mutant to produce more COs, because a longer intermediate would be resistant to disruption by helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Muyt et al., 2012</xref>). However, CO number in budding yeast and other organisms is highly regulated, especially by CO interference, which limits crossovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hunter, 2015</xref>). Since interference is still fully active in the <italic>mlh2∆</italic> and <italic>mer3R893E</italic> mutants, we infer that the CO decision is made before or irrespective of the extension of joint molecules in the absence of Mlh2.</p><p>There are other examples of mutants, which affect the length of D-loops but have no effect on CO frequency. An <italic>exo1</italic> nuclease-dead mutant displayed reduced DNA end resection length, which was expected to form shorter, less stable D-loops, but in contrast no change in CO frequency was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zakharyevich et al., 2010</xref>). This ‘buffering’ effect may be related to the phenomenon of crossover homeostasis, which maintains CO numbers, even in compromised recombination contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martini et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Why would meiotic cells limit the extent of sequences involved in gene conversions? Strikingly, gene conversion tracts are much longer in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> somatic recombination than in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yim et al., 2014</xref>), consistent with the meiosis-specific nature of the negative regulation by Mer3-MutLβ. Compared to somatic recombination, a specificity of meiosis is the simultaneous induction of high numbers of programmed DSBs, potentially very dangerous for genome integrity and that need to be controlled. It may be detrimental for pairing and/or chromosome disentangling to expose too long DNA sequences, or to run into functional elements such as centromeres or the sequences that attach chromatin loops to the meiotic chromosome axis. In <italic>Sordaria</italic> meiosis, Mlh1 mutants show an increased frequency of entanglements, suggesting a function at an earlier stage than crossover resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Storlazzi et al., 2010</xref>). These may be related to the over-extension of D-loops that we see in the absence of MutLβ and its interaction with Mer3.</p><p>Interestingly, limiting gene conversion specifically in meiosis may also serve the purpose of avoiding, in the long term, breaking of ancestral linkage groups of favorable combination of alleles and homogenizing alleles in a population that may occur when DSB formation is more frequent on one allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, in human and mice, recombination is initiated at site-specific sequences, which could be frequently erased by conversion tracts, leading to the rapid extinction of hotspots, in the absence of a limiting mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baudat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and media</title><p>All yeast strains are derivative of the SK1 background except otherwise stated and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Concerted action of the MutLβ heterodimer and Mer3 helicase regulates the global extent of meiotic gene conversion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Hannah L Klein (Reviewer #3), and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript provides a novel function for the Mlh1-Mlh2 (MutLβ) heterodimer, a conserved protein complex whose primary function has, to date, remained elusive. It shows that Mlh1-Mlh2 interacts with Mer3, a meiosis-specific helicase previously implicated as having crossover-promoting function, and that the two work together to limit the length of heteroduplex tracts formed during meiotic recombination in a manner that appears to be largely independent of Mer3 helicase activity. Because all proteins in this study are conserved in many eukaryotes, including mammals, it is highly likely that these findings will be of general applicability.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A reorganization and better introduction of the key facts are needed, the paper would benefit from having all in vitro interaction data presented in one place so that direct comparisons can be made or model recombination substrate interaction data should be presented independent of meiotic data.</p><p>In addition, you should consider having someone not immediately in the field read the manuscript to make sure that the big picture and the flow of the data are easy to understand. The following suggestions should also be attended in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Understanding the larger aspects of the paper are difficult for the non-specialist. A cartoon figure of meiotic recombination and segregation at the beginning would help. For example, in the first two paragraphs of the Introduction, it is not easy to follow how recombination shuffles parental genomes through COs and NCOs or how these concepts extend to allelic shuffling, transmission distortion or gene conversion tract length, few lines later.</p><p>Interaction between Mer3 and Mlh1 or Mlh2 is well-documented, but not with the intact Mlh1-Mlh2 complex, even though purification of this complex is documented. Demonstrating this interaction should be the primary in vitro interaction data presented. While the paper presents the Mer3-MutLβ interaction as being mediated through Mlh2, it is clear from the in vitro data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) that Mlh1 is also capable of interacting with Mer3, although with lower affinity. This needs to be more even-handedly discussed in the paper text.</p><p>Yeast two-hybrid data will be better interpreted if they are not scattered throughout different supplementary figures and the standards to define an interaction are the same throughout the manuscript. For example, in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, limited growth on -His plates and none on -His -Ade is taken as a signal of a significant interaction, while later (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) the relevant assay seems to have shifted towards whether or not growth occurs on -His -Ade.</p><p>There's much more focus on 2-hybrid assays using Mlh1 and Mer3 than on Mlh2 and Mer3, even though authors argue that Mlh2 is responsible for bridging between Mlh1 and Mer3.</p><p>All two-hybrid data should be presented in a single place and two-hybrid experiments should be presented in parallel with internal standards (for example, including Mlh2 + Mlh1 on every plate).</p><p>Analysis of Mlh1-Mer3 and Mlh2-Mer3 interactions would be greatly strengthened if experiments were done in mlh2- and mlh1- mutants, to directly test bridging interactions.</p><p>The model intermediate-binding activity of MutLβ is quite weak, as compared to Mer3, and only poorly discriminates model recombination intermediates from dsDNA. It's hard to directly assess this, since the critical data for MutLβ (at 10nM) is obscured by the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. This can be solved doing the following: 1) present graphs of MutLβ and Mer3 binding together in one figure, along with the cartoons of the model substrates, but move the actual gels to a supporting figure; 2) use either a log or split-X axis, so that data for 10nM can be clearly discerned; 3) don't assign Kd values to the interaction between MutLβ and the various substrates-the current data are just too sparse-instead describe binding in relative terms.</p><p>Data values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref> are discordant with those in panel D; the numerical values for Mer3R893E in panel C are similar to those for wild-type Mer3 in panel D.

A cartoon figure of meiotic recombination and segregation at the beginning would help. For example, in the first two paragraphs of the Introduction, it is not easy to follow how recombination shuffles parental genomes through COs and NCOs or how these concepts extend to allelic shuffling, transmission distortion or gene conversion tract length, few lines later.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we have added an introductory <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> depicting how meiotic recombination shuffles alleles, and how it can result in gene conversion.</p><p><italic>Interaction between Mer3 and Mlh1 or Mlh2 is well-documented, but not with the intact Mlh1-Mlh2 complex, even though purification of this complex is documented. Demonstrating this interaction should be the primary</italic> in vitro <italic>interaction data presented.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer may have missed it, but the interaction between purified Mer3 and Mlh1-Mlh2 complex was in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. It is now on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, and we present it in a clearer way in the text.</p><p><italic>While the paper presents the Mer3-MutLβ interaction as being mediated through Mlh2, it is clear from the</italic> in vitro <italic>data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) that Mlh1 is also capable of interacting with Mer3, although with lower affinity. This needs to be more even-handedly discussed in the paper text.</italic> </p><p>We have added additional evidence that Mer3 interacts directly with Mlh1 by showing that the 2 hybrid interaction between Mer3 and Mlh1 still occurs in the absence of Mlh2. This and the evolutionary conservation of this interaction is now more extensively discussed (see response to reviewer comment below).</p><p><italic>Yeast two-hybrid data will be better interpreted if they are not scattered throughout different supplementary figures and the standards to define an interaction are the same throughout the manuscript. For example, in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, limited growth on -His plates and none on -His -Ade is taken as a signal of a significant interaction, while later (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) the relevant assay seems to have shifted towards whether or not growth occurs on -His -Ade.</italic> </p><p><italic>There's much more focus on 2-hybrid assays using Mlh1 and Mer3 than on Mlh2 and Mer3, even though authors argue that Mlh2 is responsible for bridging between Mlh1 and Mer3.</italic> </p><p><italic>All two-hybrid data should be presented in a single place and two-hybrid experiments should be presented in parallel with internal standards (for example, including Mlh2 + Mlh1 on every plate).</italic> </p><p>We group our answer to the last three comments. We have added in Materials and methods a sentence defining “interaction”: &quot;interaction is defined compared to the growth seen in the negative control consisting of the combination between the GAL4BD-bait protein in the presence of GAL4AD-only (“empty” on the figures). Any combination that grows better than this control on the selective media is considered as an interaction&quot;.</p><p>In addition, to compare individual experiments, we have added the interaction between Mlh1 and Mlh3 as an internal standard in each experiment. This is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>Analysis of Mlh1-Mer3 and Mlh2-Mer3 interactions would be greatly strengthened if experiments were done in mlh2- and mlh1- mutants, to directly test bridging interactions.</italic> </p><p>This is a great suggestion, and indeed we have tested two hybrid interaction between Mlh1 and Mer3 in a <italic>mlh2∆</italic> mutant, and two hybrid interaction between Mlh1 and Mer3R893, defective in the interaction with Mlh2. We still see an interaction between Mlh1 and Mer3, meaning that the two hybrid interaction is not mediated by Mlh2, in agreement with the direct interaction between recombinant proteins.</p><p><italic>The model intermediate-binding activity of MutLβ is quite weak, as compared to Mer3, and only poorly discriminates model recombination intermediates from dsDNA. It's hard to directly assess this, since the critical data for MutLβ (at 10nM) is obscured by the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. This can be solved doing the following: 1) present graphs of MutLβ and Mer3 binding together in one figure, along with the cartoons of the model substrates, but move the actual gels to a supporting figure.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we have moved the Mer3 binding data to the main manuscript, and this data is presented next to MutLβ DNA binding for direct comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Use either a log or split-X axis, so that data for 10nM can be clearly discerned.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the scale of the X axis to a log scale, which makes all concentrations easy to distinguish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Don't assign Kd values to the interaction between MutLβ and the various substrates-the current data are just too sparse-instead describe binding in relative terms.</italic> </p><p>We no longer mention Kd values, but just binding in relative terms in the text as suggested (subsection “Mlh1-Mlh2 preferentially recognizes D-loops and related branched DNA structures and lacks endonuclease activity”)</p><p><italic>Data values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref> are discordant with those in panel D; the numerical values for Mer3R893E in panel C are similar to those for wild-type Mer3 in panel D. These data sets need to be reconciled, and data for mer3R893E with a mismatch at HIS4-LEU2 should be included in panel D. One possible explanation for this discordance is the use of the NFT1 locus, which is not expected to bind Mer3 or MutLβ, as &quot;normalization&quot; standard, which means that all values are &quot;normalized&quot; to a background value that might be vulnerable to experimental variation. What happens if un-normalized (i.e. just Mlh2-ChIP/input) is used?</italic> </p><p>The experiments done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C and E</xref> (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) were done in parallel (2 independent sets of WT and mutant) with the same lot of antibody, whereas the set of experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> were done later, with a different lot of antibody. We believe this is the cause of the discrepancy between the two panels. As suggested, we have added Mlh2 ChIP data in the <italic>mer3R893E</italic> strain that has a mismatch at HIS4LEU2 in panel 5F. This allows reproducing a similar decrease in Mlh2 binding compared to <italic>MER3</italic>, as the one seen in panels 5C and 5E.</p><p><italic>Data presentation for meiotic phenotypes are somewhat disorganized and confusing; given that mer3-hd is analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it would make sense to present spore viability data for this mutant along with the other spore viability data.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have moved all the meiotic progression and spore viability data of the mer3-hd mutant to the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>Data regarding partial suppression of the spore viability defect of zmm mutants, while interesting, is of limited effect and possible mechanisms are not clear; moreover, a compelling case for the phenotypic equivalence of mlh2Δ and mer3-R893E is made on the basis of tetrad data alone, and the msh4 suppression data could easily be omitted without compromising the conclusions.</italic> </p><p>The phenotypic equivalence between <italic>mlh2Δ</italic> and <italic>mer3R893E</italic> is also based on the similar delay in meiotic divisions, as well as the increase of spore viability of <italic>zmm</italic> mutants.
