However, the molecular mechanisms of chromosome translocations remain largely unknown. The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein, a DNA damage signaling regulator, facilitates DNA repair to prevent chromosome abnormalities. Previously, we showed that ATM deficiency led to the 11q23 chromosome translocation, the most frequent chromosome abnormalities in secondary leukemia. Here, we show that ARP8, a subunit of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, is phosphorylated after etoposide treatment. The etoposide-induced phosphorylation of ARP8 is regulated by ATM and ATR, and attenuates its interaction with INO80. The ATM-regulated phosphorylation of ARP8 reduces the excessive loading of INO80 and RAD51 onto the breakpoint cluster region. These findings suggest that the phosphorylation of ARP8, regulated by ATM, plays an important role in maintaining the fidelity of DNA repair to prevent the etoposide-induced 11q23 abnormalities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ATM</kwd><kwd>ARP8 phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>chromosome translocations</kwd><kwd>INO80</kwd><kwd>RAD51</kwd><kwd>ATR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP26430114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jiying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>the Program of the network-type joint Usage/Research Center for Radiation Disaster Medical Science o</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tashiro</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16H01312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tashiro</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP15H02821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tashiro</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program of the Joint Usage/Research Center of Kyoto University</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tashiro</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>KWF Kankerbestrijding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The Oncode Institute</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanaar</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The gravitation program CancerGenomiCs.nl</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanaar</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ATM plays an important role in maintaining the fidelity of DNA repair through the regulation of ARP8 phosphorylation to prevent the chromosome abnormality.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosome translocations are one of the most common types of genetic rearrangements induced by DNA damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation and certain chemotherapies. The presence of disease-specific chromosome translocations, especially in hematological malignancies such as the t(9;22) or Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myelocytic leukemia, has been reported. Molecular studies of the breakpoints of such disease-specific chromosome translocations have revealed the clustering of the breakpoints in specific regions, designated as the breakpoint cluster region (BCR). In lymphoid malignancies, the involvement of the physiological recombination of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes in chromosome translocations has been suggested, due to the presence of signal sequences for the recombination at the breakpoints. However, the molecular mechanisms of chromosome translocations in other cell types remain largely unknown.</p><p>Chromosome translocations arise as a consequence of errors in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Eukaryotic cells utilize a variety of repair pathways for DSBs, including two major ones, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair (HR). In the absence of these canonical pathways, the activation of the alternative NHEJ (Alt-EJ) pathway and the inactivation of DNA polymerase theta are implicated in chromosomal translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zelensky et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mizuno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruiz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, HR is regarded as a precise DSB repair system, since either the intact sister chromatid or the homologous region is used as the template for repair. However, both the depletion and overexpression of the RAD51 recombinase, a key factor involved in HR, lead to chromosomal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reliene et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richardson et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, the precise regulation of the recombination activity is also required for DNA repair to prevent chromosome translocations.</p><p>DNA damage leads to the activation of the DNA damage response and repair pathways. The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein regulates the DNA damage response in reaction to DSBs, through its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clouaire et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guleria and Chandna, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shiloh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shiloh and Ziv, 2013</xref>). Alterations in the function of ATM play pathologic roles in the development of leukemia/lymphoma and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khanna, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reliene et al., 2007</xref>). Chromosome translocations involving the MLL gene on 11q23 are the most frequent chromosome abnormalities in secondary leukemia associated with chemotherapy employing etoposide, a topoisomerase II poison. An increase of 11q23 translocations is observed in the ATM kinase activity-deficient fibroblast cell line AT5BIVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakada et al., 2006</xref>). We showed previously that a deficiency of ATM, a DNA damage signaling kinase, led to the excessive binding of RAD51 and the chromatin remodeling factor INO80 to the BCR in the MLL gene after etoposide treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2010</xref>). INO80 is conserved in eukaryotes and acts as an integral scaffold for assembling other proteins into the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morrison et al., 2004</xref>). The INO80 complex plays an important role in chromatin reorganization for transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lafon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xue et al., 2015</xref>), replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Falbo and Shen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vassileva et al., 2014</xref>) and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alatwi and Downs, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gospodinov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morrison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seeber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Attikum et al., 2004</xref>). The INO80 complex is required for effective DNA end resection at the early stage of HR in budding yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gospodinov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lademann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsukuda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsukuda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Attikum et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that the decreased fidelity of DNA repair by the inappropriate regulation of HR repair in ATM-deficient cells could lead to chromosomal translocations. However, the mechanism by which ATM deficiencies induce the excessive binding of INO80 and RAD51 to the BCR after etoposide treatment remains to be clarified.</p><p>INO80 forms a chromatin remodeling complex with more than 15 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2000</xref>). Among the subunits of the INO80 complex, ARP8 functions as a nucleosome recognition module and enhances the nucleosome-binding affinity of the protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saravanan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, we found that ARP8 is required for the binding of INO80 and RAD51 to the BCR in the MLL gene after etoposide treatment. We also showed that the DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation of ARP8 is regulated by ATM and ATR after etoposide treatment. The ATM-dependent phosphorylation of ARP8 negatively regulates the interaction between INO80 and ARP8, leading to the reduced binding of INO80 and RAD51 to the BCR after etoposide treatment. In contrast, ATR was not involved in the regulation of the etoposide-induced binding of RAD51 to the BCR. These findings suggest that ATM plays distinct roles from ATR in the phosphorylation of ARP8 to prevent the etoposide-induced 11q23 chromosome translocations, through the negative regulation of INO80 and RAD51 binding to the BCR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphorylation of ARP8 after etoposide treatment regulated by ATM and ATR</title><p>In our previous study, we showed that ATM deficiency resulted in the overloading of INO80 and RAD51 onto the BCR of the MLL gene after etoposide treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2010</xref>). The finding led us to investigate the phosphorylation target of the ATM kinase, which could regulate the loading of INO80 and RAD51 onto the BCR. First, we examined the phosphorylation status of INO80 after etoposide treatment. However, we could not detect the phosphorylation of INO80 by ATM after etoposide treatment by an immunoblotting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, we decided to examine the phosphorylation of the subunits of the INO80 protein complex after etoposide treatment.</p><p>The substrates of ATM contain the core sequence with an SQ or TQ motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsuoka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Neill et al., 2000</xref>). By searching for SQ or TQ motifs in the subunits of the INO80 complex, we found that APR8 had an SQ motif at S412 and Q413. This motif in ARP8 is indicated as a putative phosphorylation site in the PhosphoSitePlus database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1BâD</xref>). ARP8 is required for DNA binding by INO80 in yeast and mammals, and the ARP8 knockout in human cells impairs the binding of INO80 to chromatin and causes defects in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashiwaba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saravanan et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether ARP8 was the phosphorylation target of ATM. The immunoblotting analysis, using antibodies against the ATM/ATR substrate, revealed that the level of ARP8 phosphorylation was significantly increased from 2 hr after etoposide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The disappearance of the signal by a protein phosphatase treatment validated that the derived signal resulted from the phosphorylation of ARP8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32222.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of etoposide-induced ARP8 phosphorylation and the possible responsible kinase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Amino acid sequence 408 through 420 of ARP8.

An immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the etoposide-induced phosphorylation was completely abolished by the S412A substitution, indicating that Ser412 is the sole site within ARP8 that is phosphorylated in response to etoposide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Next to investigate whether the etoposide-induced phosphorylation of ARP8 is regulated by ATM, we compared the phosphorylation status of ARP8 in ATM-deficient BIVA and ATM-proficient 11â4 cells after etoposide treatment. An immunoblotting analysis revealed that the etoposide-induced ARP8 phosphorylation in BIVA cells was lower than that in 11â4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, the phosphorylation of ARP8 in ATM-proficient 11â4 cells after etoposide treatment was repressed by the ATM-specific inhibitor, KU55933 (ATMi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; lanes 1â8). These findings suggest that ATM regulates the ARP8 phosphorylation after etoposide treatment. The dose-dependent repression of the etoposide-induced ARP8 phosphorylation by ATMi in U2OS cells further supported this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Since ATMi did not completely abolish the etoposide-induced phosphorylation of ARP8, we next examined the relevance of ATR, another PI3-family kinase member sharing the same phosphorylation motif with ATM. ATR is responsible for the phosphorylation in the DNA replication stress response, and is activated by ATM after ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cuadrado et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jazayeri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Myers and Cortez, 2006</xref>). The etoposide-induced phosphorylation of ARP8 was strongly repressed by the ATR inhibitor VE821 (ATRi) in 11â4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lanes 9â12). This finding suggests that ATR is the major kinase responsible for etoposide-induced ARP8 phosphorylation.

Together, these findings suggest that the phosphorylation of ARP8 at S412 after etoposide treatment is regulated by ATM and ATR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Negative regulation of the etoposide-induced loading of INO80 onto the MLL BCR by the phosphorylation of ARP8</title><p>Having established that ARP8 is phosphorylated after etoposide treatment, we investigated the role of ARP8 in INO80 loading onto the MLL BCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The enrichment of Î³H2AX on BCR was observed in ATM-proficient 11â4 cells after etoposide treatment, suggesting that etoposide induces DNA damage specifically at the BCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that the depletion of ARP8 reduced the binding of INO80 to the BCR after etoposide treatment in BIVA cells ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Since the depletion of ARP8 did not affect the levels of INO80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), the result suggests that ARP8 is required for loading INO80 onto the MLL BCR after etoposide treatment in BIVA cells. Next, to explore the role of ARP8 phosphorylation in the regulation of INO80 loading onto the BCR after etoposide treatment, we generated ATM-proficient 11â4 cell lines expressing the siRNA-resistant wild-type ARP8 (WT) or the phosphorylation-deficient mutant S412A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). The ChIP analysis revealed that the expression of the S412A mutant in ATM-proficient cells increased the binding of INO80 to the BCR after etoposide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, ATMi treatment increased the binding of INO80 to the BCR after etoposide treatment in ATM-proficient cells expressing wild-type ARP8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These findings suggest that the etoposide-induced phosphorylation of ARP8 represses the binding of INO80 to the BCR. Importantly, the ATMi treatment failed to enhance the enrichment of INO80 at the BCR in ATM-proficient 11â4 cells expressing the ARP8 S412A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This suggests that ARP8 phosphorylation at S412 regulated by ATM is responsible for the excessive binding of INO80 at the BCR after etoposide treatment. To further confirm the repression of the INO80 binding to the BCR by the ARP8 phosphorylation, we next introduced the siRNA-resistant phosphomimetic mutant S412D into the ATM-deficient BIVA cells. Consistently, the expression of the phosphomimetic mutant S412D in BIVA cells reduced the binding of INO80 to the BCR after etoposide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

The etoposide-induced interaction between INO80 and ARP8 was enhanced by the treatment of U2OS cells with an ATM inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Therefore, we investigated the role of the ATM-regulated phosphorylation of ARP8 in the interaction between ARP8 and INO80 after etoposide treatment by using the U2OS cells stably expressing the phosphorylation-deficient ARP8 S412A mutant. An immunoprecipitation analysis showed an increased level of interaction of the ARP8 S412A mutant with INO80 after etoposide treatment, as compared to that of wild-type ARP8 (ARP8 WT) in ATM-proficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

ARP8 facilitates the binding of INO80 and RAD51 to the BCR of the MLL gene, while the phosphorylation of ARP8 suppresses it through a reduction of its interaction with INO80. The incidence of etoposide-induced 11q23 translocations is reduced by the expression of the phospho-mimicking ARP8 mutant in ATM-deficient cells. Moreover, the expression of the phospho-deficient ARP8 in ATM-proficient cells increases chromosome translocations. ATR was not involved in the regulation of RAD51 binding to the BCR after etoposide treatment. These findings strongly suggest that ATM represses the 11q23 chromosome translocations by regulating the binding of INO80 and RAD51 to the BCR of the MLL gene at functionally appropriate levels, via the phosphorylation of ARP8.</p><p>In response to DNA damage, the DNA repair process is facilitated by the phosphorylation of various proteins, including DNA repair factors, cell cycle regulators, and chromatin remodeling factors, through the positive regulation by ATM and ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MarÃ©chal and Zou, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clouaire et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shiloh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shiloh and Ziv, 2013</xref>). In contrast, Exo1, an exonuclease for end resection in HR, is also phosphorylated by ATM in response to DNA damage, but to inhibit its exonuclease activity for the prevention of the untimely generation of ssDNA for RAD51 loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolderson et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we show that the phosphorylation of ARP8 represses the binding of INO80 and RAD51 to damaged chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Importantly, the phosphorylation of ARP8 reduced its interaction with INO80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). Since ARP8 is required for the binding of the INO80 complex to damaged chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashiwaba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saravanan et al., 2012</xref>), the reduced interaction of ARP8 with INO80 by its phosphorylation may repress the binding of INO80 to the damaged chromatin and thus reduce ssDNA formation and RAD51 loading around damaged sites. ARP8 phosphorylation is significant from 2 hr after etoposide treatment, which is slower than the phosphorylation of ATM and H2AX. Therefore, it may also facilitate the dissociation of INO80 from damaged chromatin after the appropriate remodeling of damaged chromatin for DNA repair to avoid illegitimate recombination, leading to chromosome abnormalities. The phosphorylation of various proteins regulated by ATM may play an important role to prevent chromosome abnormalities, by maintaining the recombination activity within an appropriate range through both positive and negative regulation of repair proteins.</p><p>The phosphorylation of ARP8 is relatively slow, and occurs more than 2 hr after etoposide treatment, as compared to the early activation of ATM within 1 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>). Since the recombinational repair of DSBs starts slowly as compared to the end-joining repair, which normally begins within 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mao et al., 2008</xref>), this is consistent with the notion that ARP8 plays an important role in the appropriate regulation of the recombinational repair proteins. The slower phosphorylation of ARP8 also suggests the involvement of kinases other than ATM. Indeed, we found that ATR also regulates the etoposide-induced phosphorylation of ARP8. Moreover, ATRi repressed the phosphorylation of ARP8 especially from 2 hr after the etoposide treatment. These findings suggest the presence of different regulation systems of ARP8 phosphorylation after the induction of DNA damage. The phosphorylation of ARP8 after etoposide treatment could be regulated by multiple steps and factors for the precise control of DNA repair activity to maintain chromosome stability.</p><p>This study revealed that ATR is likely to be the major kinase responsible for the etoposide-induced ARP8 phosphorylation. However, unlike the inhibition of ATM, ATR inhibition failed to increase the RAD51 binding to the BCR of MLL after etoposide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that ATR is not involved in the regulation of RAD51 binding to the BCR after etoposide treatment. Although the mechanism of 11q23 chromosome translocations is still unclear, a specific DNA sequence and/or chromatin structure of the BCR has been suggested to promote the mis-rearrangement of this region during the repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gole and WiesmÃ¼ller, 2015</xref>). Therefore, ARP8 phosphorylation by ATM functions in the prevention of chromosome translocation at the BCR, while that by ATR may play roles in the repair of different types of DNA damage not relevant to chromosome translocations. Further studies are required to clarify the distinct roles of ATM and ATR in the phosphorylation of ARP8 after the induction of DNA damage, to coordinate the HR activity for accurate DNA repair.</p><p>Several lines of evidence have suggested the association of HR with genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bishop and Schiestl, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guirouilh-Barbat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mizuno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reliene et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruiz et al., 2009</xref>). RAD51-deficient vertebrate cells accumulate chromosomal breaks, resulting in an early embryonic lethal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lim and Hasty, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sonoda et al., 1998</xref>). However, the overexpression of human RAD51 also leads to genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marsden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reliene et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richardson et al., 2004</xref>). These findings suggest that both the down- and up-regulation of the recombination activities through the levels of the RAD51 protein are associated with chromosomal instability. Together with the regulation of the RAD51 function at the protein level, the regulation of the BCR binding by the ATM-regulated phosphorylation of ARP8 may play an important role in maintaining the local recombination activities within an appropriate range, to ensure the fidelity of DNA repair and prevent chromosome translocations. INO80 and ARP8 have been shown to regulate the RAD51 loading to damaged chromatin in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsukuda et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsukuda et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Attikum et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lademann et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the overexpression of human RAD51 leads to the various types of chromosome abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reliene et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richardson et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, this regulation of HR by ARP8 in human cells may also be applicable to DSBs in general.</p><p>The wild-type and the phospho-deficient mutant of ARP8 show increased interactions with INO80 after etoposide treatment, but the phospho-mimetic mutant does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). Human ARP8 contains five insertions in the conserved actin fold domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gerhold et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The S412 residue is located in a major loop insertion (insertion IV, residues 401â507) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). This region lacks interpretable electron density, suggesting its high flexibility to mediate dynamic proteinâprotein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gerhold et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the involvement of insertion IV in forming a proper ARP8-DNA complex has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Osakabe et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the phosphorylation of S412 within insertion IV of ARP8 could affect the binding activity of the INO80 complex to damaged chromatin, by suppressing the interactions with INO80 and components of damaged chromatin. Interestingly, ARP8 is conserved from yeast to human, but the 412-SQ motif is conserved only in higher eukaryotes, and not in yeast, Drosophila and Xenopus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Although the mechanism by which the ARP8 phosphorylation regulates the activity of the INO80 complex remains to be clarified, the DNA damage-dependent ARP8 phosphorylation may have evolutionary advantages in DNA repair.</p><p>Chromosome abnormalities involving the MLL gene are one of the most frequent chromosomal aberrations observed in secondary leukemia associated with cancer therapy. We have shown that the etoposide-induced DNA damage in ATM-deficient cells facilitates the illegitimate recombination at the MLL gene, through the excessive binding of RAD51 and INO80 to the BCR. Our findings highlight the importance of the ATM-dependent modulation of recombination repair to avert 11q23 chromosome translocations. Further studies to investigate the mechanism that maintains the fidelity of DNA repair activity, using the chromosome translocations observed in secondary malignancy will provide new insights into the general mechanisms of carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo Sapiens</italic>)</td><td>arp8</td><td>NA</td><td>GenBank: GeneID 93973</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo Sapiens</italic>)</td><td>ino80</td><td>NA</td><td>GenBank: GeneID 54617</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo Sapiens</italic>)</td><td>atm</td><td>NA</td><td>GenBank: GeneID 472</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo Sapiens</italic>)</td><td>atr</td><td>NA</td><td>GenBank: GeneID 545</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo Sapiens</italic>)</td><td>rad51</td><td>NA</td><td>GenBank: GeneID 5888</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo Sapiens</italic>)</td><td>rpa2</td><td>NA</td><td>GenBank: GeneID 6118</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo Sapiens</italic>)</td><td>AT5BIVA</td><td>PMID:21048951</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_7442">CVCL_7442</ext-link></td><td>Cell line maintained in S.

The siRNA interference experiments were performed 2 days after transfection with 0.2â0.3 nM siRNA, using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). The pcDNA 3.1 vector bearing the HA-tagged ARP8 was constructed by inserting the PCR-amplified ARP8 cDNA into the <italic>Not</italic>I/<italic>Hind</italic>III sites, followed by inserting the PCR-amplified HA between the <italic>Apa</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I sites of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (-) C. Plasmid transfections were performed using the GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen,Â Billerica,Â USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions. For rescue experiments, the siRNA-resistant ARP8 expression vector was co-transfected with the siRNA, using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) for 2 or 3 days.

For the DNA FISH analysis using the probe from Metaystems, the images were acquired on an Axio Imager Z2 microscope (Carl Zeiss,Â Germany) equipped with the MetaSystems software. Subsequently, at least 2000 etoposide-exposed or DMSO-exposed cells were counted by the Metafer platform, MetaCyte, and the cells containing split signals (separated byÂ &gt;1 Î¼m) were monitored. For the DNA FISH analysis using the probe from Vysis, the images were acquired on a Zeiss AxioplanII microscope using an AxioCamMRm controlled by Axiovision.

The cells were then sonicated to prepare chromatin suspensions of DNA fragments that were roughly 300â500 bps in length. Immunoprecipitations were performed using antibodies against INO80 and RAD51. Normal rabbit IgG was used as the negative control. Real-time PCR reactions were performed using SYBR premix Ex Taq (TAKARA,Â Japan). The dissociation curve analysis of the melting temperature of the amplified DNA showed that each primer set gave a single, specific product. The immunoprecipitation data were normalized to those of a control region in the GAPDH or Î²-globin gene, to correct for experimental variation. The relative immunoprecipitation value represents the ratio of the immunoprecipitated DNA after chemical treatment to the immunoprecipitated DNA after vehicle treatment. All ChIP analyses were repeated at least three times, and in each experiment, quantitative PCR reactions were performed in duplicate. Values represent the meansÂ Â±Â SE.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jerry Workman as the Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors addressed the phosphorylation of ARP8, a subunit of INO80-C, upon etoposide treatment, and how this phosphorylation affects the MLL translocation, which occurs frequently in leukemia. The authors established that ATM regulates phosphorylation of ARP8 S412 after etoposide treatment by an anti-ATM/ATR substrate antibody. Arp8 phosphorylation detected by this antibody was sensitive to the phosphatase treatment and it was abolished upon mutation of ARP8 S412 to alanine, suggesting that S412 is the only phosphorylation site detectable in ARP8. They further showed that S412 phosphorylation is sensitive to treatment with the ATM inhibitor KU55933 and to knockdown of ATM siRNA, suggesting that ATM regulates S412 phosphorylation.</p><p>To explore the molecular role of ARP8 S412 phosphorylation, the authors first tested its influence on INO80-ARP8 protein interaction upon etoposide treatment. They found that ATM inhibition or ARP8 alanine mutation at S412 of ARP8 enhanced INO80-ARP8 interaction. These findings indicate that ATM dependent phosphorylation on ARP8-S412 reduces ARP8 INO80 interaction.</p><p>To elucidate consequences of changed ARP8 INO80 interaction, the authors investigated the binding of INO80 and a HR protein RAD51 to a chromosome breakpoint clustered in BCR MLL locus that is associated with chromosome translocation. They demonstrated by ChIP analyses that increased INO80 and RAD51 association to the break point upon etoposide treatment is sensitive to ARP8 silencing and phospho-mimetic S412D ARP8 mutation in ATM deficient BIVA cells. Conversely, they showed that an ARP8 S412A non-phospho mutation increases INO80 and RAD51 binding to the break point in ATM-proficient cells. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of ARP8 S412, which minimizes the INO80 interaction, reduces INO80 and RAD51 association to the break point.</p><p>The authors further tested the ARP8 mutants on translocation. They showed by FISH analysis that 11q23 chromosome translocations after etoposide treatment in ATM-deficient cells (BIVA) are significantly reduced upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of ARP8, whereas translocations are increased in ATM-proficient cells (11-4). Expression of the ARP8 S412A or D mutant affects the number of chromosome translocations in an opposite manner, consistent with the notion that the ARP8 S412 phosphorylation reduces translocation events.</p><p>Overall, the data presented in the manuscript support a model that ARP8 phosphorylation mediated by ATM suppresses 11q23 translocation by reducing the binding of the INO80 and RAD51 HR protein to the break site. However, authors did not provide any evidence that ATM directly targets ARP8, nor ATM and ARP8 function in the same pathway.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the current manuscript, we did not find data that shows direct phosphorylation of ARP8 S412 by ATM, as the title of this manuscript indicates. The antibody probes for ATM or ATR targets and ATM inhibition only partially inhibits ARP8 phosphorylation detected by the antibody. Furthermore, ARP8 S412 phosphorylation status in ATM deficient BIVA cells compared to the ATM proficient cells was not shown. The onset of S412 phosphorylation after etoposide treatment is rather late. To correlate ATM action in this event, authors should compare the kinetics of ATM activation and another ATM target in parallel to ARP8 S412. As in the Discussion, it is plausible that ATR is also responsible for the ARP8 S412 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation analysis in combination with an ATR inhibitor would help to answer this question. To evaluate the phenotype that is influenced by ARP8 S412 phosphorylation and ATM, you should analyze the epistatic relation. Is S412A mutation additive or not to the ATM deficiency or ATM inhibition? For example, does ARP8 S412A mutation increase INO80 and RAD51 binding to the break point and 11q23 translocation increased in BIVA cells or by ATM inhibition in ATM proficient cells? Basically, we feel that there are many over-interpretations of these data throughout the manuscript (title, subtitles, figure legends etc.).</p><p>Under the current data set, the authors should not state &quot;ATM phosphorylates ARP8&quot;, rather than &quot;ATM regulates ARP8 phosphorylation&quot;, otherwise authors should provide an in vitro ATM kinase assay on ARP8.</p><p>2) Data showing that ARP8 phosphorylation is attenuated by ATMi could be bolstered by examining phosphorylation status of ARP8 in ATM-deficient cells (ATVBIVA). A possible role of ATR in this phosphorylation should be investigated at least by using specific ATRi.</p><p>3) Since gammaH2AX recruits INO80 to DSBs, the ChIP analyses in Figure 2 could be extended to gammaH2AX to confirm that etoposide induces DSBs specifically at the BCR.</p><p>4) Does the S412D mutant fail to interact with INO80 in co-IPs? That could help explain the lack of INO80 enrichment in Figure 2D.</p><p>5) Is the increased INO80 enrichment in Figure 2C altered by ATMi?</p><p>6) In Figure 3B, it is difficult to compare interaction of WT and S412A ARP8 as the two data sets are on separate blots. Why does the interaction of WT become apparent only at 4 h, unlike at 2h in earlier blots?</p><p>7) Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A â it is unclear what is being shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A. On the anti-Ino80 IP, the upper band appears to be phosphorylation in untreated conditions and the lower band appears to be a background band that copurifies with IgG. Which is the band we should be noticing? A molecular weight marker is needed on all gels using the ATM/ATR substrate antibody.</p><p>8) Figure 1C â why is the reduction of Arp8 phosphorylation not to the same degree as the phospho-Rpa2? Is the ATM/ATR substrate antibody detecting some other phospho substrate?</p><p>Similar comment for Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E â even after treatment with siATM, there seems to be increased signal compared to the ctrl (-etoposide) sample. The reason for this needs to be resolved.</p><p>9) Figure 2 â while ChIP results are noted as statistically significant, the change in enrichment appears modest. What are the absolute values (not normalized) of enrichment? How does this (modest) fold change alter downstream genome stability? Similar questions apply to many of the ChIPs in this manuscript.</p><p>10) Figure 3B and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B â interaction of Ino80 appears modest. In Figure 3B it looks like it peaks at 2h then is reduced. Please explain why would interaction be reduced after 2 hours?</p><p>11) Figure 5 â the translocation results look clear, yet modest. Can the authors provide a point of reference to better judge these results? For example, what translocation rate would be expected upon overexpression or deletion of a repair protein?</p><p>12) The model of Arp8 phosphorylation weakening the interaction with Ino80 was a bit speculative, and the IP westerns not terribly convincing as is. We suggest probing for additional subunits in the IP westerns. I believe there are a couple of commercially available antibodies that can be used.</p><p>13) The authors should clearly discuss how ATM-mediated inhibition of INO80 and RAD51 loading at BCR serves to suppress translocations.</p><p>14) The authors should discuss if such a suppression of RAD51 loading is specific to BCR regions or is applicable to DSBs in general.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;ATM regulates ARP8 phosphorylation to prevent chromosome translocations by counteracting DNA repair protein loading at damaged sites&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor), Jerry Workman (Reviewing Editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Generally the authors have gone to great lengths to perform the requested experiments. Most are carried out adequately, although the results were not fully incorporated into the text and conclusions. In general, the findings are novel and important, as they provide relevant insight into the crosstalk of checkpoint kinases and chromatin remodelers in DNA repair and the phenotypes they monitor are indeed, cancer associated (chromosome translocation). Thus the significance of the paper is appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>1) New data provided in the revised manuscript suggests that a major kinase responsible for ARP8 phosphorylation after etoposide treatment is ATR (Figure 1E). ATM has a slight effect, but ATR (assuming the inhibitor used is specific) is more important. It is unclear still whether either kinase modifies directly or perhaps is upstream of another kinase. But given the fact that their own inhibitor study implicates ATR more strongly than ATM, the authors should test the effect of ATR inhibition on chromosome translocation. The effect might be more pronounced than ATM ablation. This is a minimal requirement for publication.</p><p>2) If ATR inhibition does not affect Rad51 loading then ATM is likely functioning locally at the translocation site, although ATR phosphorylates ARP8 globally. If acute ATR inhibition also influences chromosome translocation, authors should extensively re-write the manuscript so that both checkpoint kinases, ATM and ATR, are implicated in the phosphorylation of ARP8 and the prevention of chromosome translocation. The authors need to provide more detailed information on the conditions used for ATM and ATR inhibitor treatment. KU55933 and ATR inhibitor IV (=VE821, I believe) were shown to be highly selective but ATP competitive inhibitors are non-specific at the high dose.</p><p>3) Finally, based on the outcome of testing ATR knockdown or inhibition in some of the assays already included, the authors should change the text, main title and subtitles to recognize their own ATR results (some of which are already shown. The more accurate title is likely to be:</p><p>&quot;Checkpoint kinases ATR and ATM regulate Arp8 phosphorylation and attenuate protein factor loading at double strand breaks.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32222.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the current manuscript, we did not find data that shows direct phosphorylation of ARP8 S412 by ATM, as the title of this manuscript indicates.

We agree with the reviewers that our findings are not sufficient to indicate the direct phosphorylation of ARP8 S 412 by ATM.</p><p>Following the reviewersâ advice, we compared the kinetics of ATM activation and other ATM targets, H2AX and RPA2, in parallel with ARP8 S412. As a result, the phosphorylations of ATM and H2AX were detected at 30 min after the induction of DNA damage. In contrast, the phosphorylations of RPA2 and ARP8 were relatively slow, and increased at 2 hrs and peaked at 4 hrs after etoposide treatment (Figure 1B). These findings suggest that ATM may activate other kinases to phosphorylate ARP8 after etoposide treatment. This notion was also supported by the results from an experiment to compare the etoposide-induced phosphorylation status of ARP8 in ATM-deficient BIVA cells and ATM inhibitor-treated ATM-proficient 11-4 cells (Figure 1D and E). The phosphorylation of ARP8 was not completely abolished in ATM-deficient and ATM inhibitor-treated cells.</p><p>Next, we examined the involvement of ATR in the phosphorylation of ARP8 after etoposide treatment, according to the reviewersâ suggestion. An ATR inhibitor also repressed the phosphorylation of ARP8 after etoposide treatment. This finding suggests the involvement of ATR in the regulation of ARP8 phosphorylation after etoposide treatment (Figure 1 E). Taken together, these results suggest that ATM and ATR regulate the phosphorylation of ARP8 after etoposide treatment.</p><p>Following the reviewersâ advice, we also examined the effect of ATM inhibition on the ARP8 S412A mutant by the ChIP analysis of 11-4 cells after etoposide treatment, using antibodies against INO80 and RAD51. We could not detect the additive effect of the ATM inhibitor on the ARP8 S412A mutation (Figure 2CâD, Figure 4B-C). ATMi treatment failed to enhance the etoposide-induced 11q23 translocations in ARP8 S412A mutant-expressing cells (Figure 5E). This finding suggests that ATM regulates ARP8 phosphorylation at S412, to regulate the loading of INO80 and RAD51 on BCR after etoposide treatment. In the revised manuscript, the original Figures 4A and 4B are presented as Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C and Figure 4A, respectively. We have also replaced original Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B with data from six independent experiments.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that the etoposide-induced phosphorylation of ARP8 at S412 is regulated by ATM and ATR. Accordingly, we have changed the title to âATM regulates ARP8 phosphorylation to prevent chromosome translocations by counteracting repair proteins loading at damaged sitesâ, according to the reviewersâ suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Data showing that ARP8 phosphorylation is attenuated by ATMi could be bolstered by examining phosphorylation status of ARP8 in ATM-deficient cells (ATVBIVA).

As a result, the etoposide-induced phosphorylation of ARP8 was repressed in BIVA cells. Although the basal level of ARP8 phosphorylation in BIVA cells was higher than that in ATM-proficient 11-4 cells (Figure 1D), this finding confirms the involvement of ATM in the regulation of the etoposide-induced phosphorylation of ARP8.</p><p>We also examined the effect of ATRi on the phosphorylation status of ARP8 after etoposide treatment in ATM-proficient 11-4 cells (lanes 9-12, Figure 1E). We found that ATRi repressed the phosphorylation of ARP8 in ATM-proficient cells. These findings suggest that ATM and ATR regulate the etoposide-induced ARP8 phosphorylation. Accordingly, we have revised manuscript by including these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Since gammaH2AX recruits INO80 to DSBs, the ChIP analyses in Figure 2 could be extended to gammaH2AX to confirm that etoposide induces DSBs specifically at the BCR.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewerâs comment, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using anti-gammaH2AX antibodies before and after etoposide treatment. The enrichment of gammaH2AX on BCR was observed after etoposide treatment, confirming that etoposide induces DNA damage specifically at the BCR. Accordingly, we have presented this result in the revised Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Does the S412D mutant fail to interact with INO80 in co-IPs?

The interaction of the ARP8 S412D mutant with INO80 was weaker than that of ARP8 WT. The weaker interaction of the ARP8 S412D mutant with INO80 was also confirmed by the Proximity ligation assay (PLA) assay, as shown in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript. Accordingly, we have revised the manuscript by including these figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is the increased INO80 enrichment in Figure 2C altered by ATMi?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of INO80 using ATMi treated 11-4 Flp-in cells expressing either ARP8 wild-type or S412A mutant. The INO80 enrichment onto MLL BCR was increased by ATMi in ARP8 wild-type expressing cells, while no significant changes were observed in ARP8 S412A mutant expressing cells. This finding suggests the epistatic relation between ATM and ARP8 S412 phosphorylation. Accordingly, the data are presented in Figure 2C and D in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 3B, it is difficult to compare interaction of WT and S412A ARP8 as the two data sets are on separate blots.

We have added a molecular weight marker, and denoted the position of INO80 using an arrow in the revised Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A. The upper bands detected by the anti-ATM/ATR substrate antibodies showed no significant difference after etoposide treatment. Since the size of the band is consistent with that of INO80, this upper band could be INO80 with background phosphorylation. The other possibility is that the upper band is non-specific. We agree with the reviewers that the lower band is a non-specific background band.</p><p>Accordingly, we have revised Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 1C â why is the reduction of Arp8 phosphorylation not to the same degree as the phospho-Rpa2?

The reason for this needs to be resolved.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for pointing out this important issue. There are two possible explanations for this issue. There could be a difference in the detection efficiency of the phosphorylated forms of ARP8 and RPA2. We used antibodies against ATM/ATR substrates for the detection of phosphorylated ARP8. In contrast, we applied antibodies against RPA2 to detect the phosphorylated form of endogenous RPA2, as slowly migrating bands. The other possibility is that ATR is more deeply involved in the regulation of ARP8 phosphorylation than that of RPA2 after etoposide treatment.</p><p>The phosphorylation of ARP8, as detected by the ATM/ATR substrate antibodies, was completely abolished by the S412A mutation. Therefore, the ATM/ATR substrate antibody should detect the phosphorylation of ARP8 at S412.</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, the phosphorylated form of ARP8 was still detected in ATM-depleted cells after etoposide treatment in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E. Since we found that ATR is also responsible for the phosphorylation of ARP8 after etoposide treatment, from the experiments suggested by the reviewer (Figure 1E in the revised manuscript), ATR could facilitate phosphorylation of ARP8 even in ATM-depleted cells after etoposide treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 2 â while ChIP results are noted as statistically significant, the change in enrichment appears modest.

The possible explanation for this is that the binding of chromatin remodelers and DNA repair factors on damaged chromatin is dynamic, not static. Such a dynamic binding could reduce the ChIP value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 3B and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B â interaction of Ino80 appears modest.

Factors associated with the homologous recombination repair pathway (HR) may be involved in the regulation of INO80 binding to ARP8. The other possibility is that the phosphorylation of ARP8 may facilitate the dissociation of the INO80 complex from damaged chromatin after the appropriate remodeling of damaged chromatin for DNA repair to avoid illegitimate recombination, leading to chromosome abnormalities. These possibilities are discussed in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 5 â the translocation results look clear, yet modest.

One study showed the increased chromosome translocations in RAD51-overexpressing cells (Richardson, Stark, Ommundsen, and Jasin, 2004). The other paper from Mizutaniâs lab showed the increased incidence of 11q23 translocations in ATM-deficient cells (Nakada et al., 2006). We have reported that the percentage of the ATM-deficient BIVA cells with the 11q23 chromosome splitting signal is increased from 0.17% to 2.5% by etoposide treatment, and in etoposide-treated ATM-proficient cells from 1.33% to 5.83% after ATMi treatment (Sun J. et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The model of Arp8 phosphorylation weakening the interaction with Ino80 was a bit speculative, and the IP westerns not terribly convincing as is.

Following the reviewerâs comment, we reprobed the blots with antibodies against ARP5. As a result, similar to INO80, we could observe a slightly increased amount of ARP5 in the S412A precipitated blot, as compared with that of wild-type ARP8 in ATM proficient cells. Similar results were obtained in wild-type ARP8, but not in S412D-expressing, ATM-deficient BIVA cells.

ATM has a slight effect, but ATR (assuming the inhibitor used is specific) is more important. It is unclear still whether either kinase modifies directly or perhaps is upstream of another kinase. But given the fact that their own inhibitor study implicates ATR more strongly than ATM, the authors should test the effect of ATR inhibition on chromosome translocation. The effect might be more pronounced than ATM ablation. This is a minimal requirement for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the important comment. Following the editorâs advice, we examined the effect of the ATR inhibitor VE821 on the etoposide-induced 11q23 chromosome translocations in ATM-proficient 11-4 cells, by the dual color FISH analysis using the MLL gene probes (Figure 6B). The FISH analysis revealed that the increase of the split signal positive cells by ATRi was less than that by ATMi. Although ATR is suggested to be the major kinase responsible for ARP8 phosphorylation after etoposide treatment, this finding suggests that the effect of ATRi on the etoposide-induced chromosome translocations is limited. Moreover, no additional effects of ATRi on the increase of the chromosome translocations by ATMi were observed. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that ATM is likely functioning locally at the translocation site, while ATR phosphorylates ARP8 globally. Accordingly, we have added a section âATM, but not ATR, negatively regulates RAD51 loading onto the BCR after etoposide treatment to repress 11q23 chromosome translocationsâ in the âResultsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) If ATR inhibition does not affect Rad51 loading then ATM is likely functioning locally at the translocation site, although ATR phosphorylates ARP8 globally. If acute ATR inhibition also influences chromosome translocation, authors should extensively re-write the manuscript so that both checkpoint kinases, ATM and ATR, are implicated in the phosphorylation of ARP8 and the prevention of chromosome translocation. The authors need to provide more detailed information on the conditions used for ATM and ATR inhibitor treatment. KU55933 and ATR inhibitor IV (=VE821, I believe) were shown to be highly selective but ATP competitive inhibitors are non-specific at the high dose.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined the effect of ATR inhibition on the RAD51 loading on the BCR of MLL in 11-4 cells after etoposide treatment, by a ChIP analysis. In contrast to the increased loading of RAD51 onto the BCR of MLL after etoposide treatment by ATMi, ATRi failed to do so (Figure 6B). This finding is consistent with the results obtained by the FISH experiments described above. As the editors suggested, ATM is likely functioning locally at the translocation sites, while ATR is functioning globally. Accordingly, we have discussed this point in the fourth paragraph in the âDiscussionâ.</p><p>We apologize for providing insufficient information about the conditions used for the ATM and ATR inhibitor treatments. We now provide detailed information in the âMaterials and methodsâ and the figure legends in the revised manuscript. As the reviewer speculated, the ATR inhibitor we used was VE821.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Finally, based on the outcome of testing ATR knockdown or inhibition in some of the assays already included, the authors should change the text, main title and subtitles to recognize their own ATR results (some of which are already shown. The more accurate title is likely to be:</p><p>&quot;Checkpoint kinases ATR and ATM regulate Arp8 phosphorylation and attenuate protein factor loading at double strand breaks.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The FISH analysis and the chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggested by the editors showed that ATR inhibition did not change the RAD51 loading onto the BCR of MLL after etoposide treatment, while a slight increase in 11q23 chromosome translocation split signal cells was detected (Figure 6). These results suggest that the ARP8 phosphorylation regulated by ATR is functionally distinct from that by ATM. Accordingly, we have changed the title to âDistinct roles of ATM and ATR in the regulation of ARP8 phosphorylation to prevent chromosome translocationsâ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
