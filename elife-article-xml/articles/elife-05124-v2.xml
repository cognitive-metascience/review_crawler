When we offset the metaphase plate position by creating an asymmetric centriole distribution on each pole, we find that metaphase plates relocate to the middle of the spindle before anaphase. The spindle assembly checkpoint enables this centering mechanism by providing cells enough time to correct metaphase plate position. The checkpoint responds to unstable kinetochore–microtubule attachments resulting from an imbalance in microtubule stability between the two half-spindles in cells with an asymmetric centriole distribution. Inactivation of the checkpoint prior to metaphase plate centering leads to asymmetric cell divisions and daughter cells of unequal size; in contrast, if the checkpoint is inactivated after the metaphase plate has centered its position, symmetric cell divisions ensue.

Before a cell divides, its entire set of chromosomes is duplicated so that the two newly formed daughter cells receive a full set. In animal cells, the chromosomes line up in the center of the cell. The two sets of chromosomes are then separated by a structure known as the spindle, which attaches long filaments of proteins to the chromosomes and pulls one set to either side of the cell. Birth defects and cancer can result from a cell ending up with too many, or too few, chromosomes. Therefore, a safety mechanism called the spindle assembly checkpoint ensures that all of the chromosomes have correctly attached to the spindle before chromosome separation begins.</p><p>Although it has been known for over a hundred years that chromosomes line up precisely in the center of the cell before they are separated, the reason why this occurs has remained unknown. Tan et al. investigated this problem by altering human cells so that the chromosomes did not align in the middle of the cell, but instead lined up off-center. However, after a short delay the chromosomes relocated to the center.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that the spindle assembly checkpoint gives cells the time required to re-position the chromosomes in the center of the cell. When the chromosomes are off-center, their connections to the spindle are altered. The spindle assembly checkpoint detects these changes and delays chromosome separation until these errors are corrected. When Tan et al. inactivated the spindle assembly checkpoint before the chromosomes had time to align at the center, the cells divided to produce two unequal cells.</p><p>This study shows that the central position of chromosomes is essential for cells to divide into two equal cells. After understanding why this is, the next big challenge will be to find out how a cell re-positions chromosomes that are off-center and how it places them precisely in the middle of the cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05124.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05124.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd>spindle assembly checkpoint</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>spindle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004362</institution-id><institution>Schweizerische Herzstiftung (Swiss Heart Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3100A0-120728</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meraldi</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003006</institution-id><institution>Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (Federal Institute of Technology Zurich)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meraldi</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Université de Genève</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meraldi</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001706</institution-id><institution>Louis-Jeantet Foundation (Fondation Louis-Jeantet)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meraldi</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>Chia Huei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds (BIF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gasic</surname><given-names>Ivana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maiato</surname><given-names>Helder</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human cells center the position of the metaphase plate before anaphase onset to ensure the formation of equal-sized daughter cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During mitosis, chromosomes are bound to microtubules emanating from both poles of the mitotic spindle via sister-kinetochores and aligned on the metaphase plate precisely in the middle of the spindle. The equatorial position of the metaphase plate is a distinctive feature of metazoan, plant, and many fungal cells. A centered metaphase plate is established even in asymmetrically dividing cells, where daughter cells of unequal size are obtained by an asymmetric positioning of the spindle prior to anaphase (e.g., in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos) or an asymmetric elongation of the spindle in anaphase (e.g., in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryonic neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaltschmidt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schneider and Bowerman, 2003</xref>]). However, the reason why the metaphase plate is located in the middle of the spindle is not known. One hypothesis is that the centered position facilitates the synchronous arrival of chromosomes at spindle poles during anaphase to prevent chromosomes from being caught on the wrong side of the cytokinetic furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nicklas and Arana, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goshima and Scholey, 2010</xref>). Elegant work in meiotic praying mantis cells demonstrated that the equatorial positioning of the metaphase plate is not a mere consequence of bipolar kinetochore–microtubule attachments, as trivalent sex-chromosome align in the middle of the spindle, even though trivalent attachment does not favor an equatorial position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nicklas and Arana, 1992</xref>). Moreover, previous studies in <italic>Chlamydomonas rheinhardtii</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> showed that an asymmetry in centriole numbers at spindle poles led to an asymmetric metaphase plate position, even though chromosomes established bipolar attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greenan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Keller et al., 2010</xref>). While in algae, longer half-spindles were associated with the pole containing fewer centrioles, in nematodes, longer half-spindles emanated from the pole containing more centrioles. However, whether cells react to asymmetrically located metaphase plates and the long-term consequences of this asymmetry are not known. Here, we investigated these questions in human tissue culture cells. We find that cells correct metaphase plate position before anaphase onset, we demonstrate that a centered metaphase plate position relies on the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to provide sufficient time for this correction mechanisms, and we show that a failure to correct plate position leads to asymmetric cell divisions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cells center the metaphase plate position before anaphase onset</title><p>To monitor the relative position of the metaphase plate in the spindle over time, we recorded by time-lapse imaging HeLa cells stably expressing eGFP-centrin1 (centriole marker) and eGFP-CENPA (kinetochore marker) and automatically tracked centrosomes and the metaphase plate using an in-house developed software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jaqaman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vladimirou et al., 2013</xref>). Metaphase or late prometaphase cells were recorded over a short period of 5 min in 3D at a resolution of 7.5 s under conditions of low phototoxicity compatible with anaphase entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jaqaman et al., 2010</xref>). By plotting the ratio R of the half-spindle lengths of metaphase cells at the onset of our recordings (first three time points), we found a broad distribution centered around median R = 0.98, which represents nearly equal half-spindle lengths. When analyzing the subset of cells that entered anaphase during our recordings 30 s before anaphase, we found a sharp R distribution in the middle of the spindle (median R = 1.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): less than 10% of the R values were smaller than 0.85 or larger than 1.15 at anaphase onset, while in the metaphase population over 24.2% were outside of these boundaries. This suggested a centering mechanism for the metaphase plate as cells progressed towards anaphase. To test this hypothesis, we aimed to create asymmetric spindles by generating cells with an asymmetric centriole distribution, using small interfering (si)RNAs against Sas-6, a protein required for centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leidel et al., 2005</xref>). This procedure was used on a set of HeLa eGFP-centrin cells that co-expressed either eGFP-CENPA, α-tubulin-mRFP (spindle marker), or Histone H2B-mRFP (chromosome marker). Every wild-type mitotic cell contains four centrioles: one oldest (grandmother) centriole, one older (mother) centriole, and their two respective daughter centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>), which all have different eGFP-centrin signal intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuo et al., 2011</xref>). A 24-hr Sas-6 depletion led to a mix of cells with two centrioles per pole, one centriole per pole, or one pole with one centriole and the other pole with two centrioles (called from here on 2:2, 1:1, or 2:1 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Our intensity measurements revealed that in 2:1 cells it was most often the oldest centriole that gave rise to a daughter centriole, probably due to limiting levels of Sas-6 (data not shown). Tracking of HeLa eGFP-centrin1/CENPA cells indicated that the distribution of half-spindle ratios during metaphase was broad in 2:2 or 1:1 cells, but that on average the plate was located in the middle of the cell (median R = 1.04 (2:2) and 1.03 (1:1); note that 2:2 cells served as control transfection for all subsequent experiments; to be consistent in 2:2 or 1:1 cells, R was calculated as the length of the half-spindle associated to the grandmother centriole divided by the opposite half-spindle length, while in 2:1 cells, R represents the ratio of the half-spindle associated to the 2-centriole pole over the opposite half-spindle length; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As in wild-type cells, the range of R had narrowed by the time cells were about to enter anaphase, consistent with a centering process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In 2:1 cells, we found two half-spindles of unequal length, with a shorter half-spindle associated with the pole containing one centriole (median R = 1.12, p &lt; 0.0001 in Mann–Whitney U test compared to symmetric distribution; R &gt; 1.15 in 42.9% of the cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This asymmetry was corrected before anaphase onset (median R = 1.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with the existence of a centering process. Since our videos were much shorter than the overall duration of metaphase, we were unable to directly visualize the centering process. To circumvent this difficulty, we recorded longer time series of 2:1 cells, monitoring them for 15 min at 30-s intervals. By plotting R over time in 15 cells that spend at least 7 min in metaphase before entering anaphase, we could directly observe how cells centered the plate position over time, while reducing the variability in metaphase plate position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05124.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cells center the position of the metaphase plate before anaphase onset.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of spindle ratio R in metaphase cells in wild-type eGFP-centrin1/CENPA HeLa cells during metaphase in general (black curve) or 30 s before anaphase onset (red curve).

Anaphase time in 2:1 cells was also delayed in eGFP-centrin1/mRFP-α-tubulin cells 2:1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that it is a robust phenomenon (p = 0.003 in Mann–Whitney U test). In contrast, anaphase was not delayed in 1:1 cells, indicating that the longer metaphase timing seen in 2:1 cells was not caused by the loss of daughter centrioles, but the consequence of centriole asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). Anaphase onset is under the control of the SAC, which inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and delays anaphase onset if kinetochores are not properly attached to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khodjakov and Pines, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>). To test whether the observed metaphase delay depended on the SAC, we co-depleted the SAC protein Mad2 or inhibited the SAC kinase Mps1 in Sas-6-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the absence of Mad2, 2:2, 2:1, 1:1, or control-treated cells had the same anaphase timing, indicating that the anaphase delay in 2:1 cells depends on the SAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The same result could be found in Mps1-inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To test whether metaphase plate position is corrected as a result of the additional time provided by the SAC, we prolonged metaphase in <italic>siSas-6</italic>-treated cells by 1 hr by adding the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and found a symmetric plate position in 2:1 cells (median R = 0.98; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, when we abrogated the SAC in metaphase cells by adding an inhibitor of the SAC kinase Mps1, MPS1-IN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kwiatkowski et al., 2010</xref>), 2:1 cells showed a bimodal distribution: 53% entered anaphase with symmetric spindles, with a median R centered around 1, however, the other 47% had asymmetric spindles with a distribution centered around R = 1.15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, Mann–Whitney U test, p = 0.032 when compared to untreated 2:1 cells at anaphase onset). We conclude that the centering of the metaphase plate is not a mechanical consequence of cells preparing for anaphase, but that it depends on the SAC, which provides 2:1 cells with sufficient time to build a symmetric spindle. Mps1 inhibition in metaphase also led to a higher rate of segregation errors in 2:1 than in 2:2 or wild-type cells; this increase was reproducible, but not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,J</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05124.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The SAC delays anaphase in cells with asymmetric spindles allowing the centering of the metaphase plate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Boxplots of the spindle assembly time (NBD until bipolar spindle formation) in wild-type and Sas-6-depleted 2:2, 1:1, or 2:1 eGFP-centrin1/mRFP−α-tubulin cells.

We first tested whether loss of centrioles reduces the polar ejection force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rieder et al., 1986</xref>), as a possible explanation for the shorter half-spindle attached to the pole with fewer centrioles. Wild-type eGFP-centrin1/mRFP−α-tubulin cells were compared with cells treated with RNAis against Sas-6 or the chromokinesin Kid, the main driving force of the polar ejection force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wandke et al., 2012</xref>). Cells were subjected to a half-hour treatment with the Eg5 inhibitor monastrol to obtain monopolar spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mayer et al., 1999</xref>), fixed and stained for HEC1 to label kinetochores. The average distance between kinetochores and centrosomes in monopolar spindles reflects the polar ejection force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wandke et al., 2012</xref>), as seen by a reduced distance in Kid-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Loss of 2 daughter centrioles in Sas-6-depleted cells (one in each pole), however, did not reduce this distance, indicating that daughter centriole loss does not reduce the polar ejection force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, half-spindle size has been linked to the abundance of TPX-2, an activator of Aurora-A, a critical regulator of centrosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greenan et al., 2010</xref>); however, by quantitative immunofluorescence we found no significant differences for TPX-2 or for phosphorylated Aurora-A (the active form of Aurora-A) between the two spindle poles in Sas-6-depleted 2:1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Next, we quantified the levels of centrobin, which stabilizes microtubule minus-ends, since it localizes only to daughter centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeffery et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with the daughter-specific localization, centrobin was only present on the pole with two centrioles in 2:1 cells; in contrast, α-tubulin density in each half-spindle and the abundance of the centrosome proteins γ-tubulin, pericentrin, ninein, and p150<sup>glued</sup> (a marker for the dynein/dynactin motor complex) on the two spindle poles in 2:1 cells were as symmetric as in wild-type or 2:2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). Since centrobin depletion leads to a SAC-dependent mitotic arrest due to unstable microtubule minus-ends and unstable kinetochore–microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeffery et al., 2010</xref>), we hypothesized that the asymmetric localization of centrobin in 2:1 cells may lead to a difference in microtubule stability between the two poles. To test this, we subjected 2:2, 2:1, and 1:1 eGFP-centrin1/CENPA cells to a 7-min cold treatment on ice to depolymerize the astral microtubules and stained the remaining cold-resistant kinetochore–microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salmon and Begg, 1980</xref>). The stability of kinetochore–microtubules varied from cell to cell, but in 75% of the 2:2 or 1:1 cells the microtubule minus-ends showed the same stability at both spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). In contrast, in 2:1 cells, an unequal stability of the minus-ends was visible in over 50% of the cells, and in most cases it was the pole with 2 centrioles that had more stable minus-ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). This difference in kinetochore–microtubule minus-end stability suggested that microtubule minus-ends might depolymerize faster in the absence of a daughter centriole, which would explain the shorter half-spindles associated with the 1-centriole pole. We also noted in our live-cell imaging experiments that &gt;70% of the spindles in 2:1 eGFP-centrin1/mRFP-α-tubulin cells (but not 2:2 or 1:1 cells) were rotating, a phenomenon that could reflect a difference in minus-end stability of the two astral microtubule populations, resulting in an imbalance of cortical forces in the two half-spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2 media3">Videos 1–3</xref>). To confirm this hypothesis, we first tested whether a 1-hr MG132 treatment, which leads to symmetric spindles in 2:1 cells, is accompanied by an equalization in microtubule stability at the two spindle poles. While in control-treated cells, we saw an unequal stability of the minus-ends in 49 ± 4% of the 2:1 cells, this was only the case in 22 ± 6% of the MG132-treated 2:1 cells (p = 0.0275 in unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). In contrast, in 2:2 cells, MG132 treatment did not affect the percentage of cells with unequal minus-end stability (14% each; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Next, we tested whether the asymmetry of the spindle and the spindle rotation phenotype could be suppressed by increasing microtubule stability. We therefore co-depleted the microtubule-depolymerases KIF2a and MCAK, a condition known to increase microtubule stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ganem and Compton, 2004</xref>). KIF2a/MCAK depletion per se did not affect the position of the metaphase plate (median R = 1.01) or the ratio of cells with rotating spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K,L</xref>). However, when KIF2a/MCAK was co-depleted in 2:1 cells, the spindle asymmetry was statistically less pronounced (median spindle ratio R = 1.08 and 19.2% R &gt; 1.15 compared to median R = 1.12 and 42.9% R &gt; 1.15 in Sas-6 deplete cells, p = 0.039 Mann–Whitney test), and spindles did not rotate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L,M</xref>). To corroborate these results, we also stabilized microtubules by applying a brief, 30 min, 10 nM taxol treatment to Sas-6-depleted cells. While control (DMSO)-treated 2:1 cells were still asymmetric (median R = 1.23 and 56.3% R &gt; 1.15), taxol-treated cells were much closer to symmetry (median R = 1.02 and 13.3% R &gt; 1.15, p = 0.0062; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>). We conclude that loss of a single centriole leads to a difference in minus-end microtubule stability between the two spindle poles, that this difference plays a large role in the asymmetric positioning of the metaphase plate, and that cells reduce this difference as they center the metaphase plate before anaphase onset.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05124.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>2:1 cells have half-spindles with different microtubule stability and fail to mature kinetochore–microtubule attachments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) eGFP-centrin1 cells (green) were treated with monastrol and stained for HEC1 (red; right panel) to calculate the distance between kinetochores and the closest centriole.

The SAC responds to unattached kinetochores or to sister-kinetochores with insufficient tension (measured as the distance between the two sister-kinetochores) that become transiently detached due to the kinase activity of Aurora-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>). Depletion of centrobin on both spindle poles leads to unstable kinetochore–microtubules and reduced inter-kinetochore distances that result in a permanent mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeffery et al., 2010</xref>). When we tracked kinetochores in 2:1 eGFP-centrin1/CENPA cells, however, we found no difference in inter-kinetochore distances or the oscillatory sister-kinetochore movements along the spindle axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jaqaman et al., 2010</xref>). Since 42.9% of the 2:1 cells have asymmetric spindles, we restricted our analysis to only include cells that have a spindle ratio R &gt; 1.15, but again found no change in inter-kinetochore distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As SAC satisfaction is also linked to intra-kinetochore stretching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maresca and Salmon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uchida et al., 2009</xref>), we further measured the intra-kinetochore distance between CENPA and the outer kinetochore protein HEC1 and found no change in 2:1 cells compared to 2:2 or 1:1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>); the observed distance of 110 nm is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wan et al., 2009</xref>). Overall, this indicated that sister-kinetochores in 2:1 cells formed bipolar attachments with mechanical behaviors that were indistinguishable from normal cells. Since a single unattached kinetochore is sufficient to elicit a SAC response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rieder et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Collin et al., 2013</xref>), we next investigated whether 2:1 cells have rare unattached kinetochores, by measuring the proportion of metaphase cells with Mad2-positive kinetochores (marker for unattached kinetochores). When compared to 2:2, 1:1, or wild-type cells, we found a small but non-significant increase in the proportion of Mad2-positive 2:1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which could point to a minor or transient attachment defect caused by the imbalance of microtubule stability within the spindles of 2:1 cells. Such imbalance could lead to kinetochores that are not fully attached, that is, not bound by the full complement of microtubules (up to 25 microtubules per kinetochore in vertebrate cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rieder, 1982</xref>). To detect immature attachments, metaphase eGFPcentrin1/CENPA cells were stained with antibodies against SKAP, a marker for kinetochores fully bound by stable microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>), and analyzed for the presence of SKAP on kinetochores: cells in which more than 30% of the kinetochore-pairs were SKAP-negative were considered to have partially unstable kinetochore–microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Such cells were rare in wild-type, 2:2, or 1:1 cells (&lt;10%), but formed a substantial proportion of 2:1 cells (22%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These SKAP-negative kinetochores were distributed in a symmetric manner (were present both on the 1- or 2-centriole side; data not shown), and they all disappeared if 2:1 cells were briefly treated with 10 nmol taxol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Moreover a 1-hr treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 also abolished the subpopulation of 2:1 cells with SKAP-negative kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

For this purpose, we used laser-microsurgery to ablate one daughter centriole in cells that had already reached metaphase. As in Sas-6-depleted cells, 2:1 cells generated by microsurgery resulted in an asymmetric plate location, as, on average, R increased from 1.06 to 1.16 after laser-ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). These cells displayed a reduced inter-kinetochore distance (mean of 1.03 μm before ablation to 0.95 μm after the ablation, p = 0.001 in paired two-tailed t-test), which led to a prolonged metaphase arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>); in contrast, a control laser pulse in the vicinity of the spindle pole did not affect half-spindle lengths or inter-kinetochore distances (data not shown). This confirmed that loss of a single daughter centriole can directly affect force generation at sister-kinetochores, consistent with our findings that Sas-6-depleted 2:1 cells show defects in the quality of kinetochore–microtubule attachments. We also conclude that an acute laser-ablation of a daughter centriole in metaphase has a more severe effect on the forces acting on kinetochore than Sas-6 depletion. Possible explanations for this difference could be that Sas-6-depleted 2:1 cells might have more time to adapt to the lack of a missing centriole as they progressively build up the spindle, or that the laser-ablation destroys not just a centriole but also part of enzymatic activities in the vicinity of the centriole, such as minus-end depolymerases, which in normal cells are known to exert a pulling force on kinetochore-fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meunier and Vernos, 2011</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media4" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-05124-media4.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05124.013</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Laser-ablated 2:1 HeLa cell expressing eGFP-centrin1 (centriole marker) and eGFP-CENPA (kinetochore marker) in metaphase.</title><p>Note the asymmetric metaphase plate position after the ablation of a single centriole.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05124.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05124.013</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Stabilization of kinetochore–microtubules suppresses the SAC-dependent delay in 2:1 cells</title><p>To confirm the presence of partially destabilized kinetochore–microtubule attachments in <italic>siSas-6</italic>-treated 2:1 cells and test whether they are the cause of the SAC response, we used the Aurora-B inhibitor ZM1. Aurora-B inhibition does not overcome a SAC-dependent mitotic arrest caused by unattached kinetochores (nocodazole treatment), but overcomes a mitotic arrest caused by insufficient tension at sister-kinetochores in monopolar spindles (monastrol treatment), as Aurora-B inhibition stabilizes kinetochore–microtubules and prevents loss of kinetochore–microtubule attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ditchfield et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lampson et al., 2004</xref>). When we acutely inhibited Aurora-B in metaphase 2:1 cells, cells entered anaphase with asymmetric spindles (median R = 1.18, Mann–Whitney U test, p = 7.57 × 10<sup>−6</sup> when compared to anaphase onset without Aurora-B inhibitor), indicating that a stabilization of kinetochore–microtubules satisfies the SAC in 2:1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To confirm these findings in an independent manner, we also tested whether depletion of the microtubule depolymerases KIF2a/MCAK would allow 2:1 cells to enter anaphase with asymmetric spindles. Depletion of KIF2a/MCAK per se did not affect plate position at anaphase onset (median R = 1.03); however, it allowed 2:1 cells to enter anaphase with asymmetric spindles (median R 1.08, p &lt; 0.0001 compared to symmetric distribution in Mann–Whitney U test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). KIF2a/MCAK depletion also rescued the anaphase timing difference in 2:1 cells compared to 2:2 cells and led to the correct loading of SKAP on kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>; note that KIF2a/MCAK depletion alone led to a small anaphase delay when compared to wild-type cells, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ganem et al., 2005</xref>]). This showed that co-depletion of KIF2a/MCAK overrides the SAC response in 2:1 cells, leaving them no time to center the metaphase plate, indicating that unstable kinetochore–microtubules cause the SAC-dependent anaphase delay. KIF2a/MCAK co-depletion, however, did not suppress a mitotic arrest caused by the presence of insufficient tension (monastrol treatment) or unattached kinetochores (nocodazole treatment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since the spindle checkpoint response has been shown to be subject to off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hübner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Westhorpe et al., 2010</xref>), we repeated these experiments with an alternative set of KIF2a and MCAK siRNAs. These experiments validated our initial findings, confirming that KIF2a/MCAK suppress the anaphase delay seen in Sas-6-depleted 2:1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Validation of Sas-6, KIF2a, and MCAK depletion siRNA treatments by immunoblotting also showed that in the triple MCAK/KIF2a/Sas-6 depletion, KIF2a was only partially depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We therefore tested whether the depletion of MCAK alone in 2:1 cells is sufficient to suppress the mitotic delay. As this was not the case, we conclude that depletion of both MT-depolymerases is necessary to overcome the instability of kinetochore–microtubules in 2:1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05124.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Depleting KIF2a and MCAK overcomes the SAC response in 2:1 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mitotic index of untreated, ZM-1-treated, MPS1-IN-treated, control-depleted, or KIF2a/MCAK-depleted cells treated for 16 hr with nocodazole (unattached kinetochores) or monastrol (lack of tension), n ≥ 400 cells in 3–4 experiments, error bars indicate s.e.m. * ZM1 and MPS1-IN overcome a monastrol arrest (t-test p &lt; 0.0001), and MPS1-IN overcomes a nocodazole arrest (t-test p = 0.0044).

We found that KIF2a/MCAK/Sas-6-depleted 2:1 cells had slightly higher rates of chromosome segregation errors (statistically insignificant difference, p = 0.4713, Fischer's exact test) when compared to KIF2a/MCAK-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Strikingly KIF2a/MCAK-depleted 2:1 cells also underwent asymmetric cell divisions, yielding two daughter cells of different volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5 media6">Videos 5, 6</xref>): while the two daughter cell volumes never differed by more than 20% in wild-type or KIF2a/MCAK depleted cells, 50% of KIF2a/MCAK/Sas-6-depleted 2:1 cells yielded one daughter cell that was at least 20% larger than its sister progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This suggested that an asymmetric metaphase plate position leads to asymmetric cell division. A recent study, however, demonstrated that asymmetric position of the entire spindle can also lead to asymmetric cell divisions in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>). To discriminate between the two possibilities, we quantified the position of the spindle center in relationship to the cell center at anaphase onset, which was often not centered in the middle of the cell at anaphase onset, as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Collins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>). The extent to which the spindle centers were offset was the same in KIF2a/MCAK-depleted and KIF2a/MCAK-depleted 2:1 cells, indicating that changes in spindle position were not at the origin of the asymmetric cell divisions seen in KIF2a/MCAK-depleted 2:1 cells. To independently confirm our hypothesis that an asymmetric metaphase plate position in anaphase leads to an asymmetric cell division, we acutely abrogated the spindle checkpoint with an Mps1 inhibitor in control-depleted cells, Sas-6-depleted 2:2 cells, Sas-6-depleted 2:1 cells in late prometaphase/early metaphase (as visualized by live-cell imaging, where 43% of the cells have a metaphase plate not in the middle of the spindle, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) or Sas-6-depleted 2:1 cells that were in late metaphase, which have symmetric spindles. Mps1 inhibition did not give rise to asymmetric cell division in control-depleted cells, 2:2 cells, or 2:1 cells treated in late metaphase; in contrast, in late prometaphase/early metaphase 2:1 cells with an asymmetric plate position, Mps1 inhibition resulted in an asymmetric cell division in 45% of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

The SAC responds to subtle defects in kinetochore–microtubule stability that arise in cells with an asymmetric plate position and an imbalance of centrioles, implying that the SAC is more sensitive than previously assumed.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that proper positioning of the spindle ensures symmetric cell divisions, and that, deviations from a symmetric position are corrected by dynein-dependent cortical forces and membrane elongation during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>). Here, we find that this external cortical correction mechanism in anaphase is complemented in metaphase by an internal centering mechanism that ensures a symmetric position of the metaphase plate within the spindle with the help of the SAC. This centering mechanism is particularly visible in cells with an asymmetric distribution of centrioles (2:1 cells), but it also acts in wild-type cells, indicating that it is active in every cell division. The centering of the metaphase plate is not just a consequence of establishing stable bipolar attachments at kinetochores, since KIF2a/MCAK/Sas-6-depleted 2:1 cells fail to center the plate, despite having reached stable bipolar attachments that satisfy the SAC; it is an active correction process, which in part depends on the regulation of microtubule dynamics, but whose precise molecular mechanisms will need to be uncovered.</p><p>KIF2a/MCAK-depleted 2:1 cells fail to center the metaphase plate before anaphase and divide asymmetrically. These cells have no defect in spindle positioning when compared to the symmetrically-dividing KIF2a/MCAK-depleted cells, implying that the asymmetric position of the metaphase plate is the source of asymmetric cell division. This hypothesis is confirmed by our analysis of 2:1 cells treated with an Mps1 inhibitor: only 2:1 cells treated in late prometaphase/early metaphase, which still have asymmetrically positioned metaphase plates, give rise to asymmetric cell division, whereas the same 2:1 cell population treated in late metaphase, which have a centered metaphase plate position, carry out symmetric cell divisions. We thus postulate that a symmetric metaphase plate position is essential for symmetric cell divisions, explaining why it is conserved in all metazoans, plants, and many fungi. Control of this parameter is essential, since differences in cell size have been linked to cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>). Metaphase plate position may also play a crucial role in asymmetric cell divisions that depend on asymmetric spindles in anaphase, such as in embryonic <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> neuroblasts. To form asymmetric spindles in a controlled and stereotypical manner, cells need an internal reference in space: breaking an existing symmetry, that is, a symmetric metaphase plate position, provides such a reference point. This is consistent with the progression of embryonic fly neuroblasts, which first align the metaphase plate in the middle of the spindle, before undergoing an asymmetric elongation of the spindle in anaphase. Our results also shed light on the mechanisms controlling the position of the cytokinetic furrow. Original studies in sand dollar eggs showed that the position of the centrosomes is a key determinant of the cytokinetic furrow position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rappaport, 1961</xref>); later studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> found that a second signal emanating from the spindle midzone also contributes to the positioning of the cytokinetic furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dechant and Glotzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bringmann and Hyman, 2005</xref>). A role for chromosomes was, however, discarded in these two organisms, since midzone formation and cytokinesis did not require them. In contrast, in human cells, chromosomes stabilize microtubules of the midzone and thus favor the formation of a cytokinetic furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Canman et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we show that 2:1 cells only misplace the cytokinetic furrow in the presence of an asymmetric plate position in metaphase, implying that the position of the metaphase plate plays a crucial fine-tuning role in the positioning of the cytokinetic furrow. Future studies will have to test whether the metaphase plate acts via the microtubules of the midzone, or as recently postulated, by influencing the cortical populations of Anillin and Myosin in anaphase in a Ran-GTP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The depletion of KIF2a/MCAK satisfies the SAC in 2:1 cells, but not in cells with unattached or tension-free kinetochore-microtubule attachments, indicating that the SAC responds to kinetochore–microtubule attachments defects less severe than lack of attachment or a tension defect. What might be these defects? Kinetochores in 2:1 cells bind a sufficient number of microtubules to form amphitelic attachments and stretch the two sister-kinetochores apart, but a number of kinetochores do not bind the full complement of stable microtubules required for SKAP loading. It is established that the SAC responds to detached kinetochores and is satisfied when kinetochores have bound the full set of microtubules. Based on our results, we postulate that the SAC also responds if a kinetochore is only bound by a fraction of the full set of microtubules. Such a lack of full occupancy would delay anaphase onset, such as in 2:1 cells; it would also explain the tendency for a higher rate of chromosome segregation errors in 2:1 cells treated with an Mps1 inhibitor or KIF2a/MCAK siRNAs. Stabilizing those kinetochore–microtubules by inhibiting Aurora-B or depleting KIF2a/MCAK establishes full binding of microtubules, SKAP loading, and satisfies the SAC, allowing cells to enter anaphase. This suggests a SAC that is more sensitive than a checkpoint that only senses detached kinetochores or kinetochores that become detached due to a tension defect. A SAC that detects such minor defects in kinetochore–microtubule occupancy caused by an imbalance of microtubule stability within the spindle would be able to indirectly probe for plate positioning, giving cells time to correct this imbalance and ensure a symmetric metaphase plate position. Such graded response to microtubule occupancy within a kinetochore complements studies showing that the SAC acts in a graded manner when it comes to the number of unattached kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Collin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dick and Gerlich, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, siRNA, and drug treatments</title><p>HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified medium containing 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator.

Three-dimensional image stacks were deconvolved with SoftWorx and subjected to the kinetochore tracking assay analysis run in MATLAB (The Math Works, Inc, Natick, MA), to asses inter-kinetochore distances and kinetochore oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jaqaman et al., 2010</xref>). The tracking assay was also used to quantify the length of the two half-spindles: the tracking assay estimates the metaphase plate by fitting a plane to the calculated kinetochore positions; metaphase plate position relative to the spindle poles was calculated using a custom MATLAB function that detects centrioles and calculates plate position as the intersection of the fitted plane with the spindle axis. The earliest time point data of each cell imaged was used for plate position and inter-kinetochore distance analysis to ensure that data come from early metaphase cells. To measure plate position at anaphase and to better visualize the centering mechanisms, we used a temporal resolution of 30 s and applied our combined kinetochore and centrosome tracking analysis. Videos were manually screened for the presence of chromosome segregation errors. To determine spindle positions within cells, we used the centrosome positions to determine the center of the spindle (equidistant to both centrosomes) and compared it to the cell center, which was determined using phase contrast images (point on the spindle axis that is equidistant to both cell cortexes). To measure intra-kinetochore distances and SKAP signals, HeLa eGFP–centrin1/eGFP-CENPA cells were fixed and stained with anti-HEC1 and anti-SKAP antibodies, respectively. Three-dimensional image stacks of fixed cells were subjected to the kinetochore tracking assay for sister–kinetochore pair identification. Imaris was used in conjunction with a custom MATLAB function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Source Code 1</xref>) to measure the HEC1 and SKAP signals of the detected sister-kinetochores.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Laser ablation experiments</title><p>Centriole ablations were carried out by 2–4 series (10 Hz repetition rate) of second-harmonic, single-mode, 532-nm pulses of an Nd:YAG laser (ULTRA-CFR TEM00 Nd:YAG from Big Sky Laser, Quantel, United Kingdom).

The authors should also show an R vs. time graph for all their individual traces</italic>.</p><p>The R-values presented in the original manuscript were calculated using an automated tracking assay for kinetochores (GFP-CENP-A) and centrosomes (GFP-centrin1) recorded with a 7.5 seconds resolution. We knew from previous studies that this temporal resolution was necessary to catch record and analyze chromosome movements in metaphase (Jaqaman et al., J. Cell Biol. 2010). To avoid photo-toxicity we were however forced to work with low intensities and to limit our movies to 5 minutes. This meant that only a subset (10-15%) of recorded cells entered anaphase within those 5 minutes, and that it is therefore not possible to visualize the full scale of the plate positioning correction, which often lasts more than 5 minutes, in such movies. Our representation of R is therefore built on a population analysis of cells either early in metaphase or just before anaphase. This population analysis shows that just before anaphase onset, cells have on average a metaphase plate that is located more precisely in the middle of the spindle.</p><p>To improve the manuscript we first explain this fact in the text (subsection “Cells center the metaphase plate position before anaphase onset”); second, to better document the metaphase plate centering process we also recorded 15 minutes movies of 2:1 cells using a temporal resolution of 30s. We show in the novel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and 1H</xref> the R-values over time for 15 single cells, as well as the median R and the 95% confidence interval for the cell population as they approach anaphase. These experiments directly visualize and validate the existence of a centering mechanism, providing a clearer representation to the reader.</p><p><italic>2) Provide stronger arguments that the asymmetry of the plate in 2:1 cells is due to differences in minus end stability</italic>.</p><p>First, we would like to point out that our data showed that depletion of KIF2a/MCAK only partially corrects the asymmetry of the metaphase plate position in 2:1 cells. This suggests that the difference in microtubule stability is an important factor in the asymmetry of the plate, but certainly not the only one. We have now made this fact clearer in our manuscript (subsection “An asymmetric distribution of centrioles leads to an imbalance of microtubule stability”).</p><p>Second, to further support our hypothesis of a differential minus-end stability that causes the asymmetric plate positioning in 2:1 cells, we measured with a cold-stable assay minus-end stability in 2:1 cells after a 1 hour MG132 treatment. Since MG132 treatment leads to a symmetric position of the metaphase plate, our hypothesis predicted an attenuated difference in minus end stability between the 1- and 2-centriole pole. This is exactly what we found, as now shown in the novel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>.</p><p>To more directly test our hypothesis we also tested whether a brief treatment with taxol, a drug that stabilizes microtubules, would correct metaphase plate position, as seen after KIF2a/MCAK depletion. As shown in the novel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>, taxol treatment largely corrects the metaphase plate position, validating our hypothesis that the asymmetric plate position is caused by differences in microtubule stability.</p><p><italic>3) Improve the evidence that SKAP loading is a read-out for stability. The authors should also show data to clarify that SKAP loading is specifically reduced on the 1-centriole side, instead of sometimes being reduced on the 1-centriole side, and sometimes on the 2-centriole side</italic>.</p><p>Our interpretation of SKAP as a marker for microtubule stability is not our claim, but a conclusion of Schmidt et al., JCB 2010, which showed that SKAP levels are inversely proportional to Aurora-B levels at kinetochores, which is itself inversely proportional to microtubule stability. This model is supported by our experiments showing that KIF2a/MCAK depletion in 2:1 cells restores normal SKAP levels at kinetochore, despite the presence of a partially asymmetric plate position. Since KIF2a and MCAK are both microtubule depolymerases that destabilize kinetochore-microtubules we concluded that SKAP is a read-out for microtubule stability. To fully validate this hypothesis we now in addition briefly treated 2:1 cells with 10 nM taxol and stained for SKAP. We found that 100% of the kinetochores were SKAP-positive, confirming that it is a read-out for k-fiber stability (novel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>With regard to the second question, we find that SKAP is not systemically absent on the 1-centriole-side or the 2-centriole-side, but that the frequency of the absence is the same for both sides. We do not think that this invalidates our model, as the SKAP read-out just indicates a reduced stability and higher dynamics of kinetochore-microtubules on both sides of the sister-kinetochores, consistent with the fact that these kinetochores are over time moving and correcting their position towards the middle of the spindle. This is now pointed out in our manuscript (subsection “2:1 cells form amphitelic kinetochore-microtubule attachments that take longer to stabilize”)</p><p><italic>4) Provide more data in support of the reproducibility and robustness of the laser ablation assay, and explain the change in spindle length after centriole ablation</italic>.</p><p>To provide a better overview of our laser ablation experiment, we now show the individual traces of R over time (before and after ablation) for 11 cells, in which a single centriole was ablated, and we plot the median of this cell population (novel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). As a negative control we also plot the median R over time for control-ablated cells (laser pulse in the cytoplasm). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> shows how R increases after destruction of a single centriole, leading to an asymmetric position of the metaphase plate, consistent with our Sas-6 depletion experiments. Moreover, we now provide a novel Supplementary movie 4, visualizing how the ablation of a single centriole creates an asymmetric position of the metaphase plate.</p><p>Since such laser-ablation experiments are technically very challenging, and not easy to combine with a second assay, we used mainly Sas-6 depletion to investigate how the removal of a single centriole affects spindle length, showing how it leads to an imbalance of microtubule dynamics (see also point 2 for the additional experiments).</p><p><italic>5) Back-up their claim that an asymmetric plate causes an asymmetric division</italic>.</p><p>Our claim that an asymmetric plate position at anaphase onset was supported by two independent experiments: both KIF2a/MCAK depletion and Mps1 inhibition allow 2:1 cells to enter anaphase with asymmetric spindles resulting in an asymmetric cell division. Importantly, when Mps1 was inhibited in late metaphase cells, when the plate has reached a symmetric plate position, we only observed symmetric cell division. Since these cells are, apart from the plate position, identical to the 2:1 cells that divide asymmetrically, we concluded that the plate position is a key determinant for the (a)symmetry of cell division.</p><p>To fully confirm this claim, we have now performed a second back-up experiment, in which we created 2:1 cells by laser-ablation (to create an asymmetric plate position), before forcing cells into anaphase by abrogating the spindle assembly checkpoint with an Mps1 inhibitor. We found that 4 out of 6 laser-ablated 2:1 cells underwent an asymmetric cell division (ratio between daughter cell size of more than 1.2, a ratio never seen in normal cells; this study but also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman 2013</xref>). In contrast 6 out of 6 control-ablated cells had a ratio smaller than 1.08. (p-value in unpaired t-test with Welch correction p = 0.0451; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, and Supplementary movies 6 and 7). Despite the low numbers – laser-ablation experiments are technically very challenging – these experiments validate our initial claim.</p><p><italic>6) Validate their RNAi and rescue experiments</italic>.</p><p>While our initial manuscript was based mainly on functional validations (e.g. number of centrioles for Sas-6 depletion), we have now validated in addition every key siRNA (Mad2, Sas-6, KIF2a and MCAK) by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the reviewers were worried about potential siRNA off-target effects, reason for which they asked for siRNA rescue experiments. Since such rescue experiments are technically extremely challenging when analyzing double or triple siRNAs and very difficult to analyze in a conclusive manner, we have instead performed a number of complementary experiments for each siRNA or provide additional explanations.</p><p>Sas-6 siRNA: one possibility is that Sas-6 siRNA could affect the position of the metaphase plate, microtubule stability and SKAP loading on kinetochores and/or lead to a spindle checkpoint dependent anaphase delay as an off-target effect. However, this is not possible, since such an off-target effect would also be present in 1:1 cells that have been subjected to the same siRNA. 1:1 cells show, however, none of the phenotypes seen in 2:1 cells, thus excluding any off target effect. Moreover, we confirm the effects of Sas-6 depletion on spindle positioning and asymmetric cell division using laser-ablation, as an alternative tool to create 2:1 cells (e.g. new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>Mad2 siRNA: this siRNA is used as a known tool to inactivate the spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Instead of performing a rescue experiment, which is very difficult since mitotic timing is sensitive to minor changes in Mad2 levels, we repeated the Sas-6 depletion in the presence of an Mps1 inhibitor to inhibit the spindle assembly checkpoint in an independent manner. These experiments validated our Mad2 depletion experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Kid siRNA: this siRNA was used as a positive control for a disruption of the polar ejection force, based on previous literature. It has been previously validated in our and other laboratories (Wandke et al., JCB 2012), and we functionally validate it as a positive control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. In contrast, we find that Sas-6 depletion has no effect on the polar ejection force. Therefore, we cannot test for an off-target effect.</p><p>KIF2a/MCAK depletion: this double depletion has been validated in multiple publications (in particular from the Duane Compton laboratory), and the phenotype we report is consistent with the published literature. The novel aspect of our manuscript comes from co-depletion of Sas-6 siRNA in 2:1 cells. While we appreciate that a siRNA rescue experiment would be informative, we believe that a triple siRNA rescue experiment is nearly impossible, particularly since the overexpression of either of these microtubule depolymerases is toxic. To nevertheless exclude potential off-target effects, we repeated our experiments with an alternative set of KIF2a and MCAK siRNAs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>, this alternative set of KIF2a/MCAK siRNAs rescued the mitotic delay seen in 2:1 cells, confirming our experiments with the original KIF2a/MCAK siRNAs. Moreover, we also validated in the same Figure the new siRNA treatment by immunoblotting. Since this experiment indicated that both the old and the new siRNA against KIF2a only led to a partial depletion of KIF2a (50%), we further tested whether depletion of MCAK alone would be sufficient to overcome the mitotic arrest seen in 2:1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C</xref>). Since this is not the case, we conclude that KIF2a co-depletion is essential to overcome the mitotic delay.</p><p>Finally, we emphasize that other claims associated with KIF2A/MCAK co- depletion are fully backed up by independent experiments:</p><p>Our claim that stabilization of kinetochore microtubules in 2:1 cells overcomes the spindle assembly checkpoint delay and allows anaphase entry with an asymmetric plate position is confirmed by the Aurora-B inhibition experiment;</p><p>Our claim that 2:1/KIF2A/MCAK-depleted cells that enter anaphase with asymmetrically positioned metaphase plate undergo an asymmetric cell division is validated by our Mps1 inhibition experiments performed on Sas-6 depleted and on laser-ablated 2:1 cells.</p><p><italic>In addition to these concerns the authors should comment on possible differences between laser ablation and Sas-6 depletion, and more clearly explain how they compute asymmetry. The authors should also make it explicit that the delay in mitosis observed in cells whose metaphase plate is off-centre is a consequence of an imbalance in microtubule forces resulting from kinetochore-microtubule occupancy that is monitored by the SAC</italic>.</p><p>We envisage two potential reasons for the stronger phenotype seen in 2:1 cells obtained through laser ablation as compared to Sas-6 depletion. First, since Sas-6 depleted cells lose a centriole in interphase, they might be better able to partially compensate for this loss as they gradually build up the mitotic spindle. Second, it is likely that the laser pulse on a mitotic spindle pole not only impairs the centriole, but that it also disrupts biochemical activities associated with the mitotic spindle pole, such as microtubule-depolymerases, which are able to exert a pulling force on k-fibers (Meunier et al., Nat. Cell Biol, 2011). Both potential explanations are now mentioned in the text (subsection “2:1 cells form amphitelic kinetochore-microtubule attachments that take longer to stabilize”).</p><p>We now also explain in the text more explicitly, how we calculate R (subsection “Cells center the metaphase plate position before anaphase onset”).</p><p>Finally, we now more explicitly link the occupancy of kinetochores with the activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint in 2:1 cells (see Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
