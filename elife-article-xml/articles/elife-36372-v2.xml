In particular, TRPV1 channels respond to temperature increases with a large surge in current, produced both by an increment in the open probability and in the single channel-conductance, with the open probability being more temperature dependent. The mechanism by which absorbed heat is converted into a conformational change triggering channel opening remains largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castillo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A large positive enthalpy change in the order of tens of kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup> is required for TRPV1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yao et al., 2010a</xref>). This heat dependence is mostly associated with channel opening while the closing transition is not highly temperature-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yao et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2003</xref>). This is the opposite in cold-activated channels, like TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Raddatz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Along with these thermodynamic constrains, TRPV1 behaves as an allosteric protein. Allosteric activation is evidenced by multiple open and closed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2003</xref>) and is also observable as a coupling between distinct activation modes when channels are activated by more than one stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahern et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jara-Oseguera and Islas, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brauchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In contrast with the voltage sensor of voltage-gated channels, a ‘temperature sensor’ has not been found and it has been suggested that temperature might affect several regions of the channel protein at once, explaining why so many regions have been implicated in temperature gating in thermoTRP channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grandl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yao et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brauchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). A possible mechanism for channel gating by temperature invokes a large difference in heat capacity between the closed and open conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapham and Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>). One possible way of realizing this mechanism is a change in solvation of hydrophobic or hydrophilic regions or residues to a hydrophilic or hydrophobic environment, respectively.</p><p>In this report, we investigated the repeated activation of TRPV1 channels by temperature. We find that activation is coupled to a previously uncharacterized temperature-dependent inactivation process and show that this transition is irreversible. Our data are suggestive of a partial or complete unfolding of one or more regions of the channel protein during heat absorption.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activation of TRPV1 channels by temperature ramps</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the time course of the current response to a typical temperature ramp. Since these temperature ramps change at a rate of ~15 °C/s and activation of TRPV1 by fast temperature jumps has a time constant in the order of ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yao et al., 2009</xref>), our ramp measurements can be considered to be in quasi steady-state. Temperature changes in an almost completely symmetrical fashion, increasing and decreasing at almost the same rate. The resulting TRPV1 temperature-activated current is shown in the same figure at two different voltages. TRPV1-mediated currents can be activated at both negative and positive potentials. Channel activity can be observed even at 20°C in multichannel patches, and it visibly increases around 40°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Current activates and deactivates steeply, but in spite of the symmetric heat stimulus provided by the ramp, the current response is not symmetrical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This can be clearly seen when current is plotted as a function of ramp temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It is apparent that the current during temperature decrease is less steep than the up-ramp current, so current activation-deactivation is accompanied by a high degree of hysteresis. Hysteresis is not a consequence of the speed of the ramp, since a slower ramp (7 °C/s) produces the same result. Also, activation by slower ramps proceeds with a high enthalpy, not significantly different from activation by the faster ramp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36372.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Activation of TRPV1 current by temperature ramps.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TRPV1-mediated Na<sup>+</sup> currents in an inside-out patch, activated by a temperature ramp while the voltage was held constant at the indicated value.

Strikingly, after several activation episodes, currents almost completely disappear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The reduction of current becomes more pronounced at higher temperatures. When the ramp reaches temperatures near 55°C, current decay is visible even before the ramp gets to its maximum temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The decay of current as a function of time is temperature-dependent. Current loss when activating by ramps that reach moderate temperatures (41–43°C) proceeds more slowly than when channels are activated by ramps above 50°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Current loss upon heating also occurs when the patch is held at a negative voltage of −60 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Activation of TRPV1 is more steeply dependent on temperature at negative voltages, which is reflected in the enthalpy of activation being significantly higher at −60 mV than at 60 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), as expected from its allosteric coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</xref>). Concurrently, current loss at negative voltage proceeds faster than at positive voltages for the same temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Current loss is not caused by patch excision, since it can be observed in whole-cell and outside-out recordings, with similar characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that the mechanism of current loss is a property of the TRPV1 polypeptide and is not caused by the loss of a stabilizing factor upon patch excision, as described for other TRP channels. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu and Qin, 2016</xref>), it was observed that TRPV1 activation, after challenging the channel with two high temperature pulses was stable. The present study shows that inactivation is observed when a series, more than two, of high temperature pulses are applied.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36372.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Loss of current with repetitive activation in TRPV1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Activation (up) part of the response to a temperature ramp in an inside-out patch expressing TRPV1 channels.

This sensitivity is mainly determined by the apparent activation ΔH. The response of TRPV1 to the first ramp results in a very steep activation curve. Subsequent activation curves show reduced slopes, indicating a reduction of the ΔH associated with opening. After five ramps, reaching a maximum temperature of 48.7<sup>°</sup>C, the ΔH of activation is reduced to near 10 kcal⋅mol<sup>−1</sup>, or a Q<sub>10</sub> value of 1–2, which is similar to diffusion processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sidell and Hazel, 1987</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Thermal inactivation of TRPV1 is irreversible</title><p>In order to further characterize current loss with repetitive thermal stimuli, currents were first inactivated by more than 50% and then we attempted to reactivate them after a recovery period. Surprisingly, current could not be elicited after the recovery period. Lack of recovery is observed when current is inactivated by application of several ramps at moderate temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>) or during a single ramp at high temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). Since current loss is highly temperature dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we investigated if lowering temperature could help in the recovery process. Again, current loss was irreversible even if the temperature was lowered to ~10°C during the recovery period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C,E and F</xref>).

Surprisingly, activation by capsaicin is also impaired after multiple temperature ramps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Capsaicin elicits robust currents, but the response to a second application after several activating ramps, is highly diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). There is a clear inverse correlation between the extent of current loss induced by temperature and the magnitude of current activated by the second application of capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that the remaining capsaicin-sensitive channels have not yet undergone inactivation. Application of the temperature ramp in the presence of capsaicin, produced an increase in current, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which had a reduced slope, since the channels are being activated by capsaicin and heat at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

This apparently distributed heat sensitivity suggests that several regions contribute discretely to heat absorption or its coupling to channel opening. Here, we report on the existence of an inactivation process in TRPV1, which had not been previously characterized. Inactivation proceeds with a time course in the order of tens of seconds. The time course is strongly dependent on the maximum temperature attained during the activation ramp, behaving as if inactivation was coupled to opening. In this regard, temperature-dependent inactivation in TRPV1 resembles open state inactivation in voltage-dependent channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demo and Yellen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldrich et al., 1983</xref>). However TRPV1 inactivation is irreversible.</p><p>Our results are compatible with a unique sequence of events during heat absorption and its conversion to pore opening. Heat might be absorbed in several regions of the channel, leading to partial contributions to channel opening, but some regions might absorb heat through a mechanism akin to partial polypeptide denaturation. Channels undergoing this partial denaturation would become less able to absorb or convert heat into a conformational change, resulting in reduced apparent enthalpy of activation. Finally, after opening, channels become sufficiently distorted and enter the inactivated state irreversibly. This is consistent with the high heat capacity change (∆C<sub>p</sub>) mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapham and Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>) and might reflect alterations of hydrophobic interactions through solvent exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sosa-Pagán et al., 2017</xref>) and not large conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De-la-Rosa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ruigrok et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>We used the HEK293 cell line obtained from ATCC 10 years ago, cell identity has not been authenticated, but we have tested for mycoplasma and the cells are free of infection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HEK293 cells were grown on 100 mm culture dishes with 10 ml of DMEM, Dulbecco´s Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 100 Units/ml-100 μg/ml of penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), incubated at 37°C in a 5.2% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Baron Chanda (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors present an interesting finding that has the potential to upend our current understanding of the thermodynamics underlying temperature-dependent gating of TRPV1 channels. Because of their exquisite heat sensitivity and physiological role as sensors of noxious temperature stimuli, these channels have become model systems to study the biophysical mechanisms of temperature-sensitivity. To date, the underlying assumption for any of the detailed thermodynamic analysis has been that the temperature-activation in TRPV1 channels is a reversible process and therefore can be modeled using widely used standard approaches. Here, Moreno et al. show that repeated activation of TRPV1 channels by thermal stimuli modifies the channel irreversibly such that the channel loses its ability to be activated either by heat or ligands such as capsaicin. These are remarkable findings that require us to rethink our current understanding of TRP channel gating for multiple reasons. Although the data is convincing and the main conclusions support their data, the reviewers have made specific recommendations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please reformat the manuscript for submission as a Short Report rather than a full-length article as proposed in the original decision letter. Much of the detailed modeling which is based on the assumption of equilibrium thermodynamics should be eliminated.</p><p>2) Please remove the DTNB experiments as the results of these experiments are not sufficiently conclusive and detract from the main findings.</p><p>3) Discus the Liu and Qin (2016) paper showing the reversibility of TRPV1 activation. It is preferable to show data that reconcile your findings with their studies. This would establish conditions under which reversibility of gating is a reasonable approximation.</p><p>4) Please add longer recovery times, different voltage protocols and other experiments that demonstrate the robustness of this phenomenon.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36372.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please reformat the manuscript for submission as a Short Report rather than a full-length article as proposed in the original decision letter.

The published data in that paper regarding TRPV1 only shows the current in response to two temperature pulses. This makes it very hard to judge how stable the current in those experiments is. In fact, their Figure 9 shows a slight decrease in the magnitude of the current generated by the second pulse and intriguingly, also a small decrease in the enthalpy associated with the current elicited by the second pulse, which points in the same direction as the data presented here.</p><p>Trying to find conditions in which TRPV1 temperature–activated currents might be recoverable, we performed a new experiment in which intracellular ATP was present. ATP delays the onset of calcium induced desensitization and might have a similar effect on temperature-induced inactivation, however we find no effect on the rate of inactivation and recovery of current continues to be absent. These data are presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please add longer recovery times, different voltage protocols and other experiments that demonstrate the robustness of this phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed and included results from experiments with a longer recovery time of up to 20 min. We performed these experiments with two different holding potentials during the recovery period: 0 mV, as we had done before for 2 min recovery, and -60 mV. These results show that there is no discernible recovery even for the longer times and that the holding potential has no effect on the recovery (Figure 3G-I).</p></body></sub-article></article>
