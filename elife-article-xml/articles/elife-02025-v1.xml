Point centromeres are defined by sequence, whereas regional and holocentromeres are epigenetically defined by the location of cenH3-containing nucleosomes. In this study, we show that <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> holocentromeres are organized as dispersed but discretely localized point centromeres, each forming a single cenH3-containing nucleosome. These centromeric sites co-localize with kinetochore components, and their occupancy is dependent on the cenH3 loading machinery. These sites coincide with non-specific binding sites for multiple transcription factors (‘HOT’ sites), which become occupied when cenH3 is lost. Our results show that the point centromere is the basic unit of holocentric organization in support of the classical polycentric model for holocentromeres, and provide a mechanistic basis for understanding how centromeric chromatin might be maintained.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02025.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02025.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02025.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During cell division, the chromosomes in the original cell must be replicated and these ‘sister chromosomes’ must then be divided equally between the two new daughter cells. At first, the sister chromosomes are held together near a region called the centromere, which is important because the microtubules that pull the sister chromosomes apart attach themselves to the centromere. In many cases, the centromere is a small region near the middle of the chromosomes, which produces a classic X shape. However, in some organisms centromeres span the entire length of the chromosomes. There are at least 13 plant and animal lineages with such holocentromeres.</p><p>Inside the nucleus of cells, DNA is wrapped around molecules called histones. There are five major families of histones, and histones belonging to one of these families—the H3 histones—are replaced by cenH3 variant histones at both conventional centromeres and holocentromeres. There are many unanswered questions about holocentromeres. In particular, do holocentromeres truly extend along the full length of the chromosomes, or are they found at a large number of specific sites?</p><p>Now Steiner and Henikoff have studied the distribution of cenH3 in the genome of the worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> to investigate holocentromeres in greater detail. These experiments showed that the holocentromere in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is actually made of about 700 individual centromeric sites distributed along the length of the chromosomes. Each of these sites contains just one nucleosome that contains cenH3, and these sites are likely to be the sites that microtubules attach to during cell division. Surprisingly, the same sites can also act as so-called ‘HOT–sites’: these sites are bound by many proteins that are involved in regulating the process by which genes are expressed as proteins, which suggests a link between centromeres and these regulatory proteins.</p><p>The work of Steiner and Henikoff describes how centromeric nucleosomes are distributed across the genome, but why and how cenH3 ends up at these particular 700 sites remains an open question.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02025.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02025.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>CenH3</kwd><kwd>CENP-A</kwd><kwd>holocentromere</kwd><kwd>point centromere</kwd><kwd>transcription factor hotspot</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Henikoff</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steiner</surname><given-names>Florian A</given-names></name><name><surname>Henikoff</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PBSKP3-124362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steiner</surname><given-names>Florian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01-HG004274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steiner</surname><given-names>Florian A</given-names></name><name><surname>Henikoff</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Worm holocentromeres show a polycentric distribution, with each site containing a single centromeric nucleosome and also being targeted by multiple transcription factors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The centromere is a defining feature of eukaryotic chromosomes and is essential for the segregation of chromosomes during cell division, as it organizes the proteinaceous kinetochore for attachment to the spindle apparatus at mitosis. Centromeres are universally marked by the variant histone cenH3 (also called CENP-A in many organisms) that replaces canonical histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes, and most commonly localize to a single position along the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malik and Henikoff, 2009</xref>). However, the DNA on which centromeric nucleosomes assemble is not conserved and varies greatly in size and composition. It ranges from genetically defined point centromeres that assemble a single cenH3-containing nucleosome to epigenetically defined regional centromeres of several kb or Mb of tandemly repeated DNA to holocentromeres that extend along the length of entire chromosomes. With the exception of budding yeast point centromeres, where there is a 1:1 relationship between a single cenH3 nucleosome and the functional centromere, the precise organization of centromeric chromatin has remained elusive. One of the main issues standing in the way of uncovering the distribution of centromeric nucleosomes is the fact that most regional centromeres are localized to homogeneous tandemly repetitive regions of the genome, making it difficult to map individual nucleosomes. <italic>C. elegans</italic> is amenable to address this question because the genome is repeat-poor, making it possible to precisely map centromeric regions.</p><p>Classical cytogenetic observations have demonstrated that <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes are holocentric, whereby mitotic spindle fibers attach along the length of chromosomes and pull them to the poles as straight bars rather than from a single position that defines the more familiar monocentric chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schrader, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albertson and Thomson, 1982</xref>). Two models have been put forward for how holocentric chromosomes might be organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schrader, 1947</xref>). The ‘diffuse centromere’ model predicts that the centromere is truly distributed along the length of the chromosomes, and that spindle fiber attachments form randomly. The ‘polycentromere’ model predicts that there are a number of discrete sites dispersed along the chromosomes, creating a holocentric appearance when observed at cytological resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02025.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide distribution of cenH3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Classic holocentromere models proposed by Schrader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schrader, 1947</xref>): diffuse and polycentric holocentromeres.

A previous study mapped <italic>C. elegans</italic> cenH3 using a microarray-based approach and found that it occupies ∼2900 broad domains that account for about half of the genome, but that there was only enough cenH3 to cover 4% of the genome, suggesting that cenH3 nucleosomes assemble at random positions within the domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gassmann et al., 2012</xref>). These findings thus seemingly supported the diffuse centromere model. However, mitotic microtubules must attach to discrete sites for chromosome segregation, and the number of microtubules attached during <italic>C. elegans</italic> mitosis has been estimated to about 100 for all six chromosomes combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O’Toole et al., 2003</xref>). This left open the question of the relationship between these diffuse domains and discrete microtubule attachment sites.</p><p>To identify potential kinetochore attachment sites in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we profiled cenH3 nucleosomes with single base-pair resolution. While we observed domains of low occupancy similar to those described in the earlier study, we also discovered discrete sites of much higher cenH3 occupancy that are distributed independently of the domains. Depletion of the machinery needed for incorporation of cenH3 nucleosomes resulted in reduced occupancy of cenH3 at these sites. As an independent indicator of centromeric localization, we also profiled the inner kinetochore protein CENP-C (also called HCP-4 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>). We found that cenH3 sites coincide with high CENP-C signal, indicating that they serve as attachment sites for the kinetochore, consistent with a polycentric organization of the chromosome. Individual sites resemble budding yeast point centromeres and coincide with transcription factor hotspots, which become occupied by transcription factors when cenH3 is lost, providing a clue as to how kinetochore sites might be selected and maintained.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CenH3 levels are high in domains of low nucleosome turnover</title><p>To precisely localize cenH3-containing nucleosomes and identify potential kinetochore attachment sites, we digested chromatin from mixed-stage embryos with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) and solubilized the majority of the chromatin by cavitation, a method adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin and Felsenfeld, 2007</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We subsequently performed native chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of cenH3 from the soluble chromatin, followed by paired-end sequencing (N-ChIP-seq), resulting in single base-pair resolution maps of cenH3-associated DNA fragments.</p><p>As expected from a previous ChIP-microarray map of <italic>C. elegans</italic> cenH3 using formaldehyde crosslinking (X-ChIP-chip) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gassmann et al., 2012</xref>), we found that cenH3 is broadly distributed throughout the genome. CenH3 is enriched towards the arms relative to the centers of the autosomes, while the distribution on the X chromosome is relatively even (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, chromosome arms tend to be enriched for repeats and are associated with marks of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the distribution of cenH3 is positively correlated with the distribution of trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3), a mark of transcriptionally silent regions, in both our ChIP-seq and the previously published ChIP–chip data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, left panels. r = 0.44, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup> for correlation with cenH3 X-Chip and r = 0.31, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup> for correlation with N-ChIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu and Fire, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). This is consistent with previous findings that have associated H3K9 methylation with the acquisition of cenH3 in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Folco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kagansky et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore wondered if the enrichment of cenH3 is associated with lower nucleosome turnover. The replication-independent variant histone H3.3 is incorporated into chromatin when nucleosomes are replaced and serves as a measure of replication-independent nucleosome turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ooi et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with the hypothesis that cenH3 is associated with lower nucleosome turnover, we found that the distributions of H3.3 and cenH3 are negatively correlated in both our ChIP-seq and the previously published ChIP–chip data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, center panels. r = −0.65, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup> for correlation with cenH3 X-Chip and r = −0.21, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup> for correlation with N-ChIP). Replication-independent nucleosome turnover is mainly driven by transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teves and Henikoff, 2011</xref>), consistent with the previously described anti-correlation between cenH3 and RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gassmann et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>CenH3 has been found to be localized to 10–12 kb wide domains that occupy about half of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, first track) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gassmann et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the use of a different methodology (low-salt native chromatin preparation and MNase digestion instead of formaldehyde fixation and sonication, a different antibody and ChIP-seq instead of ChIP–chip), our data showed a very similar domain pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, second track, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, right panel. Correlation with cenH3 X-ChIP r = 0.67, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>). The previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gassmann et al., 2012</xref>) pointed to an anti-correlation of cenH3 occupancy with transcription in the germline and in the early embryo. Because there is little RNA Polymerase II activity in the early embryo, and transcriptional profiles are not directly transmitted during the maternal–zygotic transition, the authors proposed that it is the memory of germline transcription transmitted to the embryo that excludes cenH3 incorporation. We found that the domains were both negatively correlated with previously published H3.3 data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, third track) and positively correlated with previously published H3K9me3 patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, fourth track) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ooi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). H3.3 is abundantly incorporated into chromatin in the germline and throughout early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ooi et al., 2010</xref>), whereas H3K9me3 is associated with transcriptionally silent chromatin where nucleosome turnover and H3.3 incorporation are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu and Fire, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ooi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that it is nucleosome turnover that excludes the deposition of cenH3 and shapes the domain-like distribution of cenH3 across the genome, which can happen even in absence of transcription in the early embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>High-resolution mapping of cenH3 reveals discrete high-occupancy sites</title><p>The levels of cenH3 within a cell only allow for the occupancy of 4% of the genome, and each cenH3 domain can therefore only contain a limited number of cenH3 nucleosomes per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gassmann et al., 2012</xref>). The large-scale correspondence of our native ChIP-seq data to the previously published crosslinked ChIP–chip data provides independent confirmation of this interpretation. However, we wondered whether there might also be preferred sites of centromeric nucleosome positioning within the cenH3 domains of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as predicted by the polycentromere model. These sites would appear as sites of high cenH3 occupancy in a population average. We indeed found that cenH3 was highly enriched at discrete, dispersed loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). As these loci appeared as very well-defined peaks, we removed background by subtracting the input signal and considered sites with 30 or more normalized counts (equivalent to the mean plus 7 times the standard deviation of the genome-wide signal) in at least one of two biological replicates as positive. We identified about 100 cenH3 peaks on each chromosome (707 peaks total; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), with the distance between peaks ranging from 290 bp to 1.9 Mb (median 83 kb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We averaged the signal around all 707 cenH3 peaks, represented by a single centered peak in the cenH3 ChIP data that is highly enriched compared to input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The peaks were enriched in gene-poor regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). To our surprise, 607 out of 707 of these peaks resided outside of the domains described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gassmann et al., 2012</xref>) and corresponded to sites of only slight local cenH3 enrichment in the X-ChIP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). In the N-ChIP data, cenH3 occupancy was much higher at these peaks compared to the domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). We hypothesized that these sites are preferred for the deposition of centromeric nucleosomes and serve as potential kinetochore attachment sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>cenH3 peaks are hyper-sensitive to MNase digestion</title><p>Previous studies in other organisms observed that centromeric regions were sensitive to MNase or resulted in patterns inconsistent with the presence of canonical nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Polizzi and Clarke, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takahashi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krassovsky et al., 2012</xref>).

We quantified MNase sensitivity at cenH3 peaks, at the nucleosomes immediately flanking the cenH3 peaks, and at the +1 nucleosomes by dividing the occupancy of these features at each time point by the occupancy at the first time point. This analysis revealed that cenH3 nucleosomes were more sensitive to MNase than both flanking and +1 nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To test if the signal at the cenH3 peaks results from KNL-2-dependent incorporation of cenH3, we analyzed the chromatin upon KNL-2 knockdown. KNL-2 depletion by RNAi led to an embryonic lethal phenotype with 99 ± 1% penetrance (n = 8).

To test if the cenH3 peaks indeed correspond to centromeric sites, we compared it to the kinetochore. Previous findings from our lab have suggested that in budding yeast the chromatin fraction that remains insoluble under native conditions after MNase digestion is strongly enriched for kinetochore complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krassovsky et al., 2012</xref>). As there is a one-to-one relationship between the centromere and the kinetochore in budding yeast, and the kinetochore components are conserved between eukaryotes, it can be inferred that kinetochore-bound chromatin remains mostly insoluble under these conditions. We therefore analyzed the distribution of the MNase fragments associated with the chromatin fraction that remained insoluble after MNase digestion and needle extraction and found peaks corresponding to each cenH3 peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This suggested the presence of insoluble complexes, potentially kinetochores, at every cenH3 site in at least part of the cell population analyzed. The insoluble chromatin signal is reduced in <italic>knl-2(RNAi)</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), supporting the interpretation that these peaks correspond to kinetochores. Interestingly, the peaks in the insoluble chromatin were more resistant to MNase than cenH3 nucleosomes in the soluble fraction, and the insoluble chromatin signal persisted even after 10 min of MNase digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), suggesting that the proteins that render cenH3 chromatin insoluble during extraction help to protect it from nuclease digestion.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02025.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CenH3 sites are bound by the kinetochore.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome browser view of cenH3 ChIP (native, 2 min MNase), insoluble chromatin (native, 2 min and 10 min MNase), and CENP-C ChIP (formaldehyde-crosslinked, 2 min MNase) signal at two representative cenH3 sites.

Although CENP-C remains with centromeric DNA throughout the cell cycle in other organisms, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> CENP-C localizes to chromatin only during mitosis, but not interphase, when it is in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moore and Roth, 2001</xref>). As a consequence, only a fraction of the cells analyzed contains CENP-C on chromatin, which limits the dynamic range of ChIP signal that is achievable. Because the kinetochore complex is highly insoluble, no DNA was recovered in native ChIP of CENP-C (data not shown). We therefore profiled CENP-C using MNase followed by formaldehyde crosslinking and solubilization with SDS. We found that CENP-C is enriched at cenH3 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>). Neither the signal in the insoluble fraction nor the signal for CENP-C was enriched over the previously identified cenH3 domains compared to the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Despite the presence of non-centromeric enrichment in the insoluble chromatin fraction and the lower dynamic range of the CENP-C ChIP data, we called peaks in these two data sets and compared them to the cenH3 peak calls. 460 of the 2060 insoluble chromatin peaks and 163 of the 347 insoluble chromatin peaks coincided with cenH3 peaks. In contrast, only 174 insoluble chromatin peaks and 26 CENP-C peaks fell within the domains, in both cases fewer sites than expected by chance (p&lt;0.001). Normalized to the genome coverage of domains and peaks, this amounts to an 800-fold enrichment of insoluble chromatin peaks and an almost 2000-fold enrichment of CENP-C peaks at cenH3 peaks compared to cenH3 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>).

In the input sample after 2 min of MNase digestion, the fragments that cross the dyad of the flanking nucleosomes show a distribution that peaks at 166 bp, consistent with canonical nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, black line). The peak lies at 166 bp rather than the 147 bp minimal protected fragment size for mononucleosomes because of the relatively light MNase digestion required to prevent the loss of cenH3 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Progressive MNase digestion reduced the size of the DNA fragments protected by these particles in a manner expected for nucleosomes, analogous to the size pattern observed for bulk chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). A second peak representing dinucleosomes is also visible at about 330 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, black line). The fragments that cross the center of the cenH3 nucleosomes in the cenH3 ChIP sample after 2 min of MNase digestion show a strikingly different distribution that is left-shifted and indicate that the nucleosomes that occupy these sites protect only about 60–120 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, blue line). The fragments in the insoluble chromatin fraction show a very similar distribution, supporting this size estimate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, magenta line). The dinucleosome peak in the cenH3 ChIP and insoluble chromatin, representing the centromeric nucleosome and one flanking canonical nucleosome, is equally left-shifted to about 260 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, blue and magenta lines). These shorter dinucleosome fragments, protected by two neighboring nucleosomes on the same molecule of DNA, can only be explained by the presence of a smaller centromeric nucleosome, because the inferred size estimates are not affected by possible MNase encroachment on the centromeric nucleosome. After 10 min of MNase digestion, the peak of the distribution of MNase fragments that cross the center of the cenH3 sites in the insoluble fractions lies at 66 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, magenta line), indicating that the minimal protected size of these particles lies in the 60–100 bp range. Moreover, the width at half-height of the average 10 min-digested insoluble chromatin peak that aligns with the cenH3 peaks is 82 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The inferred fragment size protected by the centromeric nucleosome is thus 60–100 bp. These results confirm the findings in other organisms that cenH3 nucleosomes at centromeric sites in <italic>C. elegans</italic> wrap less DNA than that wrapped by canonical nucleosomes.</p><p>CenH3 ChIP also revealed mild enrichment over broad domains. Fragment size analysis revealed that the majority of cenH3 nucleosomes in these regions of the genome protect about 135–155 bp of DNA, and that this size distribution is similar in regions between domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This level of protection is consistent with the findings in other organisms that cenH3 can incorporate into canonical-type nucleosomes away from centromeres, in some cases as cenH3-H3.3 heterotypic nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camahort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krassovsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lacoste et al., 2014</xref>). This further suggests that the cenH3 domains may be distributed independently of the centromere.</p><p>Taken together, fragment size analysis thus revealed that each centromeric site consists of a single cenH3-containing nucleosome that is flanked by two well-positioned canonical nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This chromatin landscape is reminiscent of the budding yeast centromere, where a single cenH3 nucleosome assembles on a genetically defined sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Furuyama and Biggins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henikoff and Henikoff, 2012</xref>). This sequence is flanked by binding sites for centromere-specific protein complexes (Cbf1 and Cbf3) that in turn position two flanking canonical nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Densmore et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krassovsky et al., 2012</xref>).

Instead, the motif we identified is almost identical to the motif associated with <italic>C. elegans</italic> high occupancy target (HOT) sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Based on cytological observations two very different models for holocentricity were proposed more than 60 years ago: diffuse centromeres and polycentromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schrader, 1947</xref>). We use high resolution mapping of centromeric nucleosomes to demonstrate that the polycentromere model is correct for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and that <italic>C. elegans</italic> holocentromeres consist of about 100 centromeric sites on each chromosome. The number of discrete centromeric sites is in excess over the observed number of microtubule attachments, which has been estimated to be ∼100 for all six chromosomes by electron tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O’Toole et al., 2003</xref>). It is possible that only about 15% of the centromeric sites identified in this study are attached in each mitotic cell, which seems reasonable given that we analyzed a diverse cell population. The availability of multiple centromeric sites might reflect redundancy to assure faithful segregation in every cell cycle, although it is also possible that some sites are rendered inaccessible for cenH3 nucleosomes in some cell lineages due to changes in expression profiles during development.</p><p>Polycentromere and diffuse centromere mechanisms might not be mutually exclusive, insofar as a large fraction of cenH3 is incorporated into broad domains that cover half of the genome. It has previously been reported that these domains anti-correlate with transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gassmann et al., 2012</xref>), and we show that they also anti-correlate with H3.3 and correlate with H3K9me3. These correlations all indicate that cenH3 is preferentially located in regions of low nucleosome turnover, and the intrinsic instability of cenH3 nucleosomes may contribute to losing it from ‘open’ chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Conde e Silva, 2007</xref>). The domains are in part shaped by transcription in the germline and are present in the early embryo, however, there is no significant RNA Pol II-dependent transcription during the first two rounds of embryonic cell division. In contrast, H3.3 is deposited in the germline and has a well-established role in the inheritance of chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ooi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ooi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jullien et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, H3.3 is retained both in mature sperm and oocytes, suggesting that it transmits epigenetic information through both the maternal and the paternal germline. The maintenance of H3.3 in sperm might explain how the domain pattern is established on paternal chromatin upon fertilization, even though cenH3 is not maintained in mature sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gassmann et al., 2012</xref>). However, because these domains do not align with the kinetochore, they probably do not have a direct centromere function, although they might serve as cenH3 ‘reservoirs’, in parallel with the suggestion that <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcription factor hotspots might serve as transcription factor reservoirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moorman et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Point centromeres are the building block of polycentromeres</title><p>We have found that individual centromeric sites resemble budding yeast point centromeres: a single cenH3 nucleosome flanked by two well-positioned nucleosomes. Point centromeres are genetically defined in budding yeast, and satellite repeats help position centromeric nucleosomes at regional centromeres in many species. However, neo-centromeres can form on sequences that are not normally linked to centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marshall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shang et al., 2013</xref>). These observations suggest that centromeric nucleosomes are inherited in a sequence-independent way, so that it might seem surprising that a distinct sequence motif is associated with <italic>C. elegans</italic> centromeric sites. However, given that the motif is short and its abundance in the genome by far exceeds the number of centromeric sites, there is no evidence that it is a direct target for cenH3-nucleosome loading. Rather, the DNA at these sites might disfavor the formation of canonical nucleosomes, allowing centromeric nucleosomes to form in these ‘gaps’ in the chromatin landscape. A similar model for worm holocentromeres had been proposed by Gu and Fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu and Fire, 2010</xref>) based on finding ∼120-bp ‘holes’ in the nucleosome landscape that could fit small nucleosomes the size of those previously shown for <italic>Drosophila</italic> cenH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalal et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, virtually any piece of DNA injected into the gonad will concatamerize, acquire a centromere and segregate with varying efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stinchcomb et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mello et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuen et al., 2011</xref>). Opportunistic assembly of centromeric nucleosomes at sites of accessible DNA predicts that cenH3 will be loaded onto any fragment of DNA that contains accessible stretches.

When cells exit the cell cycle and cenH3 is no longer expressed, ‘holes’ in the chromatin landscape might open up and allow HOT site transcription factors to bind by mass action. Although many HOT site transcription factors are cell type-specific, their non-specific binding to holes vacated by cenH3 nucleosomes would result in high HOT site transcription factor occupancy in multiple cell-types. Indeed, we found that cenH3 is lost in adult muscle cells, but that centromeric sites remain occupied, in part by the muscle-specific transcription factor HLH-1 and presumably also by other HOT site transcription factors. Virtually all transcription factors profiled in postembryonic tissues (larval instar 2 and later stages) were found at many, if not all centromeric sites. Replacement of cenH3 nucleosomes by transcription factors at HOT sites upon exit from the cell cycle may then result in their reported enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kvon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>CenH3 protein has been shown to turn over completely during the mitotic cell cycle, to disappear during the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase, to reappear when nuclei progress into diplotene and to be absent from mature sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gassmann et al., 2012</xref>). These observations imply that the centromeric sites need to be marked during certain stages of the cell cycle in order to be repopulated at later stages. The coincidence of cenH3 and HOT sites raises the possibility that low-affinity binding of transcription factors by mass action prevents encroachment of nucleosomes and thus, helps to maintain holocentric sites over the course of development.</p><p>Our results resolve the long-standing question whether holocentromeres are polycentric or diffuse. We show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> holocentromeres are organized as dispersed point centromeres, consistent with the polycentromere model. Our discovery of the coincidence of centromeric sites with transcription factor hotspots points to a possible mechanism for centromeric site selection and maintenance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm culture and RNAi</title><p>We used the standard wild-type strain N2 and OP64 grown at 20°C.

Cluster generation, followed by 25 rounds of paired-end sequencing in an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000, was performed by the FHCRC Genomics Shared Resource.</p><p>After processing and base-calling by Illumina software, paired-end reads were mapped to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome release WS220 using Novoalign (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.novocraft.com">http://www.novocraft.com</ext-link>) with default parameters, except that each multiple hit was mapped to one site chosen at random (Novoalign parameter -r Random). The number of inserts aligned to each 10-bp interval of the genome was counted, and the interval counts were normalized by dividing by the total number of counts for all intervals, and then scaled by multiplying by the number of bases in the genome. We considered fragments &gt;140 bp to represent nucleosomes, the in silico equivalent of excising a gel slice around the ∼150-bp size range from an MNase-digested chromatin ladder and extracting the DNA for single-end sequencing. As we use a modified paired-end sequencing protocol to include all fragments &gt;25 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henikoff et al., 2011</xref>), we can accomplish the size cut more precisely by mapping only the reads in the nucleosome size range. Simple repeat regions were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link> and excluded from all analyses.</p><p>To call peaks, given the discrete nature of the sites of high cenH3 signal, we set a threshold and considered all the features with higher counts as peaks. For cenH3 peak calling, input counts were subtracted from cenH3 ChIP counts for two biological replicates (2 min MNase), and peaks that exceeded 30 counts in at least one of the biological replicates were considered positive. For CENP-C peak calling, input counts were subtracted from CENP-C ChIP counts, and peaks that exceeded 20 counts were considered positive. For insoluble chromatin peak calling, peaks that exceeded 100 counts were considered positive.</p><p>To normalize against input, we used log<sub>2</sub>-ratios only to compare to previously published array data. Otherwise, we consider input reads a separate “blank” experiment that we subtract from the ChIP counts.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jorja Henikoff for data analysis, Christine Codomo, Terri Bryson and Aaron Hernandez for reagent preparation, Srinivas Ramachandran, Sivakanthan Kasinathan and Christopher Weber for help with the data analysis, James Priess for providing reagents and lab space, Mark Roth and Mike Morrison for providing antibodies and Sue Biggins, Takehito Furuyama, James Priess, Peter Skene, Paul Talbert, Christopher Weber and Gabriel Zentner for comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Detlef Weigel, and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Asifa Akhtar, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This report describes the distribution of centromeric chromatin in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and proposes a new model for “holocentric” chromosomes. A previous study had mapped the centromeric histone cenH3 by ChIP-chip to large domains throughout the genome and concluded that the centromeres of C. elegans do not reside in discrete locations but form randomly in intergenic regions (“diffuse centromeres”). This study uses a different method (ChIP-Seq) to map cenH3 and comes to a very different conclusion: in addition to the broad domains, they identify ∼700 discrete locations for cenH3 and conclude that the centromeres of <italic>C. elegans</italic> are in fact similar to the point centromeres of yeast. The authors also describe that the centromeres correspond to the so-called “HOT” sites where transcription factors tend to accumulate in non-dividing cells. These observations are novel, resolve a long-standing question regarding the structure of holocentric chromosomes, and have intriguing implications for the formation and maintenance of centromeres.</p><p>All three reviewers are generally interested in your work and find the study of significant importance to be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the consensus among the reviewers is that the following aspects of the paper must be strengthened before we proceed further. Here are the most important points that should be addressed upon revision.</p><p>The authors should demonstrate more convincingly that cenH3 peaks and not broad cenH3 domains are the centromeres that build the kinetochore. To be more convincing they need to present the CENP-C X-chip in a more transparent and comprehensive manner:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, only two regions of the CENP-C X-Chip are shown. To assess the quality of the CENP-C X-Chip it would be really important to see a larger region of DNA as it has been done in other figures of this paper.</p><p>- How many CENP-C sites are identified?</p><p>- What sub-fraction of cenH3 peaks overlaps with what subfraction of the other sequences with centromere-like behavior: insoluble sites and CENP-C peaks (a Venn diagram or other graphical means could be useful). Most importantly, how does this compare to broad cenH3 domains?</p><p>2) Given that the MNase digest is important to the argument that the identified cenH3 sites show the properties of point centromeres, the authors should show a control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for MNase digestion, such as an H3 nucleosome where the amplitude is less sensitive when compared to cenH3.</p><p>3) More information on the peak calling should be provided as this confused two reviewers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02025.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref><italic>, only two regions of the CENP-C X-Chip are shown. To assess the quality of the CENP-C X-Chip it would be really important to see a larger region of DNA as it has been done in other figures of this paper</italic>.</p><p>The quality of the CENP-C X-ChIP should be most evident from the heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, which depicts the signals over the 707 centromere sites. We did not use the CENP-C data to call sites; only to confirm that the sites that we called based on cenH3 data were enriched in CENP-C, and the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> heat map and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2B</xref> boxplots clearly make this point. It shows that the enrichment of CENP-C at cenH3 sites is not restricted to the two example peaks shown and extends to the large majority of cenH3 sites genome-wide. We acknowledge that the CENP-C X-ChIP data are inherently much noisier than the cenH3 native ChIP data. The reason for this is at least in part biological, as cenH3 is present on chromatin through the vast majority of the cell cycle, while CENP-C was previously shown to be localized to cenH3 sites during mitosis, but not during interphase (Moore and Roth, 2001 PMID:11402064). As only a small fraction of the embryonic cells analyzed are in mitosis, the signal-to-noise ratio is inevitably much lower. Nevertheless, CENP-C ChIP signal-to-noise is sufficient to confirm that the cenH3 sites correspond to kinetochore sites, and we have further strengthened this conclusion as described below.</p><p><italic>- How many CENP-C sites are identified</italic>?</p><p><italic>- What sub-fraction of cenH3 peaks overlaps with what subfraction of the other sequences with centromere-like behavior: insoluble sites and CENP-C peaks (a Venn diagram or other graphical means could be useful). Most importantly, how does this compare to broad cenH3 domains</italic>?</p><p>We agree that a direct head-to-head comparison of cenH3 peaks and broad domains with respect to insoluble sites and CENP-C peaks is important to strengthen our conclusion that cenH3 sites correspond to kinetochore sites. There are 347 CENP-C peaks, of which 163 overlap with the cenH3 sites, whereas only 26 CENP-C peaks overlap with the domains. Based on the fact that the coverage of cenH3 peaks is only 0.3% that of broad domains, the enrichment of CENP-C at cenH3 peaks relative to cenH3 domains is (163/26)/0.003 ≈ 2000-fold. Similarly, there are 2060 peaks in the insoluble chromatin, 460 of which coincide with the cenH3 peaks, compared to 147 for the domains, which implies a relative enrichment of insoluble chromatin at cenH3 peaks to cenH3 broad domains of (147/460)/0.003 ≈ 800-fold. Importantly, the densities of both CENP-C and insoluble chromatin peaks within the domains are significantly <italic>lower</italic> than within the rest of the genome. That is, our CENP-C ChIP data not only confirm that the cenH3 peaks are kinetochore sites, the data also argue against the hypothesis that broad domains harbor kinetochore sites. We have included these new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>, panels C and D and now make this point in the text (Results section entitled “CenH3 peaks correspond to kinetochore sites”).</p><p><italic>2) Given that the MNase digest is important to the argument that the identified cenH3 sites show the properties of point centromeres, the authors should show a control in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>for MNase digestion, such as an H3 nucleosome where the amplitude is less sensitive when compared to cenH3</italic>.</p><p>We agree that we had not sufficiently described the characteristic MNase sensitivity of the point centromere sites. To strengthen this point, we have substantially revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>, and expanded the text describing the MNase sensitivity (Results section entitled “cenH3 peaks are hyper-sensitive to MNase digestion”). We now show the progression of the MNase digest separately for the input and cenH3 ChIP samples, both for an extended region around the two example peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and at all sites genome-wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This illustrates that the cenH3 peaks are sensitive to MNase, while the surrounding chromatin features remain relatively unaffected. For comparison, we now also include the pattern for progressive digestion of the input chromatin at the +1 nucleosomes of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the MNase-sensitivity of cenH3 nucleosomes, the nucleosomes flanking the cenH3 peaks and the +1 nucleosomes, we plotted the occupancy at these features relative to the occupancy of first time point. This clearly shows that the cenH3 peaks are more MNase-sensitive than both the flanking and +1 nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) More information on the peak calling should be provided as this confused two reviewers</italic>.</p><p>We have extended the description of our very simple peak calling in the Methods section (penultimate paragraph of the section entitled “Illumina sequencing and data analysis”) and added a sentence in the Results section (entitled “High resolution mapping of cenH3 reveals discrete high occupancy sites”). We classified all sites that exceeded 30 normalized counts in at least one of two biological replicate (cenH3 ChIP minus input) as peaks. 30 counts is the equivalent of the genome-wide mean plus seven standard deviations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
