All known Cas9 enzymes are thought to recognize DNA exclusively as a natural substrate, providing protection against DNA phage and plasmids. Here, we show that Cas9 enzymes from both subtypes II-A and II-C can recognize and cleave single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) by an RNA-guided mechanism that is independent of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence in the target RNA. RNA-guided RNA cleavage is programmable and site-specific, and we find that this activity can be exploited to reduce infection by single-stranded RNA phage in vivo. We also demonstrate that Cas9 can direct PAM-independent repression of gene expression in bacteria. These results indicate that a subset of Cas9 enzymes have the ability to act on both DNA and RNA target sequences, and suggest the potential for use in programmable RNA targeting applications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32724.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Similar to humans, bacteria use an immune system known as the CRISPR-Cas system to protect themselves against invading pathogens such as viruses. CRISPRs are specialized stretches of DNA that guide Cas9 to the right location, while Cas9 proteins act like scissors that can cut foreign DNA.</p><p>When a virus infects a bacterium, the bacterium steals a piece of DNA from the virus and stores it in its CRISPR region. The bacterium then produces a small RNA template that matches the stolen DNA of the virus and adds a specialized protein to it. When the virus infects the cell again, the protein-RNA complex can recognize the virus and stop the infection.</p><p>Researchers have successfully adapted this system as a gene-editing tool to target and modify specific DNA sequences in different organisms. Cas9 can target and cut DNA, but until now, it was not clear whether this protein could also efficiently target RNA – the ‘genetic middleman’ between DNA and proteins. RNA is essential to make proteins, and being able to target RNA would allow researchers to answer many important questions about RNA biology.</p><p>To investigate this further, Strutt et al. used three different subtypes of Cas9 proteins and small RNA sequences in a test tube. The results showed that two of the protein subtypes could target RNA efficiently, and one of which was able to target any RNA sequence. Strutt et al. then used one Cas9 to target specific RNA sequences in bacteria and were able to reduce the amount of protein made from that gene. Moreover, the Cas9 protein helped to protect the bacteria against an RNA virus.</p><p>This work lays the foundation for using this Cas9 protein as a tool for researchers to study RNA in cells. A next step will be to test if Cas9 can cut RNA in human cells. If this works, it could allow direct targeting of RNA viruses, such as West Nile and Dengue, to stop them from infecting human cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>programmable</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1244557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strutt</surname><given-names>Steven C</given-names></name><name><surname>Doudna</surname><given-names>Jennifer A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torrez</surname><given-names>Rachel M</given-names></name><name><surname>Doudna</surname><given-names>Jennifer A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Academic Exchange Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaya</surname><given-names>Emine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007000</institution-id><institution>Laboratory Directed Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Negrete</surname><given-names>Oscar A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Paul Allen Frontiers Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doudna</surname><given-names>Jennifer A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Divergent Cas9 enzymes direct site-specific single-stranded RNA cleavage, reducing infection by RNA phage in vivo and enabling programmable, PAM-independent repression of gene expression in bacteria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prokaryotic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems provide immunity against plasmids and bacteriophage by using foreign DNA stored as CRISPR spacer sequences together with Cas nucleases to stop infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wright et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mohanraju et al., 2016</xref>). One such nuclease, Cas9 of the type II systems, employs a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) to target spacer-complementary regions (protospacers) on the foreign genetic element to guide double-stranded DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>). A protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) must also be present for the Cas9-RNA complex to bind and cleave DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gasiunas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szczelkun et al., 2014</xref>). Combining the crRNA and tracrRNA into a chimeric, single-guide RNA (sgRNA) simplified the system for widespread adoption as a versatile genome editing technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To date, both genetic and biochemical data support the conclusion that <italic>in vivo</italic>, Cas9 is exclusively a DNA-targeting enzyme. Nonetheless, multiple studies have harnessed Cas9 for RNA targeting under specific circumstances. For example, the <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> Cas9 (SpyCas9) can be supplied with a short DNA oligo containing the PAM sequence (a PAMmer) to induce single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) binding and cutting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Connell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelles et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, it was demonstrated that SpyCas9 could be used to target repetitive RNAs and repress translation in certain mRNAs in the absence of a PAMmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batra et al., 2017</xref>). A different Cas9 homolog from <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> (FnoCas9) has been implicated in degradation of a specific mRNA but through a mechanism independent of RNA-based cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sampson et al., 2013</xref>). Together with evidence that some Cas9 homologs can target single-stranded DNA substrates under some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), these studies raised the possibility that certain Cas9 enzymes might have intrinsic RNA-guided RNA cleavage activity.</p><p>To determine whether evolutionarily divergent Cas9 homologs have a native capacity for programmable RNA targeting, we compared biochemical behavior of enzymes from the three major Cas9 subtypes. This analysis revealed that certain type II-A and II-C Cas9s can bind and cleave single-stranded RNA sequences with no requirement for a PAM or PAMmer. Furthermore, we found that this activity can inhibit gene expression and confer moderate protection against infection by ssRNA phage through a mechanism reminiscent of RNA-guided DNA targeting. These results establish the utility of Cas9 for facile RNA-guided RNA targeting and suggest that this activity may have biological relevance in bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cas9 catalyzes PAM-independent RNA-guided RNA cleavage</title><p>To assess whether divergent Cas9 enzymes can catalyze binding to and cleavage of RNA substrates by a mechanism distinct from that of double-stranded DNA cleavage, we tested homologs from the three major subtypes of Cas9 proteins for their ability to cleave single-stranded RNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Hydrolysis mapping of the cleavage product revealed that the predominant RNA cleavage site is shifted by one nucleotide compared to the site of DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garneau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gasiunas et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>). The shift is consistent with that observed for PAM-dependent SpyCas9 RNA-cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Connell et al., 2014</xref>) and is likely due to the more compact geometry of an RNA-RNA helix relative to an RNA-DNA hybrid helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 1982</xref>).</p><p>SauCas9 targets ssRNA in the absence of a PAMmer, a contrast to SpyCas9 targeting of ssRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Connell et al., 2014</xref>). Testing SauCas9 in vitro ssRNA cleavage in the presence of a PAMmer (30x molar excess over ssRNA target) revealed that turn-over was two-fold slower than the reaction with only target ssRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). SauCas9 ssRNA cleavage conducted in the presence of a non-complementary, control DNA oligo did not yield a similar reduction in cleavage rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), indicating that the complementary PAMmer impairs RNA cleavage activity. Consistent with cleavage being guide-dependent, single-stranded RNA that is not complementary to the sgRNA is not cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is also not a substrate for SauCas9.</p><p>Given that Cas9 proteins are active with different length guide RNA segments (~20–24 nt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chylinski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), we tested whether longer guide segments might enhance ssRNA targeting activity. Increasing the length of the targeting region of the guide up to 23 nt results in tighter binding and more efficient cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), mirroring the preference for longer guides for DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedland et al., 2015</xref>). Extending the guide strand complementarity to the target beyond 23 nt did not increase RNA target binding or cleavage efficiency, indicating that 23 nt is the optimal length for in vitro binding and targeting applications. The apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d,app</sub>) of the SauCas9-sgRNA complex (23 nt targeting region) for the ssRNA target is 1.8 ± 0.09 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>), which is ~5 x weaker than the 0.34 ± 0.03 nM binding affinity measured for a dsDNA substrate of the same sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cleavage efficiency is impaired by duplex regions in target RNA</title><p>We noted that SauCas9-catalyzed ssRNA cleavage is limited to ~30% fraction cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), compared to &gt;80% fraction cleaved for ssDNA and dsDNA targets. Greater thermodynamic stability of RNA secondary structures, relative to those in ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bercy and Bockelmann, 2015</xref>), might occlude SauCas9-sgRNA binding to an ssRNA target sequence, a possibility that we tested using a panel of partially duplexed RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

However, when the unpaired region was increased to 12-base pairs, SauCas9 was able to cleave the target strand.

We measured the binding affinity of all substrates and found that both the 23-base pair mismatched segment RNA and ssRNA substrates are bound with similar affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, the apparent difference in cleavage efficiency was not due to the presence of a double-stranded PAM sequence, as mutating the PAM region does not impair cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, compare substrates 8 and 9). We hypothesize that RNA containing a mismatched segment presents a more accessible substrate to the Cas9-sgRNA complex due to stable annealing between the ends of the non-target and target strands, whereas the ssRNA substrate alone has ends that are predicted to stabilize a conformation that is partially structured and therefore inaccessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>An alternative hypothesis to explain the limited cleavage of ssRNA substrates is that SauCas9 enzyme inactivation occurs over the course of the reaction, even with SauCas9 protein-sgRNA (ribonucleoprotein, RNP) present in 10-fold excess relative to the ssRNA substrate. To test this, we spiked reactions with fresh SauCas9 protein alone or SauCas9 RNP after reactions reached equilibrium; however, we did not observe an increase in the amount of ssRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). We also tested whether the SauCas9 RNP was able to cleave a second ssRNA substrate that was added to the reaction after it reached completion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). After 1 hr of incubation, the addition of a second target ssRNA complementary to the guide RNA resulted in a burst of cleavage activity, whereas a non-complementary ssRNA substrate did not stimulate cleavage. The second target ssRNA is cleaved to a comparable extent to that observed when this second target was the only substrate in the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>, compare reactions 1 and 3). These observations suggest that SauCas9 RNP is still competent and available for cleavage at the end of the reaction and that a property intrinsic to the ssRNA substrate is the limiting factor. We propose that the observed difference in cleavage extents for various RNA substrates reflects the fraction of molecules that are structurally accessible for cleavage by the SauCas9 RNP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SauCas9 confers in vivo protection against RNA phage</title><p>Based on the biochemical ability of SauCas9 RNP to bind and cleave ssRNA substrates, we wondered whether this activity might provide protection against RNA phage infection in bacteria.

The majority of these sgRNAs were perfectly complementary to the MS2 genome, and only three and five control sgRNAs (out of 708 total control sgRNAs) for the MOI-10 and −100 conditions, respectively, were enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The lengths of enriched guide sequences were skewed toward shorter targeting lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left); however, this likely reflects bias in the cloned input library since the ratio between the enriched guide sequences and those of the library without phage selection are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right). When comparing the degree of enrichment between the different guide lengths, the 23-nt guide segment sgRNAs were preferentially enriched over those of shorter length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), consistent with the in vitro observation that longer guides are more efficient for directing ssRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). To assess whether there was any sequence bias within the enriched guides, we aligned guide sequences of all lengths at their 3’ end. These alignments showed no specific sequence bias in the enriched guides relative to those in the unselected library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is consistent with the crystal structure of an SauCas9-sgRNA-DNA-bound complex which revealed the absence of base-specific contacts of Cas9 to the target strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nishimasu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, mapping enriched guide sequences onto the MS2 genome showed that enriched sgRNAs were clustered at specific regions, which were consistent across both experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Together with our biochemical data suggesting that SauCas9 cannot bind or cleave structured RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we interpret these targeting ‘hotspots’ to be regions of low structural complexity. It is important to note that sgRNAs containing different guide segment lengths overlap at these regions, possibly indicating that increases in targeting efficiency due to guide length are secondary to target accessibility to the Cas9 RNP. We mapped the enriched guide sequences onto the published secondary structure of the MS2 genome determined through cryoelectron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Guides targeted not only single-stranded, accessible regions but also those that form apparently stable secondary structures. The structure of the MS2 genome was determined on the intact phage particle, however, and may not represent the RNA structure(s) relevant to the infection stage during which SauCas9-mediated protection is crucial.</p><p>Highly enriched sgRNAs from the screen were confirmed for their ability to confer protection against MS2 phage infection through a soft-agar plaque assay. Reconstitution of SauCas9 with a targeting guide confers approximately a ten-fold protection against the RNA phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). No protection was observed in the absence of an sgRNA or SauCas9 protein. Scrambling the sequence of the guide also abrogates protection, confirming that sequence complementary is necessary for phage elimination. Guide segments of all lengths tested (20–23 nts) conferred protection to a similar level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>), consistent with the result from the MS2 screen that guide segments of all lengths were enriched in ‘hotspot’ regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Two ‘control’ guides were enriched in both the MOI-10 and −100 treatments. Interestingly, both guides conferred protection but their scrambled counterparts did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). Whereas a possible off-target binding site was found for one guide (#14238) within the MS2 genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>), it remains unclear how guide #14210 confers protection. Possibly this sgRNA acts by targeting an <italic>E. coli</italic> host factor that is necessary for infection.</p><p>Screening against the MS2 genome was also used to test the effect of single-nucleotide mismatches on SauCas9’s targeting ability. We computed an average fold change (between phage treated and untreated samples) for all sgRNAs that contained a mismatch at the same position, and obtained average values for mismatches at each position across the guide. We observed a pronounced gradient of increasing guide stringency with length. On average, short guides were less sensitive to mismatches, while mismatches in longer sgRNAs led to decreased recovery compared to control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). Previous work and models suggest that shorter guide segments should be more sensitive to mismatches and lead to higher fidelity Cas9 targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisaria et al., 2017</xref>). Further study is needed to thoroughly examine this unexpected pattern of RNA-targeting stringency, as one shortcoming of this experiment is that mismatched guides were not designed, <italic>a priori</italic>, to recognize accessible parts of the MS2 genome. Nevertheless, despite potential noise introduced in this analysis due to guide segments that target inaccessible MS2 regions, we observe an interesting correlation between mismatches in the MS2 screen and in vitro biochemical cleavage assays for the sgRNA with a 23 nt guide segment sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C,D</xref>). The first few nucleotides in the ‘seed’ region (guide 3´ end proximal) are sensitive to mismatches, while a central region of sensitivity is also observed, similar to previously demonstrated regions of sensitivity for SpyCas9 DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorski et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SauCas9 represses gene expression in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>An efficient RNA-targeting Cas9 could serve as an important tool in regulating gene expression in vivo.

We tiled sgRNAs across the GFP mRNA sequence to test the robustness of dSauCas9 to repress GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As no sites are adjacent to PAM sequences, all repression presumably occurs on the mRNA level. The efficiency of dSauCas9-mediated GFP repression varied according to the target sequence, with some dSauCas9 RNPs reducing GFP signal to 15–30% of that observed in the presence of the sgRNA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, GFP2 and 6) and others showing no ability to repress GFP expression (GFP7 and 9). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays support the conclusion that repression is not occurring at the dsDNA level by promiscuous PAM binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Repression is largely equivalent between catalytically active and inactive forms of SauCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that binding of the Cas9-sgRNA complex to the mRNA is sufficient for repression and consistent with in vitro data showing that the enzyme does not catalyze multiple-turnover RNA cleavage. While we speculate that the Cas9-RNP blocks the ribosome directly (either at initiation or during elongation), our data do not rule out the possibility that Cas9 is otherwise destabilizing the mRNA transcript through an unknown mechanism.</p><p>Together our biochemical and in vivo data support a model in which SauCas9 can readily bind and cleave bacteriophage RNA and mRNA sequences that are exposed and unstructured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Regions that form strong structures are inaccessible to SauCas9 RNP binding, thereby preventing cleavage or repression activity. As Cas9 cleavage activity is limited by target accessibility, we expect that RNA occluded by RNA-binding proteins would also be recalcitrant to cleavage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Investigation of CRISPR-Cas9 has focused on its function as a double-stranded DNA endonuclease, while the ability of diverse homologs to cleave natural RNA substrates has remained unexplored. Here, we present evidence that type II-A and type II-C Cas9 enzymes can catalyze programmable and PAM-independent single-stranded RNA cleavage. Focusing on SauCas9, we show that this enzyme can be employed both biochemically and in cells to cleave RNA and regulate genes on both the transcriptional and translational level in parallel by accounting for target site PAM proximity. Importantly, SauCas9 ssRNA scission requires only an sgRNA and does not need a PAMmer, thereby simplifying applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelles et al., 2015</xref>) and facilitating delivery to cells as a pre-assembled RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zuris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mout et al., 2017</xref>)</p><p>The RNA-targeting capability of SauCas9 and related Cas9 enzymes offers the advantage of repressing viruses whose lifecycles do not involve a DNA genome or intermediate, thereby rendering them inaccessible to Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage. We demonstrated that SauCas9 could be programmed to confer protection to <italic>E. coli</italic> against MS2, an RNA bacteriophage with no DNA intermediate. Whether RNA-based viral repression by Cas9 occurs in natural systems is not known, but seems possible based on our results. DNA cleavage by SauCas9 remains more rapid than RNA cleavage, indicating that DNA-targeting is probably the biologically preferred method for phage and plasmid interference. However, Cas9 activity on RNA is PAM-independent and may mitigate the effects of PAM-escape mutants that would evade DNA-level interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deveau et al., 2008</xref>), thus acting as an additional line of defense.</p><p>Intriguingly, ‘hotspots’ of preferential targeting emerged when tiling guides across the genome, but these sites were devoid of sequence bias. In conjunction with in vitro cleavage data of partially structured RNAs, we suggest that SauCas9 cleavage efficiency is inversely related to structural complexity of the RNA target. As an alternative to the current approach of screening multiple sgRNAs for activity, experimental knowledge about RNA structure, such as SHAPE-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loughrey et al., 2014</xref>), would simplify target identification for viral targeting and repression experiments. Nevertheless, future work will concentrate on understanding the structural constraints on RNA targeting and methods to improve Cas9 access to duplex RNA regions.</p><p>SauCas9 holds promise for a range of RNA targeting applications. We showed that SauCas9 could repress gene expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Repression of the reporter occurs in the absence of the PAM and is specific for targeting of the coding strand. Recently, the Type VI CRISPR-Cas system effector, Cas13, has been proposed and demonstrated to target RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shmakov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abudayyeh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">East-Seletsky et al., 2016</xref>). ‘Activated’ Cas13 exhibits robust <italic>trans</italic> cleavage of RNAs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abudayyeh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">East-Seletsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smargon et al., 2017</xref>). While RNA-cleavage by SauCas9 is single-turnover and kinetically less robust than that of Cas13, Cas9 does not cleave RNAs indiscriminately and lends itself to targeting of specific transcripts. A programmable Cas9 capable of repressing genes on the RNA level has potential advantages over CRISPRi DNA-based techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>). For example, isoform-specific targeting of different transcripts originating from the same transcription start site or resulting from alternative splicing events might be possible. More broadly, due to its intrinsic ssRNA-binding activity, SauCas9 may have utility as a platform for directing other effector proteins to specific RNA molecules, such as proteins or domains that up-regulate translation or RNA base-modifying enzymes for site-specific epigenetic modification of RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21(DE3)</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>XL1-Blue</td><td>QB3-MacroLab</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>strain with GFP reporter</td><td>PMID: 27136077</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>SauCas9 expression vector</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>SauCas9 sequence in vector backbone from PMID: 27136077</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>His-MBP vector (plasmid - #29706)</td><td>addgene</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>SauCas9 guide expression vector</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>SauCas9 guide scaffold in vector backbone from PMID: 27136077</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageQuantTL</td><td>GE Healthcare</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014246">SCR_014246</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prism7</td><td>GE Healthcare</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015807">SCR_015807</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Phylogenetic tree construction and RNA folding</title><p>Cas9 homolog sequences were obtained from Chylinski and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chylinski et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Ailong Ke (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your manuscript presents novel Cas9 RNA targeting activity from diverse Type II-A and II-C CRISPR-Cas systems, and show ssRNA targeting and cleavage in a non-canonical PAM- and PAMmer-independent manner. The reviewers universally agree that this is a valuable addition to the literature, and that some of the findings create opportunities for both expansion of the CRISPR toolbox, and for diversification of applications.</p><p>Unless you are keen on performing additional experiments to address specific items listed below, altering the narrative to present the antiviral activity as a proof of concept, and speculating about the mechanism of action driving the translational effect would be acceptable.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>First, the authors showed that both <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Sau) and <italic>C. jejuni</italic> (Cje) Cas9 can cleave about 30-40% of ssRNA substrates in the absence of a PAMmer (which actually lowered cleavage efficiency) and determined that SauCas9 has roughly 5-fold higher K¬D¬ for ssRNA than dsDNA. Next the authors showed that RNA secondary structure can inhibit cleavage, yet interestingly, introducing mismatches in dsRNA substrates recovered activity and even exceeded the activity towards the ssRNA substrate. SauCas9's ability to cleave RNA also allowed <italic>E. coli</italic> to defend itself versus MS2 infection and was shown to be useful in knocking down GFP expression in a reporter <italic>E. coli</italic> line.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The biochemical data provided to establish PAM-independent, RNA-mediated ssRNA targeting is convincing and the narrative articulate. The reliance on guide RNA loading, the presence of active residues (D10 and N580) and divalent metal ions is clear, as well as the impairment by target RNA structural features. The same does not apply to the sections dedicated to defense vs. RNA phages, and to a lesser extent, to the repression of protein translation. In the case of viral RNA defense, while there is admittedly basic proof of concept showing reduction by an order of magnitude, it is unclear how potent and biologically relevant and useful this activity is. The authors may consider testing more guides (perhaps in the vicinity of the most functional guides tested thus far, within &quot;hotspots of low structural complexity&quot;), and may consider testing the combination of multiple guides concurrently (a la CRISPR multiplexed arrays, or with multiple independent guides) to show more potent viral resistance. The authors should readily be able to combine guides 23 and 22 to (hopefully) show enhanced resistance (guides 20 and 21 shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> are also candidates). This would enable them to keep their current conclusions about the reduction of viral infection. Another alternative would be to tone down the conclusions provided in the narrative, though this is an appealing and valuable portion of the manuscript.</p><p>With regards to repression of protein synthesis in bacteria, the levels observed are likewise somewhat quantitatively underwhelming, but do provide proof of concept preliminary results. Again, the authors should consider performing additional experiments (possibly also based on multiplexing guides to enhance the reduction effect), or alter the conclusiveness of their statements. Perhaps two of some of the most potent guides shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> could be combined. This is also a valuable element of the narrative that would be work substantiating more to support the conclusions presented.</p><p>All biochemical experiments were performed on the same pUC RNA target, which ignores the effect that target sequence may have on KD¬, spacer length preference, etc. Additionally, while the pUC RNA is predicted to have secondary structure, there are a number of weak or wobble base pairs. How does RNA sequence change Cas9's kinetic parameters and do RNA targets with stronger secondary structure preclude Cas9 cutting?</p><p>The authors demonstrated that GFP expression can be reduced by targeting SauCas9 to GFP transcripts. However, the authors didn't provide sufficient evidence to suggest that repression is on the translational level. Cas9 binding may still act on the transcriptional level by interfering with RNAP progression in a Rho-like fashion, or by destabilizing mRNA transcripts, leading to their degradation. Ribosomal profiling should definitively show that Cas9 diminishes expression by blocking ribosome progression.</p><p>The translational repression effect is presumably due to action on ribosomes, possibly prevention of ribosome loading, elongation inhibition, or reduction of tRNA accessibility. mRNA degradation affects translation but is not the translation mechanism per se. While ribosome profiling may require extra efforts and not fit within the scope of the manuscript, the authors may consider it, or possibly testing the approach on a bi-cistronic system: RBS1-A-RBS2-B, and show whether targeting A only affects A.

Other sequences displayed a lower fraction cleaved at completion of the assay and were predicted to form stronger secondary structures than the pUC target. We believe that RNA structure seems to be a limitation on the ability of SauCas9 to cleave RNA given the in vitro cleavage experiment of partially-duplexed RNAs presented in this manuscript. We imagine that sequences that form stronger secondary structures would lower the rate of cleavage by SauCas9; however, SauCas9 RNA-targeting does not seem to be limited to certain RNA sequences as no preferential motifs were detected in the target sequences enriched in the MS2 in vivo screen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regards to repression of protein synthesis in bacteria, the levels observed are likewise somewhat quantitatively underwhelming, but do provide proof of concept preliminary results.

In the absence of a PAM, we did not observe binding of SauCas9 to dsDNA in vitro. Thus, the activity of SauCas9 does not seem to be mediated by a CRISPRi-like, PAM-dependent inhibition of transcription. It is possible that SauCas9 blocks the ribosome (either at initiation or during elongation) or, as the reviewers suggest, by otherwise destabilizing the transcript. The text has been revised to include these possibilities and to emphasize the PAM-independent repression of gene expression, more broadly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
