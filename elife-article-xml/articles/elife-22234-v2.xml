The abnormal axon morphology and mitochondrial retrograde transport defects observed in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants are distinct from dynein and dynactin mutant axonal phenotypes. In addition, Actr10 lacking the dynactin binding domain maintains its ability to bind mitochondria, arguing for a role for Actr10 in dynactin-mitochondria interaction. Finally, genetic interaction studies implicated Drp1 as a partner in Actr10-dependent mitochondrial retrograde transport. Together, this work identifies Actr10 as a factor necessary for dynactin-mitochondria interaction, enhancing our understanding of how mitochondria properly localize in axons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22234.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22234.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>axonal transport</kwd><kwd>dynactin</kwd><kwd>p150</kwd><kwd>actr10</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1K99NS086903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drerup</surname><given-names>Catherine M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD072844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nechiporuk</surname><given-names>Alex V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>OHSU Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMEN0245A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nechiporuk</surname><given-names>Alex V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 NS096814</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herbert</surname><given-names>Amy L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Philip and Seema Needleman</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herbert</surname><given-names>Amy L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Harry Weaver Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monk</surname><given-names>Kelly R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Actr10, a dynactin pointed end protein, is essential for mitochondrial interaction with the dynein-dynactin retrograde motor and subsequent transport.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondrial transport in axons is critical for the formation and function of the nervous system. This organelle generates the ATP necessary for energy demanding functions in all cells, but neurons are especially reliant on mitochondria to maintain their electrically polarized state. After depolarization, ATP-dependent ion pumps are employed to repolarize the cell and prepare it for another action potential. It is estimated that at rest alone, neurons use 4.7 billion molecules of ATP per second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Because of this large ATP requirement, mitochondria need to be properly localized to regions of high ion influx, such as at synapses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schwarz, 2013</xref>). In addition to their critical role in cellular metabolism, mitochondria also regulate local calcium ion levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Werth and Thayer, 1994</xref>). Calcium efflux from intracellular stores mediates synaptic activity. During inactivity, this ion needs to be contained in intracellular compartments as high cytoplasmic calcium levels correlate with axonal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avery et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). The proper localization of mitochondria to sites of high ATP consumption and calcium ion flux requires active transport.</p><p>In addition to maintaining axon health, mitochondrial motility is also necessary to maintain mitochondrial health and function. Mitochondria undergo fission-fusion dynamics that facilitate both the replenishment of proteins in this organelle and the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA quantity and integrity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scheibye-Knudsen et al., 2015</xref>). Interrupted mitochondrial fission or fusion has been linked to loss of mitochondrial DNA, loss of oxidative potential, and mitophagy. Axonal transport of mitochondria is tightly linked to mitochondrial dynamics as mitochondrial fusion requires the coalescence of mitochondria and fission requires the active separation of dividing organelles. The relationship between mitochondrial dynamics and transport is also apparent at the molecular level: Mitofusin, an essential protein for mitochondrial fusion, participates in the anterograde transport of this organelle as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Misko et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, manipulation of the dynamin-like protein Drp1, necessary for mitochondrial fission, impacts the localization of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smirnova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Varadi et al., 2004</xref>). The mechanistic bases for these relationships are still largely unclear.</p><p>Elegant work in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and cultured neurons has begun to elucidate the mechanisms of mitochondrial axonal transport. The primary anterograde mitochondrial motor, Kinesin-1, attaches to mitochondria via the proteins Miro (RhoT1/2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2005</xref>) and Milton (TRAK1/2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glater et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>). Miro contains calcium sensitive EF hands that, when exposed to high levels of this ion, change their confirmation, resulting in the uncoupling of the Kinesin-1 motor from microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saotome et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Schwarz, 2009</xref>). This mechanism, in conjunction with mitochondrial tethering factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2008</xref>), allows mitochondrial congregation at sites of high synaptic activity. The Miro/Milton transport machinery is not specific for anterograde transport, however, as loss of either protein impacts anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saotome et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, how mitochondria are specifically moved in a unidirectional manner by either the Kinesin or Dynein motor protein complex is not well understood.</p><p>Retrograde mitochondrial transport is known to depend on the cytoplasmic dynein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pilling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schnapp and Reese, 1989</xref>). The core dynein motor (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994</xref>) is oftentimes associated with dynactin, itself a multi-protein complex, during retrograde axonal transport. Dynactin, specifically its p150 subunit, has been shown to facilitate dynein processivity and also serves as an anchor for dynein at microtubule plus ends, facilitating cargo loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lloyd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moughamian and Holzbaur, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schroer, 2004</xref>). The dynactin accessory complex is attached to dynein through interaction of p150 with the tails of the dynein intermediate chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vaughan and Vallee, 1995</xref>). In addition to p150, dynactin contains two actin-related proteins, Arp1 and Actr10 (also known as Arp11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eckley et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eckley and Schroer, 2003</xref>). Together with p25, p62 and p27, Actr10 is a part of the dynactin pointed end complex which is predicted to be in an ideal location for cargo binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeh et al., 2012</xref>). Structural work suggests that one key function for Actr10 is capping the actin-like Arp1 filament, to regulate filament length and facilitate attachment of other pointed end proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>); however, this does not preclude an additional role for Actr10 in cargo attachment to the dynein complex, a function which has not been explored.</p><p>In a forward genetic screen for mediators of retrograde axonal transport, we identified a strain with a loss-of-function mutation in Actr10. <italic>actr10<sup>nl15</sup></italic> mutants (hereafter referred to as <italic>actr10</italic>) display axon terminal swellings in the central and peripheral nervous systems indicative of retrograde transport abnormalities. Analysis of cargo localization and movement in the <italic>actr10</italic> mutant revealed clustering of mitochondria, but not other cargos analyzed, at microtubule plus ends due to failed retrograde mitochondrial movement. This phenotype was vastly different from loss of either Dynein heavy chain or p150, potentially indicating a unique function for Actr10 in mitochondrial retrograde movement. Furthermore, we demonstrated that abnormal mitochondrial movement in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants is due to failed attachment of mitochondria to the dynein-dynactin complex in the absence of Actr10. Importantly, Actr10 engineered to lack the dynactin binding domain maintains mitochondrial interaction, hinting at a specific role for Actr10 in mediating dynactin-mitochondria interaction. Finally, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence that Drp1, a Dynamin-related protein previously implicated in microtubule minus end-directed mitochondrial movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smirnova et al., 1998</xref>), partners with Actr10 in mitochondrial retrograde transport. Together our data support a model in which Actr10 functions to scaffold mitochondria to the dynein-dynactin complex for retrograde transport in axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitochondria accumulate in <italic>actr10</italic> mutant axon terminals due to failed retrograde transport</title><p>We used the zebrafish posterior lateral line (pLL) system to identify novel mediators of retrograde cargo transport in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drerup and Nechiporuk, 2013</xref>). pLL axons develop early (axon extension is complete by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf) and synapse formation occurs by 4 dpf), are superficially localized and are largely planar, making them an ideal system for <italic>in vivo</italic> observations and manipulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudière, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Metcalfe, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Metcalfe et al., 1985</xref>).

In association with structural work implicating Actr10 in Arp1 filament capping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>), these data could imply that loss of Actr10 impacts dynactin integrity and, subsequently, all dynein function. However, the aforementioned work could also be interpreted to mean that appropriate dynactin-nuclear membrane interaction requires Actr10 function. Supporting this possibility, Actr10 has been shown to regulate dynactin-membrane association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clark and Rose, 2006</xref>). With this data in mind, we next wanted to determine if loss of Actr10 phenocopied dynein or dynactin loss of function in mature neurons, the cell type that displayed specific defects in mitochondrial retrograde transport in our studies. First, we analyzed the localization of dynein and dynactin in <italic>actr10</italic> mutant axons at 4 dpf. Neither Dynein heavy chain (DHC) nor p150 were significantly mislocalized in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants, though we did observe a trend of increased DHC in <italic>actr10</italic> mutant axon terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–F</xref>). Next, to determine if dynein was able to move in the retrograde direction, we assayed dynein motility by tagging the core motor complex using expression of an mRFP tagged variant of dynein light intermediate chain (<italic>5kbneurod:dync1li1V2-mRFP</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>). Kymograph analysis revealed no change in the parameters of retrograde dynein movement, though we did note a 42% reduction in the distance and a 26% reduction in the velocity of <italic>anterograde</italic> dynein transport. Despite these defects in anterograde dynein transport, there was no change in the proportion of dynein-positive puncta moving in the anterograde or retrograde direction in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants at 4 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–M</xref>). Additionally, we analyzed reversal frequency to determine if there was a defect in persistence of dynein movement in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants but found no difference in the average number of puncta that reversed direction during our imaging sessions (wildtype: 1.62/100 µm*min ±0.37; <italic>actr10</italic> mutants: 1.74/100 µm*min ±0.44; ANOVA; <italic>p</italic>=0.844).

Immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins was not possible due to lack of zebrafish-specific antibodies, so we turned to overexpression of tagged dynein components using zygotic injection of <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized mRNA. First, we confirmed that a GFP tagged version of dynein intermediate chain 2b (i2b), a core dynein protein, could integrate into the motor complex. mRNA encoding i2b-GFP was injected into zygotes and anti-GFP antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate the complex. Extracts were subjected to western blot analysis and probed with anti-DHC antibodies. i2b-GFP can integrate into the core dynein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>). We then used this approach to determine if loss of Actr10 impacts dynein-dynactin interaction. i2b-GFP was expressed in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants and wild-type siblings and larval extracts were subjected to GFP-based immunoprecipitation at 4 dpf.

Together, these experiments confirmed that loss of Actr10 does not impact dynein-dynactin interaction.</p><p>To further explore the effect of loss of Actr10 on retrograde cargo transport, we analyzed the movement of additional dynein cargos in axons. First, we visualized peroxisome transport in lateral line axons (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">6</xref>). Kymograph analysis of peroxisome transport at 4 dpf demonstrated small changes in anterograde transport velocity and distance of retrograde transport bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–G</xref>). A slight, but not significant decrease in the proportion of peroxisomes moving in the retrograde was apparent as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; ANOVA; <italic>p</italic>=0.07). Upon further investigation, we found that previous studies revealed a surprising relationship between mitochondria and peroxisomes, including a large number of shared membrane proteins, such as Drp1 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schrader, 2006</xref>). Our work implicates Drp1 in Actr10-dependent mitochondrial localization (see Figure 12), making the impact of Actr10 loss of function on peroxisome transport complex. Therefore, we analyzed the transport of a third cargo, Lamp1-labeled vesicles, which are composed of late endosomes and lysosomes. Analysis of Lamp1-positive vesicle movement at 4 dpf demonstrated that this cargo is transported normally in <italic>actr10</italic> mutant axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–L</xref>). These live imaging experiments, in conjunction with the immunolabeling of known retrograde cargos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and our TEM studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), argue that loss of Actr10 does not hinder the transport of all dynein-dependent, retrograde cargos in axons.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22234.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Peroxisome and Lamp1 vesicle transport in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants at 4 dpf.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Stills from peroxisome imaging sessions at 4 dpf from <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">6</xref>.

In the absence of this dynactin pointed end protein, mitochondrial retrograde transport frequency is selectively disrupted, leading to accumulation of this organelle in axon terminals. Importantly, the anterograde transport of mitochondria, the localization and transport of other cargos assayed, the localization of dynein-dynactin components as well as dynein retrograde movement are all largely intact in the absence of Actr10, arguing for a role for Actr10 in mitochondrial retrograde transport in axons. Additionally, Actr10 maintains its ability to interact with mitochondria without being incorporated into the dynactin complex, suggesting a specific role for this protein in linking this organelle to the retrograde motor. Finally, we demonstrated that Actr10, perhaps through interaction with Drp1, links mitochondria to the dynactin complex. Our study brings us a step closer to understanding how unidirectional mitochondrial transport is mediated in axons to maintain a functional neural circuit.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Actr10s role in mitochondrial retrograde transport</title><p>We provide multiple pieces of evidence supporting a function for Actr10 in mitochondrial transport. First, mitochondria are the only cargo analyzed whose localization or retrograde transport is significantly perturbed with loss of Actr10. If dynein-mediated cargo movement was generally disrupted, other cargos, including lysosomes and dynein itself, would fail to move in the retrograde direction as well. Second, the axonal phenotype of dynactin and dynein loss-of-function mutants is vastly different from <italic>actr10</italic> mutants: <italic>dync1h1</italic> and <italic>p150a/b</italic> mutants display pLL nerve degeneration at 4 dpf while <italic>actr10</italic> mutants do not. Third, loss of dynactin-dynein interaction in <italic>p150a/b</italic> mutants impedes all mitochondrial transport, a phenotype that is not observed in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants. Fourth, neither the localization of dynein and dynactin nor the retrograde movement of dynein are perturbed with loss of Actr10. Lastly, we identified a domain in Actr10 (△7) that is essential for interaction with the dynactin complex but inconsequential for interaction with mitochondria. This piece of data is critical as it demonstrates that Actr10 can interact with this organelle independently of dynactin, arguing for a direct role for this protein in mitochondria-dynactin interaction. Together, our data argue that Actr10 is necessary for dynactin-dependent, retrograde transport of mitochondria in axons.</p><p>Actr10 could directly link mitochondria to dynactin or potentially facilitate this interaction through other dynactin pointed end proteins, such as p62. p62 is of particular interest in this regard as it is predicted to rely on Actr10 for binding to the dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>). Based on our current data, we cannot rule out a role for this protein in mitochondrial transport. Furthermore, Actr10 interacting proteins, including p62, could have additional impacts on mitochondrial transport parameters, including transport distance. As noted above, <italic>actr10</italic> mutants have slight deficits in the distance moved by mitochondria in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. While we cannot definitively ascertain the underlying mechanism of this disruption, at least three possibilities exist. First, bidirectional transport distance could be affected by the abnormal localization of mitochondria. Mitochondrial localization directly affects local levels of ATP, which in turn could compromise the processive activity of ATP-dependent motors necessary for long distance transport. Another possibility is local deficits in mitochondrial activity: if mitochondrial health is compromised, this could account for the bidirectional transport deficits of mitochondria. Finally, it is possible that Actr10 or its interacting proteins, such as p62, regulate motor engagement. It is largely thought that cargos typically have anterograde and retrograde motors attached simultaneously and direction of transport is attributed to regulation of motor engagement. More frequent oscillations in motor engagement due to loss of Actr10 or Actr10 interactors could account for the shortened distances moved by mitochondria in both directions. At this point, we do not have a full explanation for these transport parameter alterations but they are a topic of continued interest.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Multiple roles for Actr10 in the cell</title><p>Our data does not preclude a function for Actr10 in the retrograde transport of additional cargos in axons or other roles for Actr10, which could vary based on a number of factors including cell type and developmental stage. Of particular interest is a potential role for Actr10 in peroxisome transport through interaction with Drp1. While we did not find a statistically significant difference in the proportion of peroxisomes moving in the retrograde direction, there was a trend towards a decrease in this population. As Drp1 is known to localize to peroxisome membranes as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schrader, 2006</xref>), it will be interesting to further explore the interplay between these proteins and the transport of these highly related organelles. In addition to cargo transport, one predicted function for Actr10, based on structural and biochemical data, is in capping the Arp1 filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>). In support of this role, knockdown of Actr10 using siRNA in Cos7 cells resulted in dissociation of the dynactin complex pointed end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeh et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, studies in the fungi <italic>neurospora</italic> and <italic>aspergillus</italic> demonstrated that loss of Actr10 phenocopies the abnormal nuclear positioning observed with loss of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, zebrafish <italic>actr10</italic> mutants display the small eye phenotype observed in <italic>dync1h1</italic> and <italic>p150a</italic> mutants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Del Bene et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Insinna et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, similar to loss of p150, knockdown of Actr10 resulted in multipolar spindle formation in Cos7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeh et al., 2012</xref>). Together, these data could imply that Actr10 is in fact necessary for all dynein-dynactin activity through stabilizing the Arp1 filament; however, they could also be interpreted to mean that Actr10 is necessary for regulation of Arp1-membrane interaction. Indeed, Actr10 has been shown to regulate Arp1-membrane interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clark and Rose, 2006</xref>) and the zebrafish eye phenotype in the <italic>p150a</italic> mutant is due to a defect in interkinetic nuclear migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Del Bene et al., 2008</xref>). This type of function for Actr10 could also explain the nuclear positioning defect in the <italic>actr10</italic> loss of function studies in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, rather than purely serving a stabilizing role for the dynactin complex, Actr10 may modulate both Arp1 interaction with the nuclear membrane and mitochondria-dynactin binding in axons. How these functions are disparately regulated in different cell types, in different cellular compartments and/or at varying developmental stages is still unclear.</p><p>Given the previous data implicating Actr10 in Arp1 capping and subsequent dynactin stability and dynein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), we were presented with the challenge of confirming that Actr10 has a specific function in mitochondrial retrograde transport and reconciling our work with these previous studies. As outlined above, our evidence for a role for Actr10 in mitochondrial transport specifically includes: (1) <italic>actr10</italic> mutant axons are not phenotypically identical to <italic>dync1h1</italic> or <italic>p150</italic> mutants; (2) mitochondrial retrograde, but not anterograde, transport is disrupted in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants while all mitochondrial movement is inhibited in <italic>p150a/b</italic> mutants; and (3) localization and transport of all other cargos are not disrupted in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants. Together, these results argue that loss of Actr10 does not impact all dynein-dynactin function. In addition, a variant of Actr10 lacking the dynactin binding domain retains its ability to interact with mitochondria, further substantiating a direct role for this protein in mitochondria-dynactin interaction. Together, our data argue that Actr10 participates in mitochondrial attachment to the retrograde motor protein complex in neurons in addition to potentially facilitating Arp1 capping and nuclear positioning in other contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Drp1 and Actr10 function together to regulate mitochondrial retrograde transport</title><p>The interaction between Drp1 and Actr10 in mitochondrial retrograde transport may provide a link between mitochondrial movement and mitochondrial fission. Originally, we investigated the role of Drp1 in retrograde mitochondrial transport as previous studies revealed the unique ability of this GTPase to elicit mitochondrial localization to microtubule minus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smirnova et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">1998</xref>). Upon further investigation, it became apparent that a select number of proteins implicated in mitochondrial fission and fusion, including Drp1, have been shown to be essential for mitochondrial transport. Specifically, the fusion-related protein Mitofusin binds to the Miro-Milton complex and is necessary for mitochondrial movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Misko et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to Miro and Milton, loss of Mitofusin results in decreased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial transport in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Misko et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, the inner mitochondrial membrane protein Opa1, also necessary for mitochondrial fusion, does not participate in transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Misko et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, eliminating mitochondrial fusion itself does not impact mitochondrial movement; rather mitochondrial outer membrane proteins may have dual roles in fusion-fission dynamics and transport.</p><p>Similarly, our work in conjunction with other studies supports the argument that Drp1 participates in both mitochondrial fission and retrograde mitochondrial transport. Drp1 translocates to mitochondria where it can bind to receptors Fis1 and Mff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">LosonLosón et al., 2013</xref>). In its GTP-bound form, it then oligomerizes, forming a constrictable collar necessary for fission during which GTP is exchanged for GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingerman et al., 2005</xref>). We found that a Drp1 variant incapable of binding GTP stimulates mitochondrial accumulation at the nuclear periphery, linking fission with transport. Our genetic interaction data suggest that Actr10 functions with Drp1 in this process, though further experiments are necessary to confirm this. Rather than Actr10 working with Drp1 to regulate mitochondrial localization, it is also possible that loss of Actr10 results a decrease in the motile pool of mitochondria in axons upon which Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> could work. We cannot differentiate between these possibilities at this point. Nevertheless, given the intriguing data generated here, it is tempting to speculate that, upon the GTP-GDP transition, not only do mitochondria undergo fission but Drp1 also recruits the retrograde motor protein complex through interaction with Actr10 to facilitate separation of these daughter mitochondria. The precise nature of Drp1-Actr10 interaction and the role of this interaction in mitochondrial retrograde transport is a subject of current investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The coordinated regulation of mitochondrial transport is necessary for the formation and maintenance of active neural circuits. Our work identifies Actr10 as a crucial protein for mitochondrial interaction with the dynein-dynactin complex, regulating retrograde transport. In addition, we argue that the role of Actr10 is specific and not due to a general loss of dynactin stability or dynein function. The strongest pieces of evidence supporting this assertion are the ability of Actr10 to bind mitochondria in the absence of dynactin and the disparate nature of the <italic>actr10-dync1h1</italic> and <italic>actr10-p150a/b</italic> mutant phenotypes in axons. In addition, we identified Drp1, a GTPase implicated in mitochondrial fission, as an Actr10 interactor with a potential role in mitochondrial retrograde transport. Together with previous studies on mitochondrial motility, a complex picture is emerging in which mitochondrial transport and fission/fusion are dependent on a core group of proteins, with an independent set of proteins regulating mitochondrial docking. In conclusion, further work is crucial to understanding how mitochondrial transport and dynamics are orchestrated in axons, which will ultimately allow us to better understand how this critical organelle is positioned and maintained. As mitochondrial transport and dynamics have been implicated in neurological disorders, a more complete mechanistic understanding of their regulation will provide insight into disease pathology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry and strains</title><p>Adult *AB and WIK strains were maintained at 28.5°C and spawned according to standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Westerfield, 2000</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regulation of mitochondria-dynactin interaction and mitochondrial retrograde transport in axons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tanya Whitfield as Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This interesting study describes a forward screen in zebrafish that identifies a component of the retrograde transport machinery. The authors propose that the Actr10 protein acts as a linker between mitochondria and the dynein/dynactin complex. Specifically, the authors set out to show that in Actr10 mutant zebrafish, retrograde transport of mitochondria, but not other cargo, is specifically compromised. Dynein transport is apparently normal in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants, and mutants in dynein and dynactin components have more severe and widespread phenotypes than <italic>actr10</italic>, supporting the notion that Actr10 functions specifically in transport of mitochondria. The authors suggest that Acrt10 interacts physically with the dynactin complex and brings it to mitochondria. Furthermore, the authors identify a region of the Actr10 protein that is required for physically interacting with the dynactin complex, but not mitochondria. Finally, biochemical and genetic experiments demonstrate that Actr10 interacts with the mitochondrial protein Drp1 and that a putative gain-of-function Drp1 mutant requires Actr10 to increase retrograde transport, supporting the idea that Drp1 recruits Actr10 to mitochondria.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The results showing that the trafficking effects are specific to mitochondria are not completely convincing, and require further experiments and controls. It is not clear that mitochondria accumulate more than other cargoes in axon swellings. The images should be analysed more quantitatively, avoiding potential effects of swelling size by normalising to area/volume. Anterograde and retrograde traffic should be quantified. (After discussion, it was felt that kymograph analysis would be very suitable here; if there were no comparable deficit in retrograde transport of other cargoes, the conclusion about specificity would be supported further. EM analysis might be useful but is not essential.)</p><p>2) Critical controls are absent from several figures. Please see the specific comments from Reviewer 2.</p><p>Please see the individual reviews, which are appended below, for further information.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The conclusion about mitochondrial specificity would be even stronger if the authors analyzed more cargo using kymograph analysis-not just lysosomes and JNK. In a previous paper, the authors looked at a wide variety of cargo (Drerup and Nechiporuk, 2013, PLoS Genetics), so this should be technically feasible.</p><p>In addition to the kymograph analysis, the authors could quantify enrichment in an alternative, less biased way. For example, perhaps they could outline the entire neuromast and determine the average pixel intensity for each marker over the entire structure in <italic>actr10</italic> and wt. Another good way to do it would be to normalize the intensity of each marker by taking a ratio to a volume-filling reporter, such as cytoplasmic GFP. If they are correct, the cyt10 to GFP ratio should be higher in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants relative to wt, but the other markers should be the same in both genotypes.</p><p>One issue that the authors may wish to address a bit more, either through discussion or experiments, is the generalizability of these results. Is mitochondrial transport also affected in other neurons in the Actr10 mutant fish? What is the ultimate consequence of these defects to the neuron? Do they eventually degenerate? What is the ultimate fate of these fish? Is the Actr10 locus associated with any human diseases?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I have raised a few queries into methodological and interpretative issues below. One particular issue is the &quot;mitochondria specific&quot; effect that is not supported by the Lamp1 and pJNK staining. I suggest the authors reconsider this.</p><p>Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. I think it is problematic to say that accumulations don't contain other cargoes. 2I and 2K both show labeling that colocalises with the axonal swelling. Indeed comparing the pJNK and Lamp1 staining in <italic>actr10</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) with the same staining in p150a/b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) seems to show exactly the same effect (although the opposite conclusion is drawn).</p><p>The analysis shown in the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> seems to have selected regions outside of swellings for LAMP and pJNK, but inside a swelling for Mitochondria. Is this a strange choice?</p><p>In my opinion the swelling doesn't just contain mitochondria. This is true for other genetic mutations that give rise to axonal swelling in the literature.</p><p>In relation to the specificity of <italic>actr10</italic> mutation for mitochondria in comparison to pJNK and LAMP it would be necessary to demonstrate that transport of these cargoes is not affected in <italic>actr10</italic> mutant axons. This could be achieved using kymograph analysis.</p><p>EM could also be used to identify the contents of these swellings. Alternatively, the authors should remove the claim that these swellings are purely a consequence of mitochondrial accumulation.</p><p>Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Ideally <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> should show at least one retrograde mitochondrion to allow us to see the rate of retrograde transport. This is potentially important in relation to the point about reversals below.</p><p>Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. To be more certain of the result, the rescue of axonal swelling in a cell specific fashion in neuromasts should be quantified. A single example is given. It would be appropriate to determine the efficiency of rescue in at least 10 neuromasts from 10 embryos.</p><p>Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. This panel shows the swollen axon phenotype, and these swollen axons contain high levels of p150. I would say that this suggests that p150 is mislocalised.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>. Studying the transport parameters and looking at the kymograph suggests that the effect of <italic>actr10</italic> mutation is to increase the number of reversals of direction in puncta undergoing retrograde movement. Looking at retrograde puncta in I and J, they both show pauses, but in I these are brief and only include small reversals in direction. However in J the retrograde puncta seem to frequently reverse direction. To investigate this it would be appropriate to measure the number of reversals per mito/minute for both anterograde and retrograde cargoes. If correct, this observation would suggest that <italic>actr10</italic> is needed for the &quot;tug of war&quot; between kinesin and dynein motors, and loss of <italic>actr10</italic> leads to more kinesin mediated movement of cargoes that would normally be transported by dynein. This is consistent with the idea that the dynactin complex regulates co-ordinated movement of cargoes in vivo (e.g. Gross JCB 2002).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref> and O. Immunoprecipitations using &quot;beads only&quot; i.e. omitting the primary antibody are an essential control. GFP is notoriously &quot;sticky&quot; in these types of experiment.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>. In the co-IP of p150 with exogenous i2b it is critical to include the relevant control. i.e. western blot showing that the p150 signal is only present when i2b is pulled down. (co-IP of uninjected <italic>actr10</italic> extracts performed at the same time as co-IP from i2b injected embryos.) This is in addition to the comment above.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.

It is not clear that mitochondria accumulate more than other cargoes in axon swellings. The images should be analysed more quantitatively, avoiding potential effects of swelling size by normalising to area/volume. Anterograde and retrograde traffic should be quantified. (After discussion, it was felt that kymograph analysis would be very suitable here; if there were no comparable deficit in retrograde transport of other cargoes, the conclusion about specificity would be supported further. EM analysis might be useful but is not essential.)</italic></p><p>To address this issue, we reanalyzed our immunolabeling experiments to control for axonal volume, assayed the transport of additional cargos in axons, and perform TEM analyses of mutant axon terminals. Altogether, these data demonstrated that there is no identifiable change in the amount of other cargos in <italic>actr10</italic> mutant axon terminals.

Major changes in the text of the manuscript are in blue font.</p><p><italic>Please see the individual reviews, which are appended below, for further information.</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>The conclusion about mitochondrial specificity would be even stronger if the authors analyzed more cargo using kymograph analysis-not just lysosomes and JNK. In a previous paper, the authors looked at a wide variety of cargo (Drerup and Nechiporuk, 2013, PLoS Genetics), so this should be technically feasible.</italic></p><p>We performed live imaging experiments to analyze the transport of two additional cargos in response to this review, peroxisomes and late endosomes/lysosomes labeled by Lamp1. JNK transport, as performed in our earlier work, was not feasible at 4 dpf, the time-point at which our other experiments were performed in this paper (our previous JNK analysis was done at 2 dpf). The results of our experiments were very informative. First, we analyzed peroxisome transport. Surprisingly, there were small alterations in the distance of peroxisome retrograde transport and velocity of anterograde peroxisome movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Upon further literature investigation, it became apparent that peroxisomes and mitochondria actually share many similarities, including membrane proteins. One particular membrane localized protein, Drp1, which is shared by these different organelles, is implicated in Actr10-dependent mitochondrial transport in our work. This hints at a possibility of peroxisome transport being dependent on Actr10-Drp1 interaction (noted in the Discussion section), which will be the focus of our future work. Because peroxisome transport experiments were somewhat difficult to interpret, we analyzed the transport of a third cargo, lysosomes/late endosomes. This analysis demonstrated no change in Lamp-1 labeled lysosome/late endosome transport. Together, these experiments determined that, while peroxisome transport showed a trend towards decreases in retrograde transport frequency (p=0.07; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), not all cargo transport relies on this Actr10. These additional experiments are described in subsection “Dynein localization and motility does not rely on Actr10” and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>In addition to the kymograph analysis, the authors could quantify enrichment in an alternative, less biased way. For example, perhaps they could outline the entire neuromast and determine the average pixel intensity for each marker over the entire structure in actr10 and wt. Another good way to do it would be to normalize the intensity of each marker by taking a ratio to a volume-filling reporter, such as cytoplasmic GFP. If they are correct, the cyt10 to GFP ratio should be higher in actr10 mutants relative to wt, but the other markers should be the same in both genotypes.</italic></p><p>We agree this type of analysis is indeed more suitable for signal quantification in axon terminals and thank the reviewer for this suggestion. As suggested by the Reviewer, we used volumetric analyses in Imaris software to determine the mean fluorescent intensity relative to the volume of axon terminals (determined using the cytoplasmic EGFP fill to create a “surface”) for Cytochrome c (mitochondria), Lamp1, and pJNK in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 E-G</xref>. This analysis revealed elevated Cytochrome c levels but no change in pJNK or Lamp1 in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants. In addition, we used the same approach to analyze the amounts of Dynein heavy chain and p150 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 E and F</xref> to demonstrate no change in the localization of these components of the dynein motor complex in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants.</p><p><italic>One issue that the authors may wish to address a bit more, either through discussion or experiments, is the generalizability of these results. Is mitochondrial transport also affected in other neurons in the Actr10 mutant fish? What is the ultimate consequence of these defects to the neuron? Do they eventually degenerate? What is the ultimate fate of these fish? Is the Actr10 locus associated with any human diseases?</italic></p><p>As Reviewer suggested, we elaborated briefly on the general mutant phenotype in the Results section. Specifically, we stated that the mutant is not homozygous viable and both CNS and PNS axons have these large swellings. Due to the limitations of imaging in other types of neurons (those positioned deeper within the embryo) with the current protocols we have in place, we did not visualize mitochondrial transport in other neuronal subtypes at this time. While we do not discuss it in the manuscript, the axons in the <italic>actr10</italic> mutants do not degenerate prior to larval death. In addition, the <italic>actr10</italic> locus is not associated with any disease states save a short report demonstrating transcription of <italic>actr10</italic> is increased in an in vitro model of prion disease (Brown et al., Hum Mol Genet., 2014).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>I have raised a few queries into methodological and interpretative issues below. One particular issue is the &quot;mitochondria specific&quot; effect that is not supported by the Lamp1 and pJNK staining. I suggest the authors reconsider this.</italic></p><p><italic>Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. I think it is problematic to say that accumulations don't contain other cargoes. 2I and 2K both show labeling that colocalises with the axonal swelling. Indeed comparing the pJNK and Lamp1 staining in actr10 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) with the same staining in p150a/b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) seems to show exactly the same effect (although the opposite conclusion is drawn).</italic></p><p><italic>The analysis shown in the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> seems to have selected regions outside of swellings for LAMP and pJNK, but inside a swelling for Mitochondria. Is this a strange choice?</italic></p><p><italic>In my opinion the swelling doesn't just contain mitochondria. This is true for other genetic mutations that give rise to axonal swelling in the literature.</italic></p><p><italic>In relation to the specificity of actr10 mutation for mitochondria in comparison to pJNK and LAMP it would be necessary to demonstrate that transport of these cargoes is not affected in actr10 mutant axons. This could be achieved using kymograph analysis.</italic></p><p><italic>EM could also be used to identify the contents of these swellings. Alternatively, the authors should remove the claim that these swellings are purely a consequence of mitochondrial accumulation.</italic> </p><p>The points raised by this reviewer are critical to clarify and address for the submitted manuscript. Importantly, we do not to claim that mitochondria are the only cargo which is abnormally localized or transported in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants. Based on our analyses, we can only say that the other cargos we analyzed are localized and transported normally and dynein is capable of moving normally in the retrograde direction. In addition, no other cargo appears significantly accumulated in <italic>actr10</italic> mutant axon terminals based on our TEM analyses. However, it is possible that movement of other cargo, not analyzed in our studies, is also interrupted in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants. We would like to clarify that our main motivation for the analysis of other cargos was to show that loss of Actr10 does not impact all dynein-mediated cargo transport. This point is now discussed throughout the manuscript.</p><p>In addition, to more clearly show that at least some non-mitochondrial cargos are localized normally in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants, we reanalyzed the data using volumetric surface analyses in Imaris as described above. This type of analysis of fluorescence intensity within axon terminals defined by the presence of cytoplasmic EGFP (on the same images analyzed previously) demonstrated that Cytochrome c immunofluorescence is significantly increased in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants while Lamp1 and pJNK are not. This is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>We also analyzed the transport of two additional cargos, peroxisomes and lysosomes, using our established protocols. The results are discussed above in regard to Reviewer 1 point 1 and depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>Finally, we collaborated with Amy Herbert and Kelly Monk (now co-authors on the paper) to perform TEM analyses of the PNS axon terminals in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants. These analyses clearly show a preponderance of mitochondria in the axon terminal swellings of lateral line axons. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> of our revised manuscript and discussed in subsection “Mitochondria accumulate in actr10 mutant axon terminals due to failed retrograde transport“. While other cargos may in fact accumulate or move abnormally as well, to date we have no evidence of what that cargo may be. This is now stated in subsection “Actr10s role in mitochondrial retrograde transport“:</p><p>“Our data does not preclude a function for Actr10 in the retrograde transport of as of yet unidentified cargo in axons or other roles for Actr10 in cells, which could vary based on a number of factors including cell type and developmental stage.”.</p><p><italic>Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Ideally <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> should show at least one retrograde mitochondrion to allow us to see the rate of retrograde transport. This is potentially important in relation to the point about reversals below.</italic></p><p>We have used a different kymograph to show mitochondrial transport in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants in what is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>.</p><p><italic>Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. To be more certain of the result, the rescue of axonal swelling in a cell specific fashion in neuromasts should be quantified. A single example is given. It would be appropriate to determine the efficiency of rescue in at least 10 neuromasts from 10 embryos.</italic></p><p>We have now specified the number of axon terminals analyzed in wildtype and mutant animals as well as the number of biological replicates in subsection “Actr10 functions autonomously in neurons to regulate axon morphology and mitochondrial localization “of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. This panel shows the swollen axon phenotype, and these swollen axons contain high levels of p150. I would say that this suggests that p150 is mislocalised.</italic></p><p>We quantified the p150 fluorescence intensity using volumetric analyses in Imaris software. This quantification is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> of the revised manuscript and demonstrates there is no difference in the level of p150 in <italic>actr10</italic> mutant axon terminals relative to controls.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>. Studying the transport parameters and looking at the kymograph suggests that the effect of actr10 mutation is to increase the number of reversals of direction in puncta undergoing retrograde movement. Looking at retrograde puncta in I and J, they both show pauses, but in I these are brief and only include small reversals in direction. However in J the retrograde puncta seem to frequently reverse direction. To investigate this it would be appropriate to measure the number of reversals per mito/minute for both anterograde and retrograde cargoes. If correct, this observation would suggest that actr10 is needed for the &quot;tug of war&quot; between kinesin and dynein motors, and loss of actr10 leads to more kinesin mediated movement of cargoes that would normally be transported by dynein. This is consistent with the idea that the dynactin complex regulates co-ordinated movement of cargoes</italic> in vivo <italic>(e.g. Gross JCB 2002).</italic></p><p>We appreciate the question and think the analysis of reversals adds to the value of the manuscript. To address this issue, we quantified the number of reversals in mitochondrial and dynein movement in the revised manuscript. The results are now reported in the text. We observe no change in reversal frequency of mitochondria or dynein-positive cargos in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants in our imaging experiments. Rather, based on the population analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it appears that mitochondria which fail to attach to the retrograde motor either move in the anterograde direction or become stationary. This could align well with the tug of war model in so much as failure of mitochondria to attach to cytoplasmic dynein leads to a loss of the ability of this motor to participate in the tug of war and increased anterograde mitochondrial transport.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N and O</xref>. Immunoprecipitations using &quot;beads only&quot; i.e. omitting the primary antibody are an essential control. GFP is notoriously &quot;sticky&quot; in these types of experiment.</italic></p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>. In the co-IP of p150 with exogenous i2b it is critical to include the relevant control. i.e. western blot showing that the p150 signal is only present when i2b is pulled down. (co-IP of uninjected actr10 extracts performed at the same time as co-IP from i2b injected embryos.) This is in addition to the comment above.</italic></p><p>The need for bead only controls was duly noted. To address this concern, we repeated the specified immunoprecipitation experiments with no primary (bead only) controls. These experiments confirmed that i2b-GFP can interact with the dynein complex and mRFP-Actr10 but not mRFP-Δ7Actr10 can interact with dynactin. These new Western blots are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. This is an important figure, using biochemistry to address localization of p150 in mutants.</italic></p><p><italic>A&amp;B: I am confused by the fact that the heavy fraction is strongly enriched for mitochondria. This suggests incomplete lysis of embryos. Probably just a technical issue, because 9F does not show the same enrichment?</italic></p><p><italic>The loss of p150 from the mito fraction is striking, but the appearance in the supernatant cannot be correctly interpreted without using non-mitochondrial loading controls. I would suggest probing these blots with the following antibodies to ensure these fractions are &quot;pure&quot;.

(iii) tubulin (DM1A) to confirm supernatant and mito fractions.</italic></p><p><italic>These controls will also confirm equal loading for WT and actr10, particularly important in the case of the light fraction.</italic></p><p>While the Reviewer raised a valid point, we believe that the observed variations in this experiment are due to the less stringent nature of this particular fractionation (compared to other, more precise methods such as sucrose gradient fractionation). This means that the mitochondrial fraction is only highly enriched for mitochondria relative to the other fractions as described by Prudent et al., 2013. The comparison to the mitochondrial loading control is therefore quite important as it shows that, relative to the amount of mitochondrial protein in this fraction specifically, the amount of p150 precipitated is dramatically reduced. To clarify this point, we have quantified the levels of p150 for each fraction relative to the input as well as mitochondrial loading in each fraction. This quantification is now shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11 C and D</xref>. As the reviewer pointed out, mitochondria are also in the heavy fraction but this is likely due to the viscous nature of this fraction and, as the levels of p150 are also equal. In addition, we pointed out that the “light” fraction contains multiple cellular components.</p><p><italic>There appears to be less p150 in actr10 lysate. This in itself might affect transport and needs to be investigated.</italic></p><p>The amount of p150 in the <italic>actr10</italic> mutant fraction relative to wildtype siblings has now been quantified. In addition, the levels were normalized to the mitochondrial control (ATPβ) in the corresponding fractions to correct for any variation in loading. We felt it was important to normalize levels of p150 to mitochondria in each fraction, as the question we were addressing in this experiment was mitochondrial attachment to dynactin in the presence or absence of Actr10. This is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11 C</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, the reviewer noted potential reduction in the p150 level in <italic>actr10</italic> mutants, as detected by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>). As mentioned above, we have not seen any change p150 levels in axon terminals using whole embryo immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, our western blots do show decreases in p150 in the whole embryos extracts relative to wildtype siblings. This is likely due to unequal protein loading: Rather than normalizing to total protein amounts, we chose to use the same number of embryos or larvae for wildtype and <italic>actr10</italic> mutants for each experiment. As the <italic>actr10</italic> mutants are slightly smaller than their wildtype counterparts, this could account for the differences. Our evidence to support this is the consistently lower levels of other proteins (i2b-GFP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>) in <italic>actr10</italic> mutant extracts. This is now noted in the text in subsection “Dynein localization and motility does not rely on Actr10”.</p><p><italic>C-D: control IPs are not presented to show how much p150 is immunoprecipitated using &quot;beads only&quot;. This needs to be shown for each experiment.

Is this specific?</italic></p><p>Bead only (no primary antibody) controls are now shown for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref> for IP of endogenous p150 by Actr10 and the Actr10 deletion construct. In addition, we noted in the revised text the variability of the immunoprecipitations from HEK cell extracts and further clarified the necessity of immunoprecipitating endogenous proteins to confirm the importance of the identified region for interaction with dynactin. This is now described in subsection “<italic>Mitochondria fail to attach to the dynein-dynactin complex in actr10 mutants</italic>“.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>. To interpret the K38A result correctly there needs to be a panel showing WCE for GFP-actr10. Beads only controls (no primary antibody) are also important here.</italic></p><p>Because of time limitations, we were not able to repeat the Actr10-Drp1 coimmunoprecipitation with whole cell extracts probed for GFP; however this immunoprecipitation was replicated &gt;3 times with consistent results. This is now stated in the text in subsection “<italic>Drp1 functions with Actr10 in mitochondrial retrograde transport</italic>“.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10J</xref>. I find interpretation of this difficult. It shows that K38A impairs mito transport in WT cells, but since there are already less mitos in the actr10 axons it is less compelling to say that there is no effect of K38A because of a loss of interaction. i.e. if the effect of mutant actr10 on mitos is independent of the effect of DRP1 won't we still get the same result?</italic></p><p>With regard to Drp1K38A’s impact on mitochondrial localization: we agree with the reviewer that the results of this experiment on their own are not entirely conclusive and should be interpreted with caution. This is now explicitly noted in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript. However, we also argue that there are multiple pieces of evidence to support our argument that Drp1 and Actr10 function together. 1) We show that the K38A mutation in Drp1 strengthens the interaction with Actr10. 2) In addition, work from others (Smirnova et al., 1998; Varadi et al., 2004) demonstrates that expression of Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> relocalizes mitochondria in a microtubule-dependent fashion to microtubule minus ends, implicating the retrograde motor in this process. 3) Our data also shows that loss of Actr10 causes accumulation of mitochondria in axon terminals due to failed transport while Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> causes accumulation of mitochondria in the cell body, likely due to increased retrograde movement. In contrast, if Drp1K38A functioned in a pathway parallel to Actr10, we would predict: 1) a further reduction in mitochondrial number in the axon; 2) a rescue (at least partial) in mitochondrial density in the axon terminals; and 3) mitochondrial accumulation in the cell body of <italic>actr10</italic> mutants, none of which are observed. Together, we use these data to argue that Drp1 in its GDP-bound form, is working with Actr10 to regulate mitochondrial localization in axons. This argument is now better articulated in the Discussion section.</p><p>We also outlined an addition caveat related to this experiment. It is possible that the motile pool of mitochondria (~50% based on our work) is trapped in <italic>actr10</italic> mutant axon terminals, leading to the reduction in number in the axon capable of being transported. Without a motile pool, Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> would not be able to decrease the number of mitochondria in the mutant axons to the same degree as in wildtype axons. This is now pointed out in the revised text. Future experiments using live imaging of mitochondrial transport would likely be able to discern between these possibilities.</p><p>Unfortunately, these types of experiments are not possible without the generation of additional stable transgenic lines which would take approximately 6 months.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below (see comments from Reviewer 2).
