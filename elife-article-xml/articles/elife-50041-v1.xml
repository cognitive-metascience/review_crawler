Dependence receptors are able to induce either survival or cell death in presence or absence of their ligand, respectively. However, their precise mechanism of action and their physiological importance are still elusive for most of them including the MET receptor. We evidence that pro-apoptotic fragment generated by caspase cleavage of MET localizes to the mitochondria-associated membrane region. This fragment triggers a calcium transfer from endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria, which is instrumental for the apoptotic action of the receptor. Knock-in mice bearing a mutation of MET caspase cleavage site highlighted that p40MET production is important for FAS-driven hepatocyte apoptosis, and demonstrate that MET acts as a dependence receptor in vivo. Our data shed light on new signaling mechanisms for dependence receptors’ control of cell survival/death balance, which may offer new clues for the pathophysiology of epithelial structures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>receptor tyrosine kinase</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>hepatocyte</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tulasne</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancéropôle Nord-Ouest</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tulasne</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010095</institution-id><institution>Région Hauts-de-France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CPER Photonics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furlan</surname><given-names>Alessandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tulasne</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SIRIC OncoLille</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tulasne</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MET acts as a dependence receptor in vivo by promoting hepatocyte apoptosis, a response induced by a caspase generated fragment able to favor calcium exchange between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Hepatocyte Growth Factor-Scatter Factor (HGF/SF) receptor MET was discovered three decades ago. Its importance was highlighted during embryogenesis and injury repair, and also in neurodegenerative diseases and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Furlan et al., 2014</xref>). MET activation triggers a wide variety of biological responses such as survival, proliferation, and migration. The HGF/SF-MET pair notably plays a crucial role in the liver, both during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maina et al., 2001</xref>) and, in adults, in tissue homeostasis and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borowiak et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the survival role of ligand-activated MET, the receptor can also promote apoptosis. This has led to classifying it as a dependence receptor. MET cleavage by caspases leads to production of p40MET, an intracellular 40 kDa fragment that can amplify apoptosis, detected in apoptotic primary hepatocytes and mouse livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lefebvre et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Caspase cleavage of MET occurs at the C-terminal DNID<sub>1374</sub> and the juxtamembrane ESVD<sub>1000</sub> sites (mouse sequence). The juxtamembrane site overlaps with the DY<sub>1001</sub>R site containing a phosphorylated tyrosine (ESVD<sub>1000</sub>p-Y<sub>1001</sub>R) responsible for the recruitment of CBL involved in the receptor degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peschard et al., 2004</xref>). Although C-terminal caspase cleavage of MET removes only five amino acids in mice, a p40MET fragment to which these C-terminal amino acids remain attached loses its apoptotic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Foveau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ma et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The p40MET fragment amplifies apoptosis through mitochondrial membrane permeabilization leading to the release of pro-apoptotic factors. Mitochondrial permeabilization is regulated by anti-apoptotic BCL2-family proteins and by pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins such as BAX and BAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wei et al., 2001</xref>). While specific silencing of BAK significantly inhibits the apoptotic capacity of p40MET, no evidence of direct interaction between p40MET and a BH3-only protein has been reported to date nor the mechanism involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lefebvre et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Besides their outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) localization, the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins have also been described at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zong et al., 2003</xref>). In this organelle, they can interact with calcium channels such as inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3R) and thereby cause deregulation of the calcium flux between the ER and the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nutt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scorrano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oakes et al., 2005</xref>). Several studies have shown calcium overload in the mitochondrial matrix to cause membrane permeabilization though mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (mPTP) opening that can trigger mitochondrial swelling and OMM disruption (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brenner and Grimm, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have evidenced p40MET in the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM) region and have characterized p40MET-triggered calcium transfer from the ER to the mitochondria, which is important for its proapoptotic activity. We have also engineered a knock-in mouse model expressing MET mutated at caspase site in order to assess its importance in physiological apoptosis in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>p40MET localizes to the interface between the ER and the mitochondria</title><p>To gain insights into the pro-apoptotic function of MET, we compared p40MET fragment with its non-apoptotic variant p40MET D1374N, mutated at the C-terminal caspase site, both fragments fused to Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In MCF10A epithelial cells, ectopic expression of GFP-p40MET induced cytochrome C release and caspase 3 cleavage as efficiently as the previously published flag-p40MET, in contrast to GFP-p40MET D1374N or GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; and representative pictures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b–c</xref>). Furthermore, in p40MET-transfected cells, treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor increased the proportion of cells displaying cytochrome-C release, a likely consequence of an inhibition of late apoptosis, which would impair apoptotic cell detachment and favor their detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). To assess the proapoptotic property of MET in hepatocytes, similar experiments were performed in immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schippers et al., 1997</xref>). In these cells, apoptosis induced by BH3 mimetic promoted p40MET generation, which was inhibited by pan-caspase inhibitor treatments and by MET silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, ectopic expression of GFP-p40MET in this cell line induced caspase 3 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Locating the p40MET fragment by immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of MET receptor cleavage by caspase during apoptosis, with besides representation of the GFP-p40MET fragment and of the GFP-p40MET D1374N fragment which still possesses the C-terminal tail. (<bold>b, c, d</bold>) MCF10A (<bold>b–c</bold>) or IHH (<bold>d</bold>) cells were transiently transfected with a vector expressing GFP, GFP-p40MET, GFP-p40MET D1374N, or flag-p40MET.

MAMs constitute a subdomain with direct interactions between the ER and mitochondria. They notably play a crucial role in amplifying cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Naon and Scorrano, 2014</xref>). We thus examined whether p40MET might co-localize with Fatty Acid CoA Ligase 4 (FACL4), a protein residing mostly in MAMs, and this proved to be the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). FACL4 was also found to colocalize with the p40MET D1374N fragment, but not with GFP. To confirm this localization via another approach, endogenous p40MET was generated by an apoptotic stress and subcellular fractionation was performed. Mitochondrial fraction was enriched in the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) and an ER fraction in the ER chaperon protein calnexin. The MAM fraction displayed both MCU and calnexin, as expected, and was enriched in FACL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). p40MET was found exclusively in the MAM fraction, in agreement with the immunofluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The p40MET fragment partners with the BH3-only protein BAK</title><p>The subcellular localization of the proapoptotic p40MET fragment prompted us to further investigate functional relationship between p40MET and BCL2 family proteins.

In MCF10A, BAK siRNA abrogated MET fragment induced caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release, BOK silencing partially inhibited them, while BAX silencing had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b–c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>).

These results are consistent with our previous study on the impact of BAK and BAX silencing on the apoptosis of MCF10A cells transfected with p40MET-Flag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lefebvre et al., 2013</xref>) and confirmed the main involvement of BAK in p40MET-induced apoptosis. To elucidate whether p40MET actually interacts with BAK and other BCL2 family members, molecular engineering was carried out to fuse these proteins with mTurquoise2 (mT2) or Super Yellow Fluorescent Protein 2 (SYFP2) in order to perform FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a–b</xref>). Previous experiments had determined that this fluorophore couple was convenient for FRET quantification by fluorescence lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bidaux et al., 2018</xref>). The FRET lifetime analysis is based on the fact that transfer energy between the donor (mT2 here) and its acceptor (SYFP2) accelerates the fluorescent decay of the donor. Although maximum FRET efficiency measured in that way hardly reaches 10%, it is interestingly not dependent on the fluorophore concentration in contrast to the intensity-based method. As a positive control, BAK-mT2 and BCL-XL-SYFP2 co-transfection led to a mean FRET efficiency of 8% (in agreement with what can be obtained for other heteromeric proteins), while it was negligible (&lt;0.1%) with vector encoding freely diffusing SYFP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Co-transfection with the vectors encoding BAK-mT2 and p40MET-SYFP2also gave rise to FRET about 2.5% efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

In contrast, p40MET-mT2 hardly interacted with BCL-XL (1.5% mean FRET efficiency).

We focused on primary cells that are long-lived and do not require animal dissection for each experiment. First results showing D1374N Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) to be more resistant than wild-type to anisomycin treatment evidenced the importance of the caspase cleavage site for optimal apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). MEFs, however, produce relatively low levels of MET receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Foveau et al., 2007</xref>), so we chose to derive more relevant long-lived cells, namely Bipotential Mouse Embryonic Liver (BMEL) cells to analyze MET involvement in the liver survival-apoptosis balance. Several WT and MET D1374N BMEL clones were derived from embryonic livers. We selected two WT clones (A and B) and two D1374N clones (A and B) displaying comparable BMEL marker expression quantified by RT-Q-PCR (<italic>Krt19</italic>, <italic>Hnf4a</italic> as BMEL markers; <italic>Aldob</italic>, <italic>Alb,</italic> as markers of differentiated hepatocytes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We first found WT and D1374N BMEL clones to show comparable doubling times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). In addition, HGF/SF stimulation induced islet scattering with equal efficiency in the WT and D1374N clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). The D1374N MET mutation likewise did not alter either HGF-induced MET phosphorylation or AKT and ERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the other pair of WT and D1374N BMEL clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d–e</xref>). Lastly, massive apoptosis induced by a 7 hr staurosporine treatment led to generation of the p40MET fragment in the WT cells and of a slightly longer p40MET D1374N fragment in the D1374N cells, in agreement with the presence of the C-terminal tail, which was prevented by pan-caspase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). In conclusion, hepatic progenitors from WT and D1374N mice responded similarly to HGF/SF but produced, under apoptotic conditions, either p40MET or the longer p40MET D1374N fragment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Hepatic progenitors depend on p40MET to complete the apoptosis process</title><p>A first hint regarding the relative sensitivities of WT and MET D1374N cells to apoptosis was obtained by removing the collagen coating and comparing the abilities of these cells to adapt to this stress.

Next, a 4 hr treatment with staurosporine, used to induce partial apoptosis, proved suitable for comparing cell death in the two cell lines. While staurosporine treatment induced caspase 3 and PARP cleavages in the WT cells, these cleavages were undetected in the MET D1374N cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

To prevent any survival response induced by ligand-activated MET, mice were treated beforehand with crizotinib, a potent clinically used MET inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). HGF/SF was indeed able to induce a survival response in primary hepatic progenitors and this response was reduced by crizotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a–b</xref>) Therefore, mice received crizotinib orally before administration of FAS agonistic antibody by intraperitoneal injection.

Four hours after FAS injection, the WT mice displayed more caspase 3 activation than D1374N mice, with respectively 62% (8/13) and 27% (2/15) highly positive livers. Conversely, only one WT liver out of 13 (8%) was found negative for caspase 3 activation, as opposed to 47% (7/15) of the D1374N livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3b</xref> for a complete-panel illustration), clearly demonstrating the resistance of MET D1374N mice to apoptosis induction, with respect to WT mice. Overall, 92% (12/13) of the WT mice were positive for cleaved caspase 3 staining, as compared to 53% (8/15) of the MET D1374N mice. Dosage of plasma transaminase activities, ALAT (alanine aminotransferases) and ASAT (aspartate aminotransferases), can also be used to monitor liver injury. In independent experiments, ALAT and ASAT concentrations were therefore measured in plasma from WT and MET D1374N mice before and after FAS-agonist treatment. The resistance of MET D1374N mice to FAS-induced apoptosis was corroborated by these dosages, since WT mice displayed a significantly greater proportion of mice with a plasma level of transaminases at least doubled (&gt;100% increase over the initial level) with respect to MET D1374N mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Four hours after FAS injection, 82% of WT mice (14/17) had doubled their plasma ALAT levels vs only 46% (5/13) of MET D1374N mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Similarly, the plasma ASAT levels had doubled for all WT mice (17/17) vs 70% of MET D1374N (9/13) mice.

The MET D1374N mice thus displayed resistance to FAS-induced apoptosis, which demonstrates the importance of MET C-terminal caspase cleavage for optimal apoptosis in vivo and highlights MET function as a dependence receptor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The function of a protein is largely determined by its location and by its molecular partners. This is well illustrated by the MET dependence receptor. Whereas full-length MET is located at the plasma membrane and allows response to its ligand, MET cleavage by caspases in the absence of its ligand unleashes an intracellular fragment that can amplify apoptosis. The p40MET fragment thus affects the activity of the mitochondria, a central hub in determining the cell life/death balance.</p><p>In this study we demonstrate that p40MET localizes to MAMs, a microdomain where the ER is closely apposed with mitochondria. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that this microdomain is involved in various cellular processes, including intra-organelle Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange. The juxtaposed membranes promote ER-mitochondrion Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer through the IP3R channel at the ER membrane and through the VDAC and MCU channels at the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Massive calcium entry into the mitochondria leads to mPTP opening, enabling the release of mitochondrial components. Interestingly, BCL-2 family proteins are shown to localize to both the ER and the mitochondria and to control calcium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scorrano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oakes et al., 2005</xref>). The anti-apoptotic members Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL can interact with IP3R channels and modulate ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, thus promoting apoptosis resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Conversely, the pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK can induce massive calcium leakage from the ER, followed by mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nutt et al., 2002</xref>) Recent findings demonstrate that BAK facilitates calcium transfer by promoting contacts between mitochondria and the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mebratu et al., 2017</xref>). We have previously reported BAK silencing or Bcl-XL overexpression to reduce p40MET-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lefebvre et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the results of our FRET experiments show that p40MET interacts with BAK but not Bcl-XL.</p><p>Given the observed localization and BAK being a partner of p40MET, we investigated p40MET possible involvement on calcium flux regulation. We show here that inhibiting calcium exchanges prevents p40MET-induced apoptosis, since culturing cells in Ca<sup>2+</sup> depleted medium impairs the pro-apoptotic action of p40MET, as does a treatment with an inhibitor of ER (IP3R) or the silencing of mitochondrial (MCU) calcium channels. Furthermore, using Ca<sup>2+</sup> probes with different specificities, we have shown that in the presence of p40MET, the ER is depleted of Ca<sup>2+</sup> while the mitochondria are overloaded. The MAM location of p40MET is thus in agreement with its action on the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In the light of our various findings, we propose that upon MET cleavage by caspases, p40MET is released into the cytoplasm where it interacts with BAK at MAMs and promotes a Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux from the ER to the mitochondria, causing mitochondrial permeabilization and apoptosis amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the MET pro-survival and pro-apoptotic pathways in the presence of HGF/SF, MET receptor dimerizes and activates pro-survival signaling by activating the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways.</title><p>In the absence of ligand, MET is cleaved by caspase 3 at a juxtamembrane and a C-terminal site to generate the p40MET fragment, which translocates to the MAM microdomain. p40MET may interact with BAK and promote deregulation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux between the ER and the mitochondria, causing mitochondrial permeabilization involved in amplification of apoptosis. This dual role of MET classifies it as a dependence receptor. D1374N MET, mutated at the C-terminal caspase site, generates a slightly longer fragment that can no longer promote apoptosis. Upon stress induction by FAS activation in WT and D1374N mice, D1374N hepatocytes show less apoptosis. This suggests that C-terminal caspase cleavage of MET is important for optimal apoptosis in vivo.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50041-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The MET receptor's ability to induce both survival in the presence of ligand and apoptosis in the absence of ligand enables us to classify it as a dependence receptor. Dependence receptors displayed a great variety of mechanisms to promote apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Negulescu and Mehlen, 2018</xref>). For example, both DCC and UNC5H receptors undergo caspase cleavage and act as caspase activators though death-domain unmasked by the cleavage and carried by the part that remains membrane-anchored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mehlen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Llambi et al., 2001</xref>). The TrkC receptor, on the other hand, releases upon caspase cleavage a pro-apoptotic fragment which shuttles to the mitochondria and promotes BAX activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ichim et al., 2013</xref>). We highlight here another original mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a dependence receptor has been shown to act via regulation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux.</p><p>Knock-out of the <italic>Met</italic> or <italic>Hgf/sf</italic> gene is lethal in utero and leads to a reduced liver size associated with decreased hepatocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schmidt et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Uehara et al., 1995</xref>). Furthermore, altered liver regeneration has been found in MET-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huh et al., 2004</xref>). Here we have engineered a novel knock-in model to investigate the physiological impact of the pro-apoptotic p40MET fragment. We have found that liver and mammary gland organogenesis, both of which depend on MET pro-survival signaling, are not affected by the MET D1374N mutation. These data validate the specificity of our model for studying MET pro-apoptotic activity. Following apoptosis induction with a FAS agonist and pretreatment with MET inhibitor to prevent ligand-dependent survival, we observed more apoptosis in WT than in MET D1374N mouse livers, thus evidencing for the first time that MET acts as a dependence receptor in vivo. It would be interesting now to assess the importance of p40MET pro-apoptotic activity in pathological situations such as hepatic steatosis, in which cells expressing the MET receptor face and try to adapt to stresses.</p><p>Dependence receptors have placed the role of apoptosis in tumorigenesis in an unexpected perspective. Overexpression of the ligand of the Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) dependence receptor inhibits its pro-apoptotic activity and can promote spontaneous adenoma formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mazelin et al., 2004</xref>). Although DCC-deficient mice (like MET D1374N mice, data not shown) do not develop spontaneous tumors, experiments in which they were crossed with mice bearing a cancer-predisposing APC mutation suggest that DCC acts as a conditional tumor suppressor gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castets et al., 2012</xref>). In agreement with this concept, the COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database lists six MET mutations affecting the MET caspase sites in various cancers. Also described are exon 14 splice-site mutations found in 3% of pulmonary tumors and leading to loss of the MET juxtamembrane domain, which contains the caspase site leading to p40MET release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duplaquet et al., 2018</xref>) Altogether, the presence of these multiple MET-caspase-cleavage-abolishing mutations supports the notion that the MET pro-apoptotic function might put a brake on tumorigenesis.</p><p>This study highlights MET as a key regulator of the cell survival-apoptosis balance. In addition to shedding light on pathophysiological mechanisms, this feature of MET may be relevant to their therapeutic targeting. In diseases with exacerbated cell death, such as hepatic steatosis, one might restore the balance by favoring MET pro-survival signaling with ectopic HGF/SF treatment. To favor cancer cell death on the other hand, one might combine MET kinase activity inhibition with agents promoting its pro-apoptotic action. Elucidating the mechanisms of MET pro-survival and pro-death signaling is instrumental to identifying new possible targets and to expanding, potentially, the therapeutic arsenal.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cytokines, drugs, and cell cultures</title><p>HGF/SF was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) Anisomycin from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA), staurosporine from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA) and ABT 737 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

localize to microdomains of contact between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, where it interacts with the pro-apoptotic pore-forming molecule BAK to mediate Fas-induced apoptosis in an in vivo model of fulminant hepatitis. This is a novel function and mechanism for this protein, with relevance to human pathology.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Control of cell death/survival balance by the MET dependence receptor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The current manuscript by Duplaquet et al. builds upon previous work by this same team to investigate the mechanism by which the caspase-cleavage product of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET (p40MET) induces apoptosis.</p><p>New important observations in this manuscript are that p40MET localized to microdomains of contact between the ER and mitochondria (MAMs), that p40MET interacts with the pro-poapoptotic pore-forming molecule BAK, that calcium flux from the ER to the mitochondria is required for p40MET-induced apoptosis, and most interestingly, that p40MET is required for Fas-induced apoptosis in an in vivo model of fulminant hepatitis.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and describes well supported conclusions. The in vivo model is particularly important to demonstrate a physiological role for p40MET in apoptosis.</p><p>However, the manuscript falls short in terms of mechanistic insights and could be significantly enhanced by a deeper understanding of how p40MET contributes to the apoptotic cascade.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the interaction studies in Figure 2, p40MET is shown to interact with BAK, but not with the pro-survival BH3 protein BCL-XL. However, there is no data in the manuscript demonstrating that BAK is required for cytochrome C release, calcium efflux or caspase activation in response to p40MET overexpression. To gain further insight, the authors should test for interaction of p40MET with other pore forming proteins in the FRET assays, such as BAX and BOK. They should then test which if any of these proteins are required for p40MET-induced cytochrome C release and apoptosis.</p><p>2) In their in vivo experiments, they focused on the function of MET in the liver survival‐apoptosis balance, but their in vitro mechanistic experiments employed HEK293 cells (kidney epithelial cell line) and MCF10A (mammary epithelial cell lines). The reviewers request that key mechanistic experiments, such as localization to MAMs, interaction with pore-forming proteins, and apoptotic assays, be repeated in a cell line of hepatic origin.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50041.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the interaction studies in Figure 2, p40MET is shown to interact with BAK, but not with the pro-survival BH3 protein BCL-XL.

BAK siRNA abrogated MET fragment induced caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release, BOK silencing partially inhibited them, while BAX silencing had no effect (novel Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Similar results were obtained in IHH cells regarding p40MET induced caspase 3 activation (novel Figure 2—figure supplement 2). It is worth noticing that cytochrome C release was hardly visible in IHH cells probably due to small volume of the cytoplasm compared to the nucleus Taken together, these results confirmed the main involvement of BAK in p40MET-induced apoptosis.</p><p>To gain further insight, following the reviewers’ advice, we extended our study to interactions with other pore forming proteins including BAX and BOK. For that purpose, we built vectors of expression for fusion proteins with fluorescent proteins to be used in FRET experiments. These experiments revealed an interaction of p40MET with BAX (Figure 2—figure supplement 4A-B). Still, as observed in our previous publication with p40MET-FLAG, BAX silencing did not affect the apoptosis induced by p40MET (novel Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and 2).</p><p>BOK hardly interacted with p40MET as assessed by FRET (novel Figure 2—figure supplement 4A-C) and its silencing interfered to a certain extent with p40MET-triggered apoptosis (novel Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and 2), possibly via indirect interactions with BAK, which we reported in our FRET experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In their in vivo experiments, they focused on the function of MET in the liver survival‐apoptosis balance, but their in vitro mechanistic experiments employed HEK293 cells (kidney epithelial cell line) and MCF10A (mammary epithelial cell lines).

MET siRNA confirmed that the generated 40kDa fragment is indeed produced from MET receptor (novel Figure 1—figure supplement 2C). In addition, transfection of GFP-p40MET in this cell line induced caspase 3 activation, in contrast to the GFP-p40MET D1374N or GFP alone (novel Figure 1D). Treatment with calcium chelator BAPTA-AM abrogated p40MET induced apoptosis in IHH demonstrated that calcium flux regulation is required for MET pro-apoptotic property in cell of hepatic origin (novel Figure 3C).</p><p>As previously mentioned, the importance of BAK in this process in IHH cells was supported by FRET experiments (novel Figure 2—figure supplement 4D-E) and by the great reduction of cleaved caspase 3 immunostaining when BAK was silenced by siRNA (novel Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
