of people annually and can be complicated by hemorrhage and shock or neurological manifestations, respectively. However, a thorough understanding of the host response to these viruses is lacking, partly because conventional approaches ignore heterogeneity in virus abundance across cells. We present viscRNA-Seq (virus-inclusive single cell RNA-Seq), an approach to probe the host transcriptome together with intracellular viral RNA at the single cell level. We applied viscRNA-Seq to monitor dengue and Zika virus infection in cultured cells and discovered extreme heterogeneity in virus abundance. We exploited this variation to identify host factors that show complex dynamics and a high degree of specificity for either virus, including proteins involved in the endoplasmic reticulum translocon, signal peptide processing, and membrane trafficking. We validated the viscRNA-Seq hits and discovered novel proviral and antiviral factors. viscRNA-Seq is a powerful approach to assess the genome-wide virus-host dynamics at single cell level.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell</kwd><kwd>virus</kwd><kwd>host response</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U19 AI10966201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Einav</surname><given-names>Shirit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011098</institution-id><institution>Stanford Bio-X</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Einav</surname><given-names>Shirit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford Institute for Immunity, Transplantation, and Infection</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Einav</surname><given-names>Shirit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 269-2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zanini</surname><given-names>Fabio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Child Health Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pu</surname><given-names>Szu-Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pu</surname><given-names>Szu-Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford Clinical and Translational Science Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1​ ​ TR000093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pu</surname><given-names>Szu-Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32AI007502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bekerman</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel virus-inclusive single cell RNA-Seq approach enables identification of novel pro- and antiviral host factors in human cells in response to dengue and Zika virus infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Flaviviruses</italic>, which include dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, infect several hundred million people annually and are associated with severe morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rasmussen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guzman and Kouri, 2003</xref>). Attempts to develop antiviral drugs that target viral proteins have been hampered in part by the high genetic diversity of flaviviruses. Since viruses usurp the cellular machinery at every stage of their life cycle, a therapeutic strategy is to target host factors essential for viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekerman and Einav, 2015</xref>). To this end it is paramount to understand the interaction dynamics between viruses and the host, to identify pro- and antiviral host factors and to monitor their dynamics in the course of viral infection. The current model of flavivirus infection suggests that the virus enters its target cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, followed by RNA genome uncoating in the early endosomes and trafficking to ER-derived membranes for translation and viral RNA replication. Following assembly, viral particles are thought to bud into the ER lumen and are then released from the cell via the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Screaton et al., 2015</xref>). This pattern notwithstanding, it remains a challenge to determine the entire complement of host genes that interact, either directly or indirectly, with DENV or ZIKV.</p><p>Several high-throughput approaches have been applied to screen all 20,000 human genes for interactions with flaviviruses, including knockdown screens based on RNA interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sessions et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le Sommer et al., 2012</xref>), knockout screens via haploid cell lines or CRISPR libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2017</xref>), and bulk transcriptomics via microarrays or RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sessions et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moreno-Altamirano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fink et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Conceição et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becerra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liew and Chow, 2006</xref>). While these approaches have provided important insights, our understanding of infection-triggered cellular responses is far from complete.</p><p>Knockdown, knockout, and population-level transcriptomics screens are extremely valuable tools but also share some limitations. First, because they are bulk assays, the heterogeneity of virus infection in single cells is obscured in the averaging process; differences in timing of virus entry and cell state across the culture and the fraction of uninfected cells are not accounted for. Second, because each population is a single data point and experiments cannot be repeated more than a handful of times, reproducibility and batch effects represent a challenge. Third, in knockout and knockdown screens the temporal aspect of infection is largely ignored, because successful knockdown can take days and recovery of the culture after infection in knockout screens lasts even longer. Fourth, because both knockdown and knockout can impair cellular viability and cannot probe essential genes, only a subset of genes can be probed by these techniques.</p><p>Here we report the development of viscRNA-Seq, an approach to sequence and quantify the whole transcriptome of single cells together with the viral RNA (vRNA) from the same cell. We applied this platform to DENV and ZIKV infections and investigated virus-host interactions in an unbiased, high-throughput manner, keeping information on cell-to-cell variability (i.e. cell state) and creating statistical power by the large number of single cell replicates while avoiding essential gene restrictions. By correlating gene expression with virus level in the same cell, we identified several cellular functions involved in <italic>flavivirus</italic> replication, including ER translocation, N-linked glycosylation and intracellular membrane trafficking. By comparing transcriptional dynamics in DENV versus ZIKV infected cells, we observed great differences in the specificity of these cellular factors for either virus, with a few genes including ID2 and HSPA5 playing opposite roles in the two infections. Using loss-of-function and gain-of-function screens we identified novel proviral (such as RPL31, TRAM1, and TMED2) and antiviral (ID2, CTNNB1) factors that are involved in mediating DENV infection. In summary, viscRNA-Seq sheds light on the temporal dynamics of virus-host interactions at the single cell level and represents an attractive platform for discovery of novel candidate targets for host-targeted antiviral strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>viscRNA-Seq recovers mRNA and viral RNA from single cells</title><p>viscRNA-Seq is modified from the commonly used Smart-seq2 for single cell RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, single human cells are sorted into 384-well plates pre-filled with lysis buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition to ERCC (External RNA Controls Consortium) spike-in RNAs and the standard poly-T oligonucleotide (oligo-dT) that captures the host mRNA, the lysis buffer contains a DNA oligo that is reverse complementary to the positive-strand viral RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The addition of a virus-specific oligo overcomes limitations of other approaches and enables studying of viruses that are not polyadenylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Russell et al., 2018</xref>). Reverse transcription and template switching is then performed as in Smart-seq2, but with a 5’-blocked template-switching oligonucleotide (TSO) that greatly reduces the formation of artifact products (TSO concatemers). The cDNA is then amplified, quantified, and screened for virus presence via a qPCR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Since many cells are not infected, this enables us to choose wells that contain both low and high vRNA levels and then to sequence their cDNA on an illumina NextSeq at a depth of ∼ 400,000 reads per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This approach provides high coverage of transcriptome and allows high-quality quantitation of gene expression and intracellular virus abundance in a relatively large number of cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32942.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>viscRNA-Seq quantifies gene expression and virus RNA from the same cell.</title><p>.

We infected human hepatoma (Huh7) cells with DENV (serotype 2, strain 16681) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and 10. To assess reproducibility, we performed an independent experiment on DENV infection on a smaller scale (1/5th of the cell numbers) and obtained consistent results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In a separate experiment, Huh7 cells were infected with ZIKV (Puerto Rico strain, PRVABC59) at an MOI of 1. Uninfected cells from the same culture were used as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At four different time points after infection – 4, 12, 24, and 48 hr – cells were harvested, sorted, and processed with viscRNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Recovery of the ERCC spike-ins and number of expressed genes per cell confirmed that the libraries were of high quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels A-B). From each experimental condition, 380 cells were screened for virus and ~100 of those were sequenced. In total ~7500 single cells were screened and ~2100 were sequenced (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Intracellular virus abundance and gene expression are heterogeneous across cells</title><p>First, we focused on infection by DENV. As expected, qPCR showed an increase in the fraction of infected cells with both MOIs over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Whereas most genes were rather homogeneously expressed, both intracellular virus abundance (number of vRNA reads per million transcripts) and expression of a subset of genes varied widely across infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Overall, between zero and a quarter of all reads from each cell (i.e. ~10<sup>5</sup> reads) are vRNA-derived, hence the dynamic range for intracellular virus abundance is extremely wide. On average, intracellular virus amount increased with time and MOI. The distribution of both intracellular virus abundance and gene expression are rather symmetric in logarithmic space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>); as a consequence, mean expression as measured in a bulk assay is higher than the median and over-represents highly infected cells. The high coverage sequencing enables a quantitative measurement of the variation in the expression level of thousands of genes in each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–1B</xref>). As a next step, we aimed at identifying which elements of this variation are induced by the infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Correlation between intracellular virus abundance and gene expression within single cells tracks infection-triggered host response</title><p>In a bulk assay each of the experimental conditions would be an average of all cells, making it difficult to extract clear statistical patterns. Leveraging both single-cell resolution and high throughput, we directly computed Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between each gene expression and intracellular virus abundance across all cells. This metric does not require an explicit noise model for either expression or virus abundance and is therefore insensitive to outlier cells. To assess uncertainties, we performed 100 bootstraps over cells (see Materials and methods). As expected, most genes do not correlate with vRNA level and the distribution of their correlation coefficients decays rapidly away from zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In panels 2B-D examples of strong anticorrelation, strong correlation, and absence of correlation are shown. Both the level of vRNA at which each gene starts to correlate and the slope of the response vary across genes and may reflect different infection stages (see below). Genes with extreme correlation consistently represent specific cellular functions. Most of the top correlated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> right inset) are involved in the ER unfolded protein response (UPR) (see e.g. DDIT3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with ER stress response triggered by flavivirus translation and RNA replication on ER-derived membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Medigeshi et al., 2007</xref>). Numerous strongly anticorrelated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> left inset) are components of actin and microtubules, indicating cytoskeleton breakdown (as an example, see ACTB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Notice that anticorrelated genes appear to react at higher intracellular virus amounts than correlated genes, as exemplified by the higher threshold for ACTB than DDIT3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>, Materials and methods, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>).

This statistical analysis confirmed the qualitative picture emerging from the top correlates. At 4 hr post-infection upregulation of genes involved in translation and suppression of mRNA processing is demonstrated. At 48 hr post-infection there is an upregulation of UPR, protein degradation via ERAD, and ER-to-Golgi anterograde transport via COPII-coated vesicles, and a downregulation of cytoskeleton organization and cell cycle genes related to both G1-S and G2-M phases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>).

To disentangle the effect of time since infection from the vRNA level within each cell, we computed the same correlation coefficient within single time points. We discovered that most correlated genes exhibit either positive or negative correlation, but not both. This behavior is expected for generic stress response genes; the sign of the differential expression is a hardwired component of their physiological function. However, a group of 17 ‘time-switcher’ genes show both an anticorrelation of less than −0.3 and a correlation in excess of +0.3 at different time points post-infection, suggesting a more specific interaction with DENV. Of these, six genes transition from anticorrelation to correlation (e.g. COPE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>), 10 show the opposite trend, and a single gene (PFN1) follows a nonmonotonic pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Since more than two time points were sampled, a consistent increase (or decrease) in correlation likely stems from a biological change rather than a technical noise. Of the six proteins which switch from anticorrelated to correlated, RPN1 and HM13 localize to the ER. RPN1 is a non-catalytic member of the oligosaccharide transfer (OST) complex, which is required for N-linked glycosylation of some ER proteins, whereas HM13 is a protease that cleaves the signal peptide after translocation into the ER. Both of these factors have been shown to be essential for DENV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>). Of the other four proteins that show a similar behavior, SQSTM1 is a scaffold protein involved in selective autophagy of polyubiquitinated substrates and has been shown to have a bimodal behavior in DENV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Metz et al., 2015</xref>), whereas UBC is a major source of ubiquitin. Lastly, GORASP2 and COPE play a role in Golgi assembly and/or membrane trafficking. In particular COPE is a subunit of the coatomer complex (COPI) that mediates both intra-Golgi and Golgi-to-ER retrograde vesicle transport; another subunit of this complex, COPB1, has recently been shown to be essential for DENV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iglesias et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, COPE also appears to be downregulated during early infection in ‘bystander’ cells; i.e. cells that originate from an infected culture but are themselves not infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). No uninfected cells were recovered from infected cultures at late time points.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Host response difference between DENV and ZIKV infections</title><p>Next we sought to address the question of which elements of the host response are common between DENV and ZIKV, and therefore potentially common with other evolutionarily related viruses as well. To do so, we replicated the time course experiment with ZIKV at MOI 0 (control) and 1. Although Huh7 cells were also infected at an MOI of 10, cell death precluded sorting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows the correlations between gene expression (each dot represents a human gene) and vRNA for both experiments and represents the two-dimensional equivalent of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. We discovered that the majority of genes are not correlated with either virus (contour lines indicate density of genes). Nevertheless, a clear pattern with genes along the positive diagonal emerged, such as ATF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and ACTG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), demonstrating a similar behavior upon infection with either virus. A minority of genes are scattered away from the diagonal, indicating discordant behavior between DENV or ZIKV infection. For instance, ID2 expression decreases at high DENV level but increases at high ZIKV RNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), while the opposite trend is observed with the chaperone HSPA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and see below). A number of genes at the outskirts of the correlation plot are labeled and highlighted in red as they exhibit noteworthy expression patterns upon infection: i.e. either an extremely strong correlation with both viruses or a high degree of virus specificity. These outliers include two subunits of the SEC61 complex (B, and G), several subunits of the TRAP complex and the OST, previously shown to be essential for DENV and/or WNV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), and other genes that may be relevant to infection with either virus.</p><p>To understand how these correlated genes shape the heterogeneity of infected cells, we selected all genes with a correlation coefficient above 0.4 or below −0.4 and performed t-SNE dimensionality reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>), coloring each cell by its intracellular virus abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left) or by time post-infection (right). Although uninfected cells form a mixed, heterogeneous cloud, infection pushes cells into more stereotypic states that are distinct for DENV and ZIKV infection (black arrows indicate average positions for cells at increasing intracellular virus abundance). t-SNE visualization represents global trends contributed by many genes; plotting gene expression dynamics on top of these visualizations enables one to connect single genes to these widespread changes defined by virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Remarkably, the temporal behavior of a few genes is inconsistent with the global transcriptomics shifts: for instance the expression of HSPA5 increases until 24 hr after ZIKV infection, but is then sharply decreased at 48 hr post-infection and with higher intracellular virus abundance. To compare the temporal dynamics of gene expression during DENV and ZIKV infection, we identified ‘time switchers’ for Zika infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although the number of genes that show both correlation and anticorrelation is similar between the two viruses, the 11 Zika time switchers exhibit no correlation at 4 hr post-infection, followed by a non-monotonic behavior as time passes. HSPA5 is included in this list, in agreement with its t-SNE visualization; this gene is therefore not only subject to opposite regulation in DENV versus ZIKV infection, but may play different roles at different times during the same infection. Among the other temporally regulated genes in ZIKV infection, is the circadian clock gene PER2 that resembles HSPA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moni and Lio', 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32942.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Temporally complex expression patterns during dengue and Zika infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) t-SNE dimensionality reduction using all genes that correlate with at least one virus (&lt;−0.4 or &gt;0.4).

This approach probes the quantitative gene expression dynamics of virus infections and is therefore complementary to knockout and knockdown genetic screens, which induce a controlled perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sessions et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le Sommer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). However, unlike those loss-of-function assays, viscRNA-Seq is able to fully discern cell-to-cell variation within a single experimental condition, is compatible with time-resolved sampling, and can be used to study essential genes. Our approach can be easily adapted to any RNA virus, whether polyadenylated or not, by swapping a single oligonucleotide. Moreover, since RNA capture is highly efficient compared to droplet-based methods, an accurate quantification of both host gene expression and viral RNA (vRNA) can be obtained with as few as 400,000 sequencing reads per cell. Since full-length transcripts are recovered as in the original Smart-seq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>) and unlike in droplet-based protocols, viscRNA-Seq can be combined with enrichment PCRs before sequencing to focus on specific host or viral factors at a fraction of the sequencing cost.</p><p>We have applied this high-throughput technique to study the temporal infection dynamics of DENV and ZIKV, two major global health threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>). Our first finding is that beyond the expected increase in the number of infected cells in the culture over time, there is a large heterogeneity across cells from the same Petri dish. Since flavivirus replication is not synchronized, such heterogeneity might reflect host-responses at different stages of viral life cycle. The single-cell distributions of both intracellular virus abundance and gene expression indicate that mean values measured via bulk assays tend to over-represent highly infected cells. Moreover, bulk transcriptomics studies cannot account for uninfected cells and are therefore limited to high MOI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sessions et al., 2013</xref>); in contrast, we are able to study both high-MOI and low-MOI cultures equally well and to separate the effect of MOI from the actual infection state of each cell.</p><p>We have leveraged the statistical power of sequencing thousands of cells to correlate intracellular virus abundance with gene expression across the whole human transcriptome. The genes with the strongest positive correlation with both viruses are members of the unfolded protein response (UPR), particularly the PERK branch, including DDIT3, ATF3, and TRIB3. The strongest negative correlates with both viruses are components of the actin and microtubule networks (e.g. ACTB, ACTG1, TUBB1) as well as members of nucleotide biosynthesis, suggesting a disruption of both cytoskeleton and cellular metabolism. The URP response starts abruptly once 1000 virus transcripts are present per million of total transcripts (i.e. when virus RNA comprises only 0.2% of the cellular mRNA); a threshold that is reached in most cells between 24 and 48 hr post-infection. Downregulation of cytoskeleton and metabolism, however, starts only at 20,000 virus transcripts per million of total transcripts; this higher threshold is reached in most cells at 48 hr post-infection. This delayed response may happen either because of direct cytopathic effects or as a consequence of the earlier UPR response, and is confirmed via parametric modelling (see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). Interestingly, a recent transcriptomics study also found ER stress pathways to be differentially regulated during DENV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sessions et al., 2013</xref>). However, because thousands of host genes were classified as differentially expressed in that study, this overlap may be in part coincidental due to the sheer number of reported ‘hits’. Indeed, the quantitative statistics resulting from the large number of single cell replicates was a key factor that enabled us to narrow down the list of potentially relevant genes to a small number that could be subsequently validated.</p><p>It is noteworthy that at an MOI of 10, but not an MOI of 1, each cell is expected to be infected by more than one virus; however, we do not measure qualitative differences between the two MOIs except a faster and more robust increase of intracellular virus amount at the higher MOI. Moreover, although multiple rounds of infections are in theory possible with replication competent viruses, this is expected to happen rarely since viruses from the Flaviviridiae family complete one replication cycle in at least 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ansarah-Sobrinho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2011</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Russell et al., 2008</xref>); hence multiple rounds of infections are unlikely to be a significant factor in our analysis.</p><p>A number of host genes correlate strongly with one virus but correlate less or do not correlate with abundance of the other virus. Examples include subunits of several complexes involved in ER translocation and N-linked glycosylation: SEC61G, a subunit of the translocon; SSR3, a member of the TRAP complex; and OSTC, a subunit of the OST. Components of these three complexes were identified as essential host factors for DENV replication in a recent CRISPR-based knockout screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>). SEC11C, a subunit of the signal peptidase complex (SPCS), also behaves in this way, in agreement with the prior finding that this complex is essential for flavivirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Not all the subunits of these protein complexes correlate with virus abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>): for instance, whereas the catalytic OST subunits STT3A and STT3B show no correlation, other members such as MAGT1 show positive correlation in excess of 0.3, in agreement with recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). Strikingly, we do not observe a dominant enrichment of interferon-related genes among the most strongly upregulated during flavivirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fink et al., 2007</xref>). This result may be caused by virus-induced blocking of the interferon-induced signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muñoz-Jordan et al., 2003</xref>); moreover, Huh7 cells are known to activate the interferon cascade more mildly than other culture systems upon virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The expression of some host genes shows discordant correlation with DENV and ZIKV infection. Among the genes that are overexpressed during DENV infection but underexpressed during ZIKV infection are the molecular chaperone HSPA5 which has been shown to interact directly with the dengue E protein in liver cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jindadamrongwech et al., 2004</xref>), other members of the translocation machinery (SEC61B) or the TRAP complex (SSR1, SSR2), and ATF4, an ER-stress induced gene that interacts with DDIT3 and TRIB3. On the opposite end of the spectrum, genes that are underexpressed during DENV infection and overexpressed during ZIKV infection include the transcriptional regulator ID2. Both ID2 and cyclin D1 (CCND1), which is also strongly anticorrelated with DENV abundance, have been reported to be targets of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rockman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shtutman et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis indicates that at large intracellular virus amounts the ER stress response is activated while cytoskeleton genes are underexpressed for both DENV and ZIKV; such profound expression changes could lead to apoptosis of infected cells. We attempted to incorporate dying cells as much as possible (see Methods). Cells with the largest intracellular DENV abundance show little change in the expression of apoptosis effector genes such as caspases, while their upstream regulators such as DDIT3 and TRIB3 are clearly overexpressed during late infection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), in line with a prior report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peña and Harris, 2011</xref>). ZIKV seems to induce a similar response, with a few exceptions including upregulation of CASP3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). From an evolutionary standpoint, keeping infected cells alive could benefit virus production. Alternatively, this lack of clear proapoptotic gene expression might be due to technical challenges in capturing and sequencing mRNA from dying cells or suggest regulation of ER-stress induced apoptosis at the protein level via posttranslational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation) rather than at the transcript level.</p><p>A few host genes (17 for DENV, 11 for ZIKV) show a complex dependence on time and intracellular virus abundance; at early time points, gene expression correlates positively (or negatively) with virus abundance, but this behavior is reversed at later time points. Among these genes are HM13, COPE, and SQSTM1 for DENV and HSPA5 for ZIKV. We speculate that these genes may play multiple roles during the virus replication cycle, acting as antiviral factors during certain phases of infection (e.g. cell entry) and as proviral during others (e.g. virion release). These genes may also represent virus triggered host-responses that were counteracted by viral proteins. Of these interesting hits, HM13 or signal peptide peptidase is involved in processing of signalling peptides after ER membrane translocation, a pathway that has been reported to be critical for several flaviviruses including dengue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore SQSTM1, which is involved in selective autophagy, has been reported to affect DENV infection in a time-dependent manner, in agreement with our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Metz et al., 2015</xref>), and to interact with the unrelated Chikungunya virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Judith et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While viscRNA-Seq is a powerful tool to discover correlations between intracellular virus amount and gene expression, it does not directly address the underlying causal relations. A positive correlation between expression and virus abundance could represent either a preexisting higher expression level setting permissive conditions for infection or a consequence of the infection itself. Despite this limitation, it is possible to draw conclusion on a gene-by-gene basis: if the expression distribution in heavily infected cells shifts beyond the tails of the expression distribution in uninfected cells, it is likely that the expression change is a consequence of infection. This is exemplified by ACTB and DDIT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>) and the positive correlation at late time points for COPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In other cases, for instance the negative correlation of COPE at early time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), it is also possible that a stochastically lower expression of COPE was the cause and not the consequence of higher infection.</p><p>From the viscRNA-Seq screen we selected 32 candidate genes to determine whether they may play proviral or antiviral roles during DENV infection. The three genes HSPA5, SPCS2, and TMED2 showed clear proviral effects, reducing DENV replication upon knockdown and increasing it when overexpressed. The first two are known essential factors of DENV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jindadamrongwech et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), whereas TMED2, which is involved in coatomer complex (COPI) vesicle-mediated retrograde trafficking and trafficking from the golgi to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fiedler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldberg, 2000</xref>), has not been reported before. The gene ID2, which is an interaction partner of β-catenin, showed a strong antiviral effect, increasing DENV replication when knocked down and reducing it upon overexpression. Further in-depth studies are warranted to elucidate the role of the host factors TMED2 and ID2 in flavivirus infection. The hits SSR3, COPE, and TRAM1 reduced viral replication under both knockdown and ectopic expression, albeit at different degrees depending on the direction of the perturbation. This suggests that DENV might be evolutionarily adapted to wild type expression levels of these genes. Alternatively, the correlations for those genes may be not causative. Furthermore, it is striking that both TMED2 and COPE are involved in COPI-coated vesicle transport but produce opposite outcomes on DENV infection when overexpressed. Taken together with the time-switching correlation of COPE with intracellular DENV abundance, this result suggests a dual role for coatomer-coated vesicles during viral replication.</p><p>Overall, our study highlights the potential of single-cell level, high-throughput analyses to elucidate the interactions of human viruses with host cellular processes. Combining temporal information, cell-to-cell variability, cross-virus comparison and high-quality expression data has allowed us to identify pathways that react similarly to infection by dengue and Zika viruses, such as the unfolded protein response, and others that are more virus-specific. Furthermore, our findings reveal two proteins involved in ER translocation as novel host factors essential for DENV infection. Lastly, these results indicate that coatomer-coated vesicle trafficking shows both complex temporal behavior and includes a novel proviral factor, TMED2.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells</title><p>Human hepatoma (Huh7) cells were obtained from Apath LLC (Brooklyn, NY).

In order to reduce interference between the virus-specific primer and the Template Switching Oligo (TSO) used to extend the RT products, a 5’-blocked biotinylated TSO was used at the standard concentration. A large fraction of TSO concatemers was observed when testing reactions with a standard, non-biotinylated TSO. Reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the cDNA were performed in 1 ul and 2.5 ul, respectively: cells were amplified for 21 cycles. Lambda exonuclease was added to the PCR buffer at a final concentration of 0.0225 U/ul and the RT products were incubated at 37 C for 30 min before melting the RNA-DNA hybrid as it was observed that this reduced the amount of low-molecular weight bands from the PCR products. After PCR, the cDNA was diluted 1 to 7 in Tris buffer for a final volume of 17.5 ul. This dilution was used instead of the DNA purification by magnetic beads. In fact, we have tried to optimize purification by magnetic beads in 384-well plates but discovered that good libraries can be obtained without this step so we dropped it to maximize yield throughout the protocol, which allows fewer PCR cycles.

For Zika, a minor groove binder (MGB) probe was used instead of the LNA probe of the original publication. Notice that for both viruses, conserved regions in the virus genome are selected and degenerate bases are used to ensure that the qPCR assay works independently on the mutations happening in the virus population during the cell culture. In addition to the virus-specific primers-probe, a commercial primer-probe assay for ACTB with a VIC fluorophore is used in the same reactions as an additional checkpoint for bona fide cDNA quality. 250 nl of each cell’s cDNA were pipetted into a 5 ul reaction. The cycling protocol is 45 cycles of 95 C for 5 s followed by 60 C for 30 s. Synthetic single-stranded DNA sequences matching the qPCR primers-probe combinations were used in three concentrations (10 pM, 1 pM, 0.1 pM) and together with an additional blank well to calibrate the quantification (total of 4 wells for standards/blank). Each standard well included 250 nl of virus synthetic ssDNA and 250 nl of ACTB synthetic ssDNA covering the commercial assay, both at the same concentration. Notice that although RT-qPCR can be used directly on cell lysates to obtain an accurate quantification of cellular RNAs, this assay is performed on preamplified cDNA instead, hence it is expected to be at best semi-quantitative. Nonetheless, we found it useful both as an early quality control step during the experiments and as a rough screening criterion to cherry pick cells for sequencing (see below). Because we obtained a great dynamic range of number of virus reads from single cells after sequencing, the qPCR results were not used in the downstream data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cherry picking of cDNA</title><p>Not all 7500 sorted cells were sequenced; rather, to improve coverage at the same cost, around 2000 cells were cherry picked for sequencing. With the results of the cDNA quantification and the virus and ACTB qPCR at hand, cells were selected such that they cover the largest possible set of conditions. For instance, in a plate with infected cells we ensured that both qPCR negative cells (ACTB but no virus), cells with little virus, and cells with a high amount of vRNA were all represented in the sequencing data. The selection was designed in a semi-automatic way via JavaScript and Python scripts and implemented on TTPLabtech Mosquito HTS and X1 HV robotic platforms. At the same time as cherry picking, the cDNA from each cell was also diluted to around 0.4 ng/ul for Tn5 endonuclease library prep. Although this concentration is slightly higher than usual or this type of libraries, the cDNA was not purified so that a certain fraction of the DNA is residual short oligos from previous reactions, which is most likely too short to end up on the sequencer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Library prep and sequencing</title><p>Sequencing libraries were prepared using the illumina Nextera XT kit following manufacturer’s instructions, with the following exceptions: (1) we used a smaller reaction volume (around 1 ul per cell); (2) we chose a slightly higher cDNA concentration (0.4 ng/ul) as input, to compensate for the lack of bead purification upstream; (3) we designed, tested, and used a custom set of Nextera-compatible barcodes to increase plexity to 1536 cells per sequencing run, at an average depth of 250,000 reads per cell. The latter efforts allowed us to sequence each time course on a single illumina NextSeq sequencing run, reducing batch effects related to sequencing quality. We used the commercial 24 i7 barcodes and the 64 new i5 barcode sequences (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). We noticed a low level of cross-talk between these barcodes, indicated by up to five virus reads found in a few uninfected cells. However, considering that a sizeable fraction of cells in the same sequencing run (late infected and high MOI) had tens or even hundreds of thousand of virus reads, the amount of cross-talk between barcodes appears to be of the order of 1 in 10,000 or less. In terms of sequencing lengths, we sequenced eight bases from the standard i7 barcodes, 12 bases from the custom i5 barcodes, and 74 bases from each end of the insert (paired-end sequencing) using an illumina 150 cycles High Output kit for each of the two time courses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Bioinformatics pipeline</title><p>After sequencing was completed, we converted BCL files into gzipped FastQs via illumina’s bcl2fastq.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your manuscript utilizes a novel method of single cell RNAseq (viscRNA-seq) to examine the relationship between the host transcriptome and the genome replication of two flaviviruses, DENV and ZIKV. This method generates individual RNAseq libraries from hundreds of infected cells and allows the relative quantification of both host transcripts and viral genomes within individual cells. You use this method to identify host transcripts that correlate with viral genome abundance at different times post-infection. This study identifies a handful of pro- and anti-viral factors, some of which had not been previously reported, and confirms many of these hits through targeted gene knockdowns and overexpression experiments. A comparison of DENV and ZIKV shows that the two viruses differ significantly in their specific patterns of host factor correlation, an intriguing and unexpected finding given how closely related these viruses are.</p><p>The main strength of this paper is that it details a novel and compelling approach for leveraging single cell RNAseq to dissect viral infection processes and host interactions in higher resolution than what is possible with bulk methods. As you point out, this method can be adapted to examine host factors that correlate with the replication of other virus families with only slight modifications to the method. Another strength is the comparison of DENV and ZIKV to define host factors that are common or unique to the two viruses.</p><p>The primary weakness of the study is that the interpretation of the results does not adequately account for the potential effects of cell death and multi-round replication. As a result, some of the conclusions need to be better tailored to suit the experimental results. Addressing the comments below is likely to ameliorate this weakness.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In interpreting their results, the authors do not appear to have accounted for cell death and secondary spread of the virus at late time points. Failing to synchronize infections and limit them to a single round means that there will be cells at many stages of the replicative cycle at late time points, making comparisons of viral genome content between individual cells difficult. This point is briefly noted in the discussion but warrants more serious consideration. Further, the death of infected cells at late time points may also skew results since only survivors will make it into the analysis.</p><p>2) The causality underlying the correlations is handled a little loosely. Do host transcripts correlate with viral genomes because cells with higher pre-existing expression of those factors are more permissive (and are thus &quot;pro-viral&quot;), or are those genes simply up-regulated in a dose dependent fashion by viral replication? This issue could also factor into the &quot;time-switcher&quot; phenotype.</p><p>3) Was the DENV experiment done more than once? The number of individual cells examined contributes an enormous amount of power within a single experiment, but it is important to define the amount of variation across experiments. Ideally, a correlation plot like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> could be shown for two independent DENV infections to demonstrate that correlations are reproducible for a given virus.</p><p>4) Another major comment that needs to be addressed is the lack of uncertainty estimates. The association between the viral RNA and relative gene expression levels is at the heart of the presented work, and it is not clear as to what fraction of the observed associations and trends can be attributed to chance. This impacts many of the presented results. Most notably:</p><p>a) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Significance levels should be assessed based on the inter-plate variability (simply applying a Spearman rank correlation test will likely overestimate the significance). As significance levels will depend on the number of observations, an alternative representation of the figure may be needed – for instance, using a signed Z score on x axis (adjusted for multiple hypotheses).</p><p>b) Profile graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> need error bars. Some graphs may be too dense to show all the error bars, so the representation may need to be changed.</p><p>c) Relevant portions of the text where the numbers of associated genes are being assessed need to be suitably changed to reflect quantification.</p><p>d) A simpler confidence interval would also be useful for the individual rho estimates (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32942.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In interpreting their results, the authors do not appear to have accounted for cell death and secondary spread of the virus at late time points.

However, there is evidence that viruses from the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, such as DENV and hepatitis C virus take at least 24 hours to complete one replication cycle (Ansarah-Sobrinho et al., 2008; Jones, Patkar, and Kuhn, 2005; Li et al., n.d.; Russell et al., 2008). Three out of four time points in our study are therefore from the first, single replication cycle, whereas the latest time point, at 48 hours post-infection, is a mixture of first and second replication cycles. Prior to initiating the time course experiments, all cells were split at the same time and infected with the viral stock synchronously. We have now discussed this in the revised manuscript, Discussion section.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that cell death impacts population-level statistics of infected cells, because dead cells with no integral membrane sort and yield RNA at low efficiency. This skew is especially detrimental in bulk studies, whereas our single cell approach is less severely affected as long as one samples a (small) population of cells along the apoptotic path. By focusing on relatively early time points (up to 48 hours only), our experiment was designed to minimize death of DENV infected cells. Moreover, we attempted to incorporate dying cells as much as possible via the following experimental design choices: (i) we did not use a stain to distinguish between live and dead cells; (ii) the scattering gates used in the sorter enabled elimination of most debris particles, yet were kept as wide as possible, thereby enabling inclusion of dying cells; (iii) while cherry picking cells for sequencing, we intentionally kept cells with the largest virus/ACTB RNA ratio (as measured via the qPCR assays) to capture cells at late apoptotic stages. Nonetheless, we found little direct evidence of widespread apoptosis during DENV infection, even at MOI 10 and 48 hours post infection. Clear effectors of apoptosis (e.g. caspases) do not show a strong correlation with virus abundance, but DDIT3/CHOP and its downstream targets TRIB3 and PPP1R15A/GADD34, which are usually assumed as mediators of apoptosis, all show distinctive upregulation in cells with large intracellular virus content. DDIT3, TRIB3, and PPP1R15A have been proposed to be both anti- and proapoptotic genes, and their proapoptotic mechanisms of action remain elusive (Sano and Reed, 2013; Szegezdi et al., 2006). Moreover, many of the links in the signalling cascade induced by ER stress leading to apoptosis are regulated post-translationally (e.g. via phosphorylation), hence it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from mRNA abundance beyond the remarkable absence of a consistent population of apoptotic cells in the face of multiple efforts to include it. Zika virus infection seems to induce a similar expression profile in terms of ER stress and apoptosis with the exception of CASP3, which is positively correlated with Zika content; ATF4, which is anticorrelated with Zika content; and EDEM1, which does not correlate with intracellular Zika virus amount. We have now added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and discussed this important point in the revised manuscript, see Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The causality underlying the correlations is handled a little loosely. Do host transcripts correlate with viral genomes because cells with higher pre-existing expression of those factors are more permissive (and are thus &quot;pro-viral&quot;), or are those genes simply up-regulated in a dose dependent fashion by viral replication? This issue could also factor into the &quot;time-switcher&quot; phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that viscRNA-Seq is designed to find correlations rather than direct causality. Nevertheless, we include data that favours more causal explanations for a limited set of genes. Overall, we report two distinct sets of genes in relation to intracellular virus abundance. The first set includes genes that show extreme correlations with dengue or Zika virus abundance and are exemplified by DDIT3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and ACTB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. For each of these genes, expression at high intracellular virus levels extends far beyond the expression distribution in uninfected cells, indicating that these changes are not just due to cells expressing preexisting “permissive” genes (see also the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The second set of genes are the temporal “switchers” for which either of the two scenarios or their combination is possible at different time points. For instance, the anticorrelated expression of COPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) at early time points lies roughly within the distribution of expression for uninfected cells, suggesting that cells may acquire less virus if they pre-express higher levels of COPE. In contrast, the positive correlation of COPE at 48 hours post-infection involves an expression beyond 1,000 per million transcripts, which is never observed in uninfected cells, supporting that this phenotype more likely represents a consequence of infection rather than a pre-existing expression status. Moreover, for a small subset of genes, we performed validation experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to investigate whether a depletion/overexpression of a highly correlated gene caused a change in infection level and found that some but not all correlated genes are causal in this sense. Future efforts to further understand the mechanism of the observed patterns should provide more insight on a gene-by-gene basis. This point is discussed in the revised manuscript, Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Was the DENV experiment done more than once? The number of individual cells examined contributes an enormous amount of power within a single experiment, but it is important to define the amount of variation across experiments. Ideally, a correlation plot like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> could be shown for two independent DENV infections to demonstrate that correlations are reproducible for a given virus.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed an independent, smaller scale (~ 1/5th of the cell numbers) DENV experiment and compared the results with those of the larger scale experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. To address the reviewers’ comments, we have now included these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>. Plotted are Spearman’s correlations between each gene and the number of virus reads for the small scale versus the largescale experiment (each dot is a gene). As indicated in the legend, for all genes that correlate above 0.3 in at least one experiment, the Pearson’s r between replicates is 0.82. Even when counting all expressed genes, a pool that generates a much larger noise level, the Pearson’s r between the independent experiments is above 0.65. The vast majority of the genes are thus behaving consistently in independent experiments. Only a few highly correlated genes fall outside the first and third quadrants: some of those are likely due to skewed sampling of the experimental conditions in the small-scale experiment. While this indicates that there is a small level of false positives – as one would expect – it is important to note that we rigorously validated functional relevance of genes downstream of our viscRNA-Seq method via knockdown and overexpression experiments. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref> and subsection “Incorporation of dying cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another major comment that needs to be addressed is the lack of uncertainty estimates.

Per the reviewers’ request, we now show it as an uncertainty on the last significant digit in panels <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-E</xref>. The standard deviation of the correlation coefficient for the typical gene is around 0.02-0.04, indicating that the top correlated genes (0.6) are 20 standard deviations away from zero, hence highly significant. The housekeeping gene PSMB2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, by comparison, is only around one standard deviation away from zero, so it should be considered uncorrelated (at our level of statistical power).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Profile graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> need error bars. Some graphs may be too dense to show all the error bars, so the representation may need to be changed.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have added error bars to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. They are standard deviations of 100 bootstraps over cells and confirm that the time switching phenomenon is not due to technical noise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Relevant portions of the text where the numbers of associated genes are being assessed need to be suitably changed to reflect quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>The bootstrapping analysis of uncertainty indicates that the error bars on correlation coefficients are mostly about 0.02, indicating that the top correlated (anticorrelated) genes yield robust estimates.
