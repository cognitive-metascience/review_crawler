compartments is regulated by C-type lectin receptors that recognize glycan structures. We show that the modification of Ovalbumin (OVA) with the glycan-structure Lewis<sup>X</sup> (Le<sup>X</sup>) re-directs OVA to the C-type lectin receptor MGL1. Le<sup>X</sup>-modification of OVA favored Th1 skewing of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and enhanced cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. While cross-presentation of native OVA requires high antigen dose and TLR stimuli, Le<sup>X</sup> modification reduces the required amount 100-fold and obviates its dependence on TLR signaling. The OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-induced enhancement of T cell cross-priming is MGL1-dependent as shown by reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cell frequencies in MGL1-deficient mice. Moreover, MGL1-mediated cross-presentation of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> neither required TAP-transporters nor Cathepsin-S and was still observed after prolonged intracellular storage of antigen in Rab11<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartments. We conclude that controlled neo-glycosylation of antigens can crucially influence intracellular routing of antigens, the nature and strength of immune responses and should be considered for optimizing current vaccination strategies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11765.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11765.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11765.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Immune cells called dendritic cells play a crucial role in defending the body against tumor cells and invading viruses. The dendritic cells take up molecules called antigens from these threats and then display them on their surface. This enables the antigens to be identified by other immune cells that are capable of killing the viruses and the tumor cells. The dendritic cells recognize the antigens with the help of receptor proteins called C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). These receptors can bind to sugar molecules that are naturally found on many antigens. For example, a C-type lectin receptor called MGL1 can bind to sugars known as Lewis<sup>X</sup> and Lewis<sup>a</sup> on tumor and virus proteins. However, it is not clear how important these receptors are in triggering immune responses.</p><p>An antigen called Ovalbumin – which is found in chicken egg white – can trigger immune responses in mammals and so researchers often use it to study the immune system. Although this antigen has several sugar molecules attached to it, quite a large amount of Ovalbumin is needed to trigger strong immune responses. Now, Streng-Ouwehand et al. examine whether attaching Lewis<sup>X</sup> to Ovalbumin can results in stronger immune responses in mice.</p><p>The experiments show that injecting mice with Ovalbumin-Lewis<sup>X</sup> triggers a much stronger immune response than normal Ovalbumin does. This enhanced response was not observed in mice that lacked the MGL1 receptor, which suggests that this receptor is involved in detecting Ovalbumin-Lewis<sup>X</sup>. Furthermore, the dendritic cells store the altered Ovalbumin for longer than they store normal Ovalbumin, which gives the cells more time to present the altered Ovalbumin to other immune cells.</p><p>Vaccines and some other therapies help to boost immune responses to viruses and tumors by exposing the body to antigens. However, these therapies often use antigens that don’t have sugar molecules attached to them, or are missing the sugar molecules they would normally have. Streng-Ouwehand et al.’s findings suggest that adding specific sugars to antigens in immune therapies might help to make these therapies more effective.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11765.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11765.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>cross-presentation</kwd><kwd>T cell priming</kwd><kwd>glycosylation</kwd><kwd>MGL1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ZonMw TOP</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91211011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Nataschja I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Senternovem</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SII071030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Litjens</surname><given-names>Manja</given-names></name><name><surname>Unger</surname><given-names>Wendy WJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NWO Mozaik grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>017.001.136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaur Singh</surname><given-names>Satwinder</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000969</institution-id><institution>American Institute for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>07-0163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saeland</surname><given-names>Eirikur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NWO VENI-ALW</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>863.08.020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia-Vallejo</surname><given-names>Juan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Controlled neo-glycosylation of antigens can influence intracellular routing of antigens and the nature and strength of immune response, and should therefore be considered as a major determinant in the design of vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The induction of T cell immunity to viruses or tumors involves the presentation of viral or tumor antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APC) in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Loading of exogenously-derived antigens onto MHC class I molecules, a process known as cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carbone and Bevan, 1990</xref>) is required to activate antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, cognate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help is important for licensing the APC, which is essential for effective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming and induction of long-lasting memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schoenberger et al., 1998</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying cross-presentation have been studied intensively, however, little is still known on the nature of the antigens and stimuli that are required for APC to route exogenous antigens efficiently into the MHC class I presentation pathway.</p><p>Most exogenous antigens that originate from tumor cells or viruses are glycosylated in their native form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apweiler et al., 1999</xref>). The relative composition of the glycosylation machinery, which includes all the necessary glycosylation-related enzymes and co-factors, determines the final configuration of the glycan structures that decorate <italic>N</italic>- or <italic>O</italic>-linked glycosylation sites present in glycoproteins. The glycosylation machinery can be affected by multiple physio-pathological cues, including proliferation, activation, and the transformation status of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohtsubo and Marth, 2006</xref>), and depends on environmental factors. APC, such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages are able to sense glycans exposed on either self- or pathogen-derived antigens via glycan-binding proteins. Amongst these glycan-binding proteins are C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) that recognize defined carbohydrate-structures through their carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Depending on the amino acid sequence, the CRD bears specificity for mannose, fucose, galactose, sialylated-, or sulfated structures. CLRs function both as antigen uptake and/or signaling receptors that modify DC-induced cytokine responses thereby influencing T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van and Rabinovich, 2008</xref>). The specialized internalization motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of CLRs allow the rapid internalization of antigens upon interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engering et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herre et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests that DCs use CLRs to 'sense' the natural glycan composition of tissues and invading pathogens and, in response to this recognition, are able to modulate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The conjugation of antigens to CLRs-specific antibodies, such as DEC205, mannose receptor (MR), Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin (DC-SIGN) or CLEC9A, has proven to be an effective way to direct antigens to DCs, resulting in enhanced antigen uptake and presentation on MHC molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonifaz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hawiger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caminschi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chatterjee et al., 2012</xref>). Also glycans specific for CLRs have shown their targeting specificity and potential to improve antigen uptake and presentation in MHC class I and II molecules when coupled to antigen formulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Singh et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia-Vallejo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Unger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Unger, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarnoudse et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Singh et al., 2011</xref>). To achieve immunity rather than tolerance inclusion of a strong adjuvant is necessary. Little is known on how naturally glycosylated antigens or alterations in the glycosylation of antigens may change and re-direct antigen internalization via CLRs, in addition to subsequent processing and presentation.</p><p>MR was shown to mediate cross-presentation of the model-antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent manner and to recruit TAP-1 to endocytic organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgdorf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgdorf et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, cross-presentation of OVA was only effective using high amounts of antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgdorf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgdorf et al., 2008</xref>). The interaction of OVA with MR, which has specificity for mannose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 1992</xref>), was speculated to be dependent on the presence of mannose glycans on OVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgdorf et al., 2007</xref>). In the current study, we investigated the effect of modifying the glycan composition of OVA on the efficacy of cross-presentation, priming and differentiation of T cells. We hypothesized that modification of the antigen with specific glycans would re-direct antigens to other CLRs resulting in altered intracellular routing and presentation of antigen and Th differentiation. We have chosen to conjugate the carbohydrate structure Lewis<sup>X</sup> (Le<sup>X</sup>) to 2 free cysteine residues within the native OVA glycoprotein. Le<sup>X</sup> is a ligand of the murine C-type lectin macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL)-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singh et al., 2009b</xref>), which is expressed on murine plasmacytoid DC, CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>-</sup> splenic DC, DC in the small intestines, the sub-capsular and intra-follicular sinuses of T cell areas in lymph nodes, and on DC and macrophages in the dermis of skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dupasquier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsuiji et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denda-Nagai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Segura et al., 2010</xref>). Murine MGL1 is one of two homologues (MGL1 and MGL2) of human MGL (huMGL), which has been shown to interact with tumor cells through glycans exposed on MUC1 as well as with various pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Vliet et al., 2008</xref>). However, MGL1 and MGL2 bind different glycan structures: while MGL1 binds Le<sup>X</sup> and Le<sup>a</sup> glycans, MGL2 binds <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and galactose glycan structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singh et al., 2009b</xref>). The YENF motif in the cytoplasmic tail of huMGL is essential for uptake of soluble antigens, which are subsequently presented to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Vliet et al., 2007</xref>). Murine MGL1 contains a similar motif (YENL) in its cytoplasmic tail, which likely plays a similar and important role in antigen uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuita et al., 2005</xref>). Glycan binding to the CLRs DC-SIGN, Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 has been demonstrated to trigger the signaling capacity of these receptors, modulating DC-mediated T helper cell (Th) differentiation and cytokine production by DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009</xref>). This illustrates that glycan epitopes may not only improve antigen presentation, but may also affect Th differentiation and shape specific adaptive immune responses. This is underlined by the observation that DC-SIGN signaling induced upon sensing of specific mannose or fucose structures on pathogens differentially directed Th differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gringhuis et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that conjugation of the Le<sup>X</sup> carbohydrate to the model antigen OVA alters its routing from a MR- and TAP1-dependent cross-presentation pathway into a TAP1- and Cathepsin-S-independent pathway, devoid of any TLR-signaling dependence, which simultaneously enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming and Th1 skewing of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Cross-presentation was associated with prolonged intracellular storage of antigen in Rab11<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> vesicles. Our results illustrate that small changes in the glycosylation profile of protein antigens can have a great impact on antigen routing within DCs, affecting cross-presentation and Th cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of glycans on native and glycan-modified OVA, and the consequences for CLR-specific binding and cross-presentation</title><p>The well-known model antigen OVA carries one <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site at N293 and, although the variety of OVA glycans have been previously described, their relative abundance has never been characterized in detail. We determined the glycan profile of OVA by normal-phase HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with an intercalated fluorescence detector. We found that the majority of glycan species on OVA corresponded to the complex-type (54.9%), while mannose-rich glycans (mainly Man5 and Man6, potential ligands of the MR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor and Drickamer, 1993</xref>)) represented only 23% of all glycoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The remaining glycoforms were of the hybrid (16.2%) and oligomannose (Man3, 3%) type. The presence of mannose rich glycans on OVA correlate with the earlier reports that in particular MR interacted with OVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgdorf et al., 2006</xref>) and mediated the TLR dependent and TAP-1 dependent cross-presentation of OVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgdorf et al., 2008</xref>). We reasoned that the conjugation of additional glycans to OVA would alter its CLR-dependent effects. To do this, we conjugated the tri-saccharide glycan structure Le<sup>X</sup> (Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc) to the free cysteins of OVA using standard thiol-maleimide chemistry via the bifunctional crosslinker MPBH. Le<sup>X</sup> is a well characterized carbohydrate ligand of the C-type lectin MGL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hawiger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singh et al., 2009b</xref>). Using mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF), we confirmed that OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> increases to 1.2 KDa in mass, indicating that at least 40% of the total OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> preparation contained the Le<sup>X</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This increase corresponded to the addition of two Le<sup>X</sup> molecules per OVA molecule.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11765.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of OVA-neo-glycoconjugates with Le<sup>X</sup> that confers binding of OVA to MGL1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A glycan profile of OVA was generated using a multidimensional normal phase nano-HPLC coupled with an electrospray ionization interface mass spectrometer with an intercalated nanofluorescence detector.

Moreover, the addition of Le<sup>X</sup> to OVA did not result in increased binding to the MR binding, indicating that Le<sup>X</sup> selectively binds MGL1. Similar binding with an anti-OVA antibody was determined, which indicates that similar protein concentrations in the preparations of OVA and OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> used in our study are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel). In conclusion, through glycan profiling we identified 23% mannose-rich glycans on native OVA that may facilitate MR binding.

Since DC are crucial for priming of naive T cells, we first established the presence of MGL on both splenic and bone marrow-derived DC (spDCs and BM-DCs) of C57BL/6 mice by staining with the anti-MGL antibody ER-MP23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Since the ER-MP23 antibody does not discriminate between the two murine MGL homologues MGL1 and MGL2, MGL1 expression in wild type (WT) CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs was confirmed using qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Immunization of mice with OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> mixed with agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies resulted in the enhanced priming of OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as revealed from both higher numbers of OVA/H-2K<sup>b</sup> tetramer binding CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and OVA-specific IFN-γ and TNF-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than obtained with native OVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using MGL1KO mice, that lack MGL1 expression on DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we ascertained that MGL1 is the prime lectin involved in boosting the generation of antigen-specific effector T cells as upon immunization of these mice with Le<sup>X</sup>-conjugated OVA no enhanced frequencies of OVA-specific IFN-γ and TNFα-double-producing T cells were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In fact, the OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> immunized MGL1 KO mice displayed comparable numbers of effector T cells as WT mice immunized with native OVA.

Both OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-loaded and native OVA-loaded spDCs induced CD4<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cell proliferation to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), illustrating that the altered antigen uptake mediated by Le<sup>X</sup> did not affect loading on MHC class II molecules. Similar results were obtained using BM-DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Although we did not observe any differential effect of Le<sup>X</sup> on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion, neoglycosylation of antigens could induce signaling via CLRs and herewith potentially influence Th cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gringhuis et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore investigated whether OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> affected the differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Hereto BM-DCs and spDCs of C57BL/6 mice were pulsed with OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> and subsequently co-cultured with naive CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>hi</sup> OT-II cells. Co-cultures containing OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> loaded BM-DCs or spDCs contained significantly more IFN-γ-producing T cells than those containing OVA-loaded DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Neither induction of IL-4- nor IL-17A-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, upper and middle panel and data not shown). In addition, induction of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells was not detected (data not shown). To exclude that the Th1 skewing by OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> loaded DCs was attributed to the more Th1 prone status of C57BL/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gervais et al., 1984</xref>), we also performed the Th-differentiation assay with cells derived from Th2 prone BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsieh et al., 1995</xref>). We observed that naive OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from DO11.10 Tg mice that were stimulated with OVA-loaded BM-DCs differentiated into IL-4 secreting T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lower panels). However, the generation of IL-4-producing T cells was not influenced by loading DCs with OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> as these cultures contained comparable percentages of IL-4-producing DO11.10 T cells. Using these Th2-prone T cells, OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-pulsed DCs still induced considerably more IFN-γ-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than native OVA-pulsed DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lower panel). Since this assay takes three days longer than the antigen-presentation assay, it is possible that the higher frequency of IFN-γ-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is due to increased division of OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. However we found that the amount of proliferation of OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induced by stimulation with OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-loaded DCs after 6 days is similar to that induced by OVA-loaded DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The augmented induction of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells was also observed in vivo as revealed from the higher frequencies of IFN-γ-producing OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleens of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> immunized mice than in mice immunized with native OVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Co-staining with markers for early endosomal (EEA-1), late endosomal/lysosomal (LAMP1) and recycling endosomal (Rab11) compartments illustrated a swift co-localization of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> with EEA1 and Rab11 as shown by high co-localization scores at 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The pH at which MGL1 dissociates from its ligand is indicative of the compartment in which the antigen becomes available for degradation and loading on MHC-molecules. We therefore analyzed MGL1-binding to its ligand Le<sup>X</sup> at different pH that resembled the pH of the intracellular compartments. MGL1 starts dissociating from Le<sup>X</sup> already at pH 6.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This indicates that OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> becomes available for degradation in the early and late endosomal compartments, compartments both associated with cross-presentation.</p><p>The sustained presence of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> in Rab11<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B+C</xref>) prompted us to investigate whether these compartments facilitate prolonged cross-presentation, as shown by van Montfoort <italic>et al</italic>. for OVA-immune complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Montfoort et al., 2009</xref>).

Modification of the model-antigen OVA with Le<sup>X</sup> glycans directs OVA towards MGL1, skewing naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation towards IFNγ-producing Th1 cells. Moreover, targeting OVA to MGL1 through the conjugation of Le<sup>X</sup>, substantially enhanced cross-presentation as revealed by the increased frequency of OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, MGL1-dependent cross-presentation occurred at low antigen dose and independently of TLR-signaling. Moreover, this cross-presentation pathway did not involve TAP-transporters and Cathepsin-S. MGL1 targeting involved antigen routing to a Rab11<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartment in which antigen was present for prolonged periods.</p><p>Previous studies on CLR-mediated antigen uptake and cross-presentation, in particular by the MR, demonstrated a clear requirement for a TLR ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kovacsovics-Bankowski and Rock, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgdorf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sancho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Segura et al., 2009</xref>). A common denominator in some of these studies is that the use of antibody–antigen conjugates could potentially induce a different signal than the natural ligand, due to binding to different part of the receptor or through co-engagement of Fc-receptors. The fact that the addition of Le<sup>X</sup> glycans to OVA obviates the need for TLR signals for the induction of cross-presentation and Th1 priming in vitro, may indicate that MGL1 signaling is involved in these processes. Some CLR, like DC-SIGN, Clec9A and Dectin-1 are known to induce signaling after triggering by their natural ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sancho et al., 2009</xref>). Till now, no signaling pathway has been described for MGL1. Triggering of huMGL resulted in ERK1/2 and NF-κB activation, and results in elevated levels of IL-10 and TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Vliet et al., 2013</xref>). In our studies, the uptake of Le<sup>X</sup>-modified OVA through MGL1 was not associated with any DC maturation or altered cytokine production by DCs. The fact that OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> induced an enhanced frequency of Th1 cells in vitro and of antigen-specific effector T cells in vivo when combined with agonistic anti-CD40 Abs illustrates that a yet to be determined costimulatory signal is essential for the induction of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This powerful function of MGL1 to establish antigen-specific immunity, stands opposite to its recently demonstrated anti-inflammatory function, which include induction of IL-10 production and altered adhesive function by APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westcott et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Various models for cross-presentation of antigens have been contemplated. The 'cytosolic pathway' of cross-presentation allows receptor-mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis and antigen translocation into the cytosol, where they are degraded into antigenic peptides by the proteasome and transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kovacsovics-Bankowski and Rock, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2004</xref>) or ER/phagosomal fusion compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guermonprez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Houde et al., 2003</xref>) by TAP-transporters. A variation to the cytosolic pathway was described in which soluble OVA is taken up via the MR and is supplied to stable early endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgdorf et al., 2007</xref>). In these compartments, the MHC class I machinery as well as TAP-transporters are selectively recruited, facilitating direct loading of antigen-derived peptides onto MHC class I molecules without trafficking to the ER. The 'vacuolar pathway' allows antigens to be degraded into peptides in early endosomal compartments by endosomal proteases like Cathepsin-S, to be loaded on MHC class I molecules in the same compartment, thus is TAP-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2004</xref>). The current described models for cross-presentation depend on peptide-transport by TAP from the cytosol to either ER or ER/phagosomal fusion compartments or on endosomal degradation of antigens via Cathepsin-S (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amigorena and Savina, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgdorf and Kurts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mintern et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adiko et al., 2015</xref>]). Although we observed localization of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> in early endosomes, absence of either TAP molecules or Cathepsin-S did not influence the enhanced cross-presentation of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>. Our data indicate that the MGL1 cross-presentation pathway is different than that of the MR and may occur via antigen storage compartments similar to those described for FcγR-targeted antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Montfoort et al., 2009</xref>). We observed prolonged presence in Rab11<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartments in the absence of a maturation stimulus or apparent DC maturation. It is tempting to speculate that in these compartments cross-presentation of OVA is facilitated by Rab11 as it was recently shown that Rab11 activity mediates delivery of MHC-I molecules to phagosomes used for cross-presentation during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nair-Gupta et al., 2014</xref>). However, recruitment of additional components involved in antigen cross-presentation by the SNARE Sec22b40 complex cannot be excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cebrian et al., 2011</xref>). The prolonged antigen cross-presentation via MGL1 allows sustained cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vivo and thus the efficacy of tumor vaccines that target MGL1 may be higher than of conventional vaccines containing non-targeted antigens.</p><p>In the current study, we show that already at very low concentrations, soluble protein antigens are efficiently cross-presented upon uptake by MGL1. DCs pulsed with a low dose of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> (7.5 μg/ml) induced significant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation, whereas the same concentration of native OVA was hardly cross-presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Others have demonstrated that native OVA can only be cross-presented when a high dose was used (0.5–1.0 mg/ml) and when accompanied with TLR-triggering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgdorf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Segura et al., 2009</xref>). Although the glycan-modification was associated with increased antigen uptake and enhanced cross-presentation, it did not result in enhanced presentation of antigen on MHC-class II indicating that increased uptake of antigen is not per se a requirement to facilitate MHC class I and II presentation. Therefore, it is most likely that the CLR (and thus the glycosylation of the antigen) dictates how efficiently an antigen is cross-presented. Based on our study, MGL1 cross-presents antigen much more efficiently than the MR.</p><p>The activity of the glycosylation machinery is subjected to subtle regulation and depends on the cell-type or activation status of the cell. Upon malignant transformation glycan profiles may change dramatically. Le<sup>X</sup> carbohydrate structures are described to be expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lieberoth et al., 2009</xref>), and can be <italic>de novo</italic> expressed on cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Read et al., 2009</xref>) or pathogens, and the glycosylation pattern of in vivo accumulating antigens, being brain tissue, tumor tissue or pathogen structure, is crucial for directing specific CLR antigen uptake and cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hittelet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohana-Malka et al., 2003</xref>). Although in our studies only two Le<sup>X</sup> glycans were conjugated to each OVA molecule, it cannot be ruled out that multivalent presentation of Le<sup>X</sup>, such as often observed on tumors or pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saeland and van, 2011</xref>), may alter avidity-induced MGL-1 signaling and antigen presentation, and induce an anti-inflammatory immune repertoire. At this stage, we do not know whether high glycan valency further enhances or inhibits the MGL1-mediated (cross-)priming.</p><p>The fact that pulsing of DCs with OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> resulted in improved cross-priming and Th1-skewing indicates that conjugation of these carbohydrates to tumor-antigens could be beneficial for the induction of potent anti-tumor responses. Therefore, the use of glycans for targeting CLR for anti-cancer immunotherapy could have several advantages. First, they mimic natural function of the receptors, inducing ‘natural’ signaling cascades in DCs. Furthermore, they are very small molecules, easy to use and relatively cheap to produce. Importantly, many glycans may be considered self-antigens, in contrast to recombinant antibodies that are often not completely of human origin. These properties make it possible to decorate any antigen of choice with glycans to target specific receptors.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies indicate that the glycan composition of protein antigens is of fundamental importance in dictating the intracellular routing and Th-skewing, and should be considered as a major determinant in the design of therapeutic vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used at 8–12 weeks of age.

After staining, cells were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.02% NaN3 and kept at 4°C until analysis. The cells were acquired on an ImageStream X100 (Amnis) imaging flow cytometer. A minimum of 15,000 cells was acquired per sample at a flow rate ranging between 50 and 100 cells/second at 60x magnification. At least 2000 cells were acquired from single-stained samples to allow for compensation. Analysis was performed using the IDEAS v6.1 software (Amnis). The cells were first gated based on the Gradient RMS (brightfield) feature and then based on area <italic>vs</italic> aspect ratio intensity (both on brightfield). The first gating identified the cells that appeared in focus, while the second excluded doublets and cells other than BM-DCs. 3-colour co-localization was calculated using the bright detail co-localization 3 feature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>pH dependency of MGL1 binding</title><p>The pH dependency of MGL1 binding to Le<sup>X</sup> on antigens was determined by ELISA.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Urszula Krzych as the Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and novel study that identifies a previously unknown pathway of antigen cross-presentation and demonstrates the role of specific glycan structures in targeting an antigen to this novel pathway. The use of the Lewis<sup>x</sup> (Le<sup>x</sup>) modified OVA as an antigen, with the advantage of selective and specific Le<sup>x</sup> addition to two know cysteine residues is a creative and informative approach. Le<sup>x</sup> is a physiologically relevant glycosylation that is often found in infected cells and transformed cells. Specifically, the authors show that dendritic cells express MGL-1, the receptor for Le<sup>x</sup> glycosylated molecules and that promotes an increased Ova-Le<sup>x</sup> uptake and eventual processing that leads to CD8 T cell priming. The authors claim this is due to enhanced presentation of the relevant Kb/SIINFEKL complex following Ova-Le<sup>x</sup> uptake compared to its native ovalbumin counterpart. The authors also claim that Le<sup>x</sup> modification redirects routing of ovalbumin into the endolysosomal compartment where the antigen is available for MHC-I and -II presentation for at least 48h, the consequence of which is OVA-Le<sup>x</sup> induced enhanced Th1 cell differentiation.</p><p>This work is timely and interesting for the immunological community because it extends on the finding that glycan receptor usage is an important parameter governing the extent of cross-presentation and identifies MGL-1 as an important receptor for cross-presentation of Le<sup>x</sup>-modified antigens. The results presented here may have significant impact in future vaccine design and may also provide insight into mechanisms that trigger recognition of self-antigens in autoimmune disease.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This paper addresses an important question and is well written, presented and discussed. The experiments are generally well designed, controlled and conducted.

Co-staining with EEA-1, LAMP-1 and Rab11 revealed that upon internalization, OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> is rapidly shuttled to EEA-1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> compartments from where it moves to LAMP-1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> compartments after 2 hrs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In contrast, OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> does not end up in LAMP-1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> compartments in MGL1 KO BM-DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Importantly, these data confirm our imaging flow cytometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref> in the revised manuscript). While OVA also rapidly routes to EEA-1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> compartments, it does not move to LAMP-1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> at later time points, in contrast to OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This indicates that the modification of OVA with Le<sup>X</sup> that binds MGL1 alters the intra-cellular routing of the antigen.</p><p>The new confocal data obtained on the differential intracellular routing of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> and OVA are added to the manuscript (Results, subsection “Modification of OVA with LeX alters the intracellular routing of OVA” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, panel C. Additionally, a more detailed representation of the confocal analysis we performed is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, we have adapted the title of the manuscript to “Glycan modification of antigen alters its intracellular routing in dendritic cells, promoting priming of T cells.”</p><p><italic>2) As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>, the results neither prove nor suggest whether cross-presentation occurs in EA1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> endosome, the LAMP1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> endolysosomal compartment or both. It would strengthen the manuscript substantially to provide some functional evidence for cross-presentation in these compartments.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, the reviewers are correct that the data as presented as well our new confocal imaging data do not show that OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> is cross-presented within Rab11<sup>+</sup>LAMP-1<sup>+</sup> compartments. We therefore weakened the Discussion as we do not want to claim that cross-presentation is occurring there. To analyze this in depth we would need to generate Rab11-deficient (WT and MGL1 KO) BM-DCs by CRISPR-Cas9 technology as well as further identification of this compartment, which we consider out of the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) It is particularly important that the authors demonstrate by confocal imaging the co-localization of Ovalbumin Le<sup>x</sup> in Rab11<sup>+</sup>Lamp1<sup>+</sup> compartments in WT and MGL-1<sup>-/-</sup> BMDCs, as the resolution of the FACS based immuno-fluorescence analyses is less convincing.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned above, we have performed additional experiments to analyze the intracellular routing of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> at different time points by confocal laser scan microscopy. These new data confirm our imaging flow cytometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>+B of the revised manuscript) as they show that upon internalization, OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> is rapidly shuttled to EEA-1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> compartments from where it moves to LAMP-1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> compartments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref> below). Moreover, neither OVA nor OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> in MGL1 KO BM-DCs does end up in LAMP-1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>+C). Thus, together these data strongly suggest that OVA modified with Le<sup>X</sup>, and internalized via MGL1 is differently routed intra-cellular. These confocal images are added to the manuscript (Results, subsection “Modification of OVA with LeX alters the intracellular routing of OVA” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, panel C. Additionally, a more detailed representation of the confocal analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) It is also critical that the authors compare MGL-1-Fc with a Mannose receptor Fc fusion protein and recognition of Ova.</italic> </p><p>We have performed these additional experiments, and indeed confirm that the MR equally binds to OVA and OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>, while MGL1-Fc specifically binds to OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). These data further strengthen the previous binding of the MR to endogenous glycans on OVA (Burgdorf et al., 2007. Science, 316, 612-616) and show that modification of OVA with Le<sup>X</sup> increases its affinity to bind MGL1, favoring efficient cross-presentation, independent of MyD88 and Cathepsin-S.</p><p>The comparison of MR-Fc with MGL-1-Fc binding to OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> and OVA has been added to the manuscript (Results, subsection “Identification of glycans on native and glycan-modified OVA, and the consequences for CLR-specific binding and cross-presentation” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel B).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11765.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of OVA-neo-glycoconjugates with LeX that confers binding of OVA to MGL1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ELISA showing functional modification of OVA with LeX glycans, resulting in binding of MGL1-Fc.
