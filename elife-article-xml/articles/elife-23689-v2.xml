Cells choose from a variety of available septins to assemble distinct hetero-oligomers, but the underlying mechanism was unknown. Using a new in vivo assay, we find that a stepwise assembly pathway produces the two species of budding yeast septin hetero-octamers: Cdc11/Shs1–Cdc12–Cdc3–Cdc10–Cdc10–Cdc3–Cdc12–Cdc11/Shs1. Rapid GTP hydrolysis by monomeric Cdc10 drives assembly of the core Cdc10 homodimer. The extended Cdc3 N terminus autoinhibits Cdc3 association with Cdc10 homodimers until prior Cdc3–Cdc12 interaction. Slow hydrolysis by monomeric Cdc12 and specific affinity of Cdc11 for transient Cdc12•GTP drive assembly of distinct trimers, Cdc11–Cdc12–Cdc3 or Shs1–Cdc12–Cdc3. Decreasing the cytosolic GTP:GDP ratio increases the incorporation of Shs1 vs Cdc11, which alters the curvature of filamentous septin rings. Our findings explain how GTP hydrolysis controls septin assembly, and uncover mechanisms by which cells construct defined septin complexes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23689.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23689.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>septins</kwd><kwd>assembly</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>GTPase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000957</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer's Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIRGD-12-241119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMurray</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00GM086603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMurray</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In budding yeast cells, slow monomeric septin GTPase activity and the cytosolic GTP:GDP ratio dictate the relative incorporation of alternative subunits during septin hetero-oligomer assembly, which proceeds by discrete, ordered steps dependent on allostery between interaction interfaces.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The septin family of cytoskeletal proteins is highly conserved between humans, yeast, and other non-plant eukaryotes, both in structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oh and Bi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mostowy and Cossart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dolat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fung et al., 2014</xref>).

The diversity of functions correlates with the variety of septin monomers (13 in humans, many of which have multiple distinct splice variants) that create many different oligomer species. The majority of human septins are constitutively expressed across all cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mostowy and Cossart, 2012</xref>).

Consistent with functions in cell division and morphogenesis, the five septin proteins expressed in proliferating yeast cells – Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, Cdc12, and Shs1 – co-localize in filamentous, ring-like structures at the mother-bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oh and Bi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glomb and Gronemeyer, 2016</xref>).

The five yeast septin proteins co-assemble into two different species of linear, palindromic hetero-octamers that act as the basic building blocks of septin filaments (i.e. protofilaments, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oh and Bi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glomb and Gronemeyer, 2016</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In cells engineered to crosslink septin protofilaments via their termini (co-expressing Cdc11-V<sub>C</sub> and Cdc11-V<sub>N</sub>, which should only generate BiFC events once pre-assembled protofilaments encounter each other at the bud neck) the septin patch-to-ring transition is significantly prolonged, whereas in cells in which neighboring subunits are tagged (Cdc12-V<sub>C</sub>, Cdc3-V<sub>N</sub>) no significant delays were observed, suggesting that crosslinking in these cells is rare. Since targeted exocytosis is thought to drive the patch-to-ring transition by delivering septin-free membrane in the center of the septin patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okada et al., 2013</xref>), it may be the case that end-to-end-crosslinked protofilaments formed in Cdc11-V<sub>C</sub>-, Cdc11-V<sub>N</sub>-expressing cells are less easily displaced by exocytic delivery than are ‘free’ protofilaments, slowing clearance from the center of the patch. In summary, for the BiFC strains on which the conclusions of our study are based, the majority of BiFC signals reflect events that occurred during protofilament assembly in the cytosol, rather than inter-protofilament encounters at the membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23689.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23689.005</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23689-fig1-figsupp3-v2"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>The role of GTPase activity in septin oligomer assembly is a long-standing, central question in the field. Generally, septin proteins possess a core GTPase domain flanked by N- and/or C-terminal extensions of various lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The sequences immediately adjacent to the extensions comprise the ‘NC interface’, whereas the other dimerization interface (‘G interface’) encompasses the guanine nucleotide-binding pocket (NBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, although when purified individually most septin subunits tested show some evidence of GTP binding, dimerization across the G interface buries bound nucleotides and precludes nucleotide exchange and access to outside factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, rates of GTP hydrolysis by purified septins vary across a wide range, and many septins appear to lack hydrolytic capacity altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zent and Wittinghofer, 2014</xref>). Thus, cycles of GTP binding, hydrolysis, and exchange are unlikely to control septin profilament assembly.</p><p>Instead, recent studies pointed clearly to nucleotide binding (and, for some septins, hydrolysis) as an early, one-time event that promotes the acquisition of conformations competent for protofilament assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zent and Wittinghofer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagaraj et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirajuddin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weems et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, three lines of evidence support the idea that the identity of the nucleotide bound in the NBP influences the conformation of the NC interface in a way that dictates potential for septin-septin interactions, an example of allostery that we refer to as ‘NC priming’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirajuddin et al. (2009)</xref> first observed that preventing GTP hydrolysis by the human septin SEPT2 prevented formation of well-diffracting crystals, and attributed this effect to mispositioning of the α0 helix, a key component of the NC interface in SEPT2•GDP crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>). If septin G dimerization drives GTP hydrolysis, as with many other G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gasper et al., 2009</xref>), then subsequent ‘priming’ of the NC interface might promote additional assembly steps. Using non-native human septin homodimers formed upon overexpression, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al. (2012)</xref> found that G interface mutations prevent NC interactions, but not vice versa. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagaraj et al. (2008)</xref> found that mutating the G interface of budding yeast Cdc12 perturbed both interactions with the G dimer partner, Cdc11, and the NC dimer partner, Cdc3. However, it remained a mystery why different septin subunits possess distinct N- or C-terminal extensions and display different GTPase behaviors in vitro, and if or how these differences might contribute to the assembly of distinct protofilament species.</p><p>In vivo, septin protofilament assembly is fast: no monomers or assembly intermediates are detectable in wild-type (WT) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Field et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frazier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sellin et al., 2011</xref>). In order to better understand the mechanisms that regulate septin protofilament assembly, we visualized the discrete steps by which individual yeast septins interact during protofilament assembly. We find that distinct domains and GTPase activities confer on the different yeast septin proteins unique properties that direct the incorporation of specific subunits in an orderly, step-wise assembly pathway that can be modulated by the cytosolic GTP:GDP ratio to meet changing cellular demands.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Depletion of guanine nucleotides perturbs both G and NC septin-septin interfaces</title><p>If NC dimerization by yeast septins depends upon GTP hydrolysis, as predicted by the ‘NC priming’ model, then preventing GTP binding should perturb both NC and G dimerization. On the other hand, a reduction only in G dimerization would suggest that NC dimerization is an early, affinity-driven event that occurs independent of nucleotide state. We set out to test this prediction.</p><p>Previous studies of the role of nucleotide in yeast septin assembly mutated residues that are predicted to contact bound nucleotide and examined effects on septin-nucleotide interactions in vitro and septin-septin interactions via affinity co-purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagaraj et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirajuddin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Versele et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Versele and Thorner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farkasovsky et al., 2005</xref>). These methods are limited by the fact that the NBP itself is a major part of the G interface, and so these mutations might directly perturb septin-septin interactions in ways that do not necessarily involve roles for nucleotide state. Additionally, such mutations can promote the acquisition of non-native conformations that drive sequestration by cytosolic chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, affinity purification methods involve cell lysis and washing steps after which residual interactions may not reflect authentic associations made in vivo. Indeed, purified septins are prone to promiscuous, non-native interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Versele et al., 2004</xref>). To mitigate these concerns, we designed an assay that allows us to observe WT septin interactions in vivo.</p><p>We exploited Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kerppola, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu and Kerppola, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hu et al., 2006</xref>]) to assess septin-septin interactions, using C- or N-terminal fragments of the YFP derivative Venus (referred to here as V<sub>C</sub> and V<sub>N</sub>, respectively) fused to septin C termini. Our strains also expressed an untagged copy of each septin, except for Cdc10-V<sub>C</sub>–Cdc10-V<sub>N</sub>, where both alleles were tagged. Viability and colony growth rates were unaffected by the tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), and elongated cells, a sensitive indicator of septin dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McMurray, 2016</xref>), were very rare (≤2%) and similar to what is observed for non-BiFC fluorophore fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finnigan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McMurray, 2016</xref>). We excluded such cells from our analysis. Finally, the BiFC events we analyzed did not perturb the normal dynamics of septin rings during the progression of bud growth and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To test the effects of perturbing nucleotide binding by WT septins, we treated cells with 100 µg/ml mycophenolic acid (MPA), which inhibits inositol monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity, resulting in severe (~10 fold) decreases in cellular GDP and GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saint-Marc et al., 2009</xref>). BiFC signal was measured after 24 hr MPA exposure, or in untreated cells prepared in the same way. At this concentration MPA slows, but does not halt, cell division, and septin ring morphology, the growth of buds, the progression of mitosis, and completion of cytokinesis are all unperturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sagot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escobar-Henriques et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, MPA has negligible effects on the septin-recruiting GTPase Cdc42, which in any case is thought to act on septins only following assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sadian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okada et al., 2013</xref>), and all available evidence suggests that, following translation (the efficiency of which is decreased by MPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escobar-Henriques et al., 2001</xref>)), the only proteins that must bind guanine nucleotides in order to promote septin protofilament assembly are the septins themselves.</p><p>Consistent with a requirement for nucleotide binding for both G and NC interfaces, MPA treatment significantly depleted BiFC signals, both at septin rings and in the cytosol, generated from interactions via either interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for a summary of our methods and violin plots.) The notable exception was BiFC signal from Shs1–Cdc12, a G dimer, which was equivalent in untreated and treated cells. The finding that MPA does not perturb all septin-septin interactions argues against a non-specific effect of reduced translational efficiency, and indicates that Shs1 and Cdc12 may interact in a manner that is less dependent on GTP binding than is the case for the other septins (see below). The formation of functional septin rings despite a reduction in the kinetics/efficiency of protofilament assembly suggests that cells normally produce a surplus of protofilaments and is consistent with our previous mutation-based studies demonstrating that defects in nucleotide binding by septins slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schaefer et al., 2016</xref>) but do not block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weems et al., 2014</xref>) septin oligomerization. Notably, although the isolated C-terminal extensions (CTEs) of Cdc3 and Cdc12 have weak affinity for each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Versele et al., 2004</xref>), the fact that depleting nucleotides reduces Cdc3–Cdc12 BiFC argues that C-terminal BiFC tags must primarily report on authentic NC-interface-mediated interactions that are influenced allosterically by nucleotides in the NBPs. Indeed, the Cdc12 CTE alone cannot incorporate into septin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Versele et al., 2004</xref>). Overall, our findings confirm the importance of guanine nucleotide binding for septin NC dimerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Discrete steps in septin protofilament assembly</title><p>NC priming could explain the nucleotide dependence of septin-septin interactions. If so, G dimerization should precede NC interactions. In previous studies, the order of septin-septin interactions was indirectly inferred from contingency relationships between interactions perturbed by mutations or the absence of individual septin subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagaraj et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Versele et al., 2004</xref>). We sought to determine interaction order more directly, and in vivo, using WT interfaces. Toward this end, we developed a novel assay based on multicolor BiFC (mBiFC), which involves co-expression of V<sub>C</sub> and V<sub>N</sub> with C<sub>N</sub>, the N-terminal fragment of mCerulean. V<sub>C</sub> has equivalent affinity for both V<sub>N</sub> and C<sub>N</sub>, which differ by only seven residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu and Kerppola, 2003</xref>). Our new technique, Chronological Substrate Depletion BiFC (CSD-BiFC), exploits the effective irreversibility of the BiFC event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kerppola, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu and Kerppola, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hu et al., 2006</xref>) to determine the chronological order of protein interactions in a living cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Upon co-expression of a V<sub>C</sub>-tagged septin with V<sub>N</sub>- and C<sub>N</sub>-tagged partner septins, if one oligomerization event consistently occurs first, it precludes the V<sub>C</sub>-tagged septin from engaging in subsequent BiFC events, thus dictating the intensity of the resulting fluorescent signals. If the V<sub>C</sub>- and V<sub>N</sub>-tagged septins interact first, then the yellow fluorescent signal will remain unchanged relative to a V<sub>C</sub>/V<sub>N</sub>-only control, while the blue signal is depleted relative to its control; if the V<sub>C</sub> and C<sub>N</sub>-tagged septins interact first then the opposite trend will occur. (We confirmed experimentally that the C-terminal BiFC fusions generated equivalent signals for G and NC interfaces, and thus do not themselves bias towards a specific order [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>]). On the other hand, mutual depletion of both signals upon co-expression of all three fusions indicates no preference in interaction order.</p><p>By interrogating each septin in the protofilament against its neighboring subunits, we determined the complete order of septin protofilament assembly, using signals at bud necks (unsurprisingly, given that signal depletion is key to this assay, cytosolic signals were too weak to quantify). NC priming predicts that G dimerization occurs first, driving GTP hydrolysis and triggering movement of the α0 helix. Interrogation of Cdc12–Cdc11 (G interface) and Cdc12–Cdc3 (NC interface) revealed that Cdc12-V<sub>C</sub> first dimerized with Cdc11-C<sub>N</sub> at the G interface before subsequent NC interaction with Cdc3-V<sub>N</sub>, as evidenced by depletion of the yellow signal and maintenance of the blue signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

A strain carrying only B-V<sub>C</sub> and A-C<sub>N</sub> alleles (as in the upper-left box) will generate a blue BiFC signal once B and A interact. Similarly, a strain carrying only B-V<sub>C</sub> and C-V<sub>N</sub> will generate a yellow signal. However, in a strain where all three alleles are present (as in the lower box), the interaction that occurs first will generate its corresponding signal (in this case the blue signal from the A-B interaction) while the second interaction (the yellow signal from BC) will be unable to generate signal due to the unavailability of B’s V<sub>C</sub> tag, which irreversibly folded with A’s C<sub>N</sub> tag. The order of interaction is elucidated by comparing the blue and yellow signals of the two-allele control groups (upper boxes) with the blue and yellow signals of the three-allele experimental group (lower box). The color that maintained signal strength between control and experimental strains occurs first, while the signal that shows significant depletion occurs second. If both signals were depleted, then either interaction could occur first, and there was no preferred order of interaction between B, A, and C. All fluorescence data are gathered in diploid cells carrying one tagged and one un-tagged allele to mitigate any negative effects produced by the fusions. Because of this, depleted signals will never be fully depleted, as first binding to an untagged partner will allow later signal generation regardless of interaction order. Importantly, all data consistently presented as singly or mutually depleted, allowing reliable interpretation of results.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23689.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23689.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23689-fig2-figsupp1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig2s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23689.008</object-id><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>The complete pathway of budding yeast septin protofilament assembly, according to CSD-BiFC.</title><p>Results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were compiled and illustrated in cartoon form.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23689.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23689.008</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23689-fig2-figsupp2-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig2s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23689.009</object-id><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>C-terminal septin-BiFC fusions do not bias toward NC interactions.</title><p>As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, with cells of the indicated genotypes. BiFC signal strengths were similar regardless of whether the interaction reflected a G or NC interface. Cdc10–Cdc10 BiFC signals were strongest because no untagged Cdc10 was present in these cells, thus more protofilaments were fluorescent. Note that septin C-terminal extensions (CTEs) are long and flexible: GFP fused to the C terminus of the nematode septin UNC-61 rotates ~180˚ at a radius of ~10 nm from the ~4 nm-wide globular UNC-61 GTPase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">John et al., 2007</xref>). Yeast septin CTEs, measured from the end of the α6 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>), are similarly long: that of UNC-61 is 100 residues, and those of Cdc3, Cdc11, Cdc12, and Shs1 are 110, 118, 94, and 233 residues, respectively. Thus, although the NC interface involves α6 residues, for the CTE-containing septins Cdc3, Cdc11, Cdc12, and Shs1, the Venus fragments will be located far from both the NC and G interfaces, and interactions across either interface should generate BiFC signals of similar strengths, as experimentally demonstrated here.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23689.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23689.009</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23689-fig2-figsupp3-v2"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>By contrast, our CSD-BiFC data suggest that Cdc3-V<sub>C</sub> first interacts with Cdc12-V<sub>N</sub> (NC interface) before interacting with Cdc10-C<sub>N</sub> (G interface) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This departure from NC priming was not unexpected, as Cdc3 oligomerizes robustly with Cdc12 both in yeast cells carrying Cdc10 mutations inhibiting G dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagaraj et al., 2008</xref>) and during heterologous co-expression without Cdc10 in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Versele et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farkasovsky et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, Cdc3 lacks the highly conserved Thr residue important for GTP hydrolysis in human septins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirajuddin et al., 2009</xref>) and purified Cdc3 does not hydrolyze GTP in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Versele and Thorner, 2004</xref>). Thus, for Cdc3 NC priming is not an option, and the Cdc3 NC interface must be constitutively ‘active’, independent of the state of the bound nucleotide.</p><p>To our surprise, no other septin-septin interaction conformed to the NC priming model. Our data suggested that Cdc10-V<sub>C</sub> interacts first with Cdc10-C<sub>N</sub> (NC interface) before interacting with Cdc3-V<sub>N</sub> (G interface), and that Cdc12-V<sub>C</sub> interacts first with Cdc3-V<sub>N</sub> (NC interface) before interacting with Shs1-C<sub>N</sub> (G interface) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). These results indicate that Cdc10 NC homodimerization does not require prior G oligomerization with Cdc3 and, intriguingly, that Cdc12 NC oligomerization with Cdc3 requires G interaction when the G partner is Cdc11, but not when the G partner is Shs1. (Notably, the difference in Cdc3–Cdc12 interaction order relative to Cdc12–Cdc11/Shs1 demonstrates that, despite the expected proximity of the C-terminal BiFC tags on Cdc3 and Cdc12 within a protofilament, Cdc3–Cdc12 NC association must precede stable interactions between the CTEs.) We conclude that mechanisms other than NC priming drive the majority of septin-septin interactions. We note that, given the slow maturation of the reconstituted fluorophore following a BiFC event (~50 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kerppola, 2008</xref>]), compounded with long septin half-lives and septin ‘recycling’ through cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McMurray and Thorner, 2008</xref>), the BiFC signals we measured reported primarily on interactions that occurred during previous cell cycles. However, if even a significant fraction of septin-septin CSD-BiFC signals reflected associations between pre-formed protofilaments that occurred during polymerization at the plasma membrane, then we would expect mutual depletion in every case (i.e. apparently random order), at least according to available data for how protofilaments encounter one another during polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bridges et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, while these results deviate from a ‘G-Dimerization First’ model, our CSD-mBiFC results clearly indicate an in vivo protofilament assembly pathway that progresses not through random protein-protein interactions, but rather through specific, discrete steps. Crucially, our findings also reveal a key difference between incorporation of Shs1 vs Cdc11 during protofilament assembly, suggesting a new mechanism to generate subunit diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>When Cdc10 cannot bind nucleotide, Cdc10 homodimerization no longer precedes hetero-dimerization with Cdc3</title><p>To explain our observations that NC-dimerization preceded G oligomerization for Cdc10–Cdc10–Cdc3 and Cdc3–Cdc12–Shs1, we considered an alternative possible relationship between GTP hydrolysis and the conformation of the NC interface. If Cdc12 and Cdc10 hydrolyze GTP as monomers, prior to interaction with any other septin, these proteins could effectively ‘auto-prime’ their NC interfaces, allowing NC dimerization to precede G dimerization. In support of this idea, monomeric Cdc10 and Cdc12 (but not Cdc11 or Cdc3) are capable of GTP hydrolysis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Versele and Thorner, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The NC autopriming model predicts that the ability of Cdc10 to efficiently NC homodimerize prior to G interaction with Cdc3 requires GTP binding and hydrolysis by Cdc10, and that disrupting nucleotide binding should disrupt this order of interaction. To this end, we used a substitution in the Cdc10 NBP, D182N, that prevents binding of guanine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weems et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>), and queried the order of Cdc10(D182N)-V<sub>C</sub> interaction with Cdc3-V<sub>N</sub> and/or Cdc10-C<sub>N</sub>. As predicted, yellow fluorescence due to Cdc10(D182N)-V<sub>C</sub>–Cdc3-V<sub>N</sub> interaction was depleted by co-expression of Cdc10-C<sub>N</sub>, and blue fluorescence from Cdc10-C<sub>N</sub>–Cdc10-V<sub>C</sub> interaction was depleted by co-expression of Cdc3-V<sub>N</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, neither septin-septin interaction consistently precedes the other, arguing that without NC-priming ability, Cdc10(D182N) is equally likely to interact first with either Cdc3 (G interface) or WT Cdc10 (NC interface). Notably, disruption of interaction order by a substitution in the Cdc10 NBP demonstrates that any added NC interface affinity due to the proximity of C-terminal BiFC tags does not introduce a bias in interaction order.

Thus, when unable to rely on GTPase activity to control via NC autopriming the conformation of the NC interface, at permissive temperatures Cdc10(D182N) presumably achieves an ‘active’ NC conformation in a manner that is spontaneous and haphazard with regard to when Cdc10 interacts with Cdc3, reflecting a breakdown of allosteric control.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23689.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Perturbing GTP binding by Cdc10 disrupts the order of interactions with Cdc3.</title><p>Left, ribbon diagram of Sept2-GppNHp (PDB 3FTQ) models the location of the mutated Asp residue (red spheres) and bound nucleotide (orange).

To resolve this paradox, we considered another alternative mechanism. The rate of GTP hydrolysis by purified Cdc12 is approximately half that of Cdc10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Versele and Thorner, 2004</xref>). If monomeric Cdc12 GTP hydrolysis is also comparatively slow in vivo, then some Cdc12•GTP molecules might persist transiently in the cytosol before conversion to Cdc12•GDP. If Cdc12•GTP has a higher affinity for Cdc11 than for Shs1, and the reverse is true for Cdc12•GDP, then Cdc11 would associate with Cdc12 before it autoprimes its NC interface, and Shs1 would associate after NC auto-priming.</p><p>Additionally, our observation that Cdc3 consistently interacts with Cdc12 before Cdc12–Shs1 association suggests that Cdc12•GDP has a higher affinity (slower off-rate) for NC interaction with Cdc3 than for G interaction with Shs1.

Studies of non-septin homo-oligomers indicate that larger interfaces tend to interact first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levy et al., 2008</xref>), and in crystal structures the septin NC interface buries ~60% more surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>).

Cdc12ΔCTE-V<sub>C</sub>–Cdc11-V<sub>N</sub> signal was reduced compared to Cdc12-V<sub>C</sub>–Cdc11-V<sub>N</sub> controls, and Cdc12ΔCTE-V<sub>C</sub>–Shs1-V<sub>N</sub> was elevated compared to Cdc12-V<sub>C</sub>–Shs1-V<sub>N</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, mutating sequences near the Cdc12–Cdc3 NC interface controls selection of the G partner of Cdc12, consistent with CTE regulation of Cdc12 hydrolysis of GTP, and specificity of Cdc11/Shs1 interaction with Cdc12 in distinct nucleotide states.</p><p>To further test the reliance of Cdc11–Cdc12 interaction on Cdc12 nucleotide state, we mutated Cdc12 to alter nucleotide occupancy in the NBP. Thr75 corresponds to a Thr residue that in human septins contacts the γ phosphate of GTP and is thought to catalyze GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirajuddin et al., 2009</xref>); substitution to Gly or Ala inhibits both stable binding of GTP and its hydrolysis without reducing affinity for GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirajuddin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbey et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with a predicted depletion of Cdc12•GTP, in cells expressing <italic>cdc12(T75A)</italic> Cdc11 incorporation into neck filaments was significantly reduced, and Shs1 was correspondingly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). By contrast, Cdc11 and Shs1 were both depleted from neck filaments in cells expressing Cdc12(G268R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), a mutant with a substitution in a key component of the G interface (the Sep4 motif) that lies outside the NBP and does not change conformation upon GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirajuddin et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, although levels of both Cdc11 and Shs1 in septin rings were reduced in <italic>cdc12(G268R)</italic> cells, the relative ratio between the two proteins (Cdc11:Shs1 ≅ 1.6:1) was preserved. These observations indicate that Shs1 is able to bind Cdc12 regardless of the nature of the nucleotide bound in the Cdc12 NBP, whereas Cdc11 is specific for a transient Cdc12•GTP species. Independence of Cdc12 nucleotide binding for Shs1–Cdc12 interaction may explain our finding that this septin-septin association was least affected by MPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The Cdc12 switch II loop mediates communication of Cdc12 nucleotide state across the G interface</title><p>In septins, as in other small GTPases, GTP hydrolysis triggers movements of the Switch loops (I and II).

Thus, the Cdc12 Switch II is an excellent candidate to communicate Cdc12 nucleotide state to the future G partner, Cdc11 or Shs1. This model predicts that Cdc12 Switch II mutation should perturb the ability of Cdc12•GTP to recruit Cdc11. We mutated in Cdc12 a highly conserved Asp residue within the Switch II that is known in other septins to make <italic>trans</italic> contacts across the G interface (human SEPT2•GppNHp homodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirajuddin et al., 2009</xref>]) and to dictate G partner specificity (Cdc3–Cdc10 G heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weems et al., 2014</xref>]).

The G interface of nascent, monomeric Cdc12•GTP binds preferentially to Cdc11, but if Cdc12 hydrolyzes GTP prior to Cdc12–Cdc11 interaction, Cdc12•GDP is no longer competent to bind Cdc11, and Shs1 instead occupies the Cdc12 G interface. This model predicts that the relative abundance of monomeric Cdc11 and Shs1 available during protofilament assembly (Cdc11:Shs1 ratio measurements range from 0.8:1 to 1.2:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Newman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chong et al., 2015</xref>]) is largely irrelevant, because incorporation of each subunit is dictated by the limited availability of Cdc12 in specific nucleotide states. To test this prediction, we experimentally altered the abundance of Cdc11 or Shs1 and measured incorporation into septin rings. High-level overexpression of Cdc11 or Shs1 is toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iwase et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sopko et al., 2006</xref>). We introduced into strains expressing Cdc11-GFP or Shs1-GFP from the chromosomal locus low-copy plasmids encoding an additional source of Cdc11-GFP or Shs1-GFP, which should increase abundance of the GFP-tagged septin two- to fourfold. Indeed, cytosolic fluorescence increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Crucially, however, there was no discernable difference in the GFP signal in septin rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, the preferential incorporation of Cdc11 vs Shs1 into septin protofilaments cannot be explained by a higher overall Cdc12 affinity for Cdc11 or transcriptional control of Cdc11:Shs1 stoichiometry, and according to our results is best explained by specific affinity between Cdc11 and Cdc12•GTP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Allosteric control of Cdc3 interaction order by the Cdc3 N-terminal extension</title><p>Our CSD-BiFC experiments demonstrated that Cdc3 usually associates with Cdc12 via the NC interface before interacting via the G interface with Cdc10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting a possible ‘G priming’ mechanism for Cdc3. Cdc3 G priming might represent a reversal of NC priming, in which the act of NC association with Cdc12 properly positions the Cdc3 α0 helix – via a kind of ‘induced fit’ – and triggers allosteric changes at the G interface that allow interaction with Cdc10. However, since Cdc3 apparently lacks the ability to hydrolyze GTP, we reasoned that Cdc3 would require some unique feature(s) to allow hydrolysis-independent G priming.</p><p>Cdc3 is unique among mitotic yeast septins in possessing a very long N-terminal extension (NTE), representing 100 residues of additional sequence N-terminal of the α0 helix. The Cdc3 NTE lacks any known motif or region of predicted secondary structure. If the NTE has some affinity for the Cdc3 G interface, then this long, flexible sequence could occlude the G interface in cis until Cdc3 interacts with Cdc12 across the NC interface, whereupon repositioning of the Cdc3 α0 helix toward Cdc12 might drive rearrangement of the Cdc3 NTE, exposing the G interface for association with Cdc10. Indeed, in the atomic structure of the equivalent interface in the human protofilament, the NC interface between SEPT7•GDP and SEPT6•GTP, a portion (~7 aa) of the short NTE of SEPT6 (~25 aa) is resolved and fits into a groove on the underside of SEPT7, pointing directly away from the SEPT6 G interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>). The Cdc3–Cdc12 NC interaction would thus be predicted to position the Cdc3 NTE away from the Cdc3 G interface. Similar autoinhibitory mechanisms operate in many other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trudeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pufall and Graves, 2002</xref>): long, disordered regions occlude active sites while the protein is monomeric, and the inhibition is relieved upon dimerization and recruitment of the auto-inhibitory region to the binding partner.</p><p>The Cdc3 NTE is predicted to be almost entirely disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Sequence alignments with other fungal species revealed considerable drift in the NTEs of otherwise closely related Cdc3 homologs, yet the disordered character was uniformly maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These closely related NTEs contain only a small stretch of sequence that is conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>); by comparison, in fungal species in which Cdc3 lacks an NTE, this conserved GQ(V/K)(L/I)PxQP sequence, just N-terminal of the α0 helix, is also missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This sequence may play an important role in NTE autoinhibitory functions, perhaps promoting proper positioning of the disordered region, or potentiating recruitment by Cdc12.</p><p>To look for evidence that the NTE transiently occupies the Cdc3 G interface prior to Cdc3 interaction with other septins, we considered that for Cdc10, Cdc11, and Cdc12, single NBP mutations are sufficient to slow the maturation of the mutant septin to a conformation capable of G dimerization with other septins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagaraj et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). This delay is due in part to prolonged interactions with cytosolic chaperones that recognize misfolded septin G interfaces and is manifested in vivo as the inability of the mutant septin to incorporate into septin rings when co-expressed in haploid cells with a WT allele of the same septin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagaraj et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). Yet for Cdc3 only a triple NBP mutation (G129V K132E T133N) sufficed to render the mutant less able to ‘compete’ with WT Cdc3 for incorporation into higher-order septin assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagaraj et al., 2008</xref>). These observations could be explained if the Cdc3 NTE shields a singly-substituted NBP from chaperone recognition and sequestration, consistent with our model that the NTE also effectively shields the WT Cdc3 G interface (of which the NBP is a major part) from interaction with Cdc10.</p><p>To test this theory, we introduced a single substitution in the Cdc3 NBP, Cdc3(D289N), predicted to, like Cdc10(D182N), prevent binding of guanosine nucleotides, and examined the ability of Cdc3(D289N)-GFP to incorporate into septin rings when co-expressed with untagged, WT Cdc3. Unlike Cdc10(D182N)-GFP, which is sequestered in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>), Cdc3(D289N)-GFP was incorporated efficiently into septin rings, equivalent to the behavior of WT Cdc3-GFP tested in the same way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, the NTE was required for efficient higher-order incorporation by Cdc3(D289N) in the presence of WT Cdc3, as Cdc3(∆1–100 D289N)-GFP was unable to localize to the septin ring in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Even a partially truncated NTE was able to shield Cdc3(D289N) from cytosolic sequestration, as Cdc3(∆1–56 D289N)-GFP localized robustly to septin rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Importantly, however, NTE truncation did not itself compromise higher order assembly by Cdc3, because Cdc3(∆1–100)-GFP incorporated normally into septin rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Finally, the Cdc3(Δ1–100 D289N) mutant protein was not simply incapable of higher order assembly, because when expressed as the sole source of Cdc3 this allele provided normal septin function under the same conditions in which the co-expression experiments were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

These results suggest that the Cdc3 NTE possesses a domain between residues 57 and 100 that is capable of recognizing and occluding a nucleotide-free Cdc3 NBP, in agreement with our model in which the NTE acts as an auto-inhibitory element to dictate the order of Cdc3 interactions with other septins.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23689.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The order of Cdc3 oligomerization is controlled by the Cdc3 N-terminal extension.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Violin plot showing bud neck fluorescence for the indicated GFP-tagged alleles of Cdc10 or Cdc3 expressed from plasmids in WT cells (strain BY4741, plasmids pLA10, pCdc10-1-GFP, pCdc3-GFP, and YCpL-Cdc3(D289N)-GFP) cultured at 22°C to mid-log phase prior to imaging.

We performed docking simulations between this structure and the Cdc3 NTE. Residues 57–100 suffice for shielding of Cdc3(D289N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), so we eliminated NTE residues 1–56. We further reasoned that of the 43 functionally relevant amino acids, a linker region of 15–20 residues would be necessary to bridge the gap between the α0 helix and the NBP, so we also eliminated residues 82–100. Using Autodock Vina, we docked NTE(57-81) to our Cdc3 model, allowing full conformational freedom, and obtained a solution in which the NBP is occluded and the docked NTE region is oriented appropriately to connect via the linker with the α0 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). (No solution could be obtained using a model containing bound nucleotide.) We believe this structure provides a plausible model for occupancy of the Cdc3 NBP by the NTE, supporting our hypothesis that the NTE shields the nascent NBP from intermolecular interactions until Cdc3–Cdc12 association has occurred.</p><p>Our model predicts that NTE deletion will disrupt the order of Cdc3 interactions with other septins. Specifically, prematurely exposing the Cdc3 G interface to Cdc10 prior to Cdc3 interaction with Cdc12 might reverse the order of interactions between Cdc3, Cdc12, and Cdc10. We generated a Cdc3(Δ1–100)-V<sub>C</sub> fusion and used it to perform CSD-BiFC with Cdc12-V<sub>N</sub> and Cdc10-C<sub>N</sub>. As predicted, expression of Cdc10-C<sub>N</sub> depleted the signal arising from Cdc3(Δ1–100)-V<sub>C</sub>–Cdc12-V<sub>N</sub> interaction, whereas Cdc3(Δ1–100)-V<sub>C</sub>–Cdc10-C<sub>N</sub> signal was unaffected by expression of Cdc12-V<sub>N</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>).

Cdc11-capped hetero-octamers associate preferentially with membrane-coated beads of diameter ~1 µm, and have little affinity for 0.3 µm beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bridges et al., 2016</xref>); Shs1-capped octamers have not been tested in this way. Based on these in vitro studies, increasing the Shs1:Cdc11 ratio might be expected to increase the curvature, and decrease the diameter, of septin rings in vivo, either by directly influencing filament curvature, or by modulating the affinity of septin filaments for regions of the plasma membrane with specific curvatures. Indeed, in <italic>shs1∆ cdc11∆</italic> cells septin filaments are no longer restricted to the most highly curved regions of the bud necks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McMurray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iwase et al., 2007</xref>), and in cells of the filamentous fungus <italic>Ashbya gosyppii</italic>, the presence of WT Shs1 similarly appears to direct septin hetero-octamer recruitment to membrane regions with distinct curvatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meseroll et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies clearly established that the diameters of the yeast septin rings at the time of bud emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okada et al., 2013</xref>) and the diameter of the bud neck itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gladfelter et al., 2005</xref>) are functions of the activity of the small GTPase Cdc42, and do not reflect intrinsic properties of the septin filaments themselves (although Shs1/Cdc11 composition might dictate the range of tolerable diameters). On the other hand, upon the onset of cytokinesis, the septin ‘collar’ at the bud neck splits into two rings flanking the hourglass-shaped bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lippincott and Li, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). We reasoned that the range of membrane curvatures available at the hourglass periphery could accommodate ‘split’ septin rings of various diameters, independently of the extrinsic factors that dictate the diameter of the septin collar earlier in the cell cycle.</p><p>We therefore hypothesized that effects of alterations in the Shs1:Cdc11 ratio on the curvature of septin filaments in vivo would be manifested as changes in the diameter of septin split rings. We measured split ring diameter in the same cells in which we previously measured the Shs1:Cdc11 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). Split septin ring diameter decreased in every situation in which the Shs1:Cdc11 ratio increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Importantly, cells cultured in 0.1% dextrose are smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Soma et al., 2014</xref>), and, as a GTPase, Cdc42 activity may be influenced by GTP:GDP ratio changes, raising the possibility that the observed changes in septin split ring diameter were indirect effects of changes in these extrinsic factors. However, split septin rings were also smaller in <italic>cdc12(D104A)</italic> cells cultured in 2% dextrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), arguing against these explanations.

We suspect that without Shs1, septin filaments are incompatible with the tighter curvature of the plasma membrane at the bud necks of smaller cells formed in 0.1% dextrose. While further experiments will be required to more carefully investigate effects of the Shs1:Cdc11 ratio on cell size and shape, our findings provide the first hints of a functional context for the relationship that we discovered between this ratio and that of cytosolic GTP:GDP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Septin GTPase activity regulates progression through the protofilament assembly pathway and contributes to protofilament species selection</title><p>A complete nucleotide hydrolysis/exchange cycle is critical for actin and tubulin NTPases because their cellular functions rely on rapid dynamics of polymer assembly (promoted by NTP binding) and disassembly (promoted by NTP hydrolysis and release of inorganic phosphate). In these polymer systems, the irreducible building blocks (α-β tubulin heterodimers, or actin- or FtsZ-type monomers) must hydrolyze slowly outside the polymer context, otherwise a significant pool would, once loaded with NTP, rapidly convert to a form incompetent for polymerization. Hydrolysis rates in the polymeric context are still relatively slow for cytoskeletal NTPases compared to signaling GTPases, which is critical to allow the assembly of meta-stable polymers that persist long enough to carry out their functions.</p><p>Importantly, however, the very first GTP hydrolysis event catalyzed by a nascent tubulin polypeptide takes place concomitantly with α-β heterodimerization and triggers heterodimer release from a complex with tubulin folding cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tian et al., 1999</xref>). Allosteric communication between the septin G and NC interfaces occurring upon GTP hydrolysis, that is, NC priming, represents a conceptually similar mechanism by which an initial septin-septin interaction permits subsequent interactions with other proteins. A key, persistent assumption regarding NC priming, reminiscent of the α-β tubulin scenario, was that G dimerization triggers GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gasper et al., 2009</xref>), and that septin monomers do not hydrolyze GTP with physiologically relevant kinetics. Our work further informs this model by providing evidence that G dimerization is not required for hydrolysis-coupled NC priming to occur. Instead, we propose that slow monomeric hydrolysis allows Cdc12 to more stably sample both GTP and GDP states prior to assembly, and thus to recruit alternate partner subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23689.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for the step-wise pathway of septin protofilament assembly in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23689.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23689.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23689-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><p>By allowing formation of an interface between a GTP-bound and a GDP-bound septin (which structural studies suggest is ‘tighter’ than a ‘GDP–GDP’ interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>]) loss of GTP hydrolysis by Cdc3 during septin evolution likely promoted incorporation of Cdc10 into protofilaments, perhaps analogous to the way that ‘locking’ the α−β tubulin interface created an obligate heterodimer building block for microtubules. Uncoupling oligomerization from nucleotide state was also presumably important for evolution of Cdc11 and Shs1.

Indeed, five human septin genes (SEPT2, SEPT3, SEPT4, SEPT9, and SEPT10) have NTEs of at least ~43 amino acids, similar to the region functional for G-occlusion in Cdc3. Each is similarly devoid of predicted motifs and consistent secondary structures. (The SEPT9 NTE interacts with actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2015</xref>) and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2013</xref>), but the relevant sequences are restricted to the N-terminal half, while the C-terminal half fulfills the conditions described above.) Moreover, for SEPT2, SEPT4, SEPT9, and SEPT10, splice variants halve the NTE or eliminate it altogether, hypothetically allowing alternative splicing to control whether G-occluding or non-G-occluding variants are expressed. Mammalian septins also display wide variation in GTPase rates that could contribute to septin protofilament species selection in a manner analogous to what we propose for Cdc12–Cdc11/Shs1. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbey et al., 2016</xref> found that a SEPT7(S63A) mutation that doubles the rate of GTP hydrolysis in vitro shifts in vivo the specific SEPT9 splice variants with which it interacts (via the G interface).</p><p>We found that different metabolic states in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells bias the composition of septin hetero-oligomers in a manner that correlates with the cytosolic GTP:GDP ratio and GTP concentration, which we propose reflects differential availability of Cdc12•GTP during hetero-oligomer assembly. Ras GTPases are similarly sensitive to this ratio: exchange of GDP for GTP is hampered when GTP:GDP approaches 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rudoni et al., 2001</xref>). Changes in guanine nucleotide ratios may also alter the nucleotide states adopted by monomeric mammalian septin GTPases, representing a previously unanticipated mechanism of developmental control of septin function via specification of subunit composition within septin hetero-oligomers.

Electrospray mass spectrometry sensitively detects subcomplexes formed during disassembly, and relies on the assumption that assembly follows the reverse order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levy et al., 2008</xref>). For complexes that assemble slowly or in discrete steps punctuated by pauses – for example, when specific subunits are synthesized only at defined points in the cell cycle – assembly intermediates may be detectable by traditional pulse-chase methods. On the other hand, mutations that block or delay specific steps are typically exploited to determine assembly pathways for complexes that, like septin hetero-oligomers, assemble rapidly without detectable WT assembly intermediates. We developed CSD-BiFC to address this shortcoming, and propose that this approach will be applicable to other complexes with equivalent properties and for which BiFC tagging does not itself perturb the assembly process. It remains to be seen for how many other complexes assembly order is, like yeast septin assembly, specific and consistent. The allosteric mechanisms we propose here facilitate assembly of hetero-oligomers with precise organization of subunits that are structurally very similar, a challenge not faced by complexes composed of subunits that, due to stark differences in shape, can only fit together in exactly one way.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, media, and genetic manipulations</title><p>All yeast strains and plasmids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were manipulated using standard techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amberg et al., 2005</xref>).

Cells were then washed and mounted in sterile distilled, deionized water under #1.5 coverslips. Microscope settings were individually set for each experiment to minimize exposure times and illumination intensity, with identical settings maintained for all experimental groups across each experiment. To reduce the effects of bleaching in our data, no technical replicates (i.e. imaging of the same cells twice) were performed. However, single-cell resolution allowed for a high number of biological replicates to be obtained in each experiment. Micrographs were generated as eight-bit, greyscale. tif files. Quantification of fluorescent signal was performed using the three attached ImageJ macros (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary files 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">4</xref>) and the FIJI software suite. Briefly, the bud neck signal quantification macros operate by loading micrographs, despeckling them, and subtracting background signal using the ‘rolling ball’ method. The user then selects regions of interest (ROIs) around bud necks to be measured (only early bud necks [i.e. pre-collar stage] were measured in this work for the sake of consistency, and cells showing abnormal morphologies were excluded). Local maxima are then identified within these ROIs, and the user is asked to confirm or deny each maximum as an object to be measured. Upon confirmation, the pixel intensity and coordinates of the maximum are measured and the image is marked with a circle to prevent the user from erroneously measuring a single bud neck more than once. Once all maxima are processed, the data are exported as excel files. The ‘matched’ macro performs these same tasks, but first aligns and stacks two micrographs of the same cells imaged with different channels, so that GFP and mC signals from the same bud neck can be compared and expressed as a ratio (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Upon export to Microsoft Excel files, signals were matched using their coordinates and compiled into a single document. The ‘cyto’ macro performs quantification of cytosolic signal intensity by first despeckling and subtracting background as above, and then selecting small circular ROIs of uniform size (4 pixel diameter) based on user input. Mean pixel intensity within the ROIs is exported to an Excel file along with coordinates. Care was taken to avoid quantifying cytoplasmic regions comprising uncharacteristically high or low signal intensity (i.e. within the vacuole).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analysis and kernel density estimation</title><p>Data were imported into GraphPad Prism 7.01 for statistical analysis. Data were first tested for Gaussian distributions using the D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test, α = 0.05. Groups were then compared using either two-tailed, unpaired t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests, depending on the results of the D’Agostino-Pearson test. If data were Gaussian but had different SDs according to an F-test, Welch’s correction was applied to the t-test. Given a lack of expectations for effect size before the experiments were performed, no <italic>a priori</italic> power analyses were conducted to determine adequate <italic>n</italic>-values – instead, efforts were made to produce the highest <italic>n</italic>-values that could be reasonably achieved for each experiment. Subsequently, effect sizes were noted and power analyses were performed with this information, using point biserial correlations via G*Power 3.1.9.2 (two-tailed, α-error prob = 0.05, 1 - β-error prob = 0.95). Importantly, these analyses used no specific values gathered from observed data (such as SD, means, etc.), but only general ranges of effect sizes to ensure sufficient <italic>n</italic>. All data analyzed in this way possessed adequate <italic>n</italic> given the effect size ranges observed for experiments of this type. KDEs and violin plots were produced using the Seaborn visualization library in the Python 2.7 IDE, Spyder 2.3.9. Kernel bandwidth was determined using Scott’s rule of thumb.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In silico structural modeling and protein-protein docking</title><p>The apo-Cdc3 structural model was generated by threading the primary sequence of Cdc3(116-411) (truncated to match the template model) through the apo-Cdc11 crystal structure (PDB 5AR1) using I-TASSER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang, 2008</xref>). The Cdc3 α0 helix was modeled by threading its sequence through the SEPT6•GTP crystal structure published (PDB 2QAG) using I-TASSER, and attached to the apo-Cdc3 model (maintaining orientation relative to the globular domain) using Chimera 1.11. Docking was performed using a local installation of AutoDock Vina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trott and Olson, 2010</xref>) via Chimera 1.11 with a search volume containing the C-terminal half of the receptor model. The ligand was a 25-residue peptide constructed from Cdc3(57-82). Of the seven results, one was selected that positioned its C-terminal residue in a position accessible to a 18-residue linker chain (Cdc3(83-100) attached to the α0 helix. Once the linker chain and peptide ligand were attached, the linker was modelled into a low-energy conformation using MODELLER via Chimera 1.11. Ribbon diagrams were generated using Chimera 1.11 or PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5.0.1, Schrödinger, LLC.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Marian Farkasovsky (Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava), Erfei Bi (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine), and Jeremy Thorner (University of California, Berkeley) for strains and plasmids.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The step-wise pathway of septin hetero-octamer assembly in budding yeast&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Yves Barral (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>There is consensus on finding your study interesting and worth of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we feel that the data are not fully ready yet, and a number of additional experiments are still needed before final acceptance. The main concerns of the reviewers are two fold:</p><p>First, we feel that while your novel assay, CSD-BiFC, seems very original and powerful, it still needs to be more extensively validated before firm conclusions can be drawn. Since the vast majority of the conclusions of the paper rely only on this assay, its thorough validation is vital.</p><p>Second, your conclusions would certainly benefit from alternative support. The reviewers feel that a strong approach towards this would be if you could provide biological evidence for your conclusions and their relevance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) BiFC is your only readout of septin-septin interactions. To complement violin plots, provide fluorescent images to show what exactly is being imaged and quantified (presumably by ImageJ?). Please, provide experimental support for your assumption that BiFC tagging does not perturb the assembly (as stated in subsection “Elucidating the order of hetero-oligomer assembly in vivo”).</p><p>Suggestion: For example, what are the phenotypes associated with expressing the tagged proteins? Do they affect viability, the timing of cytokinesis and septin reorganization, or the morphology of the cells? Do they cause synthetic phenotypes when combined with septin mutations?</p><p>The interpretations presented in the manuscript rely on the assumption that the BiFC fragment-tagged neighboring subunits competitively interacting via G- and NC-interfaces provide equal opportunities for those fragments to assemble, such that the detected signals reflect the bias in the G- vs NC-based septin interaction. It is not clear that this is the case. Assuming the BiFC tags are always C-terminal to the septins (hard to judge, as the tagging strategy is not explicitly detailed), certain interactions may clearly be favored. The existing structural data, such as the heterotrimeric human septin assembly (pdb: 2QAG), show more than 3-fold difference in the distances of the C-termini of the septins: ~7 nm for the G-interface-related monomers, ~2 nm for the NC-interface-related ones. One would therefore expect a strong positional effect to be there. The positional bias of the BiFC signals may undermine the interpretations, and the authors should find a way to address this point. Indeed, the study relies on analysis of competing interactions of BiFC fragments, and some of these interactions may be favored over the others simply by difference in BiFC fragment proximity.</p><p>Suggestion: Using modeling, please make sure that the constructs you used, and thus also your interpretations of BiFC experiments, are consistent with the available structural evidence.</p><p>The study seems also to exclusively rely on fluorescent signal at the bud neck. How do we know BiFC signal comes from linear septin complex assembly? Considering assemblies at the bud neck are more than isolated filaments, could the readouts be confusing septin filaments versus bundles versus rings? The same positional bias may apply to the interactions of protofilaments in the context of known larger structures, such as paired septin filaments (Bertin et al., 2008, DeMay et al., 2011). How would the interpretation change if the convoluted signal from the fluorescence-based in vivo experiments were to stem from adjacent protofilaments, rather than from subunits within the individual octamers? Although you make a case for a purely in vivo study, in subsection “Depletion of guanine nucleotides perturbs both G and NC septin-septin interfaces”, it is not quite clear from the current version of the manuscript that the interactions observed in vivo can be unequivocally ascribed to individual octamers.</p><p>Suggestion: Is it possible to measure interaction between subunits in the cytoplasm, i.e., before the oligomers assemble into higher order structures at the bud neck? Can these interactions be compared to those observed at the bud neck? Perhaps isolated oligomers are easiest to observe during the G1 phase, when the old ring disassembles and the new one forms? If there are differences in results from cytoplasm versus bud neck measurements and / or a problem for other constructs used (eg signal too weak, BiFC freezing), this can also be valuable to report.</p><p>What happens to the fluorescence intensity after yeast cells divide and the septin collars disassemble? Can any biology be inferred?</p><p>2) Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is used to disrupt de novo GMP, GDP, and GTP production. Do yeast cells fail to divide in the presence of MPA? To strengthen conclusions about the role of GTP hydrolysis, can a second approach be used?</p><p>3) This report offers many new inferences including (i) the role of GTP hydrolysis, (ii) the order of septin complex assembly, and (iii) Cdc11 vs Shs1 protofilament diversity. A biological significance to confirm violin plots for any of these new inferences would strengthen the accessibility and impact of the manuscript. Some discussion on protofilmaent diversity (Shs1/Cdc11 ratio) arising from the cellular GTP/GDP ratio could be exciting and raise profile of results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The step-wise pathway of septin hetero-octamer assembly in budding yeast&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have also provided the FIJI/Image J scripts/macros that we created for this analysis. As experimental support of the assumption that the BiFC tagging does not perturb the assembly process in any fundamental way, we also provide, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, new data showing that the tagging does not detectably affect viability/proliferation rate, or the timing of major structural changes in the septins associated with the onset of budding, cytokinesis, etc. (Because the reconstituted Venus fluorophore photobleaches quickly, we were unable to perform time-lapse imaging of single cells, and instead compared the frequencies of cells in different stages as visualized with snapshots of asynchronous cultures.) We have added additional body text (subsection “Depletion of guanine nucleotides perturbs both G and NC septin-septin interfaces”, paragraph three) to point out that elongated buds (a known phenotype of tagging septins) are very rare, and that we eliminated such cells from our analysis. As suggested, we also observed no obvious synthetic effect of combining CSD-BiFC tags with septin mutations, specifically the cdc10(D182N) and cdc3(Δ1-100) alleles. Thus we are confident that BiFC tagging itself does not perturb septin assembly in any way that is relevant to our conclusions.</p><p><italic>The interpretations presented in the manuscript rely on the assumption that the BiFC fragment-tagged neighboring subunits competitively interacting via G- and NC-interfaces provide equal opportunities for those fragments to assemble, such that the detected signals reflect the bias in the G- vs NC-based septin interaction.

We added other new text to emphasize that interactions between septin C termini must not drive septin-septin BiFC, or we would not be able to see differences upon nucleotide depletion, and to cite published evidence that Cdc3–Cdc12 CTE interactions are insufficient for incorporation into septin filaments/bud neck localization. Similarly, we added new text (subsection “Discrete steps in septin protofilament assembly”) pointing out that CTE-mediated interactions between Cdc3 and Cdc12 must not precede, and thus cannot “drive”, Cdc3–Cdc12 interactions, otherwise there would be no difference in order between Cdc3–Cdc12–Cdc11 and Cdc3–Cdc12–Shs1. We have added new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2 —figure supplement 3</xref>) to demonstrate that BiFC signals from C-terminally tagged CTE-containing septins are of similar “strength” regardless of whether the interaction measured is via the G or NC interface. We have also added to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> text citing published work that septin CTEs are so long and flexible (≥10 nm, rotating ~180°) that in fact the available structural evidence predicts no bias introduced by the locations of the tags, which fits with our findings. Finally, any slight added “strength” of NC interactions due to proximity of the tags to the NC interface must not introduce a bias in the order of Cdc3–Cdc10–Cdc10 interactions, because introducing a mutation in the Cdc10 nucleotide binding pocket (D182N) randomizes the interaction order, without altering the location of the tags.

Can any biology be inferred?</italic> </p><p>If septin-septin CSD-BiFC exclusively, or even primarily, reports on interactions between pre-formed protofilaments that occur during polymerization on the membrane, then this approach would fail miserably, at least according to available data for how protofilaments encounter one another during polymerization (see PMID: 24469790). We would expect mutual depletion in every case, i.e., random order. Furthermore, there is no current model for such post-assembly events that could explain how MPA treatment and specific point mutations within individual septins (Cdc10(D182N), Cdc3(Δ1-100)) could bring about the specific changes in CSD-BiFC signal that we observed. Even if every possible BiFC event occurs in the cytosol during assembly and prior to interaction with the membrane at the site of budding, we do anticipate some frequency of postassembly BiFC events, such as upon “lateral” association between a protofilament containing only VN-tagged septins and protofilament containing only VC-tagged septins. Such events should “crosslink” protofilaments together, which, if they occurred frequently, might be expected to perturb septin ring disassembly or the next round of septin ring assembly (pre-existing septin complexes are recycled for use through many successive cell divisions). We found no evidence for such perturbations in the strains that we used to draw our conclusions (see above). However, we now provide new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) for a scenario in which BiFC should induce protofilament-protofilament crosslinking upon events occurring at the bud neck, i.e., Cdc11-VC–Cdc11-VN BiFC. Here, we do observe perturbations in the timing of higherorder structural transitions: the patch-to-ring transition during late G1-early S phase is slightly prolonged. Since targeted exocytosis is thought to drive the patch-to-ring transition by delivering septin-free membrane in the center of the septin patch (PMID: 23906065), it may be the case that end-to-end-crosslinked protofilaments are less easily displaced by exocytic delivery than are “free” protofilaments, slowing clearance from the center of the patch. We mention this possibility in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, but we believe that this idea is too speculative to warrant description in the body text. We were able to quantify cytosolic BiFC signal in the nucleotide depletion experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and the trends were exactly the same as we measured at the bud neck. However, CSD-BiFC signals are, by definition, weaker, and we were unable to reliably distinguish cytosolic CSD-BiFC signal from background. We have added new text to that effect. With regard to measuring cells in G1 during the period between old ring disassembly and new ring assembly, in rapidly dividing cells like the ones we imaged (and which we believe are probably most representative of the conditions under which septins assembly pathways evolved), new ring assembly is usually concomitant with old ring disassembly (see PMID: 21736496), hence the requested cells are too rare for reliable numbers. Ultimately, given the slow maturation of the reconstituted fluorophore following a BiFC event (~50 min; PMID: 18573091), compounded with septin stability and “recycling” through cell division, in every such cell the signal reports primarily on events that occurred during previous cell cycles. Rather than detailing all of these lines of logic in the body text, if this manuscript is published in <italic>eLife</italic>, we hope that a curious reader could find them in the “Author Response” section.</p><p><italic>2) Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is used to disrupt</italic> de novo <italic>GMP, GDP, and GTP production. Do yeast cells fail to divide in the presence of MPA? To strengthen conclusions about the role of GTP hydrolysis, can a second approach be used?</italic> </p><p>We have revised the body text to point out that cells treated with this concentration of MPA continue to divide. We also now include new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) demonstrating that NC interaction between Cdc3 and Cdc12 is also perturbed in culture conditions (reduced dextrose, or in glycerol) in which IMDH expression is reduced, and thus guanine nucleotide levels should be depleted.</p><p><italic>3) This report offers many new inferences including (i) the role of GTP hydrolysis, (ii) the order of septin complex assembly, and (iii) Cdc11 vs Shs1 protofilament diversity. A biological significance to confirm violin plots for any of these new inferences would strengthen the accessibility and impact of the manuscript. Some discussion on protofilmaent diversity (Shs1/Cdc11 ratio) arising from the cellular GTP/GDP ratio could be exciting and raise profile of results.</italic> </p><p>We now include new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) demonstrating that in conditions in which</p><p>protofilament composition is biased towards incorporation of Shs1, the diameter of split septin rings decreases, consistent with previous in vitro studies demonstrating that increasing the Shs1:Cdc11 ratio increases the curvature of ring structures formed from mixtures of Cdc11- and Shs1-containing protofilaments. Furthermore, we now include other new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) demonstrating that when Shs1 is unavailable for incorporation (i.e., in <italic>shs1Δ</italic> cells), culture conditions that normally promote increased incorporation of Shs1 exacerbate the defects in morphology of both the cells and of septin rings. While we are careful not to suggest that the composition of septin protofilaments directly dictates the diameter of the septin collar or the bud neck, and we acknowledge that we do not yet fully understand the functional consequences of altering split septin ring diameter, we believe these new findings provide the kind of biological significance that was suggested might raise the profile of the study.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>We acknowledge that you have made a real effort to provide clarifications and that the manuscript has been much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>Please, do not reserve any arguments that strengthen your manuscript.
