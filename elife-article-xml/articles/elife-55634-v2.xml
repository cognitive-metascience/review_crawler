TRPM3 mutations in humans were recently reported to be associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy; the functional effects of those mutations, however, were not reported. Here, we show that both disease-associated mutations in the human TRPM3 render the channel overactive, but likely via different mechanisms. The Val to Met substitution in the S4-S5 loop induced a larger increase in basal activity and agonist sensitivity at room temperature than the Pro to Gln substitution in the extracellular segment of S6. In contrast, heat activation was increased more by the S6 mutant than by the S4-S5 segment mutant. Both mutants were inhibited by the TRPM3 antagonist primidone, suggesting a potential therapeutic intervention to treat this disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inherited brain disorders often cause severe problems for those affected by them. One example is a group of diseases, collectively termed “developmental and epileptic encephalopathies”, or DEE for short. People with these diseases usually have both epilepsy and intellectual disabilities, and in some patients these conditions are associated with two mutations that change a gene called <italic>TRPM3</italic>.</p><p>The <italic>TRPM3</italic> gene encodes a protein called an ion channel. Ion channels form pores on the surfaces of cells. When channels are active, the pores open, allowing charged particles – which, in the case of TRPM3, are sodium and calcium ions – to pass through, carrying tiny electrical currents. In the nervous system, ion channels help nerve cells communicate and also allow them to sense changes in the environment.</p><p>The TRPM3 channel is known to open in response to heat and certain chemical “activators”. In mice, TRPM3 is found in sensory nerve cells, where it acts as a heat sensor. Although altering TRPM3 in mice affects their ability to sense intense or painful heat stimuli, they are otherwise completely normal and have no symptoms resembling human DEE disorders.</p><p>Although TRPM3 is found in the human brain, little is known about its role there or what effects the DEE-associated mutations have on its activity. Zhao et al. therefore set out to determine, whether each of the mutation was a ‘loss of function’, meaning that it stopped the channel from opening, or a ‘gain of function’, meaning it made the channel open more often.</p><p>Frog egg cells and mammalian cells grown in the laboratory were engineered to produce the TRPM3 ion channel. Measurements of electrical activity on these cells revealed that the two mutations seen in people with DEE were both ‘gain of function’. Both mutants were more sensitive to heat and chemical activators than the normal protein. They were also more active overall, even without any stimuli. However, one mutation had a greater effect on heat sensitivity, while the other caused a larger increase in chemical-induced activity.</p><p>Imaging experiments revealed that both mutant channels also increased the amount of calcium inside the cells. This could explain why the mutations cause disease, since abnormally high calcium levels can damage nerve cells. In addition, the epilepsy drug primidone switched off the mutant channels, pointing to potential treatment of this disease using primidone.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRPM3</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>channelopathy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS055159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohacs</surname><given-names>Tibor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM093290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohacs</surname><given-names>Tibor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM131048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohacs</surname><given-names>Tibor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Disease-associated mutants of the TRPM3 ion channel are overactive, and they are inhibited by the antiepileptic medication primidone, offering a potential therapeutic intervention to treat this channelopathy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 3 (TRPM3) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable, non-selective cation channel activated by heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>) and chemical activators such as the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PregS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>) and the synthetic compound CIM0216 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Held et al., 2015</xref>). TRPM3 is a well-established temperature sensor in peripheral sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG); its genetic deletion in mice leads to defects in noxious heat sensation as well as reduced inflammatory heat hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vandewauw et al., 2018</xref>). Inhibitors of TRPM3 also reduced both acute heat sensation and inflammatory heat hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Straub et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krügel et al., 2017</xref>). While TRPM3<sup>-/-</sup> mice show defects in noxious heat sensation, the channel shows increased activity well below the noxious range, when temperature is increased from 15°C to 26°C, with further increases in activity at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>). TRPM3 is also inhibited by activation of Gi-coupled receptors such as μ-opioid receptors and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in DRG neurons, and agonists of those receptors reduced nocifensive reactions to local injection of TRPM3 agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badheka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dembla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Quallo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>TRPM3 is also expressed in tissues other than peripheral sensory neurons, where its functional roles are not well understood. In pancreatic β-cells, it was shown that application of the TRPM3 agonist PregS induced an increase in insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>), but TRPM3<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed no impairment in glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>). TRPM3 is also expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, and PregS was reported to induce contractile responses in freshly isolated aorta, but the concentration required for this response was higher than the plasma levels of this compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Naylor et al., 2010</xref>). TRPM3 is also expressed in various regions of the brain, where its functional role is essentially unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Oberwinkler and Philipp, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Very little is known about the physiological and pathophysiological roles of TRPM3 in humans. A recent paper showed that two missense mutations in TRPM3 are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability, hypotonia and epilepsy, pointing to important roles of this channel in the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dyment et al., 2019</xref>). Seven of the eight patients had a de novo Val to Met substitution in the S4-S5 loop, while one patient had a Pro to Gln substitution in the extracellular segment of S6. The effects of these mutations on channel function however were not reported.</p><p>Here, we tested the functional effects of the two disease-associated mutations using electrophysiology and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements. We find that both disease-associated mutations render the channel overactive. Both mutants showed constitutive activity that was inhibited by the TRPM3 antagonist primidone. As primidone is a clinically used medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krügel et al., 2017</xref>), our findings offer potential clinical intervention to treat this channelopathy. We also find that the Val to Met substitution in the S4-S5 loop induced a larger left shift in the concentration response relationship to PregS and CIM0216 than the Pro to Gln substitution close to the pore-loop in the extracellular segment of S6. The increase in heat activation on the other hand was more pronounced in the S6 mutant. We conclude that both reported mutants of TRPM3 are gain of function, but the mechanism of increased channel activity is different for the two mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Here we used, patch clamp electrophysiology and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements in HEK293 cells and two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes to study the effects of disease-associated mutations on TRPM3 function. TRPM3 has a large number of splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Oberwinkler and Philipp, 2014</xref>), but there is no information available which splice variants are expressed in the human brain, and relatively little is known about the functional differences between splice variants. To ensure that our results do not only apply to one variant, we used two commonly used and well-characterized splice variants of TRPM3 in our experiments. In HEK293 cells, we expressed the human orthologue of the most studied mouse variant TRPM3α2 that was originally cloned from mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oberwinkler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, we expressed the human TRPM3 splice variant we used in several previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badheka et al., 2017</xref>), originally described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grimm et al. (2003)</xref> also called the TRPM3<sub>1325</sub> variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oberwinkler et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Most alternatively spliced exons are in the cytoplasmic N-terminus; thus, the numbering of mutated residues varies between splice variants. The more common S4-S5 segment mutant described as V837M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dyment et al., 2019</xref>) corresponds to V990M in the hTRPM3 splice variant we expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, and to V992M in the hTRPM3α2 variant we expressed in HEK293 cells. The S6 mutant P937Q in Dyment et al corresponds to P1090Q in the hTRPM3 variant we used in oocytes, and it is P1092Q in the hTRPM3α2 we used in HEK293 cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the location of these residues in the TRPM3 sequence and putative structure.</p><p>First, we co-expressed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) and the hTRPM3α2 isoform and its mutants in HEK293 cells and performed intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements in a 96-well plate reader. We found that the concentration-response relationship to PregS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>) and CIM0216 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>) were left shifted in the mutant channels; V992M showed a much larger shift than P1092Q for both agonists. The V992M mutant also showed a larger increase in basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels than P1092Q at room temperature (21°C), and the application of the TRPM3 antagonist primidone decreased basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels for both mutants in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–L</xref>). Primidone had no effect on basal cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in cells transfected with the wild type TRPM3 indicating negligible basal activity of the wild type channel at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Primidone robustly inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by EC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of PregS both for wild type and mutant channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also measured PregS responses at 37°C. Consistent with earlier results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>), sensitivity of wild-type TRPM3 to PregS increased at 37°C; the EC<sub>50</sub> of activation decreased to 0.99 μM at 37°C compared to 7 μM at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at 37°C were substantially elevated in cells expressing wild-type channels, which is consistent with the low temperature threshold of TRPM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>). Both mutant channels showed very high basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which were not further increased by PregS, indicating substantial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload when kept at 37°C continuously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). Primidone (50 μM) reduced basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at 37°C in wild type channels and to a smaller extent in the mutant channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M–P</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Disease-associated mutations increase agonist sensitivity and basal activity of TRPM3.</title><p>HEK293 cells were transfected with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f and the hTRPM3α2 or its mutants, and fluorescence was measured in a 96-well plate reader (Flexstation-3) as described in the Materials and methods section.

The inhibition of the P1090Q mutant was similar to wild type, but the V990M mutant was essentially not inhibited. To test whether the lack of inhibition was due to allosteric effects of the increased sensitivity to PregS, we stimulated the oocytes expressing the V990M mutant with 5 μM PregS where ACh induced a ~ 35% inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C,E</xref>).

These data show that while the V990M mutation affects receptor-induced inhibition at high PregS concentrations, it is not likely to be the primary mechanism of its gain-of-function phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Overall, our data show that disease-associated mutations in TRPM3 render the channel overactive. Both mutants showed basal activity even at room temperature, which was reduced by the TRPM3 antagonist primidone. Basal activity of the V992M mutant at room temperature was higher than that of the P1092Q mutant, but at 37°C, the difference in basal activity between the two mutants became negligible. Given the increased constitutive activity of the mutants at body temperature, increased neuronal excitability and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced neuronal damage is a possible disease-causing mechanism. Primidone is a clinically approved antiepileptic drug; it is thought to exert its effects by being converted to barbiturate by the liver, but it crosses the blood brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nagaki et al., 1999</xref>), and directly inhibits TRPM3 activity even below its therapeutic concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krügel et al., 2017</xref>). Our data showing that primidone inhibited the basal activity of the mutant channels, suggests a potential therapy for this newly described channelopathy.</p><p>The V990/V992M mutation showed a larger increase in basal activity at room temperature, and also induced a larger left shift in the concentration response curves of the agonists PregS and CIM0216 than the P1090/1092Q mutation. This is expected if both mutations increase the stability of the open state of the channel, with the V990/992M mutation having a larger effect. If increased open state stability is the only explanation for the over-activity of the mutants, we would expect V990/992M to be also more sensitive to activation by increased temperatures than P1090/1092Q. This is however not what we observed. We consistently find that the P1090/1092Q mutant showed more pronounced activation by increased temperatures than the V990/992M mutant. This indicates that the mechanism of over-activity is different for the two mutants.</p><p>These two residues are in different locations; V990/992 is in the S4-S5 linker whereas P1090/1092 is in the outer portion of S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The S4-S5 linker plays essential roles in channel gating, and has been shown to be a hotspot of disease-associated gain-of-function mutations in a number of TRP channels, including TRPV3, TRPV4, TRPM4 and TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hofmann et al., 2017</xref>). This channel segment also plays a role in binding of hydrophobic, or amphipathic ligands in TRPM channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). For example, in TRPM8 channels the S4-S5 linker is in direct contact with both the cooling agent icilin, and the menthol analog WS12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yin et al., 2019</xref>). While PregS is thought to activate TRPM3 by directly binding to the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drews et al., 2014</xref>), its binding site in the channel is not known, and currently there is no structural information available for TRPM3. Because of the clear increase in basal activity of the V990/992M mutant, it is quite likely that the mutation primarily increased the stability of the open state and the decrease in EC<sub>50</sub> of agonist activation is a consequence of the change in activation equilibrium constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colquhoun, 1998</xref>). It cannot be excluded, however, that the mutation also affected PregS binding concurrently, given the general role of this segment in ligand binding in TRP channels.</p><p>The membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) is also required for PregS-induced TRPM3 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tóth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Uchida et al., 2016</xref>). In TRPM8, the equivalent of V990 is two positions upstream from a residue that is in close contact with PIP<sub>2</sub>, and it is 4 and 7 positions downstream from two residues in close contact with icilin and the menthol analog WS12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). PIP<sub>2</sub> is located adjacent to the menthol analogue WS12 and the cooling agent icilin in the TRPM8 structures, and menthol has been shown to allosterically affect PIP<sub>2</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rohács et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is also possible that the V990/992M mutation affects PregS activation indirectly via PIP<sub>2</sub>. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in cells expressing mutated channels may also modify cellular PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels, which may alter channel activity. Differentiating between these possibilities will require future studies.</p><p>While the mechanism of temperature activation of TRP channels is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clapham and Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Islas, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrigoni and Minor, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castillo et al., 2018</xref>), large-scale unbiased mutagenesis studies on TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grandl et al., 2010</xref>) and TRPV3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grandl et al., 2008</xref>) show that mutations in the pore region and the outer portion of S6 in these channels selectively abolished heat-, but not agonist-induced channel activation. The P1090/1092Q mutation in TRPM3 is located in the outer portion of S6, and it had a stronger effect on heat activation than the V990/992M mutation, therefore it is possible that the primary effect of the P1090/1092Q mutation is increasing heat sensitivity. Increased temperatures synergize with PregS in activating wild-type TRPM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>), see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>, therefore it is possible that the increased PregS sensitivity of the P1090/1090Q mutant is secondary to its increased heat activation.</p><p>Overall our data show that both disease-associated mutations render TRPM3 overactive, but likely with different mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">hTRPM3α2;

For measurements at 37°C the MEM medium used to culture the cells was replaced with the measurement solution preheated to 37°C, and the plate was placed in the plate reader warmed to 37°C using its built-in temperature controller.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments were performed using an Olympus IX-51 inverted microscope equipped with a DeltaRAM excitation light source (Photon Technology International, PTI), as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badheka et al., 2017</xref>). HEK293 cells were transfected with hTRPM3α2-GFP or its mutants using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen). Cells were loaded with 1 μM fura-2 AM (Invitrogen) for 40 min before the measurements at 37°C, and dual-excitation images at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths were detected at 510 nm with a Roper Cool-Snap digital CCD camera. Measurements were conducted at room temperature in extracellular solution containing 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4. PregS, and primidone were applied with a gravity-driven whole chamber perfusion system. Temperature stimulation was performed using a custom-built system as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badheka et al., 2017</xref>) by pushing bath solution through a spiral tubing immersed in hot water using a 60 ml syringe while monitoring the temperature of the perfusion chamber using a CL-100 Warner Instruments temperature controller. The analogue signal from the CL-100 unit was fed into the Digidata digitizer and the temperature curve was collected in Clampex. Data analysis was performed using the Image Master 5 software (PTI).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Whole cell patch clamp experiments</title><p>HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding the hTRPM3α2-GFP, or its mutants with 0.2 µg of constructs using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according manufacturer’s protocol and were used in experiments 48–72 hr later. Measurements were carried out on GFP positive cells, in an extracellular solution containing (in mM) 137 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES and 10 glucose, pH 7.4. The intracellular solution contained (in mM) 140 potassium gluconate, 5 EGTA, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, and 2 NaATP, pH 7.3. Patch clamp pipettes were prepared from borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter Instruments) using a P-97 pipette puller (Sutter Instrument) and had a resistance of 2–4 MΩ. In all experiments after formation of GΩ-resistance seals, the whole-cell configuration was established and currents were recorded using a ramp protocol from −100 mV to +100 mV over 500 ms preceded by a −100 mV step for 100 ms; the holding potential was 0 mV, and this protocol was applied once every 1 s. The currents were measured with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, filtered at 5 kHz, and digitized through Digidata 1440A interface. In all experiments, cells that had a passive leak current over 100 pA were discarded. Data were collected and analyzed with the PClamp10.6 (Clampex) acquisition software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and further analyzed and plotted with Origin 2019b (OrigiLab, Northampton, MA). Heat stimulation was performed as described for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Two electrode voltage clamp experiments</title><p><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes were prepared as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>). All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. In brief, frogs were anesthetized in 0.25% ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate solution (MS222; Sigma-Aldrich); bags of ovaries were removed surgically from the anesthetized frogs. Individual oocytes were obtained by overnight digestion at 16°C in 0.2–0.3 mg/ml type 1A collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich), dissolved in a solution containing 82.5 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 μM HEPES, pH 7.4 (OR2 solution). The next day the collagenase containing solution was discarded and the oocytes were washed multiple times with OR2 solution. The oocytes were maintained in OR2 solution supplemented with 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 16°C. cRNA was transcribed from the linearized human TRPM3 (hTRPM3) cDNA clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grimm et al., 2003</xref>), or its mutants in the pGEMSH vector using the mMessage mMachine kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cRNA (40 ng) was microinjected into individual oocytes, using a nanoliter-injector system (Warner Instruments). For combined injection of wild-type and mutant TRPM3 for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E–G</xref>, 40 μg total cRNA was injected in a 1:1 ratio. The V990M and P1090Q mutants were generated using the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies). For the GPCR regulation of these mutants, we injected cRNA of human M2 muscarinic receptors together with TRPM3 or mutants at 1:1 ratio. Oocytes were used for electrophysiological measurements 48–72 hr after microinjection. The hTRPM3<sub>1325</sub> clone in a mammalian expression vector was provided by C. Harteneck (Eberhard Karls University Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany), and it was subcloned into the pGEMSH oocyte vector using standard molecular biology techniques.</p><p>Two electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Leon D Islas as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.

TRPM3 has been shown to act as a peripheral nervous system mild temperature heat-sensor. However, the roles it might play in the central nervous system are less well known. Recently, single point mutations have been identified in TRPM3 from human patients with a neurodevelopmental disability and epilepsy. This finding suggests that TRPM3 channels may play a very important physiological role in normal aspects of motor control and cognition.</p><p>This manuscript by Zhao at al., presents an initial characterization of the functional effects of these two mutations on the molecular physiology of hTRPM3. The findings show that both mutants produce a gain-of-function phenotype that partially explains the pathological effects of the mutations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use two &quot;commonly used&quot; splice variants of the channel but do not specify if these are the variants expressed in the brain in humans. It seems that both of those are not the same splice variant where the mutations were recently found (Dyment et al., 2019). The authors should perform the analysis on the same splice variant that was sequenced in human patients.</p><p>2) For the V990M and P1090Q, the authors explain that &quot;temperature sensitivity&quot; was affected (to different degrees), however, they have not measured temperature sensitivity, that is, the slope of the conductance vs. temperature curve. The authors should be careful to distinguish this measurement from the amplitude of the current at a fixed temperature, which is what they are measuring and may or may not have anything to do with changes in sensitivity.</p><p>3) For the mutant in the pore (P1090Q), the authors should show if the effect of the mutant is also on the single-channel conductance. This is especially true to begin to distinguish the effects on temperature activation.</p><p>4) The effects of the mutations are characterized by comparing magnitude of the current elicited by ligands or temperature with the magnitude of the currents elicited by pregnenolone sulphate (PS), but the authors have not characterized the effects of the mutations on the sensitivity of the channels to PS. It is paramount that the authors show that the mutants have not affected activation by PS since this could severely bias the interpretation of the results.</p><p>5) The interpretation that each one of the mutations affects heat or agonist activation preferentially is not well sustained. Without measuring the actual sensitivity to temperature, you cannot argue that it has been changed by the mutation. The same goes for sensitivity to agonist. Without knowing the binding site you cannot make an argument about sensitivity. Given that TRPM3 seems to be a channel that acts by allosterically coupling its different modalities of activation, and the fact that both mutations increase the basal activity of the channel to some degree, it the seems likely that both mutations just increase the basal open probability without actually affecting the sensitivity to temperature or to ligand. Given that these channels are gated by allosteric mechanisms, increasing the basal open probability will be reflected in increased fractions of current being activated by either temperature or ligand binding. Since the authors do not yet have a handle on the detailed effects of the mutations, they should be careful to offer mechanistic molecular explanations.</p><p>6) Given that the heat sensitivity of TRPM3 might be relevant for central neurons, you may consider testing the PS sensitivity of the mutant channels at the body temperature of 37°C. Results from such experiments would dramatically boost the significance of the study. In addition, it is important to note that the elevated basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the mutant-expressing cells may alter the chemo- and thermos- sensitivities indirectly, e.g., by affecting the levels of PIP2, which is known to regulate TRPM3. This should be discussed.</p><p>7) The temperature-dependent gating described here should be thoroughly reviewed. TRPM3 is known to be activated by noxious heat, but in the current study, the channel is robustly activated by 30°C. Judging from the recordings in the Figure 2, it appeared that there was no temperature threshold for activation. Note that the temperature protocol appears to be slightly misaligned with the current traces, such that the currents started to increase prior to temperature elevations. The authors should also consider using the same experimental protocol and X/Y axis to compare WT and mutant channels.</p><p>8) In Figure 4, the experimental design is flawed. The effects of drug inhibition should be separated from those caused by temperature reduction (washout).</p><p>9) The authors analyze one splice variant in oocytes (using electrophysiology) and the second one in HEK cells using calcium imaging. The authors did not provide any reason for their choices. Also, the authors used primidone only in HEK cells, although they show higher basal activity in oocytes as well, why did the authors not perform parallel experiments for both splice variants?</p><p>10) Figure 1: The authors assume that the co-expression of wild-type and mutant receptors (in 1:1 ratio) will lead to heteromeric channels. What is the experimental evidence for this assumption? Moreover, the fact that the mutations are heterozygote, according to Dyment et al., 2019, does not necessarily mean a heteromeric channels. Thus, it is not clear what the advantage is of these experiments.</p><p>11) Figure 1—figure supplement 2: According to the present results, the agonist CIM0216 evokes a non-washable response in oocytes in all the concentrations. Thus, establishing a relevant dose-response under these conditions is quite challenging. The authors should perform a single dose recording normalized to the saturating concentration and not a step dose-response. More importantly, the mutant V990M seems to lose all sensitivity to the CIM in negative potentials. Alternatively, the data for CIM should be eliminated.</p><p>12) Figure 1—figure supplement 3: The authors measure the Gi evoked TRPM3 inhibition of the wild type and mutants. Although the conclusion that the mutations do not interfere with the Gi inhibition seems correct, the experiment should be done at the relevant EC50 of each construct and not in the wild type saturating concentration.</p><p>13) Figure 2: similar to the previous point, the authors should normalize the temperature response to the same PregS saturating level based on their dose-response (Figure 1). Using the saturating dose of the wild-type receptor is not comparable when the authors claim to a leftward shift in the mutant's dose-response.</p><p>14) Figure 2—figure supplement 1: The authors should provide some recording examples to these basal currents. Based on Figure 2A-C, it seems all constructs have a similar baseline.</p><p>15) Figure 3 and Figure 4: As mention previously, it is not clear what is the purpose of this specific splice variant to this study, and why HEK cells and calcium imaging. This data can be added as a supplement to Figure 1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55634.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The physiological functions of TRPM3 ion channels are not well understood.

The findings show that both mutants produce a gain-of-function phenotype that partially explains the pathological effects of the mutations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use two &quot;commonly used&quot; splice variants of the channel but do not specify if these are the variants expressed in the brain in humans. It seems that both of those are not the same splice variant where the mutations were recently found (Dyment et al., 2019). The authors should perform the analysis on the same splice variant that was sequenced in human patients.</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge there is no information on which splice variants are expressed in the human brain. These mutations are identified in genomic DNA sequences and therefore are found in all splice variants, as neither mutation is located on an alternatively spliced exon. There are more than 17 splice variants of TRPM3 in mice and a similar number in humans; most of them have not been functionally characterized. The authors identifying these mutations did not perform any functional experiments; rather they chose an arbitrary splice variant as a reference sequence to assign numbers to the mutated residues. We chose the two best characterized splice variants to characterize these mutations, to ensure that the effect of the mutations are not specific to one arbitrarily chosen splice variant. We clarified this in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the V990M and P1090Q, the authors explain that &quot;temperature sensitivity&quot; was affected (to different degrees), however, they have not measured temperature sensitivity, that is, the slope of the conductance vs. temperature curve. The authors should be careful to distinguish this measurement from the amplitude of the current at a fixed temperature, which is what they are measuring and may or may not have anything to do with changes in sensitivity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new experiments for the revised version, where we measured TRPM3 currents in response to slower temperature ramps, and plotted the current increase as a function of temperature. Our data show that the P1092Q mutant showed a significantly steeper increase in currents than the V992M mutant with increasing temperature, and both mutants showed significantly steeper increase than wild type. The new data are shown in Figure 3 of the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For the mutant in the pore (P1090Q), the authors should show if the effect of the mutant is also on the single-channel conductance. This is especially true to begin to distinguish the effects on temperature activation.</p></disp-quote><p>As the major effect of the P1090Q mutant was not increased current amplitudes, but rather increased sensitivity to heat and left shifted concentration response relationship to agonists, measuring single channel conductance would not explain the key effect of the mutation, and we felt that detailed single channel characterization of the mutations is beyond the scope of the manuscript. I would also like to refer to my phone conversation with Dr. Islas who confirmed that this experiment was not critical for the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The effects of the mutations are characterized by comparing magnitude of the current elicited by ligands or temperature with the magnitude of the currents elicited by pregnenolone sulphate (PS), but the authors have not characterized the effects of the mutations on the sensitivity of the channels to PS. It is paramount that the authors show that the mutants have not affected activation by PS since this could severely bias the interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not clear what the reviewers meant, we have performed PregS concentration dependence measurements, which were shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3 and the V990/992M mutation induced a larger left shift than the P1090/1092Q mutation. As the figures have been rearranged, these data are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 4 in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The interpretation that each one of the mutations affects heat or agonist activation preferentially is not well sustained. Without measuring the actual sensitivity to temperature, you cannot argue that it has been changed by the mutation. The same goes for sensitivity to agonist. Without knowing the binding site you cannot make an argument about sensitivity. Given that TRPM3 seems to be a channel that acts by allosterically coupling its different modalities of activation, and the fact that both mutations increase the basal activity of the channel to some degree, it the seems likely that both mutations just increase the basal open probability without actually affecting the sensitivity to temperature or to ligand. Given that these channels are gated by allosteric mechanisms, increasing the basal open probability will be reflected in increased fractions of current being activated by either temperature or ligand binding. Since the authors do not yet have a handle on the detailed effects of the mutations, they should be careful to offer mechanistic molecular explanations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we do not have a full mechanistic explanation for the effect of the mutations; we have substantially rewritten the discussion and tried our best to be more careful with interpreting our data in the revised version. When referring to agonist sensitivity we meant the shift in the concentration response curve, and did not mean ligand binding, for which we agree with the reviewer that we need knowledge of the binding site. Overall, however, we do not believe that a simple increase in basal activity can explain the differences between the functional effects of the two mutations. The V990/992M mutation induced a larger increase in basal activity and a larger left shift in the PregS dose response than the P1090/1092Q mutation. If both mutants simply increased basal activity, i.e. the stability of the open state, then the V990/992M mutation would also have a larger effect on temperature activation than the P1090/1092Q mutation. This is however not the case, rather it is the opposite, the P1090/1092Q mutation had a larger effect on temperature activation than V990/992M. As mentioned earlier, in the revised version we also confirmed this finding with measuring the slope of the current increase which showed that the P1092Q mutant showed a significantly steeper increase in currents with increasing temperatures than V992M (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Given that the heat sensitivity of TRPM3 might be relevant for central neurons, you may consider testing the PS sensitivity of the mutant channels at the body temperature of 37°C. Results from such experiments would dramatically boost the significance of the study. In addition, it is important to note that the elevated basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the mutant-expressing cells may alter the chemo- and thermos- sensitivities indirectly, e.g., by affecting the levels of PIP2, which is known to regulate TRPM3. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments at 37°C in the plate reader assay. As expected, the EC50 for PregS activation of the wild type channel shifted to the left. In both mutants however basal cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels became so high, that PregS did not induce any additional increase in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These new data are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3. We also applied primidone (50 μM) which decreased basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in both mutants at 37°C similar to that of the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in cells transfected with the wild type channels. Primidone also decreased basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in cells transfected with wild type TRPM3 at 37°C, which is consistent with our data showing that increasing temperature to 37°C from room temperature induces channel activity. These new data are shown in Figure 1 Panels M-P. We have also discussed the possibility of indirect effects by the mutations via PIP2, and possible effects of increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels on PIP2. The patch clamp and two electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> therefore Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced changes in PIP2 levels are unlikely in those experimental settings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The temperature-dependent gating described here should be thoroughly reviewed. TRPM3 is known to be activated by noxious heat, but in the current study, the channel is robustly activated by 30°C. Judging from the recordings in the Figure 2, it appeared that there was no temperature threshold for activation. Note that the temperature protocol appears to be slightly misaligned with the current traces, such that the currents started to increase prior to temperature elevations. The authors should also consider using the same experimental protocol and X/Y axis to compare WT and mutant channels.</p></disp-quote><p>Genetic deletion of TRPM3 leads to defects in noxious heat sensations, but the channel is known to be activated by temperature well below noxious temperatures; thus, our data are congruent with the literature. We explained this in the introduction of the revised version. The current increasing earlier than the temperature was a plotting error during file conversion, we fixed it in the revised version, but the reviewer is correct that there do not seem to be a threshold, as soon as the temperature increases the current starts increasing also. This is again consistent with data in the literature, the article first describing temperature activation of TRPM3 noted that TRPM3 currents increase when the recording temperature is increased from 15 to 26<sup>o</sup>C with a further increase of currents at 37<sup>o</sup>C (Vriens et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 4, the experimental design is flawed. The effects of drug inhibition should be separated from those caused by temperature reduction (washout).</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of applying primidone in Figure 4 (Figure 2 in the revised manuscript) was to accelerate return of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels to baseline after increased temperature, not to test the effect of the drug per se. We mentioned in the main text, but we also clarify this in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors analyze one splice variant in oocytes (using electrophysiology) and the second one in HEK cells using calcium imaging. The authors did not provide any reason for their choices. Also, the authors used primidone only in HEK cells, although they show higher basal activity in oocytes as well, why did the authors not perform parallel experiments for both splice variants?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a better justification for using two splice variants and performed experiments in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> with primidone. The new data are shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 1: The authors assume that the co-expression of wild-type and mutant receptors (in 1:1 ratio) will lead to heteromeric channels. What is the experimental evidence for this assumption? Moreover, the fact that the mutations are heterozygote, according to Dyment et al., 2019, does not necessarily mean a heteromeric channels. Thus, it is not clear what the advantage is of these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not say the channels were forming heteromers, as we agree with the reviewer that we cannot be certain of that without experimental evidence. We think this experiment is important as it presumable mimics the heterozygous condition, regardless of whether the mutant channels form heteromers. In heterozygous conditions one chromosome has the mutant the other chromosome has the wild type gene, and we think it is a reasonable assumption that they generate mRNA of the wild type and mutant channels in similar amounts. We clarified this in the revised version. Note that in the revised version the figure describing these data became Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 1—figure supplement 2: According to the present results, the agonist CIM0216 evokes a non-washable response in oocytes in all the concentrations. Thus, establishing a relevant dose-response under these conditions is quite challenging. The authors should perform a single dose recording normalized to the saturating concentration and not a step dose-response. More importantly, the mutant V990M seems to lose all sensitivity to the CIM in negative potentials. Alternatively, the data for CIM should be eliminated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the CIM0216 oocyte data from the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 1—figure supplement 3: The authors measure the Gi evoked TRPM3 inhibition of the wild type and mutants. Although the conclusion that the mutations do not interfere with the Gi inhibition seems correct, the experiment should be done at the relevant EC50 of each construct and not in the wild type saturating concentration.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed experiments with M2 receptors using EC50 concentrations of PregS from wild type and mutant channels; the new data are shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 3G-K. The data are consistent with our initial assessment that interfering with Gβγ inhibition is not the major mechanism of overactivity in these mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Figure 2: similar to the previous point, the authors should normalize the temperature response to the same PregS saturating level based on their dose-response (Figure 1). Using the saturating dose of the wild-type receptor is not comparable when the authors claim to a leftward shift in the mutant's dose-response.</p></disp-quote><p>The oocyte experiments with temperature induced currents are moved to the supplement (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) as the new patch clamp experiments in HEK cells (Figure 3) convey a very similar message. The concentration response curves are left shifted in the mutants, therefore a saturating concentration for the wild type is also saturating for the mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure 2—figure supplement 1: The authors should provide some recording examples to these basal currents. Based on Figure 2A-C, it seems all constructs have a similar baseline.</p></disp-quote><p>This figure was a compilation of data from the original Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2, example traces were provided in those figures. We have performed additional experiments with the TRPM3 inhibitor primidone in oocytes, which we show together in the revised manuscript with the summary of basal currents, providing additional representative traces in the same figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Figure 3 and Figure 4: As mention previously, it is not clear what is the purpose of this specific splice variant to this study, and why HEK cells and calcium imaging. This data can be added as a supplement to Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>There are several reasons we think these experiments are important. 1. The splice variant we used in the original Figure 3 and 4 (Figure 1 and Figure 2 in the revised MS) is the human orthologue of the best characterized mouse splice variant TRPM3a2. TRPM3 has a large number of splice variants (&gt;17), testing the effect of mutations all of them is not realistic, but we wanted to ensure that our data are not only valid on splice variant. 2. The oocyte experiments were performed in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to avoid complications with Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced inactivation. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data show that a similar effect is also induced on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by TRPM3 activation. 3. As it was pointed out the CIM0216 dose response in oocytes is difficult to interpret, and our Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements show that the CIM0216 dose response is also left shifted. Nevertheless, our new HEK cell electrophysiology experiments (Figure 3) made the original Figure 2 with heat-induced currents in oocyte redundant; therefore, we moved that figure in the supplement (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
