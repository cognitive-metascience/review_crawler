We found that two RNA viruses with broad host ranges, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sindbis virus (SINV), are completely restricted in their replication after entry into Lepidopteran cells. This restriction is overcome when cells are co-infected with vaccinia virus (VACV), a vertebrate DNA virus. Using RNAi screening, we show that Lepidopteran RNAi, Nuclear Factor-κB, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways restrict RNA virus infection. Surprisingly, a highly conserved, uncharacterized VACV protein, A51R, can partially overcome this virus restriction. We show that A51R is also critical for VACV replication in vertebrate cells and for pathogenesis in mice. Interestingly, A51R colocalizes with, and stabilizes, host microtubules and also associates with ubiquitin. We show that A51R promotes viral protein stability, possibly by preventing ubiquitin-dependent targeting of viral proteins for destruction. Importantly, our studies reveal exciting new opportunities to study virus-host interactions in experimentally-tractable Lepidopteran systems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02910.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02910.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02910.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses can infect species as diverse as bacteria, plants and animals, and once they have infected an organism they hijack its cells to rapidly replicate their own genetic material, which is made of DNA or RNA. Many animals, including insects, have been used as model organisms to investigate viral infections. These studies have, for example, provided insights into how viruses replicate and how they suppress their host's immune system.</p><p>One insect species that has been used in many virus-host studies is the gypsy moth. This species of moth was accidently introduced into North America from Europe in the late 1800s, and its caterpillars have become a major pest because they destroy hardwood trees and forests. Gypsy moth outbreaks are still a serious problem, but their numbers can be kept in check by using biological control strategies, such as DNA viruses. However, the response of gypsy moths to infection by RNA viruses has not been studied extensively.</p><p>Gammon et al. now show that, after being infected with one of two different RNA viruses, gypsy moth cells can slow down and eventually halt the replication of the RNA viruses. However, if the gypsy moth cells are also infected with a DNA virus, they lose their ability to restrict the replication of the RNA virus. Gammon et al. discovered that the moth’s immunity to RNA virus infection is disarmed by a protein called A51R from the DNA virus. This protein increases the stability of the proteins in the RNA virus, most likely by stopping the moth from breaking them down.</p><p>The results of Gammon et al. suggest that it might be possible to use a combination of RNA viruses and the A51R protein to keep the number of gypsy moths in check.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02910.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02910.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Lymantria dispar</kwd><kwd>vaccinia virus</kwd><kwd>vesicular stomatitis virus</kwd><kwd>Sindbis virus</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI60025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silverman</surname><given-names>Neal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mello</surname><given-names>Craig C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>8 P41 GM103533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moresco</surname><given-names>James J</given-names></name><name><surname>Yates</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gammon</surname><given-names>Don B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000145</institution-id><institution>Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gammon</surname><given-names>Don B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel virus-host systems yield insights into how Lepidopterans (moths and butterflies) combat RNA virus infection and reveal that poxvirus A51R proteins can suppress the host's immune system and stabilize microtubules in host cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viruses represent a constantly evolving challenge to the fitness and survival of their cellular hosts. Thus, not surprisingly, investigations into virus-host interactions have produced important and fundamental new insights into both cellular and pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Panda and Cherry, 2012</xref>). Invertebrate model organisms have proven useful in elucidating a wide range of host responses to infection and because many of these responses are well conserved, studies in model organisms are often directly relevant to human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Panda and Cherry, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moy et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, studies of invertebrate antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fire et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou and Rana, 2013</xref>) have produced powerful tools for probing and manipulating gene function, with potential utility for direct therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blake et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Relatively small genomes, well-defined genetics, and efficient RNAi pathways make insect models attractive systems in which to study virus-host interplay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherry, 2011</xref>). Dipteran organisms, such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, have been the primary focus of virus-host studies in invertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi screens have greatly enhanced our understanding of how eukaryotic host factors can promote or inhibit virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherry, 2011</xref>). These studies have almost exclusively focused on RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu and Cherry, 2014</xref>). In contrast to Dipterans, most virus-host studies in the order <italic>Lepidoptera</italic> (moths and butterflies) have focused on DNA viruses, particularly baculoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ikeda et al., 2013</xref>). These studies have provided key insights into highly conserved mechanisms by which Lepidopterans combat DNA virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ikeda et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, while Lepidopterans provide a relevant model for studying DNA virus-host interaction they have not previously been used to probe restrictions to RNA virus replication.</p><p>The gypsy moth (<italic>Lymantria dispar</italic>) has been one of the most prolific North American hardwood forest pests since its accidental release in the late 1800’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sparks et al., 2013</xref>). Exploring the susceptibility and responses of <italic>L. dispar</italic> and other Lepidopterans to virus infection is of particular importance in designing new and effective virus-based biocontrol strategies to minimize the devastating economic impact these species continue to have on the forest industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sparks et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>L. dispar</italic>-derived cell lines are susceptible to a wide variety of invertebrate DNA viruses, and as such, they are often used in virus-host studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sparks and Gundersen-Rindal, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>L. dispar</italic>-derived LD652 cells can also support a limited infection by vaccinia virus (VACV), a vertebrate poxvirus encoding a large dsDNA genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 1998</xref>). During infection of LD652 cells, VACV undergoes early gene expression, DNA replication and late gene expression, but the infection is abortive due to a defect in one or more steps of virion morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 1998</xref>). VACV entry and early gene expression have also been documented in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, however viral DNA replication and subsequent late gene expression were not detected, indicating that VACV replication is blocked earlier in its life cycle in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells than in LD652 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moser et al., 2010</xref>). Despite these limitations, RNAi screening of VACV-infected <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells has identified multiple host factors required for VACV entry in eukaryotic hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moser et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the LD652 cell culture system provides a unique model in which to explore multiple aspects of vertebrate DNA virus biology, including basic replication strategies and suppression of host immune pathways by viral proteins.</p><p>The extent of RNA virus studies in <italic>Lepidoptera</italic> is limited compared to DNA virus studies and largely restricted to non-enveloped dsRNA and (+)-sense ssRNA viruses such as cypoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hill et al., 1999</xref>), iflaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Oers, 2010</xref>) and tetraviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Short and Dorrington, 2012</xref>). These viruses only infect invertebrate hosts and several cannot productively replicate in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Short and Dorrington, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, to our knowledge, (−)-sense ssRNA viruses have not been previously reported to productively infect Lepidopteran hosts. A new model system for studying RNA viruses in Lepidopteran hosts may be useful in the design of new biocontrol agents for pest species and improve our understanding of RNA virus-induced disease in vertebrates.</p><p>Here we explore RNA virus-Lepidopteran host interactions by infecting LD652 cells with the (−)-sense ssRNA vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or the (+)-sense ssRNA Sindbis virus (SINV), both of which replicate in a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Letchworth et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xiong et al., 1989</xref>). We unexpectedly found that LD652 cells restrict both VSV and SINV replication after virus entry. Using RNAi to knock down the expression of candidate <italic>L. dispar</italic> antiviral immunity factors, we show that specific RNAi and innate immune pathway components restrict RNA virus replication. We also uncover a role for the Lepidopteran ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in restricting RNA virus replication. Surprisingly, co-infection with VACV strongly suppressed this restriction, suggesting that VACV encodes one or more factors that promote RNA virus replication. Using RNAi and genetic techniques, we found that the highly conserved, and previously uncharacterized, VACV <italic>A51R</italic> gene product is sufficient to alleviate the LD652 cell restriction to VSV and SINV replication. Interestingly, A51R formed aggregate- and filament-like structures that colocalize with microtubules (MTs) and protected MTs from depolymerization. Using alanine mutagenesis, we further show that an A51R point mutant with reduced RNA virus rescue ability still forms filamentous structures and stabilizes MTs, suggesting that A51R functions, in addition to MT stabilization, are required for disarming Lepidopteran antiviral immunity. Using mass spectrometry-based techniques, we found that A51R co-immunoprecipitates with several host proteins, including ubiquitin (Ub). Using radiolabeling and immunoblotting, we show that A51R does not affect viral mRNA translation rates but does promote virus protein stability, possibly by inhibiting Ub-dependent host targeting of viral proteins for degradation. Importantly, we show that A51R is also required for efficient replication of VACV in vertebrate cells and for pathogenesis in mice, indicating that A51R is a VACV virulence factor. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the utility of Lepidopteran systems for the study of RNA- and DNA virus host interactions and shed light on how this economically-important order of insects restricts virus replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNA virus restriction in <italic>L. dispar</italic> cells is relieved by VACV co-infection</title><p>To determine the susceptibility of <italic>L. dispar</italic> cells to RNA virus infection, we challenged LD652 cells with recombinant strains of VSV and SINV that express either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase (LUC) from viral promoters. In single infections with VSV-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kato et al., 2005</xref>) or SINV-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cristea et al., 2006</xref>), we found that, even at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10, &lt;4% of LD652 cells exhibited GFP fluorescence by 96 hr post-infection (hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). A previous report indicated that VACV enters LD652 cells and reaches the stage of late gene expression but ultimately fails to complete virion morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 1998</xref>). VACV, like other poxviruses, encodes numerous immunomodulatory proteins that inhibit a wide variety of host antiviral pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore wondered if VACV co-infection (although abortive) might nevertheless overcome an immune response in LD652 cells that restricts RNA virus replication. Consistent with this idea, when LD652 cells were co-infected with VSV-GFP or SINV-GFP and the Western Reserve (WR) strain of VACV (VACV-WR), the number of GFP-positive cells increased to ∼77% (VSV-GFP) and ∼45% (SINV-GFP) by 96 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02910.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Restriction of RNA virus replication in LD652 cells is relieved by VACV co-infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GFP fluorescence (top) and phase contrast images (PC, bottom) of infected LD652 cells at 96 hpi.

Using this strategy, we detected small, ∼3–5-fold increases in light units (LU) during VSV-LUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or SINV-LUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) infection of LD652 cells between 8 and 24 hpi, with levels plateauing by 24 hpi.

Co-infection of VSV-LUC or SINV-LUC with VACV-WR initially yielded LU levels similar to those seen in single infection by 8 hpi; however, LU readings increased logarithmically by 24–48 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>The trends observed in the LUC assays were further confirmed by immunoblotting for LUC and other viral proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>).

Therefore we used confocal microscopy to begin A51R characterization by examining A51R subcellular localization. We found that Flag-A51R, expressed under its natural promoter from the ΔA51R<sup>FA51R</sup> virus, formed both aggregate-like as well as filamentous structures in the cytoplasm of African green monkey-derived (BSC-40) cells. This staining pattern significantly overlapped with that of cellular tubulin, suggesting that A51R associates with a subset of MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Indeed deconvolution of images from these experiments revealed Flag-A51R staining localized on intact MT tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the idea that A51R not only co-localizes with MTs but also alters their properties, we observed enhanced co-localization on A51R-dependent, drug-resistant MT structures in infected cells treated with the MT-depolymerizing drug nocodazole. In the presence of nocodazole, MT structures were essentially absent in mock-infected and ΔA51R-infected cells. However filamentous, drug-resistant ‘MT pieces’ were abundant in ΔA51R<sup>FA51R</sup>-infected BSC-40 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Nocodazole-resistant MT pieces were previously observed in mammalian cells infected with VACV-WR but not with VACV-MVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ploubidou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schepis et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore examined Flag-MVAA51R protein localization in nocodazole-treated cells and found that, although Flag-MVAA51R staining stained small punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm that overlapped with tubulin, large drug-resistant MT-like structures failed to form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). These results suggest that Flag-MVAA51R protein is deficient in its ability to both form filament-like structures and to protect MTs from depolymerization.</p><p>To ask if Flag-A51R localization to and stabilization of MTs requires other VACV proteins, we transfected BSC-40 cells with a plasmid expressing Flag-A51R. We found that Flag-A51R expression was sufficient for both localization to, and stabilization of, MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover, using similar assays, we found that A51R homologs from other poxviruses also co-localize with and protect MTs from depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Finally, in LD652 cells, as in vertebrate cells, Flag-A51R formed aggregates and filamentous structures that co-localized with and protected MTs from depolymerization by the MT-depolymerizing agent vincristine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that the ability of A51R to interact with the host MT cytoskeleton is a conserved property of A51R proteins.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02910.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Poxvirus A51R proteins localize with and stabilize host microtubules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence of Flag-A51R (red) and tubulin (green) in BSC-40 cells in the presence or absence of nocodazole 24 hr post-transfection of Flag-A51R vector.

To first investigate if there were differences in viral protein translation rates in the presence of A51R, we used a two hour pulse of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine to label newly-synthesized proteins in virus-infected LD652 cells. We then analyzed the abundance of newly synthesized, radiolabeled VSV N protein after immunoprecipitation from these lysates. We found that radiolabeled VSV N protein was undetectable in cells infected only with either VACV-WR (control) or VSV-LUC. In contrast, we found significant quantities of radiolabeled VSV N protein in VSV-LUC-infected cells that were also infected with either VACV-WR or ΔA51R strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, top panel). These results suggest that viral protein translation rates are too low to be detected by this method in VSV-LUC single infections but are detectable (and surprisingly similar) in co-infections with VACV-WR or ΔA51R strains. When whole cell extracts from these experiments were immunoblotted for total VSV N protein levels, again we found that VSV N was not detected in either VACV-WR or VSV-LUC single infection lysates. However, total VSV N protein levels were dramatically reduced in ΔA51R co-infections compared to co-infections with VACV-WR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, middle panel). To determine if the reduced VSV N protein levels in ΔA51R co-infections might be due to altered VSV N protein stability, we calculated the half-life of newly-synthesized VSV N protein using pulse-chase analyses. Although newly synthesized VSV N protein could be detected during co-infection with either VACV-WR or ΔA51R strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), the levels of radiolabeled protein appeared to diminish more rapidly during ΔA51R co-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Regression analyses of pulse-chase experiments estimated the half-life of VSV N to be ∼5.3 hr during co-infection with VACV-WR while only ∼1.8 hr during co-infection with the ΔA51R strain. Collectively, these data suggest that A51R associates with Ub and promotes viral protein stability.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02910.022</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A51R promotes RNA virus protein stability in LD652 cells.</title><p>Cells were infected with the indicated strains for 72 hr and then pulsed for 2 hr with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine.

Both VACV-WR and ΔA51R infections led to rapid weight loss of animals by days 4 and 5, respectively. In animals infected with VACV-WR, weight loss continued on days 6–7 post-infection, with 5/5 animals ultimately succumbing to infection by day 7. In contrast, only 1/5 animals infected with the ΔA51R strain died by day 7, while the remaining animals recovered from infection, gained weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>) and survived until the end of the 28 day experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>).</p><p>We further confirmed in separate experiments, and at multiple doses of virus, that the ΔA51R virus displays attenuated virulence compared to VACV-WR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). To determine the relative amount of virus replication that occurred during these infections in vivo, we isolated lung and ovarian tissues on days 4 and 6 post-infection and measured virus titers by plaque assay. After four days of infection, both VACV-WR and ΔA51R viruses replicated to similar titers in lung tissue, the primary site of infection. By day 6, however, a trend toward lower ΔA51R titers in the lungs was observed, although this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). Neither VACV-WR nor ΔA51R viruses were detected in isolated ovaries by day 4 post-infection, suggesting that these viruses had not yet spread to this distant tissue. By day 6 post-infection, however, we detected significantly higher virus titers (p&lt;0.05) in the ovaries of all VACV-WR-infected animals compared to ΔA51R-infected animals, in which virus was detectable in only 1/5 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>). These data suggest that A51R is not only important for VACV replication in cell culture but also for virulence in vivo.</p><p>The reduced replication of the ΔA51R strain at later time points of infection during in vitro and in vivo infections was not caused by a reduction in the extracellular enveloped (EEV) form of VACV, which primarily mediates spread of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Our analysis revealed that, despite ∼10-fold lower titers of total (intracellular and extracellular) virus in ΔA51R cultures than in VACV-WR or ΔA51R<sup>FA51R</sup> cultures, ΔA51R cultures shed ∼twofold higher levels of EEV than VACV-WR or ΔA51R<sup>FA51R</sup> cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The early plateau of ΔA51R replication and reduced load of this mutant in ovarian tissues might be explained by an inability to overcome an immune response caused by initial infection. We therefore pre-treated BSC-40 cells with interferon (IFN) to induce an antiviral state in cells prior to VACV infection and asked whether A51R is required to overcome an IFN response. Comparing the titers of VACV-WR, ΔA51R, or ΔA51R<sup>FA51R</sup> cultures pre-treated with IFN to parallel cultures without IFN treatment, we found that IFN pre-treatment reduced VACV-WR and ΔA51R<sup>FA51R</sup> titers by ∼10-fold by 24 hpi relative to control treatment. ΔA51R titers, however, were similarly reduced at this time point, suggesting that loss of A51R does not make VACV more susceptible to the antiviral effects of IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Insect model systems provide powerful tools for probing virus-host interactions but have primarily focused on Dipteran hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kingsolver et al., 2013</xref>). Development of new virus-host models in <italic>Lepidoptera</italic> is important for several reasons. First, these insects may encode antiviral mechanisms that are not found in <italic>Diptera</italic>. Second, our current understanding of Lepidopteran antiviral immunity is solely garnered from studies of invertebrate DNA viruses, leaving many questions regarding how these organisms restrict RNA virus infection. Third, understanding how Lepidopterans combat virus infection may lead to more rationale design of virus-based ‘bioinsecticides’ to control pest species.</p><p>Here we have identified an unusual resistance of Lepidopteran cells to VSV and SINV infection, and in so doing, we have further developed LD652 cells as a useful tool for the study of virus-host interplay in an important pest species. Our mRNA-seq-based transcriptome data, combined with RNAi knockdowns studies, allowed us to identify host cell immunity factors that restrict RNA virus replication. We also used an RNAi screen to identify A51R as a poxvirus factor that overcomes Lepidopteran immunity to virus infection. A51R stabilizes a subset of host MTs and promotes RNA virus protein stability, which might be explained by its association with Ub. In addition we have shown that A51R is critical for VACV infection in vertebrate cells and is a virulence factor in mice. Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that A51R promotes both DNA and RNA virus infection by disarming host immunity mechanisms conserved in both vertebrates and invertebrates.</p><p>Despite promiscuous host ranges in both vertebrates and invertebrates, VSV and SINV were completely restricted in LD652 cells. Restriction occurred post-entry, and was overcome either by VACV-co-infection or by blocking host cell transcription. Using RNAi we have identified several host-cell factors that restrict RNA viruses in Lepidopteran cells. These include; (i) homologs of the antiviral RNAi factors AGO2 and Dicer-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kingsolver et al., 2013</xref>), (ii) Relish, a homolog of vertebrate NF-κB family members of antimicrobial transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dushay et al., 1996</xref>), (iii) a homolog of ‘Effete’ an E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Treier et al., 1992</xref>), and finally (iv) several genes encoding Ub.</p><p>A role for AGO2 and Dicer-2 in Lepidopteran restriction to RNA virus replication is consistent with the deep conservation of RNAi-based antiviral immunity in vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kingsolver et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maillard et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, transient expression of the nodamura virus B2 protein, a well-characterized inhibitor of both invertebrate and vertebrate RNAi pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sullivan and Ganem, 2005</xref>), also rescues VSV and SINV replication in multiple Lepidopteran cell lines (DBG and CCM, unpublished data). Thus, Lepidopteran cells provide a new system to investigate the mechanism of antiviral RNAi. These studies will likely complement other RNA virus-invertebrate host models such as the Orsay virus-<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> system, in which RNAi has been shown to restrict RNA virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Felix et al., 2011</xref>). We are currently conducting deep-sequencing of small RNAs to further explore how Lepidopteran RNAi pathways respond to RNA virus infection.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the NF- κB homolog Relish is a component of the IMD pathway which is stimulated by receptor-dependent recognition of bacterial peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kleino and Silverman, 2014</xref>). Pathway stimulation results in phosphorylation and cleavage of Relish, which then translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of antimicrobial factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silverman et al., 2000</xref>). Activation of Relish requires a series of ubiquitination reactions that are dependent on a complex of Ub-conjugating enzymes that includes Effete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paquette et al., 2010</xref>). The finding that homologs of Relish, Effete and Ub all function to restrict VSV and SINV replication in <italic>L. dispar</italic> cells suggests that an IMD-like pathway protects against virus infection in <italic>Lepidoptera</italic>. Our findings are consistent with recent reports that the IMD pathway plays an antiviral role in <italic>Diptera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avadhanula et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa et al., 2009</xref>). However, the mechanism by which viruses are recognized by this pathway is still unknown.</p><p>While it is tempting to speculate that the Ub-encoding transcripts identified here promote viral immunity via Relish activation, Ub has a role in many cellular processes and therefore may be required for a variety of immune functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oudshoorn et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, several natural viral pathogens of <italic>Lepidoptera</italic> encode Ub-like molecules, suggesting that Ub may be required for their life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, viruses may also benefit from inhibiting or reversing ubiquitination. For example, baculovirus-encoded Ub homologs can inhibit Ub chain elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haas et al., 1996</xref>), and several viruses encode potent deubiquitinating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lindner, 2007</xref>). Inhibiting or reversing Ub reactions might block the activation of the IMD pathway and/or may prevent the direct targeting of viral proteins for destruction by the host UPS. Future studies will be aimed at dissecting the roles of these <italic>L. dispar</italic> host factors in restricting virus replication.</p><p>We were surprised by the rescue of VSV and SINV replication in LD652 cells by VACV, despite the fact that VACV replication is abortive in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 1998</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first example of heterologous virus rescue by a vertebrate virus in an invertebrate host. In mammalian cell culture, VACV also enhances VSV replication, but the VACV-encoded IFN response antagonists E3L and B18R are the major determinants of this rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Boeuf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shors et al., 1998</xref>). Since the IFN response appears to be vertebrate-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mukherjee et al., 2014</xref>), it was perhaps not surprising that we failed to observe any effect of <italic>E3L</italic> or <italic>B18R</italic> deletion on VACV-dependent VSV rescue in <italic>L. dispar</italic> cells (data not shown). Instead, we identified the previously uncharacterized VACV gene product A51R as a major determinant of VACV-mediated RNA virus rescue. Additional VACV proteins are likely to contribute to suppression of antiviral activity in <italic>L. dispar</italic> cells, since both VSV and SINV replication were partially rescued by co-infection with the ΔA51R strain. This might explain why newly synthesized, radiolableled VSV N proteins were undetectable in single infections yet at relatively abundant (and similar) levels during co-infection with either VACV-WR or ΔA51R strains, despite the lack of N protein accumulation in the latter co-infection. Thus, the highly restrictive nature of VSV and SINV infections in <italic>L. dispar</italic> cells, in combination with our sensitive LUC-based detection methods, may prove useful in identifying additional novel immunomodulators encoded by VACV and other viruses.</p><p>Although our understanding of how A51R promotes RNA virus replication is incomplete there are several intriguing clues. First, our analysis indicates that A51R-mediated rescue occurs at a step after RNA virus entry. Second, the findings that A51R promotes RNA virus infection in multiple Lepidopteran (but not Dipteran) cells and promotes VACV infection in vertebrate hosts, suggests that A51R overcomes immunity mechanisms that are shared between Lepidopterans and mammals but absent or easily antagonized in Dipteran insects. Third, the suppression of host restriction to RNA virus replication and the association with MTs are both conserved features of A51R homologs from disparate vertebrate poxviruses, suggesting that both immunomodulatory and MT-stabilization functions may be important for poxvirus replication. This idea is supported by the reduced replication of the ΔA51R strain in vertebrate cell culture and in mice. Finally, the association of A51R with Ub and the A51R-dependent VSV protein stabilization we observed, along with the aforementioned roles of the UPS in restricting RNA virus replication, point to a role for A51R in usurping or inhibiting host Ub machinery.</p><p>A51R proteins localize with a subset of host MTs in both invertebrate and vertebrate cells, often forming tubulin aggregates and filament-like structures that are resistant to MT depolymerizing agents. These findings suggest a close interaction of A51R with MT structures, and consistent with this, A51R co-sedimented with MTs in MT-pelleting assays (DBG and CCM unpublished data) which may explain our difficulty in recovering soluble A51R in immunoprecipitation studies. Importantly, these nocodazole-resistant MT structures are absent in ΔA51R infections and can be formed by expression of A51R in the absence of other poxvirus proteins. Furthermore, the truncated VACV-MVA A51R protein fails to form filamentous, nocodazole-resistant MTs. Thus, the presence or absence of functional A51R could explain why the nocodazole-resistant ‘MT pieces’ previously observed in VACV-infected cells were not observed in uninfected or VACV-MVA-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ploubidou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schepis et al., 2006</xref>). Our results suggest that A51R is the elusive MT-stabilizing factor encoded by VACV.</p><p>When we initially observed an inability of VACV-MVA A51R to both rescue RNA virus replication and stabilize MTs, we hypothesized that stabilization of MTs may be the mechanism by which A51R promotes virus replication. Previous studies implicate MTs in promoting VSV and SINV gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qiu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heinrich et al., 2010</xref>), and tubulin has been shown to promote VSV RNA polymerase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moyer et al., 1986</xref>). Furthermore, VSV transport to the cell surface is reported to be MT-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Das et al., 2006</xref>). However, a recent study found no effect of MT depolymerization on VSV and SINV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matthews et al., 2013</xref>). Thus the role of MTs in VSV and SINV replication remains unresolved. Considering the very early restriction of RNA virus gene expression in LD652 cells, it seems unlikely that A51R overcomes host restriction by promoting RNA virus transport on stabilized MTs. Furthermore, our studies with the A51R<sup>R321A</sup> mutant indicate that RNA virus rescue is not fully mediated by MT association or stabilization and therefore must require an additional function encoded by A51R. This finding however, does not rule out the possibility that MT-association is required for A51R immunosuppressive function or stability.</p><p>It is possible that A51R subverts host antiviral responses partly by perturbing MT-dependent transport of host factors and/or organelles. Previously it has been shown that VACV-WR infection causes redistribution of endosomes from dispersed cytosolic locations to large perinuclear clusters, suggesting that outward, MT-dependent endosomal trafficking might be impaired during VACV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schepis et al., 2006</xref>). This endosome clustering phenomenon requires early gene expression and one or more activities lacking in VACV-MVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schepis et al., 2006</xref>). A51R fits these criteria, and thus could be the VACV factor that induces endosome clustering, perhaps to overcome a host mechanism that could otherwise trap viruses in endosomes. It is interesting to note that even at relatively late times post-infection (e.g., 24 hr) we detected punctate immunofluorescence staining patterns for VSV N and SINV E1 virion-associated proteins inside LD652 cells. It is possible that these punctate structures represent virions trapped inside endosomes as both VSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mire et al., 2010</xref>) and SINV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeTulleo and Kirchhausen, 1998</xref>) can utilize endocytic modes of entry. It will be interesting in the future to determine if the expression of wild-type or mutant forms of A51R alter endosomal distribution in <italic>L. dispar</italic> cells and whether endosomal redistribution correlates with virus replication. Unfortunately, we have not yet found suitable reagents for monitoring endosome distributions in <italic>L. dispar</italic>.</p><p>Alteration of MT-dependent trafficking by A51R may help explain why both VACV-MVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meiser et al., 2003</xref>) and ΔA51R (this study) strains release 2-3-times more EEV particles than does VACV-WR. This phenomenon is particularly striking given the overall 10-fold lower total (intracellular + extracellular) virus titers of the ΔA51R strain. The release of EEV is MT-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ploubidou et al., 2000</xref>), and EEV is known to elicit neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Thus it is possible that A51R attenuates virion transport along MTs, and subsequent EEV release, in order to allow the virus to escape activation of host immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schepis et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the Dryvax strain of VACV, which is used for smallpox vaccination, encodes a fragmented <italic>A51R</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2011</xref>). These observations, along with the attenuated virulence of ΔA51R strain in vivo, raise the intriguing possibility that loss of A51R function contributes to the induction of poxvirus immunity.</p><p>It is also possible that MT structures might serve as a scaffold to allow A51R to interact with and sequester host factors, such as Ub. Although we do not yet know specifically how A51R promotes virus protein stability, it is possible that A51R-dependent sequestration of Ub (or removal of Ub from viral proteins) acts to overcome a Ub-dependent mechanism that either activates host antiviral protein effectors or directly targets nascent viral proteins for destruction. This latter hypothesis predicts that Lepidopterans cells might have a mechanism to target protein synthesis that is coupled to cytoplasmic transcription. Importantly, inhibition of the UPS in <italic>L. dispar</italic> cells only enhanced LUC activity when cells were infected with LUC-encoding viruses and not when cells were simply transfected with a LUC expression plasmid. Given that VACV, VSV and SINV are all cytoplasmically-replicating viruses and that plasmid-based transcription of <italic>luc</italic> mRNA would occur in the nucleus, this hypothesis is not unreasonable. Whether other potential A51R interactors identified here such as myosin II essential light chain or RPS15 play a role in A51R rescue function is currently unknown.</p><p>Further studies of A51R function will not only help us to understand eukaryotic antiviral immunity but may also provide new strategies to overcome the antiviral responses of Lepidopteran pests, leading to more effective biocontrol agents. Indeed, the unexpected uncoupling of RNA virus restriction by A51R has provided an exciting new arena to explore virus-host interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>X-gal, nocodazole, vincristine, PYR-41, and MG132 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo) and dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, Rollie Clem, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors of this study make a surprising discovery that VACV infection of a Lepidopteran cell line can rescue infection with two RNA viruses (VSV and SINV). The authors identify a previously uncharacterized VACV gene product A51R as being responsible for the rescue of RNA viral infection. The mechanism of A51R effect is complex, as it associates with such polyfunctional targets as microtubules and ubiquitin. A51R is shown to promote viral protein stability, possibly by interfering with Ub-mediated degradation. VACV lacking functional A51R is attenuated and this may be an important feature of the vaccine starin of the virus, which has a truncation of A51R.</p><p>The manuscript has several strengths: it develops a new experimental system that will benefit many investigators: the LD652 cell line will likely become a system of choice to investigate antiviral immunity in Lepidoptera. The authors also identify multiple targets for A51R, which will be useful for future detailed characterizations of its mechanisms of action, which likely to be very complex.</p><p>Overall the manuscript reports novel insights into the nature of RNA virus restriction in lepidopteran cells. The findings are an important contribution to our knowledge of anti-viral responses in these organisms. The mechanism(s) by which A51R relieves the restriction of VSV and SINV is still vague, but there are important clues that can be followed in future work.</p><p>From a broader biological perspective, the findings suggest that poxvirus infections may generally enable co-infections with RNA viruses, perhaps in species outside of Lepidoptera order of insects. Because VACV is unlikely to benefit from a concomitant RNA virus infection, one possibility is that A51R evolved to perform function(s) that have nothing to do with RNA viruses, but rather RNA viruses evolved to exploit the altered host cells (due to VACV infection) to establish a productive infection. From this perspective, it would be very informative to examine the consequence of VACV–VSV co-infection in mice, a prediction being that this co-infection will have a strong synergy (increased virulence or viral load).</p><p>Major points of concern:</p><p>1) The authors report that VSV and SINV do not replicate in Ld652 cells, however co-infection with vaccinia allowed VSV and SINV to replicate. The block appears to be at a post-entry step, because immunostaining revealed the presence of viral particles in punctate staining pattern inside cells at 24 hpi. I believe the authors have missed an important clue: in the case of SINV, their antibody was against the E1 protein, an envelope protein of the virus. The observation of E1 staining in a punctate pattern inside the cell at 24 hpi indicates that the virus has been taken up by endocytosis but is trapped in endosomes. This is the only way to explain why the E1 protein, a transmembrane protein, is present inside the cells. Thus, A51R may act at least in part by promoting release of these viruses from endosomes. This could potentially involve microtubule trafficking and/or ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and could perhaps bring increased clarity to their overall findings. The authors need to re-examine their findings in light of this observation.</p><p>2) The authors conclude that A51R may act in part by promoting the stability of viral proteins, but the evidence here is not convincing. After a 2 hr pulse with labeled methionine, the levels of labeled VSV N protein were similar in cells infected with either wt vaccinia or a mutant lacking A51R, but immunoblotting indicated that the overall levels of N were substantially lower in the mutant-infected cells. However this could be due to the 100-fold decreased replication of VSV in cells infected with A51R mutant vs wt vaccinia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In order to conclude that A51R affects the stability of N, it would be necessary to do a proper pulse-chase experiment to properly determine the half life of N in cells infected with wt vs A51R mutant vaccinia (and preferably also in cells transfected with A51R in the absence of other viral genes).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02910.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors report that VSV and SINV do not replicate in Ld652 cells, however co-infection with vaccinia allowed VSV and SINV to replicate.

The authors need to re-examine their findings in light of this observation</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful comment. It is indeed possible that part of the restriction to both VSV and SINV may be due to a poor ability of these viruses to escape from endosomes upon entry. While this is an excellent point that may highlight another layer of Lepidopteran cell restriction to infection, we feel that clearly defining a role for endosome trapping in RNA virus restriction in this new system is beyond the scope of this initial report. Furthermore, it is clear that at least some virus particles escape the endosome in the absence of A51R because 1) some RNA transcription and LUC reporter gene expression can be detected during single VSV-LUC/SINV-LUC infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>), and 2) knockdown of <italic>L. dispar</italic> RNAi factors such as AGO2/Dicer-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which would target intracellular viral transcripts during replication, partially relieve the restriction of VSV/SINV in LD652 cells.</p><p>Because we believe that endosome trapping may be important for future studies, we did attempt initial experiments to investigate co-localization of VSV/SINV markers with endosomes. Given the lack of validated antibodies to <italic>L. dispar</italic> endosome proteins, we screened several polyclonal antibodies raised against endosome marker proteins (e.g., rabenosyn-5, early endosome antigen 1 etc) for cross reactivity with homologs in LD652 cells. Unfortunately we were unable to observe a clear, punctate staining pattern with any of these antibodies indicative of endosome staining. We also tried labeling all membranous vesicles in LD652 cells with a fluorescent lipohilic dye (FM<sup>™</sup> 4-64FX). However, in our hands, we found that this fluorescent dye was lost during our fixation/immunostaining procedure for viral antigens, despite trying various fixatives and permeabilization techniques. Thus, the inability of our antibodies and FM<sup>™</sup> 4-64FX dye to mark <italic>L. dispar</italic> endosomes has made it clear to us that we will be unable to address the endosome question until we find suitable reagents for <italic>L. dispar</italic>.</p><p>We have included a paragraph in the Discussion to discuss the possibility that VSV/SINV virions become trapped in endosomes in LD652 cells. We have also discussed the possibility that A51R might be involved in the known perturbation of endosomal trafficking during VACV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schepis et al., 2006</xref>) and that future studies should investigate if A51R-mediated perturbation of MT-dependent endosomal trafficking may affect VSV/SINV replication in <italic>L. dispar</italic> cells.</p><p><italic>2) The authors conclude that A51R may act in part by promoting the stability of viral proteins, but the evidence here is not convincing. After a 2 hr pulse with labeled methionine, the levels of labeled VSV N protein were similar in cells infected with either wt vaccinia or a mutant lacking A51R, but immunoblotting indicated that the overall levels of N were substantially lower in the mutant-infected cells. However this could be due to the 100-fold decreased replication of VSV in cells infected with A51R mutant versus wt vaccinia (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>). In order to conclude that A51R affects the stability of N, it would be necessary to do a proper pulse-chase experiment to properly determine the half life of N in cells infected with wt versus A51R mutant vaccinia (and preferably also in cells transfected with A51R in the absence of other viral genes)</italic>.</p><p>We have included data from pulse-chase experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C</xref>) showing that VSV N protein stability is reduced during co-infection with the ΔA51R strain compared to VACV-WR. We have also indicated in the text that regression analyses of these pulse-chase experiments suggest that there is indeed a reduced half-life of VSV-N during co-infection with the ΔA51R strain (∼1.8 hr) when compared to co-infection with VACV-WR (∼5.3 hr). We made further attempts to conduct pulse-chase experiments of VSV-N in LD652 cells transfected with either Flag-GFP (as a control) or Flag-A51R vectors but found (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) that radiolabeled VSV N signals were too low in the control treatments to calculate half-lives to compare to the Flag-A51R treatments. Thus, using this approach we were unable to distinguish defects in VSV protein translation rates vs protein stability. Therefore, we opted to only include the pulse-chase data obtained from co-infection experiments. The “residual” VSV rescue afforded by the ΔA51R co-infection (presumably due to other factors encoded by VACV) allows one to actually detect radiolabeled VSV N protein in the absence of A51R and thus one can directly compare half-lives in these conditions to the VACV-WR co-infections.</p></body></sub-article></article>
