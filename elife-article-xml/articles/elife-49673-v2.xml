Signaling defects caused by dysregulation of its Ntrk2 (TrkB) kinase (TrkB.FL) and truncated receptors (TrkB.T1) have been linked to the pathophysiology of several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. We found that upregulation of Rbfox1, an RNA binding protein associated with intellectual disability, epilepsy and autism, increases selectively hippocampal TrkB.T1 isoform expression. Physiologically, increased Rbfox1 impairs BDNF-dependent LTP which can be rescued by genetically restoring TrkB.T1 levels. RNA-seq analysis of hippocampi with upregulation of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> in conjunction with the specific increase of TrkB.T1 isoform expression also shows that the genes affected by Rbfox1 gain of function are surprisingly different from those influenced by <italic>Rbfox1</italic> deletion. These findings not only identify TrkB as a major target of Rbfox1 pathophysiology but also suggest that gain or loss of function of Rbfox1 regulate different genetic landscapes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA regulation</kwd><kwd>neurotrophins</kwd><kwd>RbFox</kwd><kwd>TrkB</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003645</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tessarollo</surname><given-names>Lino</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RbFox1 upregulation modulates the expression of hundreds of genes but only dysregulation of the TrkB.T1 receptor isoform expression causes BDNF-dependent LTP impairments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Learning and memory depend on the establishment, maintenance, strengthening or regulated elimination of synapses between neurons. These processes are mediated by neuronal activity and the activity-dependent secretion of factors that act at synapses. BDNF is one of the most potent mediators of synaptic plasticity as it is secreted during Long Term Potentiation (LTP) induction and is functionally essential for acute signaling cascades leading to LTP [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park and Poo (2013)</xref>. As a consequence, BDNF has a crucial role in cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bambah-Mukku et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panja et al., 2014</xref>). Critical insights into BDNF activities in humans have been provided by the identification of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the <italic>BDNF</italic> gene that converts a valine to methionine at codon 66 (Val66Me) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egan et al., 2003</xref>). This polymorphism impairs BDNF trafficking and synaptic localization, causes a reduction in activity-dependent BDNF secretion and is associated with alterations in brain structure and function leading to several neurological and psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greenberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). Genetic or pharmacological manipulations of the levels or activity of the BDNF receptor Ntrk2 (TrkB) also result in impaired LTP and reduced synapse numbers causing deficits in the formation and consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Minichiello, 2009</xref>). TrkB receptor signaling depends on the precise pattern of expression of the different isoforms generated by the <italic>Ntrk2</italic> gene, including the full-length tyrosine kinase receptor (TrkB.FL) and truncated receptors lacking the kinase domain (TrkB.T1). Hypomorphic expression of the TrkB.FL causes hyperphagia-induced obesity due to reduced hypothalamic BDNF signaling, while genetic deletion of TrkB.T1 leads to increased anxiety related behavior associated with structural alterations in neurites of the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carim-Todd et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, up-regulation of TrkB.T1 levels in brains of a mouse model with a Chromosome 16 trisomia (Ts16) leads to an increased sensitivity of hippocampal neurons to BDNF deprivation due to a block in TrkB.FL functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorsey et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, alterations in <italic>NTRK2</italic> isoforms receptor levels have also been associated with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dwivedi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ernst et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferrer et al., 1999</xref>). Because loss and gain of function experiments have stressed the importance of proper TrkB.T1 expression regulation for normal brain development and function, we elected to investigate this mechanism. We took advantage of the observation that the Ts16 mouse model has a TrkB.T1 upregulation, despite having an intact <italic>Ntrk2</italic> locus on Chromosome 13, to identify genes on Chromosome 16 responsible for the dysregulation of TrkB isoforms expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorsey et al., 2006</xref>). We identified Rbfox1 as an RNA binding protein that regulates TrkB.T1 receptor levels. Rbfox1 is expressed only in neurons, heart and skeletal muscle, sites with notable TrkB expression. Moreover, <italic>RBFOX1</italic> dysregulation has been associated with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and Parkinson disease, pathologies that have been associated with alterations in BDNF signaling as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conboy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). We found that Rbfox1 upregulation impairs hippocampal BDNF-dependent LTP by specifically increasing TrkB.T1 receptor levels. Although Rbfox1 can regulate the splicing and abundance of many gene isoforms in the nervous system, we show that genetic reduction of the TrkB.T1 isoform in animals with up-regulated Rbfox1 is sufficient to restore hippocampal BDNF<italic>-</italic>dependent LTP, suggesting that <italic>Ntrk2</italic> is a major target of Rbfox1 pathological dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fogel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gehman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Underwood et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, RNA-seq analysis of hippocampi with Rbfox1 upregulation validates the abnormal TrkB.T1 isoform levels, and also shows that the genes affected by increased Rbfox1 levels are different than those changed by its loss of function, thus suggesting that Rbfox1 has broader genetic targets than previously established.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We have previously reported that the trisomic TS16 mouse model, which has an extra copy of Chromosome (Chr) 16, has a neuronal upregulation of the TrkB.T1 receptor isoform level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorsey et al., 2006</xref>). Since, the <italic>Ntrk2</italic> gene is located in Chr 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tessarollo et al., 1993</xref>), these data suggested that one or multiple genes present in Chr16 are responsible for this phenotype. A comparison between the genes isolated from brain immunoprecipitation of the spliceosome and bio-informatics analysis of the Ts16 unique region identified two RNA binding proteins, Tra2b (Sfrs10) and Rbfox1 (A2bp1), as potential candidates of TrkB.T1 expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Tra2b is a ubiquitously expressed splicing factor that contributes to alternative splicing processes in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elliott et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we first tested whether <italic>Tra2b</italic> overexpression in neurons can change TrkB isoforms expression levels. However, infection of primary hippocampal neurons with a <italic>Tra2b</italic>-expressing lentivirus did not cause any change in TrkB isoforms expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we tested the RNA binding protein Rbfox1 that, compared to Tra2b, has a more restricted and overlapping pattern of expression with TrkB in organs such as brain, heart and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stoilov et al., 2002</xref>). Western blot analysis of primary hippocampal neurons transfected with a lentiviral vector expressing <italic>Rbfox1</italic> showed increased truncated TrkB receptor levels associated with Rbfox1 overexpression while the TrkB.FL isoform was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Although TrkB.T1 is the dominant truncated TrkB isoform in mouse brain, the potential presence of other truncated isoforms prompted us to test the identity of the upregulated truncated isoform. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (right panel) western blot analysis with an antibody recognizing the specific 11 amino acid intracellular domain of TrkB.T1 confirmed that TrkB.T1 is the isoform upregulated by Rbfox1. Moreover, QPCR analysis also revealed an increased level of TrkB.T1-specific mRNA while TrkB.FL was unchanged, paralleling the results from the western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49673.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Rbfox1</italic> upregulation increases truncated TrkB.</title><p>T1 receptor levels in vitro and in vivo.

By gene targeting of the <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic> locus we introduced one copy of the <italic>Rbfox1</italic> cDNA preceded by the CAG promoter to drive expression (R26-Fox1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sakai and Miyazaki, 1997</xref>). A loxP-flanked stop cassette was inserted between the CAG promoter and the <italic>Rbfox1</italic> c-DNA to allow for conditional activation of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Primary hippocampal neurons from heterozygous <italic>Rbfox1</italic> transgenic mice (R26-Fox1) were isolated and transduced with a <italic>Cre</italic>-recombinase-expressing adenovirus (Ad-Cre) to delete the stop cassette and induce <italic>Rbfox1</italic> expression. Compared to control neurons infected with the Ad-Cre, R26-Fox1 neurons showed increased Rbfox1 expression and subsequent TrkB.T1 upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data suggest that this is an efficient model to up-regulate Rbfox1 and further validated our initial observation that lentiviral overexpression of Rbfox1 upregulates TrkB.T1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested whether Rbfox1 upregulation can regulate TrkB.T1 expression in vivo by crossing the R26-Fox1 model with the <italic>Nes-cre</italic> (N-cre) mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tronche et al., 1999</xref>). First we tested <italic>Nes-cre</italic> expression in the hippocampus by crossing it with a <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor-LacZ</italic> (R26-LacZ) reporter mouse. β-Galactosidase staining (X-Gal) of the hippocampal area showed LacZ activity in granule cells of dentate gyrus (DG) and pyramidal cells of CA1 and CA3 regions, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schultz et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Nes-Cre</italic> (N-cre) crossing with the R26-Fox1 transgenic mouse (N-cre;Fox1) showed that hippocampal Rbfox1 expression is similar between N-cre and N-cre;Fox1 mice, and Rbfox1 expression does not co-localize with the glial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). These data demonstrate the relevance of this model to study Rbfox1 neuronal up-regulation in vivo. N-cre;Fox1 animals showed a modest 25% increase of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> mRNA level in the hippocampus (data not shown). At the protein level, similar to what observed in vitro, N-cre;Fox1 hippocampi had a significant 35% increase in TrkB.T1 associated with about 33% Rbfox1 protein upregulation, while TrkB.FL level was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). mRNA analysis also showed that TrkB.T1, but not TrkB.FL was significantly increased as a consequence of Rbfox1 upregulation (data not shown). Importantly, this model leads to a relatively modest up-regulation of Rbfox1 expression suggesting its validity to study the physiological consequences of Rbfox1 dysregulation.</p><p>To further test the specificity of this phenotype, we also investigated the protein levels of Ntrk3 (TrkC), another <italic>Ntrk</italic> family member also expressed in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tessarollo et al., 1993</xref>), in the same N-cre;Fox1 hippocampi and found that the levels of TrkC isoform receptors were unaffected by in vivo Rbfox1 upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Since Rbfox1 upregulation increases TrkB.T1 expression in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) we also tested whether lower levels of Rbfox1 cause a reduction of TrkB.T1 expression.

However, there was no change in TrkB.T1 or TrkB.FL receptor isoforms expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether other <italic>Rbfox</italic> family members could compensate for the partial loss of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>. Hippocampal lysates from <italic>Rbfox1</italic> heterozygous animals showed a significant 35% upregulation of Rbfox2 whereas Rbfox3 expression was unchanged [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vuong et al., 2018</xref>).

Due to the fact that Rbfox1 affects several genes regulating synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gehman et al., 2011</xref>) we focused on BDNF-induced long term potentiation (LTP) at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 neuron synapses to dissect the specific effect on LTP caused by alterations in BDNF/TrkB signaling. We applied extracellular BDNF (20 ng/ml) to hippocampal slices from control mice for 20 min while the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were elicited at 20 s intervals. As previously reported, BDNF induced a strong, gradual increase in the fEPSP in control N-cre (Ctrl) hippocampi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kang and Schuman, 1995</xref>). Surprisingly, N-cre;Fox1 animals had a blunted induction of LTP in response to BDNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and at 50 min this response was only about 30% of Ctrl (Ctrl 218.14 ± 22.42% vs. N-cre;Fox1 72.95 ± 12.82%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). To test whether the BDNF-induced LTP deficit in the mutant animals was caused by the augmented TrkB.T1 expression, we introduced a TrkB.T1 KO allele in N-cre;Fox1 (N-cre;Fox1;T1+/-) mouse model to reduce its levels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, this strategy led to a significant, although partial rescue of the BDNF-induced LTP deficit caused by Rbfox1 upregulation. Interestingly, analysis of BDNF-induced LTP in TrkB.T1 heterozygous animals (T1+/-) was similar to that of controls, suggesting that TrkB.T1 is not haploinsufficient and its levels influence BDNF-induced LTP only in the situation of upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). To further test whether TrkB.T1 levels are most critical in neurons, where Rbfox1 is expressed, we introduced a conditional TrkB.T1-loxP allele into the N-cre;Fox1 model (N-cre;Fox1;T1-Flx). This strategy allows for the simultaneous induction of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> activation, which causes TrkB.T1 upregulation, and deletion of one copy of TrkB.T1 in the same neurons where <italic>Nes-cre</italic> is active. Importantly, this strategy also led to a partial rescue of BDNF-induced LTP over time, which became significant at 50 min (187.97 ± 49.26%) strongly suggesting that the TrkB.T1 up-regulation in neurons caused by Rbfox1 is causing the impairment in BDNF<italic>-</italic>induced LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). Analysis of the Shaffer collateral-CA1 excitability (Input/Output relationship <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) and presynaptic function with paired pulse stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>) showed no differences between the controls and mutant animals suggesting that hippocampal circuitries overall are not affected by the genetic manipulations. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Rbfox1 upregulation leads to a deficit in the BDNF-induced LTP caused, at least in part, by an increase in TrkB.T1 receptor expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49673.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Rbfox1 overexpressing mice have impaired BDNF-induced LTP that is rescued by conditional removal of one TrkB.</title><p>T1 receptor allele.

Rbfox1 is an RBP that regulates the RNA metabolism of hundreds of genes expressed in neurons; thus, a major challenge has been to identify those genes that are in a nodal position downstream of Rbfox1 in transducing its normal and pathological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gehman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vuong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weyn-Vanhentenryck et al., 2014</xref>). So far, the recognized experimental paradigms to identify and study genes targeted by Rbfox1 have been by downregulation or knockout experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gehman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Here we show that <italic>Rbfox1</italic> upregulation influences the neuronal expression level of the BDNF receptor TrkB.T1, a change not present in <italic>Rbfox1</italic> deletion experiments, and this regulation has significant physiological consequences. Importantly, whole transcriptome RNA-seq analysis of hippocampi from mice with <italic>Rbfox1</italic> upregulation revealed a completely different set of differentially expressed gene-isoforms when compared to those identified by <italic>Rbfox1</italic> knock-out experiments. Although there are limitations associated with comparing data sets from different studies our conclusions are supported by the parallel analysis of raw data from all studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vuong et al., 2018</xref>) using uniform parameters and filtering, and similar findings from other independent models of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> loss of function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gehman et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that upregulation or downregulation of a specific RBP can have different genetic outcomes and may be relevant to understanding how to approach pathologies caused by RBP dysregulation. A notable example is provided by <italic>Tra2b</italic> (<italic>Sfrs10</italic>), an RBP ubiquitously expressed but whose differences in cellular concentrations is believed to lead to tissue-specific pattern of splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elliott et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a disease caused by deletion of the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene, expression of the adjacent full-length <italic>SMN2</italic> gene, that includes exon7, can ameliorate disease in some patients. Tra2b overexpression in transfected cells appears to increase splicing of <italic>SMN2</italic> exon seven promoting the production of a full-length SMN2, thus suggesting that this strategy could ameliorate SMA disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hofmann et al., 2000</xref>). However, <italic>Tra2b</italic> deletion in mice (<italic>Sfrs10</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) does not influence splicing of <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mende et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Upregulation of Rbfox1 causes increased expression of TrkB.T1 which in turn blunts BDNF-induced LTP. RNA-seq analysis, besides validating TrkB.T1 up-regulation, identified more than five hundred differentially expressed gene-isoforms in the hippocampus of N-cre;Fox1 animals, including many involved in important neuronal functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, decreasing only TrkB.T1 levels in the same cells where Rbfox1 is up-regulated, is sufficient to restore BDNF-induced LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This is important because BDNF-induced LTP is a potent modulator of brain synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). Although alterations in BDNF signaling caused by disruptions in its expression or changes in levels of <italic>Ntrk2</italic> receptor isoforms have been associated with neurodegeneration, psychiatric disorders, intellectual disabilities and autism, most studies have focused on the mechanisms regulating <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression and not its receptor TrkB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). For example, it has been shown that at the transcription level <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression is regulated by epigenetic factors and via the use of multiple promoters. Different transcription factors can bind to these promoters to generate transcripts containing the unique BDNF protein encoding exon. In addition, the neuronal spatially and temporally regulated processing of the pro-BDNF peptide provides another level at which BDNF function can be modulated (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hing et al. (2018)</xref>). The significance of this second regulatory mechanism has been validated by the Val66Met <italic>BDNF</italic> polymorphism in humans which affects the processing and trafficking of BDNF and causes phenotypes including profound impairments in synaptic and cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Soliman et al., 2010</xref>). However, almost nothing is known about the mechanisms regulating <italic>Ntrk2</italic> expression or the mechanisms leading to its pathological dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kemppainen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wong et al., 2012</xref>). Contrary to the <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene that has multiple promoters activated by different stimuli, the <italic>Ntrk2</italic> locus has only one promoter. The <italic>NTRK2</italic> gene spans over 350 Kb of DNA sequence and allows for the generation, by alternative splicing of at least 36 potential transcripts from 24 exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luberg et al., 2010</xref>). However, gene targeting experiments have shown that two isoforms, namely TrkB.FL and TrkB.T1, are the most highly expressed and phenotypically important during development [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fulgenzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klein et al., 1993</xref>). To date, no RBPs have been shown to regulate <italic>Ntrk2</italic> splicing or mRNA transcripts levels. Thus, <italic>Rbfox1</italic> is the first gene shown to regulate <italic>Ntrk2</italic> expression at the mRNA level. Its direct binding to <italic>Ntrk2</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and its function in promoting TrkB.T1 RNA stability, rather than splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) are strongly supported by: 1) the in vivo and in vitro Rbfox1 overexpression leading to up-regulation of only TrkB.T1 and no changes in TrkB.FL; 2) the confirmation of the change in expression of only TrkB.T1 by the RNA-seq analysis in N-cre-Fox1 mouse hippocampus; 3) the analysis of new nascent RNA showing that TrkB.T1, but not TrkB.FL RNA is more stable upon <italic>Rbfox1</italic> overexpression. Nevertheless, the details of this newly identified molecular mechanism by which RbFox1 expression influences TrkB.T1 mRNA levels needs to be further elucidated since it appears to be independent of an action on the 3’UTR region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, this mechanism does not appear to be limited to TrkB.T1 since it has also been reported that in the hippocampus of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> knock-out mice some genes lacking iCLIP clusters or GCAUG binding elements in the 3’UTR region can still be differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vuong et al., 2018</xref>) and Rbfox1 can increase the mRNA concentration of genes that lack identified 3’UTR miRNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While upregulation of Rbfox1 changes TrkB.T1 expression, a reduction in its level does not have an effect. The upregulation of Rbfox2 supports a compensatory mechanism by this family member since both genes are expressed in neurons and like all Rbfox proteins they bind to the same (U)GCAUG motif. However, the fact that only overexpression of Rbfox2, but not Rbfox3, can upregulate TrkB.T1 in primary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>) suggest that different, yet unknown binding partners might be part of this mechanism. Mass spectrometry analysis of Rbfox protein complexes should help identifying which molecular players can differentiate Rbfox protein functions.</p><p>Upregulation of Rbfox1 has an inhibitory function on BDNF-induced synaptic plasticity most likely by reducing the TrkB kinase signaling through an increase of TrkB.T1 expression. This is in line with the observation that nervous system–specific deletion of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> results in heightened susceptibility to spontaneous and kainic acid–induced seizures which suggest increased neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gehman et al., 2011</xref>). The presence of such regulatory mechanisms on TrkB function is important considering the increased evidence supporting a key role for TrkB activation in epileptogenesis caused by status epilepticus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McNamara and Scharfman, 2012</xref>). Thus, having TrkB activity under the control of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>, which also regulates the splicing of several synaptic function genes including ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, structural proteins of the synapse and vesicle fusion proteins, suggests a unifying biological system to regulate neuronal function and excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gehman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McNamara and Scharfman, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In humans, reduced <italic>RBFOX1</italic> expression has been associated with autism, epilepsy and heart disease although the mechanistic relationship between <italic>RBFOX1</italic> downregulation and these disorders is still unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). Impaired BDNF signaling has also been associated with these diseases raising the interesting possibility that <italic>RBFOX1</italic> regulation of the expression of TrkB receptors might, at least in part, be part of the pathogenetic mechanism. Increasing or decreasing TrkB.T1-receptor levels indeed affects BDNF/TrkB signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although, we do not see changes in TrkB.T1 expression in <italic>Rbfox1</italic> heterozygous mice, it is conceivable that the compensatory mechanisms between mice and humans are different. For example, <italic>Nedd4-2</italic> heterozygous mice have minimal developmental abnormalities such as hyperactivity, increased basal synaptic transmission and enhanced sensitivity to inflammatory pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yanpallewar et al., 2016</xref>). However, human heterozygous missense mutations cause major malformations including periventricular nodular heterotopia leading to hypotonia, intellectual disability, seizures, syndactyly and cleft palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broix et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kato et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, <italic>Ntrk2</italic> heterozygous mice do not show major abnormalities while loss of one <italic>NTRK2</italic> (TrkB) allele in human leads to hyperphagic obesity and severe impairment in memory, learning and nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klein et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeo et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Most epidemiological studies associate gene loss of function caused by deletions or point mutations with disease. Indeed, even for <italic>RBFOX1</italic> most studies have looked at <italic>RBFOX1</italic> downregulation. However, our findings suggest the need to investigate causal relationship between <italic>RBFOX1</italic> gain of function to specific pathologies. For example, it has been reported that neurons derived from iPSCs of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have elevated <italic>RBFOX1</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, there is already abundant data showing a role for BDNF/TrkB signaling in the etiology of Parkinson's disease, at least from in vivo animal models. For example, ablation of the <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene impairs the survival and/or maturation of substantia nigra (SN) dopamine (DA) neurons during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baquet et al., 2005</xref>); loss of one copy of <italic>Ntrk2</italic> leads to an age-dependent increase in the levels of α-synuclein in the SN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">von Bohlen und Halbach et al., 2005</xref>), and in a mouse model with a chronic reduction in TrkB signaling (~30% of WT) there is an age-dependent and selective degeneration of SN DA neurons and increased vulnerability of these neurons to neurotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baydyuk and Xu, 2014</xref>). Because it has also been reported that neurons of PD patients have an increase in TrkB.T1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fenner et al., 2014</xref>), it will be of interest to test whether sporadic PD patients have <italic>RBFOX1</italic> upregulation and, if that is the case, an association with increased TrkB.T1 receptor levels. In another study, it has been reported that in the human population there is an intronic SNP affecting an enhancer in the fourth intron of <italic>RBFOX1</italic> that leads to a substantial increase in expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter et al., 2017</xref>). While this SNP has been identified in the context of a study evaluating how inherited polymorphisms carried in the germline affect the somatic evolution of a tumor, it will be important to study whether this SNP has other effects on cognitive brain functions and leads to an increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders where TrkB.T1 upregulation has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dwivedi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ernst et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karege et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karege et al., 2005b</xref>). Most importantly, the change in TrkB.T1 level caused by Rbfox1 upregulation is not dramatic, but it is occurring at the synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) which in turn can compromise critical BDNF functions on synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Examples where small changes in the expression of specific genes are very detrimental and relevant to human pathology have already been described. For instance, gain of function mutations that facilitate or enhance the activation of protein kinase Cγ (PKC) by only approximately 10% have been associated with Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfonso et al., 2016</xref>).

After 5 hr, the media was replaced with normal media (without EU) for 9 hr (chase). Neurons were lysed at time 0 hr (right after 5 hr EU pulse) and at time 9 hr (after 9 hr of EU free media) and the RNA isolated using Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Cat.no 74104) according to manufacturer’s instruction. Biotin azide was then chemically bound to the EU containing RNA molecules and streptavidin magnetic beads were used to capture the newly synthesized pool of RNA. cDNA was generated by using SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (11754–050, ThermoFisher Scientific).</p><p>Real time PCR was performed using BioRad iTaq Universal SYBR-green Supermix (Cat.No. 172–5120) in a MX3000P (Agilent Technologies) apparatus with the following program: 95°C for 3 min; 95°C 10 s, 60°C 20 s for 40 cycles; 95°C 1 min and down to 55°C (gradient of 1°C) for 41 cycles (melting curve step).

RNA integrity numbers (RIN) were observed to be greater than nine for all samples. Libraries were constructed from hippocampal total RNA using Illumina’s TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Kit (RS-122–2201). Three biological replicates were used for each of the two experimental groups: Ctrl mice (<italic>Nes-Cre</italic>) and N-cre-Fox1 mice (<italic>Nes-Cre;R26-Rbfox1</italic><sup>flox/+</sup>) of about 3 months of age and in the C57BL/6 background. Deep-sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 in paired-end mode with a read length of 150 base-pairs.</p><p>The sequencing quality of the 99–153 million reads per sample was evaluated using FastQC (version 0.11.5), Preseq (version 2.0.3), Picard tools (version 1.119) and RSeQC (version 2.6.4). Reads were trimmed using Cutadapt (1.18) to remove adapter sequences, prior to mapping to the mm10 mouse reference genome using STAR (version 2.5.2b) in two-pass mode. Gene and transcript expression levels were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.0) with gencode’s M16 mouse annotation. EBSeq (version 1.22.1) was used to test for differential isoform expression between experimental conditions. Group-based TPM filtering was applied to remove lowly expressed transcripts. Significant differentially expressed isoforms were identified with a false-discovery rate ≤0.05. The R package clusterProfiler (version 3.10.1) was used for gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the significant differential expressed gene-isoforms identified by EBSeq. Significant over-represented biological process GO terms were identified with a q-value less than 0.05. The RNA-seq data generated for this study have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE136253.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>iCLIP analysis</title><p>CLIP sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Damianov et al., 2016</xref>) (GSE76475) was downloaded from SRA using sratoolkit (version 2.9.2).

Sequencing quality was assessed using FastQC (version 0.11.5), Preseq (version 2.0.3), Picard tools (version 1.119), and deeptools (version 2.5.0.1). Illumina sequencing adapters were trimmed from reads using cutadapt (version 1.14). Reads were aligned to the mouse genome version mm10 using BWA (version 0.7.15). Once the quality of the data was ensured, tracks suitable for viewing in IGV were downloaded from GEO (GSM1835189, GSM1835195). Bedops (version 2.4.30) and crossmap (version 0.2.7) were used to lift-over genomic coordinates from mm9 to mm10.

Brains were extracted from the skull within 1 min, sectioned at 300 µm (Leica VT1200 vibratome) and appropriately incubated before recording (for all solutions and the complete procedure see section 2.1 on Materials and 3.1 Methods in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ting et al., 2014</xref>). For the electrophysiological recording, the slice was placed in a recording chamber under microscope (Zeiss Axioskop 2fs) and perfused with ACSF (2 ml/min; 28 C). A Teflon-coated concentric platinum–iridium electrode (FHC, ME USA) was placed in the stratum radiatum in the CA1 area of the dorsal HC, 300–400 µm from the recording electrode. Borosilicate glass recording electrodes were pulled (Sutter Instruments P90), ACSF filled to get 4–7 MΩ resistance, and placed in the apical dendritic region of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in CA1 by activation of the Schaffer collaterals. An input-output curve was initially obtained by gradually increasing the stimulus intensity until the fEPSP reached a plateau. After which the stimulus was reduced to obtain an fEPSP that was 50% of the maximum level. Baseline recording was obtained by stimulating the slice every 20 s for approximately 45 min. Once the baseline was stabilized to obtain LTP, BDNF infusion was initiated and continued for 20 min (20 ng/ml; 2 ml/min). Recording was continued for 50 min. Field potential was recorded (Multiclamp 700b; Axon Instruments), digitized (10 kHz Digidata 1324), low-pass filtered (3 kHz, eight-pole Bessel), and stored (Clampex 9.2; Axon Instruments). Signals were analyzed off line (Clampfit 9.2; Axon Instruments), and the size of the fEPSP was evaluated by measuring the initial slope of the signal expressed as percentage of the variation from the baseline value (average of 5 min before the BDNF infusion). n = indicates the number of hippocampal slices analyzed (from ≥3 mice).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Clive Bramham (Reviewer #1). Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study focuses upon the regulation of a truncated TrkB species, TrkB.T1, by the RNA binding protein RbFox1. There was agreement among the three reviewers that the regulation of TrkB.T1 by RbFox1 is of considerable interest. However, a number of reservations were raised. The major issues are the need for more evidence for the role of truncated TrkB in BDNF-dependent LTP; a resolution of how the levels of RbFox1 impact upon TrkB.T1 expression; and whether there is a non-neuronal contribution of Rbfox1. These are valid concerns that will require more experimentation in order to validate the major conclusions. Specific comments by the reviewers follow this letter. Based upon the common concerns and recommendations from the referees, we have therefore decided to decline the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study provides important insights into the mechanism and functional regulation TrkB signaling via selective modulation in the expression of truncated TrkB.T1 receptors at synaptic sites. Regulation of TrkB.T1 is mediated by the RNA-binding protein RbFox1. In a gain-of-function model, RbFox1 stabilizes TrkB.T1 mRNA and increases expression of TrkB.T1 protein. Surprisingly, stabilization occurs through an unknown mechanism involving binding of RbFox1 to the intronic region of TrkB.T1 pre-mRNA, and not by binding to cis-acting elements in the 3'UTR. Functional studies in acute hippocampal slices show that transgenic overexpression of TrkB.T1 greatly inhibits LTP in the induced by rapid bath perfusion of BDNF. BDNF-LTP is partly restored in heterozygous transgenic mice, strongly supporting a role of TrkB.B1 in regulating TrkB function and plasticity in the adult hippocampus. The background for this work is the observation of enhanced TrkB.T1 expression in chromosome 16 trisomy mice. By identifying regulation of TrkB.T1 by RbFox1 and showing differences between gain and loss-of-function of the RNA binding-protein, the study opens new avenues for pre-clinical translational research.</p><p>1) The effect on BDNF- LTP requires substantiation. Transgenic expression of TrkB.T1 modulates the response. To better evaluate the physiological role of TrkB.T1, BDNF-LTP should also be assessed in TrkB.T1 knockouts. TrkB inhibitors should be applied to confirm a TrkB-mediated response.</p><p>2) Data on the binding sites and mechanism of RNA stabilization would improve the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript presents interesting data examining the consequences of RbFox1 upregulation as an approach to identify downstream genes regulated by RbFox1 which may have significance for brain disorders associated with RbFox1 mutation. The authors begin by following up on their prior Trisomy 16 work, to identify RbFox1 as a chromosome 16-encoded gene that could produce their previously observed upregulated expression of a truncated form of the TrkB receptor, TrkB.T1. Data is presented to show that viral overexpression of RbFox1 in hippocampal neurons produces upregulation of TrkB.T1 protein and mRNA without changing levels of full-length TrkB (TrkB.FL), and differential binding of RbFox1 to TrkB mRNAs is assessed. A mouse model with inducible RbFox1 expression is used to assess effects on gene expression by immunoblotting and RNA-seq and to probe BDNF-induced LTP. The authors compare their RbFox1 induced expression RNA-seq dataset with a published dataset from another group studying the effects of RbFox1 deletion (Vuong et al., 2018) to support a main conclusion that genes affected by RbFox1 gain of function differ from genes affected by RbFox1 loss of function.</p><p>Several aspects of the data make it difficult to definitively conclude that gain and loss of RbFox1 produce regulation of different genes:</p><p>1) The comparisons of the results of RbFox1 overexpression and RbFox1KO in Figure 4B are hampered by the fact that there may be many differences in experimental design, mouse genetic background, sample preparation, sequencing, analysis and filters applied, etc., between the authors' dataset and data presented in Vuong et al., 2018. It's not clear that differences in seq data will all or even mostly be due to biological differences in the effects of Rbfox1 overexpression compared to Rbfox1 deletion. Insufficient details are provided in this manuscript to compare even major biological variables such as the age of mice used by the authors for the RNA-seq experiments.</p><p>2) A proposed mechanism for the difference in genes regulated by gain or loss of RbFox1 expression is incompletely defined. The authors show that an RbFox1 heterozygote with reduced RbFox1 expression has an increase in RbFox2 expression relative to a control mouse, while RbFox1 gain of function does not alter RbFox2 levels. It is not clear whether RbFox2 is changed in the RbFox1 deletion context (Vuong et al., 2018) though, or to what extent RbFox2 can interchange for RbFox1 binding sites and gene regulation.</p><p>If RbFox1 differentially elevates levels of newly synthesized TrkB.T1 mRNA compared to TrkB.FL mRNA (Figure 2D), then can the authors explain why this action of RbFox1 overexpression fails to produce any change in the level of TrkB.T1 protein (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) in the HEK293 dox-inducible cell line?</p><p>Greater explanation is needed for the determination of reads as TrkB.T1 compared to TrkB.FL, especially given that TrkB.FL contains the sequence of TrkB.T1.</p><p>In the BDNF-induced LTP experiments, it is not clear that the effect of 'inactivation' of one TrkB.T1 allele is specific to the context of RbFox1 upregulation. This manipulation should be symmetrically applied in the context of to the Ctrl mouse as well. The data presented are insufficient to conclude that RbFox1 upregulation leads to a deficit in the BDNF-induced LTP resulting from an increase in TrkB.T1 expression (as opposed to indicating possible distinct roles for both TrkB.T1 and RbFox1 upregulation in BDNF-induced LTP).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Tomassoni-Ardori et al. investigate the impact of Rbfox1 on the expression of different TrkB isoforms. The findings are somewhat interesting though the overall impact is somewhat limited by the many other recent manuscripts studying the function of this protein and the focus on Rbfox1 overexpression even though disease is associated with reduced functional Rbfox.</p><p>However, the work does provide new insight into the potential role of Rbfox1 and the data demonstrating it binds and regulates TrkB.T1 is pretty conclusive, though there are a few shortcomings that should be addressed that are outlined below.</p><p>1) In the second paragraph of the Results, the authors state that the observation that Rbfox1 specifically impacts TrkB.T1 mRNA without affecting full length suggests that it does not act by regulating splicing. I do not really understand this argument and think conducting experiments to rule out an effect on splicing (or some additional explanation) are warranted.</p><p>2) It would be helpful to confirm that the upregulation of Rbfox1 in brains of lox-stop-lox/nestin-Cre animals is limited to neurons. Depending on what nestin-cre driver was used, it is possible that Rbfox1 is also upregulated in non-neuronal cells which could contribute to the gene expression changes observed.</p><p>3) In order to demonstrate that TrkB.T1 was a key target of Rbfox1 despite the many other targets was to use a BDNF induced LTP paradigm. As responses in this setup would be expected to be dominated by BDNF/TrkB signaling, any regulator of TRkB levels would be expected to have strong phenotype here and dominate over the impact of other genes. Perhaps another complimentary functional experiment, if possible would be helpful here.</p><p>4) Related to the above, it could be interesting to determine whether any of the other RNA-seq hits were TrekB dependent, this could be another opportunity to support a key role for Rbfox1 dependent regulation of TrkB.T1 in downstream phenotypes.</p><p>5) The authors comment on potential differences between mouse and human, and it might be helpful to confirm that Rbfox1 similarly regulates TrkB.T1 in human neurons and determine whether knockdown of Rbfox1 is effective in that system.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>We are pleased to inform you that your article, &quot;RbFox1 up-regulation impairs BDNF-dependent hippocampal LTP by dysregulating TrkB isoform expression levels&quot;, has been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. A summary of the study and the reviewers' comments are included below.</p><p>The BDNF TrkB receptor is responsible for synaptic plasticity, obesity and learning and memory. In addition to the full length TrkB tyrosine kinase receptor, a truncated form of TrkB (TrkB.T1) exists in the central nervous system. However the regulation of TrkB.T1 receptors is not well understood. In this study, the RNA binding protein, RBFox1, was found to upregulate the expression of TrkB.T1, which resulted in a deficit in BDNF-dependent LTP. This paper provides a new mechanism to explain the effects of BDNF upon synaptic plasticity.</p><p>The revised manuscript has been evaluated by two prior reviewers. Both reviewers found the revised manuscript adequately addressed the previous criticisms and questions with additional experiments and analysis. They concluded the revision is suitable for publication. One remaining question was whether the regulation of truncated TrkB occurred through RNA stability or alternatively by a splicing event. this issue can be dealt with in the future, but it would be useful to acknowledge it in the text of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Tessarollo and colleagues identify that RbFox1 regulates levels of TrkB.T1, a TrkB isoform that regulates activity of TrkB.FL. The then go on to show that upregulation RbFox1 impacts LTP specifically through regulating TrkB/T1 levels.</p><p>I was a reviewer of the last version of this manuscript, and the changes made by the authors have adequately addressed many of the concerns raised with the original version. The revised manuscript represents a more cohesive story with a logical flow that was harder to see in the previous version.</p><p>There are still a few issues with the manuscript that should be addressed that are outlined below, but in general the revised manuscript is greatly improved and should be considered for publication.</p><p>1) Despite additional experiments conducted by the authors, the mechanism by which RbFox1 specifically regulates TrkB.T1 is still a mystery. In the eyes of this reviewer, the data does not necessarily confirm an RNA stability mechanism and could be due to regulation of splicing to favor the T1 UTR. Altered splicing to include the T1 UTR could result in more T1 mRNA after RbFox overexpression in the pulse chase experiment (Figure 3D) and is consistent with the observation that the 3'UTR does not increase mRNA stability (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Additional experiments to look at splicing directly and/or experiments looking at stability using full mRNAs for TrkB.T1 and TrkB.FL would be ideal, but depending on the views of other reviewers it could also be acceptable to note that in the text that either mechanism is possible.</p><p>2) The authors have done an excellent job demonstrating that (A) the LTP deficits following RbFox1 upregulation are Trkb.T1 dependent and (B) that RbFox2 is at least semi-redundant with RbFox1. Therefore, the gene expression data shown by the authors is not likely to underlie any of the core phenotypes of interest in the study. Because of this, it may be best to put less emphasis on this data through removing/rewording the significance statement for example.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have done a thorough revision of their manuscript, which is much improved from the prior submission. I believe that the manuscript is suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While the mechanism of action by which RbFox1 overexpression upregulates truncated TrkB.T1 remains unclear, the authors now show that this action is also achieved by RbFox2 but not RbFox3.</p><p>It should be made clear within the manuscript text and figure legend whether the experiments in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 utilize a construct containing only the TrkB.T1 3'UTR, or the entire cDNA transcript inclusive of the 3'UTR.</p><p>The authors have made gains in further understanding the relationship of RbFox1, TrkB.T1, and BDNF-dependent LTP. They have added data that TrkB.T1 deficient cultured hippocampal neurons display an increased response to BDNF. The manuscript also now includes data showing that conditional removal of one TrkB.T1 receptor allele in animals with up-regulated RbFox1 is sufficient to rescue hippocampal BDNF dependent LTP, suggesting that TrkB is a relevant target of RbFox1 in BDNF-dependent LTP.</p><p>This would be a more appropriate conclusion than the more broad: 'genetic reduction of the TrkB.T1 isoform in animals with up-regulated RbFox1 is sufficient to restore hippocampal BDNF dependent LTP, suggesting that TrkB is a major target of RbFox1 pathological dysregulation' particularly since the author's observe a broad variety of gene dysregulation in their RNA-seq experiments.</p><p>Statistical analysis and description of experimental design are improved. Analysis of RNA-seq data is improved for consistency across datasets being compared, although it remains unclear what biological variables exist between the authors' dataset and the previously published comparison dataset.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49673.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This study focuses upon the regulation of a truncated TrkB species, TrkB.T1, by the RNA binding protein RbFox1.

In addition, we have performed BDNF-induced LTP experiments in a new triple transgenic mouse model (nestin- cre; R26-Rbfox1; TrkB.T1<sup>loxP</sup>) to demonstrate a direct role of TrkB.T1 function in neurons (new Figure 8), where RbFox1 is also expressed (new Figure 8—figure supplement 2).</p><p>2) To further understand how the levels of RbFox1 impact TrkB.T1 expression we have investigated the specificity of this function within the RbFox1 family members. The surprising finding that only RbFox1 and RbFox2, but not RbFox3, regulate TrkB.T1 despite the fact that all Fox proteins bind to the same RNA sequence suggests that other proteins are required for this phenomena (new Figure 2C, D). This observation is important because it steers the RNA biology field toward the investigation of a new molecular mechanism of RbFox protein function. In addition we have further strengthened our finding that RbFox1 gain or loss of function affects different genetic pools by re-doing our bioinformatics analysis starting from raw data from all studies and by employing the same parameters and filtering (new Figure 5).</p><p>3) We have validated that RbFox1 function is strictly neuronal by performing a detailed characterization of hippocampal nestin-cre/R26-RbFox1 activity (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2) and by performing BDNF- induced LTP experiments in a new transgenic nestin-cre; R26- Rbfox1; TrkB.T1<sup>loxP</sup> mouse model to demonstrate a direct role of TrkB.T1 function in neurons (new Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The study provides important insights into the mechanism and functional regulation TrkB signaling via selective modulation in the expression of truncated TrkB.T1 receptors at synaptic sites. Regulation of TrkB.T1 is mediated by the RNA-binding protein RbFox1. In a gain-of-function model, RbFox1 stabilizes TrkB.T1 mRNA and increases expression of TrkB.T1 protein. Surprisingly, stabilization occurs through an unknown mechanisms involving binding of RbFox1 to the intronic region of TrkB.T1 pre-mRNA, and not by binding to cis-acting elements in the 3'UTR. Functional studies in acute hippocampal slices show that transgenic overexpression of TrkB.T1 greatly inhibits LTP in the induced by rapid bath perfusion of BDNF. BDNF-LTP is partly restored in heterozygous transgenic mice, strongly supporting a role of TrkB.B1 in regulating TrkB function and plasticity in the adult hippocampus. The background for this work is the observation of enhanced TrkB.T1 expression in chromosome 16 trisomy mice. By identifying regulation of TrkB.T1 by RbFox1 and showing differences between gain and loss-of-function of the RNA binding-protein, the study opens new avenues for pre-clinical translational research.</p><p>1) The effect on BDNF- LTP requires substantiation. Transgenic expression of TrkB.T1 modulates the response. To better evaluate the physiological role of TrkB.T1, BDNF-LTP should also be assessed in TrkB.T1 knockouts. TrkB inhibitors should be applied to confirm a TrkB-mediated response.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree with the reviewer that more experiments to strengthen the role of TrkB.T1 modulation in LTP ware important. Experiments with Trk inhibitors have already been performed and have suggested a key role for TrkB.FL signaling in BDNF induced LTP (Kang and Schuman, 1995). In addition, in our initial paper (Carim-Todd et al., 2009) where we evaluated LTP in TrkB.T1 KO mice we failed to detect any significant difference. Here, we have also reported that TrkB.T1 heterozygous mice do not show any defect in BDNF induced LTP (Figure 8—figure supplement 2). Since a key point of the paper is to evaluate whether neuronal TrkB.T1 upregulation (since RbFox1 is expressed only in neurons), disrupts BDNF-induced LTP we did test whether it is the TrkB.T1 up-regulation in neurons causing the impairment (a point also raised by reviewer 2 and 3). Therefore, we have generated a triple transgenic mouse with a conditional TrkB.T1<sup>loxP</sup>, R-26-RbFox1 and nestin-cre allele to test rescue of the BDNF induced LTP in neurons. The strategy led to a rescue (new Figure 8). Furthermore, to mechanistically address the role of TrkB.T1 modulation on TrkB.FL function, we have used an in vitro system and showed that increased TrkB.T1 levels reduced TrkB.FL and ERK phosphorylation levels (new Figure 6A). A modulatory role was also confirmed in pure TrkB.T1 KO primary hippocampal cultures where TrkB.FL signaling was increased (new Figure 6B-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Data on the binding sites and mechanism of RNA stabilization would improve the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point. So far, the data that we have accumulated show</p><p>1) by analysis of the iCLIP data, that RbFox1 associates along the TrkB transcripts in two different nuclear fractions of the mouse brain (Figure 3A). Direct binding is also confirmed by RIP analysis in primary hippocampal neurons (Figure 3C); 2) mechanistically, RbFox1 stabilizes specifically TrkB.T1 transcripts (Figure 3D) and 3) RbFox1 RNA-binding capability is required for regulation of TrkB.T1 (Figure 3E, F). (we have clarified this concept in the third paragraph of the Discussion). Importantly, during the revision process, we have found that in primary hippocampal neurons RbFox2, but not RbFox3 can substitute for RbFox1 (new Figure 2C, D). The implications of this finding are important because they suggest that other proteins binding to RbFox1 and/or RbFox2 confer specificity of action since all RbFox members bind to the same sequence ((U)GCAUG). We have added this important point in the Discussion (fourth paragraph). We think that future IP and proteomic analysis to identify proteins associated with the different RbFox gene products should help determine the identity of these proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript presents interesting data examining the consequences of RbFox1 upregulation as an approach to identify downstream genes regulated by RbFox1 which may have significance for brain disorders associated with RbFox1 mutation. The authors begin by following up on their prior Trisomy 16 work, to identify RbFox1 as a chromosome 16-encoded gene that could produce their previously observed upregulated expression of a truncated form of the TrkB receptor, TrkB.T1. Data is presented to show that viral overexpression of RbFox1 in hippocampal neurons produces upregulation of TrkB.T1 protein and mRNA without changing levels of full-length TrkB (TrkB.FL), and differential binding of RbFox1 to TrkB mRNAs is assessed. A mouse model with inducible RbFox1 expression is used to assess effects on gene expression by immunoblotting and RNA-seq and to probe BDNF-induced LTP. The authors compare their RbFox1 induced expression RNA-seq dataset with a published dataset from another group studying the effects of RbFox1 deletion (Vuong et al., 2018) to support a main conclusion that genes affected by RbFox1 gain of function differ from genes affected by RbFox1 loss of function.</p><p>Several aspects of the data make it difficult to definitively conclude that gain and loss of RbFox1 produce regulation of different genes:</p><p>1) The comparisons of the results of RbFox1 overexpression and RbFox1KO in Figure 4B are hampered by the fact that there may be many differences in experimental design, mouse genetic background, sample preparation, sequencing, analysis and filters applied, etc., between the authors' dataset and data presented in Vuong et al., 2018. It's not clear that differences in seq data will all or even mostly be due to biological differences in the effects of Rbfox1 overexpression compared to Rbfox1 deletion. Insufficient details are provided in this manuscript to compare even major biological variables such as the age of mice used by the authors for the RNA-seq experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a very valid point. Therefore, we have completely redone the comparative analysis of RNA-seq data using raw data from all studies, using the same parameters, and by applying the same filtering during the analysis. In addition, we have analyzed the changes in isoform expression and used the same cut-off between studies. This analysis greatly increased the number of genetic changes caused by RbFox1 loss of function (1657 from 967 of the previous submission, new Figure 5B) yet only 42 (from 38 of previous submission) overlap between that genetic model and our gain-of-function study. We have also changed our analysis to report changes in pathways rather than individual genes (new Figure 5A) which we think is more relevant to understanding the implications on brain function.</p><p>We apologize for not having included all the details about the mice used for the analysis. We have now amended the Materials and methods section (subsection “Mouse models”; subsection “RNA stability”) to indicate that mice were backcrossed into a pure C57BL/6 genetic background for at least 10 generations and the nestin-cre mice were from the same source (JAX) as reported in the study by Vuong et al., 2018. The age of the animals is also indicated. Lastly, we have added more details in the Materials and methods section for the RNA-seq analysis (subsection “RNA seq analysis”). While we cannot completely rule out differences between studies we feel that, if any, these should be minimal after the new analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A proposed mechanism for the difference in genes regulated by gain or loss of RbFox1 expression is incompletely defined. The authors show that an RbFox1 heterozygote with reduced RbFox1 expression has an increase in RbFox2 expression relative to a control mouse, while RbFox1 gain of function does not alter RbFox2 levels. It is not clear whether RbFox2 is changed in the RbFox1 deletion context (Vuong et al., 2018) though, or to what extent RbFox2 can interchange for RbFox1 binding sites and gene regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in our response to point 2 of reviewer 1 we have now shown that RbFox2 is not only upregulated in RbFox1 heterozygous mice but can also functionally compensate for RbFox1 (Results, fourth paragraph; new Figure 2C, D; Discussion, fourth paragraph). As suggested by the reviewer, we have also checked whether RbFox2 is up-regulated in the context of RbFox1 deletion (Vuong et al., 2018) and found that indeed it is. We have added the reference (Results, fifth paragraph), and also reported the data in Supplementary file 2. In addition, RbFox1 and RbFox3 knockdown experiments in primary neurons also show a 2- fold increase in RbFox2 protein (Lee et al., 2016), as also previously reported in RbFox1-KO brain (Gehman et al., 2011).</p><p>Indeed, as also indicated in our response to reviewer 1, point 2, we have made some progress with the new data toward the understanding of what might regulate the stability of different transcripts in a overexpression context but we think that showing the biological significance and importance of this new mechanism should be the first critical step to prompt the RNA biology community to dissect the molecular basis of this important phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If RbFox1 differentially elevates levels of newly synthesized TrkB.T1 mRNA compared to TrkB.FL mRNA (Figure 2D), then can the authors explain why this action of RbFox1 overexpression fails to produce any change in the level of TrkB.T1 protein (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) in the HEK293 dox-inducible cell line?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not having been more clear in explaining the HEK293-dox inducible experiment and its significance. Since it has been reported that RbFox1 can stabilize mRNA species by binding to the 3’UTRs and antagonize specific miRNA activity (Lee et al., 2016), we have tested if RbFox1 could increase the stability of TrkB.T1 cDNA with the 3’UTR. Our data show that RbFox1 presence does not change the level of TrkB.T1 with the 3’UTR suggesting that it is the binding to the intronic regions of the TrkB.T1 that changes its level of expression. This is in agreement with our iCLIP analysis and RIP experiments that show Rbfox1 binding to the intronic regions of TrkB.T1 (Figure 3A, C). We have now clarified the concept in the manuscript (Results and Discussion, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Greater explanation is needed for the determination of reads as TrkB.T1 compared to TrkB.FL, especially given that TrkB.FL contains the sequence of TrkB.T1.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that more details are needed for how we determined the reads of TrkB.T1 and TrkB.FL since there is sequence overlap between the two isoforms. Even if TrkB.FL and TrkB.T1 share the same extracellular region, the unique TrkB.T1 exon and long 3’UTR provides specificity for the determination of reads as TrkB.T1 compared to TrkB.FL. We have added more details in the Materials and methods section about the RNA-seq analysis including the use of “EBSeq (version 1.22.1) to test for differential isoform expression between experimental conditions. Group-based TPM filtering was applied to remove lowly expressed transcripts. Significant differentially expressed isoforms were identified with a false-discovery rate £0.05”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the BDNF-induced LTP experiments, it is not clear that the effect of 'inactivation' of one TrkB.T1 allele is specific to the context of RbFox1 upregulation. This manipulation should be symmetrically applied in the context of to the Ctrl mouse as well. The data presented are insufficient to conclude that RbFox1 upregulation leads to a deficit in the BDNF-induced LTP resulting from an increase in TrkB.T1 expression (as opposed to indicating possible distinct roles for both TrkB.T1 and RbFox1 upregulation in BDNF-induced LTP).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this very important point that also helped in addressing point 1 of reviewer 1. Specifically, we have generated a triple transgenic mouse with a conditional TrkB.T1<sup>loxP</sup>, R-26-RbFox1 and nestin-cre alleles to test the rescue of the BDNF induced LTP in the same cellular context where RbFox1 is upregulated (neurons); see new Figure 8. All manipulations are now symmetrically applied. The N-cre-Fox1 mouse had the R-26-RbFox1 and nestin-cre alleles, and the control (Ctrl) had the nestin-cre only allele. As indicated above, we also went further to better dissect the role of the TrkB.T1-isoform in the context of BDNF/TrkB signaling by showing that increasing TrkB.T1 levels reduces BDNF- induced signaling (new Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Tomassoni-Ardori et al. investigate the impact of Rbfox1 on the expression of different TrkB isoforms. The findings are somewhat interesting though the overall impact is somewhat limited by the many other recent manuscripts studying the function of this protein and the focus on Rbfox1 overexpression even though disease is associated with reduced functional Rbfox.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that most studies have focused on RbFox1 loss of function though it is now emerging that there are pathological situations in humans where RbFox1 (and even RbFox2) is found to be up-regulated (see also comment above). Thus, we feel that we are covering a new understudied and yet important area of research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the work does provide new insight into the potential role of Rbfox1 and the data demonstrating it binds and regulates TrkB.T1 is pretty conclusive, though there are a few shortcomings that should be addressed that are outlined below.</p><p>1) In the second paragraph of the Results, the authors state that the observation that Rbfox1 specifically impacts TrkB.T1 mRNA without affecting full length suggests that it does not act by regulating splicing. I do not really understand this argument and think conducting experiments to rule out an effect on splicing (or some additional explanation) are warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We do understand the difficulty of this concept especially because RbFox1 is known as a regulator of splicing. The data that lead to our conclusion are the following: 1) in vivo and in vitro RbFox1 overexpression causes up-regulation of only TrkB.T1 and no changes in TrkB.FL. In situations of alternative splicing we should have seen TrkB.FL expression levels going down; 2) These data, i.e. change of only one isoform, is confirmed by the very sensitive RNA-seq analysis in N-cre-Fox1 mouse hippocampus. 3) Analysis of new nascent RNA showed that TrkB.T1 but not TrkB.FL RNA is more stable upon RbFox1 overexpression. We have now modified the Discussion to clarify these points (third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be helpful to confirm that the upregulation of Rbfox1 in brains of lox-stop-lox/nestin-Cre animals is limited to neurons. Depending on what nestin-cre driver was used, it is possible that Rbfox1 is also upregulated in non-neuronal cells which could contribute to the gene expression changes observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this very important point. As suggested, we have performed a very careful analysis of nestin-cre activity in the hippocampus. The characterization of cre-activity as well as of Fox1 expression and potential overlap with GFAP is reported in the new panels of Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and in the Results section (third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In order to demonstrate that TrkB.T1 was a key target of Rbfox1 despite the many other targets was to use a BDNF induced LTP paradigm. As responses in this setup would be expected to be dominated by BDNF/TrkB signaling, any regulator of TRkB levels would be expected to have strong phenotype here and dominate over the impact of other genes. Perhaps another complimentary functional experiment, if possible would be helpful here.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s point is well taken and indeed there could be other genes that are regulated by RbFox1 and that could impact TrkB levels or signaling. To strengthen our observation and test the direct regulation of TrkB.T1 in BDNF-induced LTP, we have performed this experiment in the context of conditional TrkB.T1 deletion in neurons to clarify that the previous rescue effect was not caused by an indirect down-regulation of TrkB.T1 in glia (new Figure 8). Moreover, we have performed a new complementary functional experiment to show that increasing or decreasing TrkB.T1 modulates TrkB.FL signaling, which is key to BDNF-induced LTP (New Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to the above, it could be interesting to determine whether any of the other RNA-seq hits were TrekB dependent, this could be another opportunity to support a key role for Rbfox1 dependent regulation of TrkB.T1 in downstream phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be nice to know if there are some TrkB- dependent RNA-seq hits. However, we are afraid that it would be almost impossible to demonstrate a direct relationship between those hits and TrkB-induced LTP because there are so many genes/neuronal pathways that are dysregulated by Rb-Fox1. To convey this point, we have changed panel Figure 5A to indicate that many neuronal pathways are dysregulated. Yet, we hope that the reviewer will agree that it is remarkable that correcting only the expression of one isoform can rescue the BDNF-induced LTP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors comment on potential differences between mouse and human, and it might be helpful to confirm that Rbfox1 similarly regulates TrkB.T1 in human neurons and determine whether knockdown of Rbfox1 is effective in that system.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s comment we have investigated the possibility of testing our hypothesis in human hippocampal neurons, which are available. However, National Institutes of Health (NIH) regulations do not allow such experiments since human hippocampal neurons are of fetal origin. We have also considered the possibility of differentiating human iPSCs or ES cells but, to our knowledge, there are, as yet, no good protocols specific to the differentiation of hippocampal neurons. In the future, it will be important to test RbFox1 in conjunction with TrkB levels in patients with specific neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disorders, studies that we think will be prompted by our report.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We are pleased to inform you that your article, &quot;RbFox1 up-regulation impairs BDNF-dependent hippocampal LTP by dysregulating TrkB isoform expression levels&quot;, has been accepted for publication in eLife.

In addition to the full length TrkB tyrosine kinase receptor, a truncated form of TrkB (TrkB.T1) exists in the central nervous system. However the regulation of TrkB.T1 receptors is not well understood.

Both reviewers found the revised manuscript adequately addressed the previous criticisms and questions with additional experiments and analysis.
