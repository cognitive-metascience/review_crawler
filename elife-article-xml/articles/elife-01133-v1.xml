process regulated by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). How these diverse processes are coordinated remains unclear. We show that in mammalian oocytes Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) in addition to protecting cohesin, plays an important role in turning off the SAC, in promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, in facilitating formation of K-fibers and in limiting bivalent stretching. Sgol2’s ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, as is its ability to silence the SAC, with the latter being mediated by direct binding to Mad2. In contrast, its effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and mediated by recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity respectively. By virtue of its multiple interactions, Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01133.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01133.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01133.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human reproductive cells—eggs and sperm—are produced through a process called meiosis. This means a ‘parent’ cell in the ovaries or testes undergoes two stages of cell division: it first divides into two cells, which then divide again to produce four ‘daughter’ cells. A crucial part of meiosis is ensuring that each daughter cell has half the number of chromosomes that the parent cell did.</p><p>Before the first round of meiosis, the chromosomes in the parent cell are copied to produce enough chromosomes for the four daughter cells. The distribution of these chromosomes between the daughter cells is determined by the opposing forces acting on them. The pairs of identical chromosomes produced during the copying process are held together by a proteinaceous glue, while microtubules attached to a structure called the spindle—which has poles at opposite ends of the cell—try to pull these pairs of chromosomes apart.</p><p>Rattani et al. now show that a protein called shugoshin-like 2 (Sgol2), which is involved in holding pairs of identical chromosomes together after the first round of division, has a bigger role than was previously realised. Sgol2 performs three other functions: it helps to align the chromosomes prior to division by, it is thought, facilitating the formation of the K-fibers that attach the microtubules to the chromosomes; it turns off the checkpoint that monitors the alignment of the chromosomes and the attachment of the microtubules; and it regulates a number of the enzymes involved in the process. The specific interactions that allow Sgol2 to perform these diverse functions in meiosis were also identified. Thus, Rattani et al. show that in linking so many essential processes throughout meiosis, Sgol2 appears to have a key, if not unique, role in determining the fate of chromosomes as cells divide.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01133.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01133.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>Meiosis</kwd><kwd>Shugoshin</kwd><kwd>PP2A</kwd><kwd>Aurora kinase</kwd><kwd>MCAK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>019859/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nasmyth</surname><given-names>Kim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>84673</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nasmyth</surname><given-names>Kim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rattani</surname><given-names>Ahmed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STE997/3-2 within the priority program SPP1384</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stemmann</surname><given-names>Olaf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2011-25252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pendas</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MitoSys/241548</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nasmyth</surname><given-names>Kim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) is involved in a variety of cell cycle process during the first stage of meiotic division.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The production of haploid gametes from diploid germ cells depends on two rounds of chromosome segregation (meiosis I and II) without an intervening round of DNA replication. Defects during the first or second meiotic division in oocytes lead to formation of aneuploid eggs, which in humans occurs with a frequency between 10 and 30% and is a major cause of fetal miscarriages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Hassold and Hunt, 2001</xref>). Understanding the causes of meiotic chromosome missegregation will require clarifying not only the forces and regulatory mechanisms governing meiotic chromosome segregation but also how these are coordinated.</p><p>At the heart of this process are two opposing forces. The pulling forces produced by kinetochore-microtubules attachments (K-fibers) and resisting forces generated by sister chromatid cohesion, which counteracts K-fiber forces if and when kinetochores attach to microtubules with different polarities. During meiosis I, cohesion along chromosome arms holds bivalent chromosomes together following the creation of chiasmata produced by reciprocal recombination between homologous non-sister chromatids. This cohesion must persist during the attachment of maternal and paternal kinetochores to microtubules from opposite poles (bi-orientation) and resist the resulting spindle forces. The degree of traction exerted by meiotic spindles must create sufficient tension to facilitate bi-orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tachibana-Konwalski et al., 2010</xref>). During the bi-orientation process, the initial attachment of kinetochores to the surface of the microtubule lattice (lateral attachment) is converted to attachments to their plus ends (end on attachment), creating K-fibers. Because this process is intrinsically error prone, inappropriate attachments, for example those that connect maternal and paternal kinetochores to the same pole, must be disrupted through phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins by Aurora B/C kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kitajima et al., 2011</xref>). However, because these kinases disrupt K-fibers, they must subsequently be down regulated once bivalents bi-orient correctly.</p><p>The first meiotic division is eventually triggered by activation of a gigantic ubiquitin protein ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) whose destruction of securin and cyclin B activates a thiol protease called separase that cleaves the kleisin subunit of the cohesin complex holding sister chromatids together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McGuinness et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kudo et al., 2006</xref>). This process converts chromosomes from bivalents to dyads. It is delayed until all bivalents have bi-oriented by the production, at kinetochores that have not yet come under tension, of a potent inhibitor of the APC/C called the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) whose Mad2 subunit binds tightly to the APC/C’s Cdc20 co-activator protein. This regulatory mechanism, called the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), must be turned off before APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> can direct destruction of securin and cyclin B and thereby activate separase. Another pre-condition for cleavage, at least in yeast, is phosphorylation of cohesin’s kleisin subunit by a pair of protein kinases, namely CK1δ/ε and DDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ishiguro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Katis et al., 2010</xref>). During the first meiotic division, cohesin is phosphorylated along chromosome arms but not at centromeres, which ensures that only cohesion along arms is destroyed by separase at the onset of anaphase I. The consequent persistence of cohesion at centromeres promotes bi-orientation of dyads during meiosis II.</p><p>Centromeric cohesin avoids phosphorylation and therefore cleavage during the first meiotic division because separase activation is preceded by the recruitment to centromeres of orthologues of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MEI-S332 protein, called shugoshins. Members of this family contain a conserved C-terminal basic region and an N-terminal homodimeric parallel coiled coil, which provides a docking site for protein phosphatase 2A’s (PP2A) C and B’ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). In budding yeast, mutant proteins defective specifically in PP2A binding fail to confer protection of centromeric cohesion during meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Mammals have two members of the shugoshin family: Shugoshin-like protein 1 (Sgol1), and Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2). The former prevents centromeric cohesin from a process called the ‘prophase pathway’ that removes cohesin from chromosomes by a non-proteolytic mechanism soon after cells enter mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McGuinness et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Sgol2, on the other hand, protects centromeric cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Llano et al., 2008</xref>). Sgol2’s coiled coil domain binds PP2A in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2009</xref>) but whether this is vital for protecting centromeric cohesion is not known. Sgol2 also interacts with MCAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Huang et al., 2007</xref>), a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, implicated in correcting inappropriate kinetochore-microtubule interactions (error correction), and with Mad2 an essential component of the MCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Orth et al., 2011</xref>). Shugoshins, though not explicitly Sgol2, have also been implicated in recruiting to kinetochores the Aurora B kinase, necessary both for the SAC and for error correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tsukahara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yamagishi et al., 2010</xref>). Based on its interactions, Sgol2 has been linked to cohesion protection, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and error correction pathways. However, the physiological significance of these multiple interactions remain unclear.</p><p>We show here that Sgol2 defective in PP2A binding fails to protect centromeric cohesin, as found for Sgo1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). However, if this were the sole function of Sgol2, then chromosome behavior during meiosis I should be unaffected. To our surprise, we found that Sgol2 deficiency caused striking changes in chromosome and microtubule dynamics. It delayed bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, caused increased bivalent stretching, and greatly increased Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores, which was accompanied by an increase in lateral and a decrease in end on kinetochore-microtubules attachments. Lastly, Sgol2 deficiency delayed considerably APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> activation, suggesting that it was required to shut off the SAC. Sgol2 helps to turn off the SAC by binding directly both PP2A and the MCC protein Mad2, it moderates chromosome stretching by recruiting to kinetochores the kinesin MCAK, and likely promotes formation of K-fibers by down-regulating the activity of Aurora B/C kinase specifically at kinetochores. Meiotic chromosome segregation is a highly complex process dependent on an array of different biochemical processes. Our findings imply that through its multi-domain structure, Sgol2 has an important if not unique role in coordinating many of the key processes within this array.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sgol2 interacts with PP2A through conserved residues in its coiled coil</title><p>An essential feature of shugoshins is a conserved N-terminal homodimeric coiled coil that binds PP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Unlike Sgol1, which only interacts stably with the PP2A holoenzyme (a complex of A, B’ and C subunits), Sgol2 also associates with a core complex containing only A and C subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). To create versions of Sgol2 defective specifically in binding PP2A, conserved residues (namely L51, N54, R56, and E82) predicted to interact directly with PP2A were substituted by alanine or in the case of E82 also by lysine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Likewise, the highly conserved asparagine (N55 on Sgol2), corresponding to N61 in Sgol1, which forms a hydrogen bond within the coiled coil enabling it to adopt a conformation compatible with PP2A binding, was substituted by isoleucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, binding between purified Flag- and His-tagged Sgol2 fragments spanning the coiled coil (cc) region (31–117) was unaffected by any of these mutations, implying that all permit coiled coil formation. A triple mutation L51A/N54A/R56A (3A) reduced dimerization modestly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) but this effect was not seen when the two proteins were co-expressed in bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To assess the effects on PP2A binding, GST-tagged PP2A A subunit was incubated with B’ and C subunits in the presence of MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag. Pull down experiments revealed that N55I and the 3A triple mutation abolished co-purification of Sgol2 with the GST-tagged A subunit while N54A and R56A reduced it. In contrast, L51A and E82A had little or no effect while E82K caused a modest reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01133.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sgol2 binds to PP2A and Mad2 through coiled coil domain and Mad2 Interaction Motif (MIM), respectively.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram indicating relative positions of the coiled coil domain and the MIM sequence in <italic>M. musculus</italic> Sgol2 (not drawn to scale).

Sgol2 and PP2A co-localize at inner kinetochores of bivalent chromosomes at metaphase I in wild type oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) but neither protein was detected at this location in <italic>sgol2</italic><sup><italic>Δ/Δ</italic></sup> oocytes (n = 26). Importantly, microinjection of wild type Sgol2 encoding mRNA into <italic>sgol2</italic><sup><italic>Δ/Δ</italic></sup> oocytes restored accumulation at kinetochores of both Sgol2 and PP2A at metaphase I. In contrast, microinjection of mRNAs carrying N54A, N55I, or 3A mutations restored Sgol2 but not PP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), implying that binding of PP2A to Sgol2’s coiled coil is necessary for recruiting the phosphatase to kinetochores in vivo.

During phase 1, multiple microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) form a ball of polymerizing microtubules on whose surface chromosomes are distributed individually. This is followed by a period (phase 2) in which chromosomes slide laterally over the ball shaped spindle apparatus, eventually congressing to form a ‘prometaphase’ belt around it. During phase 3, chromosomes invade the cluster of microtubules, which elongates along an axis perpendicular to the earlier chromosome belt, forming a barrel-shaped bipolar spindle. This highly dynamic phase culminates when chromosomes bi-orient on a metaphase plate within the bipolar spindle. During the fourth and final stage (phase 4), bi-oriented chromosomes oscillate around the metaphase plate with low amplitudes (Phase 4).</p><p>Live-cell confocal imaging of wild type mouse oocytes microinjected with H2B-mCherry and GFP-MCAK showed that MCAK accumulates at MTOCs and on microtubules during phase 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) but does not appear at kinetochores until chromosomes congress on the surface of the ball at the start of phase 2. This event is accompanied by an increase in Sgol2’s abundance at kinetochores and by phosphorylation of T521 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). MCAK’s abundance at kinetochores gradually increases during phase 3 as chromosomes invade the spindle apparatus and peaks as chromosomes bi-orient on the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, top panel; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

This revealed three differences between wild type and <italic>sgol2</italic><sup><italic>Δ/Δ</italic></sup> oocytes at 6 hr post-GVBD, when most kinetochores in wild type have relinquished lateral and formed end on attachments and chromosomes have bi-oriented. Kinetochore associated microtubules bundles (K-fibers) were thinner and more sparse, lateral attachments were greatly increased in frequency, and kinetochores (as detected by CREST antibodies) were frequently highly stretched in mutant oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA had the opposite effect, eliminating lateral attachments and kinetochore stretching while greatly increasing the abundance of end-on microtubules associated with each kinetochore, an effect abrogated by T521A T600A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This suggests that the accumulation at kinetochores of Sgol2 phosphorylated by Aurora B/C kinase stimulates the conversion of lateral to end on attachments and that this may be the mechanism by which Sgol2 accelerates chromosome bi-orientation. Because injection of CENPB-eGFP-MCAK mRNAs instead of Sgol2 largely failed to increase end-on attachments at the expense of lateral ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), we suspect that Sgol2 phosphorylated by Aurora B/C has a function at kinetochores besides MCAK recruitment (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Sgol2 inhibits Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores</title><p>Because Aurora B kinase destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments, at least partly by phosphorylating proteins within the KMN network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Welburn et al., 2010</xref>), we tested whether Sgol2 altered the phosphorylation of Ser24 on Knl1 (p-Knl1).

Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA reduced this to below wild type, an effect unaltered by N54A but largely abolished by T521A T600A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Similar results were obtained using a phospho-specific antibody against Ser100 on Dsn1 (data not shown) and one that detects activating auto-phosphorylation of Aurora A/B/C at Thr288, Thr232, or Thr198 (p-Aurora), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Interestingly, these effects were specific to kinetochores as auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B/C on chromosome arms was unaltered in the mutant oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Importantly, Sgol2 did not alter the overall amount of Aurora C at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). These results imply that Sgol2 counters phosphorylation of KMN network proteins by a mechanism not involving its recruitment of PP2A. Strangely, this process seems to depend on Sgol2’s prior phosphorylation by the very same kinases that it ultimately inhibits. In other words, Aurora B/C creates its own inhibitor at kinetochores, creating a negative feedback loop. Consistent with this notion, the gradual accumulation at kinetochores of Sgol2 phosphorylated at T521 following GVBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) is accompanied by a corresponding reduction in Dsn1 Ser100 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Critically, Sgol2’s ability to inhibit Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores does not depend on kinetochore-microtubule interactions, as Sgol2 reduced auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B/C even in the presence of microtubule destabilizing drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).

Our creation and analysis of mutations within Sgol2’s highly conserved coiled coil reveals the likely mechanism, namely recruitment of PP2A to centromeres. PP2A might protect cohesin from separase either directly, by binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Holland et al., 2007</xref>) and inhibiting separase activity, or indirectly, by reversing phosphorylation of cohesin’s Rec8 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Katis et al., 2010</xref>), a process known to be important for its cleavage in yeast. However, if cohesion protection were Sgol2’s sole function, then its depletion should not compromise chromosome segregation during meiosis I. The precocious loss of cohesion should only affect the second meiotic division. On the contrary, depletion of Sgol2 specifically in oocytes has highly pleiotropic consequences already during meiosis I. These include inefficient SAC silencing, greatly increased bivalent stretching, and major alterations in the dynamics of kinetochore-microtubule attachments (K-fibers). We show that Sgol2 silences the SAC by binding to Mad2 using a similar MIM motif common to Mad2’s other two partners Cdc20 and Mad1. This raises the possibility that Sgol2 silences the SAC by competing with Cdc20 for the binding of activated Mad2, thereby preventing formation of the MCC. However, this cannot be the full story as SAC silencing also depends on Sgol2’s ability to bind PP2A. Because Sgol2’s MIM motif is close to the coiled coil by which it binds PP2A, it is conceivable that PP2A directly (i.e., structurally) facilitates the formation or stability of ‘closed’ complexes between Sgol2 and Mad2. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that only dephosphorylated Mad2 interacts with Cdc20 and Sgol2, while a phosphomimetic mutant of Mad2 cannot associate with either of these proteins (personal communication Michael Orth). Thus, PP2A could selectively stabilize the Sgol2-Mad2 complex by keeping Mad2 in a de-phosphorylated state. Therefore, it is conceivable that if there were sufficient turnover of Mad2 bound to MCC, then PP2A could promote the Sgol2: Mad2 complex formation and thus alter the activity of the MCC responsible for inhibiting the APC/C.</p><p>Unlike centromeric protection and SAC silencing, Sgol2’s regulation of bivalent stretching depends not on its ability to bind PP2A but instead on phosphorylation at T521 and T600 by Aurora B/C kinases. This facilitates MCAK accumulation at kinetochores. Because artificial recruitment of MCAK to kinetochores by fusion to CENP-B substitutes for Sgol2 with regard to bivalent stretching, we suggest that it is the population of MCAK recruited to kinetochores by Sgol2 that moderates the pulling forces exerted on maternal and paternal kinetochores, possibly by reducing the incidence of lateral attachments.</p><p>Artificial MCAK recruitment did not however restore normal looking end on attachments or greatly facilitate bi-orientation in Sgol2 deficient oocytes, implying that Sgol2 has yet another function at kinetochores besides recruiting PP2A and MCAK. Our observation that auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B/C kinases as well as phosphorylation of KMN proteins are elevated in Sgol2’s absence but depressed upon microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA suggests that this other function of Sgol2 is to act as a kinetochore-specific inhibitor of Aurora B/C kinases. The notion that Sgol2 moderates Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores was unexpected, as it has been reported that xSgo2, a newly discovered homolog of shugoshin in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, actually promotes Aurora Kinase activity, generating a favourable environment for microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rivera et al., 2012</xref>). In this case, the effect may be systemic, that is throughout the cytoplasm, whereas <italic>M.m</italic> Sgol2 appears to act as an inhibitor only at kinetochores. A remarkable feature of this effect is that Sgol2’s ability to inhibit Aurora B/C kinases at kinetochores depends on its prior phosphorylation at T521 and T600 by the very same Aurora kinases. In other words, Aurora B/C kinase creates its own inhibitor, generating a negative feedback loop. Whether the phosphorylation of Sgol2 necessary for it to act as an inhibitor of Aurora kinases at kinetochores is also generated at this location or along chromosome arms or elsewhere in the cell is currently unclear.</p><p>Irrespective of its precise spatial and dynamic properties, this negative feedback loop may be an important feature of meiosis I. Aurora B/C protein kinases have a key role in destabilizing inappropriate kinetochore-microtubule attachments, namely those that do not generate tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lampson and Cheeseman, 2011</xref>). They are therefore essential for the efficient bi-orientation of bivalent chromosomes. However, it is important that the de-stabilization process is eventually turned off so that correctly attached bivalents remain stably attached to microtubules. Hitherto, it has been assumed that the mechanism responsible for turning off these kinases merely involved physical forces that pull Aurora substrates away from the enzymes when maternal and paternal kinetochores are pulled in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Though our work does not preclude a role for traction in down regulating Aurora B/C’s access to kinetochore-bound substrates, it raises the possibility that down regulation is also an intrinsic feature of a biochemical system in which Aurora B/C activates its own inhibitor. The regulatory network revealed by our work ensures that Aurora B/C kinases will be active early during the bi-orientation, when incorrect attachments may be more frequent, and less active later, when they have been largely eliminated. It is possible that during the period when Aurora B/C kinases are active, the selective stabilization of correct attachments is mediated by mechanical changes within kinetochores induced by tension, as recently observed in purified yeast kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</xref>), not as originally thought by tension dependent changes in Aurora kinase activity, for which there has never been much direct evidence. We suggest that an important feature of meiosis I in oocytes is an early phase of high Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores followed by a later phase of lowered activity made possible by the Aurora B/C-Sgol2 negative feedback loop. The lowered activity of Aurora B/C might increase the MT-depolymerizing activity of MCAK at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2004</xref>). This is supported by the fact that the kinetochore pool of MCAK, recruited by Sgol2, is indeed not phosphorylated at serine 92 in mouse oocytes (data not shown). If correct, it will be important to understand the dynamic properties of the feedback loop that ensures that Aurora B/C kinases do not turn themselves off precociously. It is currently unclear whether the Aurora B/C-shugoshin feedback loop is a general feature of meiotic cells or whether it is also a feature of mitotic cells. How Sgol2 inhibits Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores is also unclear, in particular whether Sgol2 does this alone or only in conjunction with the recruitment of MCAK.</p><p>Given the number of fundamental processes regulated by Sgol2, it is surprising that <italic>sgol2</italic><sup><italic>Δ/Δ</italic></sup> oocytes often manage to undergo the first meiotic division without generating massive aneuploidy. Their second meiotic division is of course completely defective due to the total absence of sister chromatid cohesion. We suggest that all of the processes regulated by Sgol2 are fundamentally essential but that they are also regulated by Sgol2-independent pathways. In other words, the processes regulated by Sgol2 may be so fundamental that there are multiple pathways regulating them. It is not inconceivable that Sgol1, which is also expressed during meiosis, shares some functions with Sgol2 and it will therefore be interesting to analyze the phenotype of double mutant oocytes.</p><p>What is possibly most remarkable is that a single protein regulates sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome traction, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and lastly Aurora B/C kinases. Crucially, by demonstrating that different point mutations alter the regulation of some but not other processes, we have proven that the pleiotropy observed in <italic>sgol2</italic><sup><italic>Δ/Δ</italic></sup> oocytes is not due to knock on effects (secondary or even tertiary pathology) of eliminating a single function. Sgol2 possesses several different domains that regulate fundamentally different processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We all were favourably impressed by your systematic analysis of the surprisingly numerous functions of Sgol2 in chromosome segregation. You demonstrate that PP2A localization and protection of centromeric cohesion depends on Sgol2, and more specifically, on the coiled-coil domain of Sgol2, and provide here the final proof that PP2A localization through Sgol2 brings about centromeric cohesin protection in mammalian oocyte meiosis I.</p><p>1) There was some discussion among the reviewers as to whether it would be important to show the localization of a component of the SAC – is Mad2 remaining at kinetochores in Sgol2 knockout oocyte? On balance we decided that it was not essential, but if you have the data it would strengthen the message.</p><p>2) All the reviewers felt you could improve the citation of previous work in the Introduction. In particular, you should provide a citation for the statement that stretching the bivalents causes terminalisation of chiasmata. Furthermore, you should discuss the claim that stretching bivalents causes terminalisation without any apparent loss of cohesin.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01133.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) There was some discussion among the reviewers as to whether it would be important to show the localization of a component of the SAC – is Mad2 remaining at kinetochores in Sgol2 knockout oocyte?

We performed chromosome spreads at multiple time points, but unfortunately none of the three different antibodies we tested gave us a reliable signal that we could quantify. In short, at this time we do not have data for Mad2 levels in Sgol2 knockout oocytes.</p><p><italic>2) All the reviewers felt you could improve the citation of previous work in the Introduction. In particular, you should provide a citation for the statement that stretching the bivalents causes terminalisation of chiasmata. Furthermore, you should discuss the claim that stretching bivalents causes terminalisation without any apparent loss of cohesin</italic>.</p><p>We do agree that this phrase could create confusion. Therefore in the revised version, we have removed the statement that stretching of the bivalents causes terminalisation of chiasmata from the Introduction and in the Results we have also modified the phrasing. We have described in the Results that though the bivalent in Sgol2 knockout oocytes appeared terminalised, they still retained cohesion between homologous chromosomes. Furthermore, we have added that this abnormal shape of bivalent chromosomes on chromosome spreads could possibly be explained by increased inter-kinetochore stretching on the proximal end of the chromosomes in Sgol2 knockout oocytes, but these bivalent chromosomes are still connected at distal ends by cohesin molecules.</p></body></sub-article></article>
