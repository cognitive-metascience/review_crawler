Lineage regulates the synaptic connections between neurons in some regions of the invertebrate nervous system. For example, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system, projection neurons are specified by cell lineage to receive synaptic input from the axons of specific types of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jefferis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2018</xref>). In mammals, it has been reported that clonally related pyramidal neurons are preferentially connected to each other in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, it has been proposed that sister neurons in the visual cortex have a strong correlation to the stimuli to which they respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2012</xref>), while other works suggest that this correlation is much weaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohtsuki et al., 2012</xref>). To further investigate the role played by lineage in the assembly of brain circuits we focused on the mammalian olfactory bulb, a brain region with an anatomical organization particularly advantageous to study this question.</p><p>The mammalian olfactory system can be divided into three regions: olfactory epithelium, olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory cortex. The olfactory epithelium harbors the OSNs. Each OSN expresses just one of more than one thousand odorant receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chess et al., 1994</xref>). OSN axons expressing the same odorant receptor converge into one or two discrete neuropil structures in each OB called glomeruli, forming a stereotypic map on the OB surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ressler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vassar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mombaerts et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). The projection neurons in the OB are called mitral and tufted cells (M/T cells). In mammals, the majority (&gt;90%) of M/T cells have a single apical dendrite that branches into a single glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mori, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shepherd, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malun and Brunjes, 1996</xref>) where they receive sensory input from OSNs expressing a particular odor receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ressler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vassar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stewart et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mori, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malun and Brunjes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsutani and Yamamoto, 2000</xref>). Thus, the anatomical organization of the glomerulus in the OB is an ideal system to investigate the possible relationship between lineage and connectivity because the apical dendrite of the M/T cells provides a direct readout of their synaptic input. To address this question, we sparsely labeled M/T cells progenitors and investigated the sensory input that their progeny receives from OSNs. Our results show that sister M/T cells receive synaptic input from different glomeruli, indicating that lineage does not determine the sensory input of the OB projections neurons, and suggest that the connectivity between OB projection neurons and olfactory sensory neurons depends on other mechanisms, including random targeting of dendrites towards glomeruli and activity-dependent mechanisms.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46675.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Clonal analysis of projection neurons using <italic>Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup>::Confetti</italic> mice to sparsely label neuronal progenitors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the olfactory bulb (OB). Axons from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the same receptor project to a single glomerulus, forming synaptic contacts with the apical dendrites of mitral and tufted cells.

To be able to perform clonal analysis, we optimized the conditions to label just a handful of progenitors, ideally a single progenitor per OB. First, we confirmed that our transgenic mice <italic>Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup>::Confetti</italic> did not label any neurons in the brain without tamoxifen (TMX) administration (n = 3; data not shown). Second, we found that with an injection of 1 mg of TMX per 40 g of body weight into a 10-day pregnant female (E10.5) we observed a handful of labeled pyramidal neuron clones in the neocortex, and around 20 M/T cells labeled in the OB when the brains were examined at postnatal day 21 (P21) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Third, we confirmed that this TMX concentration labeled a few progenitors per brain when animals were analyzed 2 days after TMX administration (E12.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). With these conditions, we observed between none to a single progenitor labeled per fluorescent protein in the OB primordium (n = 6 embryos), the presumptive location of the M/T progenitors. Although we observed a very low number of progenitors labeled, we cannot unambiguously conclude whether a group of cells labeled at P21 with the same fluorescent protein in the OB originated from a single progenitor or two independent progenitors. However, because of the low number of clones labeled with these conditions we will work under the assumption that any group of M/T cells labeled with the same fluorescent protein in the OB are part of a single clone.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46675.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sparse labeling of progenitor cells in the embryonic mouse brain.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Sagittal sections through the brain of an E12.5 mouse treated with TMX at E10.5.

We did not analyze any of the nGFP+ cells for two reasons. First, the most reliable way to unambiguously identify M/T cells is by their distinctive morphology. Nevertheless, if a cell is only labeled in the nucleus (as in nGFP+ cells), we cannot tell apart M/T cells from other OB cell types (e.g. short axon cells, granule cells, juxtaperiglomerular). Second, to identify the connectivity between M/T cells and glomeruli, it is necessary to follow the projection of their apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and we cannot observe any dendrites in the nGFP+ cells.</p><p>In total, we analyzed 28 OBs. 15 of them did not have any labeled M/T cells. 11 OBs had both M and T cells labeled (n = 14 clones). Of these 11 OBs, eight had putative clones of a single color, and the remaining three OBs had two clones labeled with different fluorescent proteins. Two OBs had clones that contained only M cells (n = 2 clones).

The 3D reconstructions revealed that sister M/T cells were distributed in a broader area than the tight columns of sister pyramidal neurons in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). To analyze the distribution of cells from each clone, we calculated the nearest neighbor distance (NND) based on the distances of neurons in our 3D reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The dispersion of sister M/T cells that we observed is consistent with the tangential migration of immature M/T cells reported in the embryonic OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanchart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imamura et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether the distribution of sister M/T cells observed was random, we compared the NNDs of the labeled M/T cells observed (n = 310) with a simulated random dataset.

Similar results were reported for pyramidal neurons in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). This indicates that although sister M/T cells are not obviously clustered, their distribution in the OB is not random. Interestingly, previous works have observed that the tangential migration of immature M/T cells in the embryonic OB may be regulated by gradients of secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inokuchi et al., 2017</xref>) or cell adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastakis et al., 2015</xref>), biasing their distribution to specific regions within the OB.</p><p>Previous experiments have demonstrated that migration of M/T cells is biased toward the dorsal or ventral regions of the OB at different developmental times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imamura et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, it has been hypothesized that the dorsal and ventral domains of the OB may have a preference to process innate and learned odorants, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayakawa et al., 2007</xref>). To investigate whether the cell distribution in a clone was biased toward a specific OB domain, we divided the OB into two domains based on the expression of the OSN markers NQO1 and OCAM, that label the dorsal and ventral regions of the OB, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gussing and Bohm, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshihara et al., 1997</xref>). Then, we analyzed the distribution of clonally related M/T cells throughout these two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of the 14 OB clones we analyzed, four clones had a bias toward the ventral OB domain, three clones for the dorsal domain, and the remaining seven clones had similar number of cells in the dorsal and ventral domains. Overall, when all the clones were analyzed together, there were no preferences in the distribution of M/T cells towards the dorsal or ventral domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1L</xref>; p=0.67, t-test). Similarly, we did not detect any bias for the distribution of M/T cells OB in the lateral or medial domains (data not shown).</p><p>To analyze whether labeling of M/T progenitors at different developmental times could influence the distribution of M/T cells to a specific OB domain, we performed additional experiments to label M/T progenitors at a later time point by injecting TMX into 12 day pregnant females (E12.5), and brains were examined at P21, as in the E10.5 experiment. Previous works have demonstrated that in the neocortex the number of neurons per clone is reduced as progenitors are labeled at later embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angevine and Sidman, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Walsh and Cepko, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luskin et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Price and Thurlow, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rakic, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this observation, the clones that were labeled at E12.5 in the OBs contained fewer cells than at E10.5: 8.44 ± 6.37 M/T cells per clone (average ± standard deviation, n = 76 cells) when labeled at E12.5, compared with 22.14 ± 6.61 M/T cells per clone when labeled at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B, C-I'</xref>). Similarly, we observed a reduction in the number of cells per clone in the neocortex when labeling progenitors at later developmental stages (22.5 ± 6.47 pyramidal neurons (n = 135 cells) at E12.5 versus 92.67 ± 23.18 pyramidal neurons at E10.5)), consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Franco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B,K–P</xref>). In total we analyzed 18 OBs with progenitors labeled at E12.5. Eleven OBs did not have any M/T labeled cells. Seven OBs had nine clones with labeled M/T cells. Of these seven OBs, five s had a single putative clone, each clone labeled with a single fluorescent protein. Each of the other two OBs had two clones labeled with different fluorescent proteins. As in our E10.5 experiment, we observed that sometimes the cells in a clone were preferentially located in a specific domain (dorsal or ventral, or medial or lateral), although overall we did not find any significant differences in their distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4J</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments were designed to investigate the relationship between lineage and connectivity in the main olfactory bulb (MOB). Although not the primary goal of our work, these experiments gave us the opportunity to investigate whether M/T cells in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) were clonally related to the M/T cells in the MOB. When TMX was administered at E12.5, we did not find any M/T cells labeled in the AOB, consistent with the observation that AOB M/T cells are born earlier than MOB M/T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinds, 1968a</xref>). When we injected TMX at E10.5 we observed a small number of labeled M/T cells in the AOB. We inspected 28 OBs labeled at E10.5, and found that 10 OBs contained 18 M/T cells labeled in the AOB, with only 1–3 labeled M/T cells per AOB. Four OBs had 1–2 labeled M/T cells in the AOB and none in the MOB. Four OBs had M/T cells labeled with the same fluorescent proteins in both MOB and AOB, with only 1–3 cells in each AOB. The remaining two OBs had one cell in each AOB labeled with a fluorescent protein different from the M/T cells labeled in the MOB (see table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Although these small numbers do not allow for a definitive conclusion, our results suggest that there are separate progenitors for the M/T cells in the MOB and AOB. This hypothesis is consistent with recent works indicating that some M/T cells in the AOB are born from progenitors located in the diencephalic-telencephalic boundary, which then migrate rostrally to the posterior AOB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huilgol et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ruiz-Reig et al., 2017</xref>). Further experiments will be required to clarify these questions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Synaptic input of sister M/T cells</title><p>It has been proposed that the anatomical organization of the OB may be analogous to the neocortex columnar organization. In the neocortex it is thought that the pyramidal neurons forming part of a column perform a similar task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rakic, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mountcastle, 1997</xref>). Similarly, M/T cells receiving synaptic input from the same glomerulus respond to the same odorant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kauer and Cinelli, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mori et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bozza et al., 2002</xref>). Our results indicate that sister M/T cells are widely distributed throughout the OB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Based on this observation, it may seem unlikely that sister M/T cells would have apical dendrites projecting into the same glomerulus. However, this could still be possible because the soma of M/T cells innervating the same glomerulus may be separated from each other up to 450 µm (for M cells) and 350 µm (for T cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate whether sister M/T cells receive synaptic input from the same glomerulus, we tracked their apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among all the labeled M/T cells that we detected (310 cells from 14 putative M/T clones (E10.5) and 74 cells from nine putative M/T clones (E12.5)), we never observed two neurons innervating the same glomerulus, even when their cell bodies were near each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Nevertheless, it is still possible that, although we did not observe them, there may exist clones of M/T cells in the OB genetically pre-determined to project to the same glomerulus. This scenario could be expected for putative glomeruli responsive to relevant odors for survival, such as those responsive to predators or poisons, which require an innate and hardwired response of avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayakawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>).

However, there is a critical caveat that make it difficult to investigate the relationship between lineage and connectivity in the AOB. Although glomeruli are clearly distinct in the MOB, glomeruli in the AOB are less well defined and more difficult to identify. As indicated above, we observed only a small number of AOBs (four out of 10) that contained more than one (2 or 3) labeled M/T cells. Although the small number of labeled AOB M/T cells does not allow us to draw any firm conclusions, we did not find any M/T cells whose apical dendrites innervated the same glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), similar to what we observed in the MOB.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that lineage does not determinate the input connectivity of the apical dendrites of projection neurons in the mammalian OB. This is in contrast to what has been described for projection neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jefferis et al., 2001</xref>) and suggested for pyramidal neurons in the rodent visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Our results indicate that the sensory input received by M/T cells is regulated by other factors independent of lineage, including random targeting of dendrites towards glomeruli and activity-dependent mechanisms, consistent with previous observations from multiple lines of evidence. First, during early postnatal stages M/T cells have several dendrites (between 3 to 5), and each of these dendrites project into different glomeruli that are close to each other, and immediately above their cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinds, 1968a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanchart et al., 2006</xref>). Starting approximately 1 week after birth, a process of refinement occurs such that around 90% of M/T cells retain just one apical dendrite and retract all others, and that remaining single apical dendrite branches into a single glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malun and Brunjes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsutani and Yamamoto, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanchart et al., 2006</xref>). It is important to note that even in full adult animals approximately 10% of mature M/T cells have two apical dendrites that project into two different glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, the refinement by which M/T cells retain a single dendrite is a process partially dependent on neuronal activity. Olfactory deprivation by naris occlusion retards the refinement of M/T cell dendrites by approximately one week, although eventually the refinement process is accomplished to the same degree as in non-manipulated animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsutani and Yamamoto, 2000</xref>). Interestingly, a recent work demonstrated that genetic blocking of action potentials in M/T cells prevented the dendrite refinement process such that even in adult animals the majority of M/T cells have several dendrites projecting into multiple glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujimoto et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, recent experiments indicate that activity-dependent mechanisms can direct the projection of M/T cell dendrites into specific glomeruli. For example, sensory odor experience in utero recruits the apical dendrites of M/T cells to the activated glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, genetic ablation of a large set of OSNs results in the absence of a large number of glomeruli in the dorsal OB, and in these animals, some M/T cells located in those regions lacking glomeruli extend their dendrites tangentially for a long distance until they reach a region with glomeruli, where they branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishizumi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In summary, multiple observations indicate that M/T cells are not committed to project into specific glomeruli. Instead, the available evidence, including the data presented here, suggests a model where progenitor cells give rise to a clone of sister M/T cells that migrate throughout the olfactory bulb such that sister cells disperse independently from each, and their cell bodies do not end up close to each other in specific regions of the bulb. After neuronal migration is completed, immature M/T cells initially grow multiple dendrites that receive synaptic input from multiple glomeruli without any apparent specificity. After a period of refinement regulated, in part, by neuronal activity, most (but not all) M/T cells retain a single dendrite that branches into a single glomerulus. However, the available evidence indicates that any of the multiple apical dendrites displayed by immature M/T cells can be retained, suggesting that M/T cells are not committed to receive synaptic input from any specific glomeruli. Finally, it is curious that the targeting of OSN axons and M/T dendrites toward the glomeruli appears to be regulated by very different mechanisms. Each OSN expresses a single olfactory receptor molecule that instructs its axons to project into a single glomerulus with high specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ressler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vassar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mombaerts et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast, the existing evidence suggests that the apical dendrite of M/T cells can project to any glomeruli within a certain distance from the position of their cell bodies, without any apparent specificity. What is the relationship between the OSN axons and the M/T dendrites for synapse formation in the glomeruli? Animals with mutations in the Tbr1 gene that result in the complete loss of M/T cells demonstrate that OSN axons can still reach the OB and converge into glomeruli-like structures in the same location as in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bulfone et al., 1998</xref>). These experiments suggest that the targeting of OSN axons into the OB to form glomeruli does not require the presence of M/T cells. In contrast, the apical dendrites of M/T cells cannot form glomeruli in regions in mice in which a large set of olfactory receptors are genetically ablated, indicating that M/T cells require the presence of OSN axons to target their apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayakawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishizumi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Is there any biological advantage to the dispersion of projection neurons in the OB such that sister M/T cells receive synaptic input from different OSNs? Interestingly, it has been proposed that the M/T cells receiving input from the same glomerulus exhibit a wide diversity in their biophysical properties, and this diversity may be important for neural coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Padmanabhan and Urban, 2010</xref>). In addition, neurons in the piriform cortex receive synaptic input from M/T cells innervating different glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>), whereas M/T cells connected to the same glomerulus project their axons into many different areas of the olfactory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>). However, the connectivity between M/T cells and the amygdala appears to be more stereotypical than between the M/T cells and other targets in the olfactory cortex (anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex, tenia tecta, olfactory tubercle, cortical amygdala and entorhinal cortex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haberly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>). Based on these observations, one can speculate that the connectivity between the OB and its targets in the olfactory cortex may occur by two different mechanisms. Genetic factors, including lineage, may contribute to the connectivity between M/T cells and the amygdala, as this brain area is involved in innate behavior responses that may require hardwired connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the connectivity between M/T cells and areas of the olfactory cortex involved in the perception of odors that do not elicit innate behaviors are more plastic and may be regulated by mechanisms independent of lineage, such as random neurite targeting and activity-dependent wiring, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schaffer et al., 2018</xref>). Our results indicating that lineage does not determine the sensory synaptic input of M/T cells raise further questions about the assembly of the olfactory circuits, including the mechanisms regulating the formation of synapses between OSNs and M/T cells, the role that experience may play sculpting the odor representations in the piriform cortex, and whether lineage regulates the connections with the amygdala to trigger innate behaviors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>, <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic>, <italic>Confetti</italic>, and <italic>Ai9</italic> mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory.

The boundaries of the OB and neocortex were traced and used to line up each section with the previous one to form 3D reconstructions. Each labeled cell in the OB or neocortex was tagged with a dot. Blue dots represent mCFP cells, red dots cRFP cells and green dots cYFP.</p><p>The distribution of the nearest neighbor distance (NND) was calculated using Matlab based on the cell coordinates of our 3D reconstruction created in Neurolucida software. NND was calculated by identifying the shortest straight path between labeled cells using the Euclidean distance. The NND was represented as cumulative percentage (average ± standard deviation) of the clones analyzed in the OB (n = 14) and neocortex (n = 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In addition, we generated a dataset of random simulations based on the same number of M/T cells detected in our experiments (n = 310). The random dataset was generated based on the external plexiform layer (EPL) volume from one of the OBs analyzed. Using Matlab, we randomized eight times the number of cells of each OB clone in the EPL volume (n = 112 simulations). Using the same procedure, we randomized 17 times the number of pyramidal neurons of each neocortical clone (n = 102 simulations). The volume of one neocortex clone, representative of the average, was used as a volume boundary. Data are presented as average ± standard deviation, and statistical differences in the clone distribution were determined using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).</p><p>The division of the OB into dorsal and ventral domains was based on the expression of the NQO1 and OCAM markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) based on the previous published results (see Figure 7 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2007</xref> and Figure 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imamura et al., 2011</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stephen Liberles (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers noted that the work was interesting and the data generally convincing, but also indicated that additional experiments were needed to support principal conclusions. Reviewer comments are attached in their entirety below, but a few specific points are highlighted to help focus your revision efforts.</p><p>1) All reviewers asked for more validation that all mitral cells could be labeled by the approach. This is important given that dedicated subsets of mitral cells might be relevant for innate behaviors, and that such neurons might be born at different times, in different locations (dorsal/ventral), or not be marked in Nestin-Cre mice.</p><p>2) Reviewers 2/3 also ask for analysis of central projections, (reviewer 3 mentions the cortical amygdala as it has been implicated in innate behaviors). Are the central projections of different clonal populations indistinguishable from global mitral cell projections across higher order olfactory nuclei?</p><p>3) Reviewers also inquire about sister cells within the AOB, and whether sisters can be distributed among both the AOB and MOB. Is the logic underlying glomerulus connectivity of AOB sister cells distinct?</p><p>Please see all comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors use a genetic approach to visualize small groups of olfactory projection neurons with a putatively clonal origin. They find that neurons from the same putative clone can project to different glomeruli, and as such, they are likely relevant for different odor responses. These findings argue against lineage-based determinism underlying mitral cell identity. Given the large number of glomeruli, and the ability of the olfactory map to expand and contract with receptor number, lineage-based models do not seem likely from the get-go; that said, I am not sure whether lineage models have formally been challenged in the mouse. Certainly, the notion that glomerulus innervation occurs through an at least partially stochastic mechanism is an intuitive and attractive model, and the authors present data that is at least consistent with this idea. These findings are also consistent with recent work indicating that the receptor-guided spatial map in the olfactory bulb is discarded in the piriform cortex. It should be noted that it is possible that neuron specification occurs after time points of clonal expansion measured here, or in smaller subsets of neurons not detectable here (as the authors discuss).</p><p>I only have one technical point. The authors should provide additional evidence that clonal populations are being analyzed. They report ~20 projection neurons labeled per olfactory bulb, and 16/29 olfactory bulbs with labeled cells. Is only one clone (and thus one fluorophore) detected in all ~20 neurons from each of these 16 bulbs? In a table, provide the exact distribution of mitral cells with different fluorophores from each mouse as this information is essential for assessing the extent of clonality and whether the assumption at the end of the second paragraph of subsection “Labeling of progenitors of OB projection neurons” is valid. Conclusions depend on an absence of multiple independent labeling events.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Summary:</p><p>Using a genetic strategy to sparsely label neural progenitors, Sánchez-Guardado and Lois found that sister olfactory bulb mitral/tufted cells innervate multiple glomeruli distributed across the olfactory bulb. This paper has relevance to the general problem of understanding how the bulb wires up, and implications for the organization of projections connecting the bulb to the cortex.</p><p>Experimental Concerns:</p><p>1) Previous work, such as Imamura et al., (2011, 2015), has shown that early-generated mitral cells (E10) cells are distributed more in dorsal domain of the olfactory bulb, whereas late-generated mitral (E12~13) cells are preferentially distributed in ventral domain. Given this, it is important to examine multiple timepoints for tamoxifen injection and ask if there are any timing-dependent changes in clonal distribution of mitral/tufted cells (e.g. test additional embryonic timepoints in addition to E10.5).</p><p>2) It is not clear if all the mitral/tufted cells are generated from Nestin-positive RGCs. This is important because otherwise the results shown here may miss subpopulations of more restricted or distributed sister mitral/tufted cells. Using Nestin-Cre or giving more tamoxifen can answer this.</p><p>3) The small number of clones (typically 1) labeled at a single time-point makes it hard to interpret their results as actually representative throughout the olfactory bulb. They authors should quantify or demonstrate to what extent their clones uniformly cover the olfactory bulb. In addition, more images of the clones themselves would be useful.</p><p>4) In addition to asking about the bulb, this work affords the opportunity to look at connectivity and organization in cortex. Given that prior work (e.g. Miyamichi et al., 2011; Sosulski et al., 2011) suggests that M/T cells innervating a single glomerulus project diffusely across olfactory regions, the authors could provide an explanation for these findings by examining the projection patterns of sister M/T cells, which they should be able to do by looking at downstream olfactory bulb targets of the clones labeled in this study.</p><p>5) The authors should examine if sister mitral/tufted cells were distributed across dorsal and ventral domains (as labeled with Nqo1 and OCAM, respectively) or they were specific to either domain.

By using an elegant transgenic system, the authors sparsely labeled M/T cell progenitors to study whether sister M/T cells connect to the same glomerulus.

It will be quite interesting to examine whether the sister M/T cells send their axons to the same area in the olfactory cortex (OC). It will also strengthen the paper if the authors could discuss more about the connectivity of M/T cells regarding possible mechanisms that mediate partner matching with glomeruli.

This is important given that dedicated subsets of mitral cells might be relevant for innate behaviors, and that such neurons might be born at different times, in different locations (dorsal/ventral), or not be marked in Nestin-Cre mice.</p></disp-quote><p>a) Are there different subsets of M/T cells born at different times with different characteristics?</p><p>We initially focused at embryonic day 10.5 because according to the existing literature, this is the time in which the majority of M/T cells are born (Hinds, 1968a, 1968b; Blanchart et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2011; Imamura et al., 2011). In our original submission, all data were derived from labeling E10.5 progenitors. The reviewers raised the question of whether clonally related cells born from later progenitors may produce sister M/T cells that innervate the same glomerulus. We analyzed a later time point of tamoxifen administration (E12.5) and have observed that sister M/T cells born from this E12.5 progenitors do not receive synaptic input from the same glomerulus. These new data are included in a new figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>b) Are there progenitors that produce subsets of M/T cells preferentially destined to occupy the dorsal or ventral regions of the bulb?</p><p>We have analyzed the distribution of clones of M/T cells born both at E10.5 and E12.5. We have observed that at both of these time points there are clones preferentially located in the dorsal domain, in the ventral domain and clones with no preference for either dorsal or ventral domains. Moreover, when all clones are analyzed together, we did not observe any preference for distribution in the dorsal or ventral domains. These new data are now included in a new figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 (E10.5), and Figure 3—figure supplement 4 (E12.5))</p><p>c) Are all M/T cells labeled in Nestin-cre mice?</p><p>We agree that these are important questions and we have performed additional experiments to address them. Below we will reply to these questions in order:</p><p>To address this question, we have performed two complementary experiments.</p><p>First, according to the literature, progenitors for M/T cells are located in the rostralmost region of the forebrain, also called the presumptive olfactory bulb. As suggested by one of the reviewers we crossed the <italic>Nestin-cre</italic> mouse with the <italic>Ai9</italic> mouse strain, a highly sensitive loxP-cre reporter that expresses tdTomato upon cre mediated recombination. When we analyzed these animals at E10.5 we observed that all neuronal progenitors (identified by the expression of Pax6 and RC2 markers) are also positive for tdTomato. This observation indicates that the <italic>Nestin-cre</italic> can activate recombination of a loxP-reporter in all neuronal progenitors located in the presumptive OB at the time when we labeled the clones of M/T cells that we analyzed in the OB. These new data are presented in a new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 2)</p><p>Second, we analyzed the expression of the tdTomato marker in the OB in a postnatal day 7 mice carrying the <italic>Nestin-cre</italic> and <italic>Ai9</italic> reporter alleles. We observed that all M/T cells analyzed (identified by the expression of the M/T cells marker Tbx21) are also positive for the tdTomato marker. These new data are presented in a new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewers 2/3 also ask for analysis of central projections, (reviewer 3 mentions the cortical amygdala as it has been implicated in innate behaviors). Are the central projections of different clonal populations indistinguishable from global mitral cell projections across higher order olfactory nuclei?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this is an interesting question, and we included a brief discussion of this possibility in our original submission. The reason why we only mentioned this as a possibility, but we decided not to present any data in this regard is because with the currently available transgenic mice it is not possible to reliably address this issue. Recently, several works have traced the final destination of axons originating from M/T cells locally labeled in the OB (Sosulski et al., 2011, Ghosh et al., 2011, Igarashi et al., 2012). Although there are transgenic mice that can be used to selectively label neocortical progenitors (such as <italic>Emx1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>), currently there are no transgenic mice capable of selective labeling of M/T progenitors. Because of this limitation, to label progenitors of M/T cells we used the <italic>Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mice that labels all neuronal progenitors throughout the brain. Therefore, when we induce cre recombination in these mice we label, not only M/T progenitors but also many other progenitors in other brain regions, including the olfactory cortex and other brain regions with neurons whose axons project into the olfactory cortex. When we attempted to analyze the trajectories of axons in the olfactory cortex we observed some local neurons labeled in the olfactory cortex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1F</xref>, illustrating a labeled neuron in the olfactory cortex). These neurons have axons that extended locally within the olfactory cortex, and this makes it extremely challenging to discern whether a given labeled axon in the olfactory cortex belongs to a M/T cell from the OB, or to local neurons in the olfactory cortex. Thus, we did not attempt to trace the destination of axons in the olfactory cortex because we could not unambiguously identify the cells from which they originated. As an example, we attach confocal images from two brains as examples of axons in the olfactory cortex that illustrate this challenge.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Axons in olfactory cortical regions.</title><p>(A-F) Confocal images of the axons in the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), in two different brains, at different anterior-posterior levels of the brain in coronal sections.

Is the logic underlying glomerulus connectivity of AOB sister cells distinct?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question, especially because the AOB is thought to process smells involved in innate behaviors, which could be genetically programmed. In our initial submission we decided to exclusively focus on the relationship between lineage and connectivity for M/T cells in the MOB, because identifying the connectivity of dendrites in the MOB is unambiguous, but the anatomical characteristics of the AOB make it a less reliable system where to study this question. In the MOB, M/T cells have a single apical dendrite that projects into a single, well-defined glomerulus. The AOB has a critical caveat to study questions related to synaptic connectivity because its glomeruli are not well defined, and thus, are difficult to identify. In addition, we also observed that whereas the number of cells per clone in the MOB was (on average) 20 cells, for the AOB the clone size was much smaller (between 1-3 per AOB). Taking into account these limitations we now include these data in the revised manuscript. However, we think that given these caveats we thought that it would be important to temper any interpretation, as follows: “Although the small number of labeled AOB M/T cells does not allow us to draw any firm conclusions, we did not find any M/T cells whose apical dendrites innervated the same glomerulus (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), similar to what we observed in the MOB”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please see all comments below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I only have one technical point. The authors should provide additional evidence that clonal populations are being analyzed. They report ~20 projection neurons labeled per olfactory bulb, and 16/29 olfactory bulbs with labeled cells. Is only one clone (and thus one fluorophore) detected in all ~20 neurons from each of these 16 bulbs? In a table, provide the exact distribution of mitral cells with different fluorophores from each mouse as this information is essential for assessing the extent of clonality and whether the assumption at the end of the second paragraph of subsection “Labeling of progenitors of OB projection neurons” is valid. Conclusions depend on an absence of multiple independent labeling events.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a valuable addition to the ms., and we have now included all these data in two new supplementary figures (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 4). In these figures we show all the clones obtained by labeling at E10.5 and E12.5, and we indicate the following: (i) the 3D reconstructions of the OBs illustrating the distribution of each labeled M/T cell through the bulb, including the potential bias towards a dorsal or ventral domains, (ii) the number of cells labeled in each putative clone, and (iii) the fluorophore of each clone, including those bulbs that contain cells labeled with 2 fluorophores.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Experimental Concerns:</p><p>1) Previous work, such as Imamura et al., (2011, 2015), has shown that early-generated mitral cells (E10) cells are distributed more in dorsal domain of the olfactory bulb, whereas late-generated mitral (E12~13) cells are preferentially distributed in ventral domain. Given this, it is important to examine multiple timepoints for tamoxifen injection and ask if there are any timing-dependent changes in clonal distribution of mitral/tufted cells (e.g. test additional embryonic timepoints in addition to E10.5).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by this reviewed we have performed new experiments in which TMX was administered at E12.5. These new data are now shown in a new figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). Again, as suggested by the reviewer we have analyzed the distribution of the labeled M/T cells to investigate for a possible bias towards the dorsal or ventral regions of the OB from the clones labeled at E10.5 and E12.5. These new data are shown in two figures: Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 4.</p><p>We have observed that at both of these time points there are clones preferentially located in the dorsal regions, in the ventral regions and clones with no preference for either dorsal or ventral regions. Moreover, when all E10.5 clones are analyzed together, we do not observe any clear preference for distribution in the dorsal or ventral regions. For the clones labeled at E12.5 there is tendency towards labeled M/T cells to occupy more ventral regions of the OB (consistent with Imamura et al. data), but the statistical analysis reveals that these differences do not reach significance.</p><p>Imamura et al., (2011) show that E10 generated M/T cells have a bias towards the rostral regions of the OB, in an approximate ratio of 1 (dorsal) to 0.75 ventral. Similarly, the M/T cells generated at E12 have an approximate bias of 0.6 (dorsal) to 1 (ventral). In their experiments, they labeled M/T progenitors with thymidine analogs (brdu, IDU and CiDU), and presumably their samples included thousands of cells which allowed them to perform a robust statistical analysis. For our experimental design it was crucial to label a small number of clones per bulb (ideally a single clone per bulb), which resulted in a small number of total cells labeled, even combining all the animals studied. As mentioned above, our analysis of progenitors labeled at E12.5 may suggest that those late-generated clones could have a bias ventral as demonstrated by Imamura et al., (2011). We would like to point out that the main objective of clonal analysis is to identify lineage relationships between cells, or their distribution within a single clone. However, the small sample numbers provided by clonal analysis are not well suited to provide information about the distribution of all the neurons in a cohort born in a given day, a type of data for which the birthday dating method used by Imamura et al., (2011) is best suited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear if all the mitral/tufted cells are generated from Nestin-positive RGCs. This is important because otherwise the results shown here may miss subpopulations of more restricted or distributed sister mitral/tufted cells. Using Nestin-Cre or giving more tamoxifen can answer this.</p></disp-quote><p>Of the 2 strategies suggested by this reviewer, we chose to use the <italic>Nestin-cre</italic> x <italic>Ai9</italic> because increasing the dose of TMX into pregnant females triggers abortions (see Danielian et al., 1998; Ved et al., 2019). As suggested by this reviewer, we crossed the driver <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> mouse with the reporter <italic>Ai9</italic> mouse. In postnatal animals (P7), all M/T cells in the <italic>Nestin-cre::Ai9</italic> mice were labeled in the MOB (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The small number of clones (typically 1) labeled at a single time-point makes it hard to interpret their results as actually representative throughout the olfactory bulb.</p></disp-quote><p>1a) Labeling of single clones per bulb:</p><p>Labeling a single clone per bulb is necessary to increase the likelihood that all the sister cells labeled belong to a single clone. In our experiments we used the Confetti mice because this strain can produce clones in 4 different distinguishable markers. With this strain, even if 2 clones are labeled in an olfactory bulb and each clone is labeled with a different color, one can infer that these are 2 independent clones, originating from individual progenitors. However, if several clones are labeled per olfactory bulb (for example, 5 clones in one bulb) some of the clones will be labeled with the same color thus making it impossible to discern how many individual clones are labeled.</p><p>1b) Labeling at different time points:</p><p>As suggested by this reviewer we have performed additional experiments to label clones at a later time point, E12.5. We have observed that, as expected, the number of cells per clone is smaller at E12.5 compared with E10.5. However, the characteristics of the clones are similar in these 2 time points. As we mentioned in response to point 1 from the reviewer, both at E10.5 and E12.5 we find clones where the sister cells are mostly located ventrally or dorsally, but we also find clones where the sister cells are distributed throughout all the bulb regions without any clear bias. In aggregate, when all clones are analyzed together, we do not observe any clear preference for distribution in the dorsal or ventral regions. These new data are shown in two new figures (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 4).</p><p>1c) Are the clones observed representative?:</p><p>We mention in the discussion that it is theoretically possible that there may exist some clones where the sister cells project to the same glomerulus, that those clones may be rare and that we could we have not been able to label those putative clones in our experiments. However, the analysis of the clones that we have studied reveals several commonalities: (i) the M/T cells are not concentrated in defined regions of the bulb, and instead, they are distributed throughout large volumes, (ii) none of the sister M/T cells in one clone project to the same glomerulus, (iii) the size of the clones ranges between 12 and 33 M/T cells, and between 3 and 22 M/T cells, when labeling at E10.5 and E12.5, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They authors should quantify or demonstrate to what extent their clones uniformly cover the olfactory bulb.

Given that prior work (e.g. Miyamichi et al., 2011; Sosulski et al., 2011) suggests that M/T cells innervating a single glomerulus project diffusely across olfactory regions, the authors could provide an explanation for these findings by examining the projection patterns of sister M/T cells, which they should be able to do by looking at downstream olfactory bulb targets of the clones labeled in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in the general comment to all reviewers, this is an interesting question, and we included a brief discussion of this possibility in our original submission. The reason why we only mentioned this as a possibility but we decided not to present any data in this regard is because with the currently available transgenic mice it is not possible to reliably address this issue.

These data suggest that in our experiments we are labeling the same M/T progenitors at E10.5 and E12.5, but that at a later time points those progenitors have already produced much of its progeny.

As this paper presents basically negative results, adding some positive data as to a role of cell lineage in forming M/T-cell circuits would strengthen the paper. It will be quite interesting to examine whether the sister M/T cells send their axons to the same area in the olfactory cortex (OC).</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in the general comment to all reviewers, this is an interesting question, and we included a brief discussion of this possibility in our original submission. The reason why we only mentioned this as a possibility, but we decided not to present any data in this regard is because with the currently available transgenic mice it is not possible to reliably address this issue. Recently, several works have traced the final destination of axons originating from M/T cells locally labeled in the OB (Sosulski et al., 2011, Ghosh et al., 2011, Igarashi et al., 2012). Although there are transgenic mice that can be used to selectively label neocortical progenitors (such as <italic>Emx1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>), currently there are no transgenic mice capable of selective labeling of M/T progenitors. Because of this limitation, to label progenitors of M/T cells we used the <italic>Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mice that labels all neuronal progenitors throughout the brain. Therefore, when we induce cre recombination in these mice we label, not only M/T progenitors but also many other progenitors in other brain regions, including the olfactory cortex and other brain regions with neurons whose axons project into the olfactory cortex. When we attempted to analyze the trajectories of axons in the olfactory cortex we observed some local neurons labeled in the olfactory cortex (see reviewer Figure 1F, illustrating a labeled neuron in the olfactory cortex). These neurons have axons that extended locally within the olfactory cortex, and this makes it extremely challenging to discern whether a given labeled axon in the olfactory cortex belongs to a M/T from the OB, or to local neurons in the olfactory cortex. Thus, we did not attempt to trace the destination of axons in the olfactory cortex because we could not unambiguously identify the cells from which they originated. As an example, we attach confocal images from two brains as examples of axons in the olfactory cortex that illustrate this challenge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It will also strengthen the paper if the authors could discuss more about the connectivity of M/T cells regarding possible mechanisms that mediate partner matching with glomeruli.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important issue, and have added a long paragraph discussing this issue immediately after presenting our data (see subsection “Synaptic input of sister M/T cells”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments are as follows:</p><p>1) In Figure 4, some examples are shown for sister M/T cells connecting to different glomeruli. Are there any differences in sister-cell distribution between the innate and non-innate OB regions?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. Some works have suggested that the dorsal and ventral regions of the olfactory bulb preferentially process innate and learned odorants, respectively. We have analyzed the distribution of M/T cells clones born both at E10.5 and E12.5. We have observed that at both of these time points there are clones preferentially located in the dorsal domain, in the ventral domain, and clones with no preference for either dorsal or ventral domains. Moreover, when all clones are analyzed together, we do not observe any preference for M/T cells distribution in the dorsal or ventral domains. These new data are now included in a new figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 (E10.5), and Figure 3—figure supplement 4 (E12.5))</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is it possible to determine when and where the sister cells are derived during embryonic development?</p></disp-quote><p>The information that can be obtained from clonal analysis regards the relationship between the sister cells that are derived from a single progenitor. The main objective of our study was to investigate whether sister M/T cells receive synaptic input from a single glomerulus, and our data indicates that they do not. However, as in any clonal analysis experiment, we cannot say anything about the position of the specific progenitor that generated those mature cells, because those progenitors disappear as such when they differentiate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Even if sister cells do not connect to the same glomerulus, are there any shared characteristics and common features in their gene expression (particularly for axon guidance molecules), OC projection (particularly to the amygdala), and firing patterns?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that our main interest was to investigate the possible relationship between lineage and synaptic input, which we believe is a central question in developmental neuroscience.

However, we believe that those questions, although interesting, are not the main question of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is worth examining M/T cells in the accessory OB where all M/T-cell circuits are hard-wired to mediate innate pheromone responses?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question, especially because the AOB is thought to process smells involved in innate behaviors, which could be genetically programmed. In our initial submission we decided to exclusively focus on the relationship between lineage and connectivity for M/T cells in the MOB, because identifying the connectivity of dendrites in the MOB is unambiguous, but the anatomical characteristics of the AOB make it a less reliable system where to study this question. In the MOB, M/T cells have a single dendrite that projects into a single, well-defined glomerulus. The AOB has a critical caveat to study questions related to synaptic connectivity because its glomeruli are not well defined, and thus, are difficult to identify. In addition, we also observed that whereas the number of cells per clone in the MOB was (on average) 20 cells, for the AOB we clone size was much smaller (between 1-3 per AOB). Taking into account these limitations we now mention these data in the revised manuscript as follows: “Although the small number of labeled AOB M/T cells does not allow us to draw any firm conclusions, we did not find any M/T cells whose apical dendrites innervated the same glomerulus (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), similar to what we observed in the MOB”.</p><p><italic>5) In the last part of Discussion section, the authors list interesting future questions. This paper would be significantly strengthened if any results could be added regarding these questions, particularly for connectivity to the amygdala.</italic></p><p>We agree, and we attempted to perform this experiment. However, as we explained above the currently available transgenic do not allow us to reliably trace the projection of the axons of sister M/T into the olfactory cortex and amygdala.</p></body></sub-article></article>
