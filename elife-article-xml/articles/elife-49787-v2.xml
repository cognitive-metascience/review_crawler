in Gram-negative bacteria and its counterparts in mitochondria and chloroplasts fold and insert outer membrane β-barrel proteins. BamA, an essential component of the complex, is itself a β-barrel and is proposed to play a central role in assembling other barrel substrates. Here, we map the path of substrate insertion by the Bam complex using site-specific crosslinking to understand the molecular mechanisms that control β-barrel folding and release. We find that the C-terminal strand of the substrate is stably held by BamA and that the N-terminal strands of the substrate are assembled inside the BamA β-barrel. Importantly, we identify contacts between the assembling β-sheet and the BamA interior surface that determine the rate of substrate folding. Our results support a model in which the interior wall of BamA acts as a chaperone to catalyze β-barrel assembly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>outer membrane</kwd><kwd>gram-negative bacteria</kwd><kwd>beta barrel</kwd><kwd>membrane protein folding</kwd><kwd>Bam complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI081059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomasek</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Santos</surname><given-names>Thiago M A</given-names></name><name><surname>May</surname><given-names>Mary D</given-names></name><name><surname>Meuskens</surname><given-names>Ina</given-names></name><name><surname>Kahne</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31GM116210</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI132120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>May</surname><given-names>Mary D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hanna H Gray Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santos</surname><given-names>Thiago M A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Outer membrane β-barrel proteins in Gram-negative bacteria are assembled within the lumen of the BamA β-barrel.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major challenge in cell biology is to understand how proteins are incorporated into membranes. Transmembrane proteins can be divided into two main classes: α-helical bundles and β-barrels. Membrane incorporation of proteins with α-helical transmembrane segments has been studied extensively and is accomplished by the Sec machine, which functions in the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rapoport et al., 2017</xref>). In an α-helix, the backbone hydrogen bonds are internally satisfied, allowing a single α-helix to exist stably in a membrane, given that the side chains are compatible. β-barrel transmembrane proteins, which comprise a variable number of anti-parallel β-strands wrapped into a cylinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koebnik et al., 2000</xref>), are found in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. These proteins are involved in a range of functions, including the creation of pores to allow passage of diverse molecules across the membrane. Their assembly is thus essential for maintaining the integrity of the cell envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruiz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voulhoux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). A β-stranded structure is thought to be stable in the membrane only as a completely folded and closed β-barrel in which the N- and C-terminal β-strands are joined via hydrogen bonding and the membrane-exposed exterior surface is hydrophobic. Despite their importance, the mechanism by which β-barrel transmembrane proteins are folded is not well understood.</p><p>In Gram-negative bacteria, the β-<underline>b</underline>arrel <underline>a</underline>ssembly <underline>m</underline>achine (Bam) complex accelerates the folding and membrane integration of β-barrel transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hagan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). Analogous machines exist in the outer membranes of mitochondria (Sam50, for <underline>s</underline>orting and <underline>a</underline>ssembly <underline>m</underline>achinery) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gentle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paschen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wiedemann et al., 2003</xref>) and another is proposed to exist in the outer membranes of chloroplasts (OEP80, <underline>o</underline>uter <underline>e</underline>nvelope <underline>p</underline>rotein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Töpel et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> the Bam complex is composed of five proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sklar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). The core of the complex is BamA, an essential protein that belongs to the Omp85 superfamily of outer membrane proteins that function as protein translocation or assembly factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gentle et al., 2005</xref>) and is conserved across all Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinz and Lithgow, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Webb et al., 2012</xref>). BamA contains five N-terminal soluble periplasmic <underline>po</underline>lypeptide <underline>tr</underline>ansport-<underline>a</underline>ssociated (POTRA) domains and a C-terminal β-barrel transmembrane domain. The POTRA domains act as a scaffold that mediates interaction with four lipoproteins (BamB, BamC, BamD, and BamE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Together, the periplasmic components of the complex create a protein vestibule beneath the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakelar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2016</xref>). Although all four lipoproteins contribute to efficient folding, only BamD is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malinverni et al., 2006</xref>) and found in all Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinz and Lithgow, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Webb et al., 2012</xref>). The Bam complex accelerates folding of β-barrels containing vastly different amino acid sequences and numbers of β-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doerner and Sousa, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hagan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagan and Kahne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iadanza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Plummer and Fleming, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roman-Hernandez et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, this machine must accelerate folding by exploiting features common to its diverse substrates.</p><p>The prevailing model for folding is based on structures showing an open seam in the BamA barrel where the N- and C-terminal strands interact. It has been suggested that β-hairpins in the substrate assemble at the seam in what has been described as the ‘budding model’ because the nascent substrate barrel grows into the membrane as new strands are added at the seam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Höhr et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noinaj et al., 2014</xref>). A budding model has also been proposed for the mitochondrial ortholog of BamA called Sam50. It has been demonstrated that peptide substrate fragments crosslink strongly to the N-terminus of the Sam50 barrel and more weakly to its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Höhr et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these experiments and the known structures of BamA, it was concluded that new β-strands were being added at the seam in accordance with the ‘budding model’. An alternative model holds that an extensive region of β-sheet assembles in the periplasm at the POTRA domains of BamA with one end of the sheet held by one end of the seam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doerner and Sousa, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schiffrin et al., 2017a</xref>). These models have focused largely how folding is initiated with less attention paid to explaining how folding is completed and substrates released.</p><p>Here, we have studied the folding of a large β-barrel, LptD, and variants that fold more slowly. LptD, a component of the <underline>l</underline>ipo<underline>p</underline>olysaccharide <underline>t</underline>ransport machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braun and Silhavy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sampson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2006</xref>), is one of the two essential β-barrel proteins in <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> the other being BamA itself. LptD contains 26 β-strands, and must fold around a globular lipoprotein, LptE, which acts as a plug within the β-barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freinkman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>). LptD is useful as a model substrate for the Bam complex because it folds much more slowly (several orders of magnitude) than smaller β-barrel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ureta et al., 2007</xref>) making the process of folding more accessible for study than for other substrates. Moreover, we have previously identified a variant of LptD lacking a 23-amino acid stretch within β-strand seven and extracellular loop four (LptD4213) that accumulates as a late stage folding intermediate that can complete folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we take advantage of these slow folding substrates and in vivo crosslinking to identify contacts between folding intermediates and the Bam complex. The major conclusion from these crosslinking experiments is that LptD, in the process of folding, forms extensive contacts with the concave interior wall of the BamA β-barrel.</p><p>Thus, in contrast to either the budding or periplasmic models for folding, our evidence indicates that folding is catalyzed in the interior of the BamA β-barrel. In agreement with earlier models we show that the substrate LptD is held at its C-terminus through a stable interaction with BamA. In our model, however, the β-hairpins do not form at the lateral gate but rather form inside the BamA β-barrel, generating an extensive β-sheet as folding proceeds from the C-terminus towards the N-terminus. Here we present evidence that release of the N-terminus from the interior wall of BamA ultimately allows substrate β-barrel closure and insertion into the membrane. Importantly, we show that changes to residues in the interior of BamA can accelerate folding, leading us to conclude that it serves as an active site that catalyzes folding. Our results establish a model for β-barrel assembly by the Bam complex where the catalyst for β-strand formation is the interior surface of the BamA barrel.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The interior surface and lateral gate of the BamA β-barrel form a binding site for substrates</title><p>We first sought to identify regions of the Bam complex that interact with LptD substrates. Individual components of the Bam complex can interact with substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennion et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gessmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hagan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ieva and Bernstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pavlova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Plummer and Fleming, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ricci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schiffrin et al., 2017b</xref>), but how these interactions facilitate folding is unknown. Because it is essential, is conserved across all Gram-negative bacteria, and is the only transmembrane component in the Bam complex, we decided to focus on the role of the BamA β-barrel. We substituted residues throughout the BamA β-barrel with the unnatural amino acid para-benzoyl phenylalanine (pBPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chin et al., 2002</xref>) to capture interactions between BamA and the substrates LptD and LptD4213. LptD4213 stalls as a late-stage folding intermediate during its assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). This substrate was chosen because we expected that the longer residence time of LptD4213 on the Bam complex would allow for more efficient crosslink formation. We introduced pBPA substitutions at the lateral gate of BamA, where the N- and C-termini of the β-barrel meet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and within the sixth extracellular loop (L6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) because both the lateral gate and L6 were previously proposed to be important in the mechanism of substrate assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bamert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Höhr et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leonard-Rivera and Misra, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noinaj et al., 2014</xref>).

The crosslinks at the lateral gate and L6 provide the first demonstration that these regions in BamA interact directly with substrate, but are consistent with other findings suggesting that these regions in the Omp85 superfamily members contact substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bamert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Höhr et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>If β-barrel substrates come in close contact with L6, which resides in the interior of BamA near the lateral gate, then substrates might insert directly at the lateral gate of BamA as previously suggested or might first enter the interior of the BamA β-barrel. The BamA interior surface has not been previously probed for interactions with substrates so we introduced pBPA at 18 positions spanning this surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Of those, we identified nine residues across β-strands two, four, five, seven and ten that showed UV-dependent crosslinks to substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These nine residues and all but one of the four residues described above have their side chains oriented towards the interior of the BamA β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The exception, F804, resides at the C-terminal edge of the lateral gate where the N- and C-terminal ends of the BamA β-barrel interact. Together, the residues that directly interact with substrate form an extensive surface that includes a substantial portion of the interior wall of the BamA β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, several interacting residues, including G528, G530, and K610, are located directly opposite of the lateral gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). This is an important observation because it is not consistent with the proposal that the β-strands of substrates are sequentially added to the nascent β-barrel via interactions that occur between β-strands 1 and 16 at the BamA lateral gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Höhr et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noinaj et al., 2014</xref>). Because our results show that the LptD4213 substrate forms interactions with the interior surface of BamA far from the lateral gate, substrates may begin to fold inside the BamA β-barrel before exiting through the lateral gate of BamA into the membrane.</p><p>Next, we asked whether full-length native substrates make the same contacts to BamA as the stalled substrate (LptD4213) during their assembly. Under native expression conditions, we did not observe crosslinks from BamA to wild-type LptD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). However, because crosslinking efficiency depends on the residence time a substrate is bound, we speculated that the crosslinking intensity might simply be too low to observe by immunoblotting. Therefore, we selected three representative sites at different locations within BamA (positions 439, 610, and 666 within the lateral gate, interior wall, and L6, respectively) that crosslinked to LptD4213. We assessed crosslinking to wild-type LptD that was expressed at higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Under these conditions, we observed UV-dependent crosslinks to the substrate at all three sites. Additionally, we observed crosslinks to other overexpressed smaller β-barrel substrates, including OmpF and LamB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the lateral gate, interior wall, and L6 of BamA, which all contact LptD4213 during its folding, also contact diverse native β-barrel substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Our results imply that faster-folding native substrates follow a similar folding pathway as the slow-folding LptD4213.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The interior of the BamA β-barrel forms a general substrate binding site.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) The interior of the BamA β-barrel interacts with a diverse number of wild-type, full-length substrates including (<bold>A</bold>) LptD and (<bold>B</bold>) LamB and OmpF.

Because BamA interacts with residues that would be involved in maintaining the closure of substrate once folded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), one function of BamA during assembly may be to bind substrates to prevent their premature release.</p><p>Next, we introduced pBPA substitutions farther away from the N-terminus of LptD. We tested 12 additional residues in β-strands four through six and the associated extracellular loops, which are N-terminal of the 23-residue deletion in LptD4213 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The same substitutions were introduced into the wild-type substrate. Overall, the crosslinks to LptD4213 were more intense than for the wildtype substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), as expected given the longer residence time of LptD4213 on Bam. We also noted that the crosslink intensities from several residues in β-strands four, five, and six of LptD4213 varied in a periodic pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). For example, in strand four crosslinking from residues W272 and F276 was more intense than from residue E275 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left) and in strand five crosslinking intensities were greater for L289 and Y291 than for D290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, middle). We did not observe periodicity in crosslinking intensities from strands one, two, and three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The periodicity or lack thereof implies that strands four, five and six have organized into a β-stranded structure but strands one, two, and three have not. Because we found an extensive surface within the interior of BamA that interacts with substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we propose that strands four, five, and six of the substrate are housed in the BamA barrel during the stall.

If this model is correct, it should be possible to form bidirectional crosslinks between the corresponding regions of BamA and the substrate. We substituted residues in BamA and LptD4213 with cysteines and probed for crosslink formation between the two proteins after treatment with 1,4-bis(maleimido)butane (BMB, 11 Å linker) and purification of crosslinked adducts formed by the two proteins.

A model in which BamA catalyzes folding against its interior wall requires a rationale for how such an extensively bound substrate can be released once folding is complete. We and others have shown that no energy is required for folding on the Bam complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doerner and Sousa, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hagan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iadanza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patel and Kleinschmidt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Plummer and Fleming, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roman-Hernandez et al., 2014</xref>), and indeed, there is no ATP in the periplasm. The stalled complex provides a clue to the release mechanism. In fully-folded, wild-type LptD, L4 interacts with both the N- and C-termini of the β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that this loop stabilizes the released product relative to the late-stage intermediate that makes extensive contacts with the interior of BamA. When this loop is missing, as is the case in LptD4213, the interactions that normally stabilize the closed β-barrel are absent, and the relative energies of the BamA-associated intermediate and the fully closed β-barrel change such that the substrate stalls on the Bam complex at a late stage of folding.</p><p>This model predicts that mutations that destabilize the interactions between the N-terminus of LptD4213 and the interior of BamA may allow for release from the machine. An N274I amino acid substitution in LptD4213 was previously identified in a genetic selection for mutations that rescue permeability defects associated with LptD4213 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruiz et al., 2005</xref>). N274 is in β-strand four of the folded β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, left) with its polar side chain embedded within a nonpolar surface oriented towards the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right). Because our studies here identified crosslinks to BamA from β-strands flanking β-strand 4, we predicted that β-strand four itself would also interact with the interior wall of BamA. In β-strand 4, the side chains of residues 272 and 276 lie adjacent to that of residue 274 and are oriented towards the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, pBPA substitutions at these positions should form crosslinks to BamA. To test this hypothesis, we replaced these residues with pBPA in both LptD and LptD4213 and probed for crosslinking to BamA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Substitution at W272 and F276, two residues flanking N274, generated strong crosslinks to BamA in both wild-type LptD and the LptD4213 variant; weak crosslinks were also observed for both proteins after substitution of N274 with pBPA. These results suggest that β-strand 4 of LptD is bound to the interior wall of BamA during folding. Furthermore substitutions in β-strand four that disrupt polar contacts to the interior wall of BamA shorten the residence of the substrate at this binding site.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Substrate release from the interior wall of BamA allows β-barrel closure, triggering release from the Bam complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) N274 resides within a large hydrophobic patch that encompasses at least six β-strands at the N-terminal region of the LptD β-barrel.

Because weaker crosslinking can indicate a shorter residence time, we speculated that the N274I suppressor weakens the affinity of the N-terminus of LptD for BamA. To test this possibility, we replaced residue 276, which is in the middle of β-strand four and faces outward, with pBPA in the LptD4213 N274I mutant. No crosslinking from this residue to BamA was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), consistent with a more transient interaction of β-strand four with the interior wall in the N274I variant. The N274I mutation evidently destabilizes the BamA-associated intermediate so that it is released more rapidly from the interior wall of BamA. Therefore, the ability of the N274I mutation to rescue folding is consistent with a release mechanism in which the intermediate is bound to BamA until folding has progressed to the point where the N- and C-termini are proximal. At this point, substrate β-barrel closure is promoted by interactions of the N- and C-terminal β-strands with loop 4, and the substrate detaches from the interior wall of BamA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A slow folding LptD mutant is rescued by a compensatory mutation in the interior wall of BamA</title><p>We sought to test our model for BamA binding and release of substrates through rational design of slow-folding mutants and identification of compensatory mutations that rescue these folding defects. Because we have proposed that L4 plays a crucial role in stabilizing the folded substrate, we deleted a single amino acid at the start of loop 4 (D330) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) with the expectation that this change would alter the disposition of the loop. Because the LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> substrate contains only a single amino acid deletion, it is more similar to wild-type LptD than the LptD4213 variant with its 23 amino acid deletion. Nevertheless, if the L4 loop is important for release because it stabilizes the folded β-barrel, then changing its orientation should affect folding.</p><p>We expressed either wild-type LptD, LptD4213, or LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> from a plasmid in otherwise wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> and plated the strains on media with or without vancomycin to probe for changes in outer membrane integrity.

We found that expression of LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> increased susceptibility to vancomycin, consistent with impaired LptD assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, top three lanes). Since these strains also contain a second functional copy of LptD, the increased permeability conferred by LptD4213 and LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> is not result of a lack of functional LptD translocons, but from a pore formed by the defective substrate. Next, we probed residence time of LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> on the Bam complex using crosslinking and observed that this variant formed strong crosslinks from the N-terminus of LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> to BamA, similar to LptD4213 and distinct from the wild-type LptD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, left panel). Therefore, LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup>, like LptD4213, has a longer residence time on BamA than wild-type LptD. Importantly, addition of the intragenic N274I substitution in LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> restored outer membrane barrier function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

LptD contains two disulfide bonds that, during its assembly, convert from an intermediate state containing consecutive disulfide bonds ([1,2] LptD) to the mature state containing nonconsecutive disulfide bonds ([1,3][2,4] LptD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruiz et al., 2010</xref>). These two states can be detected by a difference in mobility by SDS-PAGE and serves as a proxy for folding status. In contrast to LptD4213, which largely remains in the intermediate disulfide bonded state, LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> eventually achieves the correctly folded state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, left half of immunoblot), indicating that it is on-pathway.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of the deletion of D330 on assembly kinetics, we pulse-labeled cells with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine and monitored the oxidation status of LptD over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chng et al., 2012</xref>). In cells expressing wild-type LptD, 50% of the substrate is converted to the mature disulfide bonded state within 20 min. In cells expressing LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup>, we found that the LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> substrate folded more slowly than WT LptD, as judged by a slower conversion to mature LptD with its native disulfide bond configuration ([1,3][2,4] LptD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, top two panels).</p><p>Finally, we sought to identify additional mutations that could compensate for the folding defect in LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup>. We have shown that an intragenic suppressor that increases the hydrophobicity of the N-terminus of substrate LptD can influence the affinity of LptD to BamA and facilitate substrate release. If this is true, we predicted that mutations in the interior wall of BamA that weaken interactions with substrate would also facilitate substrate release. Therefore, we screened positions in the interior wall of BamA that we showed contact substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) to identify a suppressor that would allow for more rapid release of the LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> substrate. We found that a single substitution in the interior of BamA, E470G, rescued the permeability barrier defects caused by LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right bottom three lanes). Moreover, BamA<sup>E470G</sup> had a more transient association with LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> than with LptD4213 as judged by loss of crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, right panel). BamA<sup>E470G</sup> did not compromise the ability of LptD or the LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> mutant to achieve the mature disulfide bond configuration (i.e., properly oxidized product) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, right half of immunoblot). Finally, pulse-chase analysis showed that LptD<sup>ΔD330</sup> was folded faster by BamA<sup>E470G</sup> (t<sub>1/2</sub>=25 min) than by wild-type BamA (t<sub>1/2</sub>=50 min), and its folding by BamA<sup>E470G</sup> was comparable to that of wild-type LptD by wild-type BamA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The rate of folding of wild-type LptD was similar by wild-type BamA and by BamA<sup>E470G</sup>. These results confirm that interactions between substrate and the interior wall of BamA are important for folding and that changes in these interactions affect an important step in folding, which is release from the machine.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we present evidence for how the Bam complex catalyzes folding of a β-barrel substrate. The main features of the model are that the C-terminal strand of the substrate is held by BamA while the N-terminal strands of the substrate fold inside the BamA barrel. In our model the concave interior wall of BamA serves as an active site for formation of β-strands. At a late stage of assembly release of the completed β-sheet from the interior wall allows the substrate N-terminus to pair with the substrate C-terminus and close the β-barrel. Substrate β-barrel closure is further assisted by intramolecular interactions within the substrate, with substrate loop residues playing a critical role by interacting to bring both ends of the β-barrel together. In support of this model, we have identified a large substrate-binding surface that encompasses the interior wall of BamA. The periodicity in substrate residues that crosslink to BamA implies that folding intermediates have substantial β-sheet structure when bound to the interior surface of BamA. We also found that changes to residues in the substrate that contact the BamA interior or changes to residues in the BamA interior surface itself that contact substrate can increase or decrease the rate of folding. It follows that the interior surface of the BamA barrel wall is the catalyst for β-barrel strand formation.</p><p>An interesting aspect of our folding model is that the BamA interior surface is relatively polar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>), and yet it promotes the folding of β-barrel substrates with a hydrophobic exterior by forming extensive contacts with the hydrophobic surface of the growing substrate β-sheet. We argue that this type of association makes sense in the context of understanding the kinetics of β-strand formation. First, the polar nature of the interior wall is likely necessary because the interior surface is exposed to water for at least some of the time and the cavity would not be stable if it was too nonpolar. Second, and more importantly, an extensively hydrophobic BamA interior surface would interfere with release of a hydrophobic β-sheet. That is, to ensure that substrate binding is not too strong as tight binding of a substrate would impede the rate of β-strand formation. Indeed, weak oriented binding of substrates is a hallmark of enzymatic catalysis. Third, release of bound water from the hydrophobic exterior surface of the substrate as it folds against the interior surface is likely the driving force for folding. Finally, the leading exposed edge of the β-sheet in the folding substrate contains unsatisfied hydrogen bonds and is therefore polar; a relatively polar interior may be required to stabilize this leading edge. Therefore, we propose that the apparent mismatch in polarity between the associating surfaces is in fact central to the enzymatic mechanism for how β-strand formation is catalyzed.</p><p>How then does the interior wall accelerate the folding of LptD and other substrates by nucleating the formation of β-strands against the BamA interior wall? The barrier to formation of β-sheet structure involves formation of an extended, entropically disfavored conformation of the peptide chain. However, once one β-hairpin forms, successive addition of more β-hairpins is facilitated in two ways. First, the leading edge of the β-sheet serves as a preorganized template facilitating the simultaneous formation of multiple hydrogen bonds. Second, each new β-strand has the appropriate hydrophobic periodicity of side chains to benefit from the hydrophobic effect as it packs against the interior wall. In short, confining substrates within a cage overcomes the entropic barrier that would normally slow folding because successive peptide β-strands do not have to sample as large a conformational space as they would in free solution, and moreover the new β-strands gain stability from their contacts to the cage itself.</p><p>Our model stands in contrast to the predominant model in the field of membrane β-barrel folding known as the budding model, which involves sequential insertion of individual β-hairpins at the seam of the BamA barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Höhr et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noinaj et al., 2014</xref>). This earlier model raises two important mechanistic problems. First, models in which hairpins are continuously added by forming hydrogen-bonding networks at the seam imply a substantial kinetic barrier for addition of each hairpin because the existing hydrogen-bonding networks must be disrupted to insert new hairpins. In contrast, in our model, the interior surface serves as a catalyst for β-strand formation without invoking continuous β-strand exchange with the machine. A second problem posed by the budding model is that, as the barrel grows, the N- and C-termini are displaced farther and farther apart, and this presents a problem for how barrel closure is achieved. No such problem arises in our model because confining the N-terminus of the growing sheet within the cage allows the ends of the substrate to remain close to each other as folding progresses.</p><p>Finally, we note that the mechanism that we have proposed for β-barrel folding by the Bam complex resembles the mechanism by which the GroEL/GroES chaperone system accelerates the folding of soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayer-Hartl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horwich and Fenton, 2009</xref>). The GroEL/GroES chaperonin uses ATP hydrolysis to drive a series of conformational changes that open and close the cavity to promote binding and release of folding intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weissman et al., 1995</xref>). Like GroEL/GroES, we propose that BamA uses a hydrophilic cage to limit the conformational space substrates can sample. Unlike GroEL/GroES, ATP is not required to drive conformational changes in BamA between its open and closed forms because the BamA β-barrel can access the open form without energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakelar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iadanza et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the Bam complex accelerates the assembly of membrane β-barrel proteins by confining segments of folding substrates within the open BamA β-barrel to reduce the entropic cost of folding.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>MC4100</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casadaban, 1976</xref>);

The resulting strains were grown overnight in LB supplemented with 50 μg/mL carbenicillin, 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and 0.2% (w/v) glucose (37°C, 220 rpm). These overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 into 100 mL of fresh LB containing the same additives without glucose, and were grown (37°C, 220 rpm) to OD600 ~ 0.5. Cells were then collected by centrifugation (4200 x g, 10 min, 4°C). Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS (20 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). TCEP-HCl (VWR) was then added at a final concentration of 2 mM, and cells were incubated on a rocking platform (20 min, room temperature). Cells were then centrifuged (5000 x g, 10 min, 4°C) and again resuspended in PBS. The cysteine-to-cysteine crosslinker 1,4-bis(maleimido)butane (BMB, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mM. After incubation on a rocking platform (40 min, room temperature), the crosslinking reaction was quenched via addition of L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate (Alfa Aesar) to a final concentration of 10 mM. Cells were centrifuged (5000 x g, 10 min, 4°C) and the pellets were frozen at −80°C prior to subsequent purification. In each sample, 6 × His BamA (and any associated substrate) was purified, and Ni-NTA elutions were subjected to SDS PAGE and subsequent Western blotting. 6 × His BamA was detected by using a penta-His (HRP) antibody (Qiagen). LptD4213−3 × FLAG (substrate) that was pulled down with 6 × His BamA was detected by using a monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Sigma-Aldrich).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of antibiotic sensitivities</title><p>Plating of the strains was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wzorek et al., 2017</xref>). All strains were grown at 37°C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 0.8. Cells were normalized to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1 and then subject to five serial 10-fold dilutions. 5 μL of the dilution series were plated on agar plates containing the indicated additive and incubated at 37°C for 18–20 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of cellular protein levels</title><p>All strains were grown at 37°C to an OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.5. The cells from a 1 mL sample were normalized to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.3 and were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 min. The resulting cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μL of 1X SDS-sample buffer (+β-mercaptoethanol, β-ME) and incubated at 95°C for 10 min. The samples were separated on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed via Immunoblotting. To analyze trimer assembly, samples were not boiled and were directly subject to SDS-PAGE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Proteins were transferred from Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) for 15 min at a constant voltage of 25 V. Membranes were blocked with casein blocking buffer (Sigma) for 1 hr and incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer at 4°C overnight. Membranes were washed 3 times with TBST buffer (10 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20), incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature, and again washed 3 times with TBST buffer. Signal was detected using an Azure C400 imager (Azure Biosystems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Pulse-chase analysis</title><p>Pulse-chase experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chng et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, a 5 mL culture was grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of ∼0.5 in M63 minimal media supplemented with 18 amino acids (minus methionine and cysteine) at 37°C. The culture was pulse-labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine (100 μCi/mL final concentration) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) for 2 min and then chased with cold methionine (5 mM) at 37°C. At the indicated time point during the chase, an 800 μL culture aliquot was transferred to a 1.5 mL tube containing 80 μL of TCA (70% in water) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Precipitated proteins were pelleted at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, washed with 700 μL ice- cold acetone, and then solubilized in 80 μL 100 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1% SDS and 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma). The sample was sonicated for 30 s to aid solubilization. Following that, 800 μL of ice-cold immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, and 1 mM EDTA) was added and the sample was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. 700 μL of the supernatant was transferred to another 1.5 mL tube containing 2.5 μL of anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads 4 (Sigma). The beads were washed and preequilibrated with 3 × 1 mL IP buffer before use. The mixture was incubated on a rotary shaker for 1 hr at 4°C, and the beads were washed three times with 800 μL of ice-cold high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM EDTA) and one time with 800 μL ice- cold 10 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, using a magnetic separation rack (New England Biolabs). Sixty microliters of 2 × SDS nonreducing sample buffer was then added to the beads and the mixture heated for 10 min at 100°C to elute the bound proteins. Fifteen microliters of eluted sample was applied to SDS/PAGE directly. For reduction of disulfide bonds, 0.5 μL β-ME (Sigma) was added to 20 μL eluted sample and heated for 5 min at 100°C before loading. Tris·HCl polyacrylamide gels (4–20%) were used for SDS/PAGE analysis (running conditions: 150 V for 120 min). The gel was then dried and exposed to phosphor storage screens for autoradiography. Signals were detected with a Typhoon FLA 7000 image analyzer (GE Healthcare) using ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all members of the DK laboratory for helpful discussions.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This study has used a biochemical strategy to investigate how new β-barrel proteins are folded by the β-barrel translocation apparatus formed by BamA. Using site-specific crosslinking from various side chains in BamA, the authors establish that folding of substrate occurs to a large extent in the interior of the BamA barrel. This conclusion is different than current models of how nascent β-barrel proteins fold, which had postulated that they 'bud' from BamA into the membrane. The new work will therefore warrant a re-assessment of how this important class of membrane proteins is made and folded, and will motivate new directions of study. The process of membrane protein insertion is a universally conserved process essential for life, and β-barrel proteins are found in many bacteria and the outer membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts. For these reasons, the study will be of importance and interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Formation of a β-barrel membrane protein is catalyzed by the luminal surface of the assembly machine protein BamA&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ramanujan Hegde as the Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three referees found to paper to be important, well executed, and well written. No experimental revisions were judged to be absolutely necessary to support the central conclusions, although one referee asked whether the claim of non-overlapping interactions between substrate and different parts of the Bam complex might benefit from additional work. I leave the choice to add more experiments to buttress this claim to your discretion. I've appended the reviews below for your information. The most substantive points to be addressed have been extracted from the individual reviews and are re-iterated here for convenience.</p><p>1) The crosslinks that are observed are highly specific to mutant LptD unless the wild type is over-expressed at high levels. Can the authors briefly summarize in the Introduction the main reasons why the reader should treat this mutant as an on-pathway intermediate as opposed to an off-pathway product? This is of course critical for interpreting the crosslinks that are observed, and if the issue is not addressed at the outset, a reader will be wondering for some time whether they should believe the crosslinking results as assembly intermediates. Similarly, the authors should provide a statement about whether, under over-expression conditions, all of the protein does indeed mature. The overall concern here is that the crosslinks that are seen reflect off-pathway interactions.</p><p>2) Introduction: &quot;Analogous machines exist in the outer membranes of mitochondria (Sam, for sorting and assembly machinery) (Paschen et al., 2003; Wiedemann et al., 2003) and chloroplasts (Toc, for translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts) (Schnell et al., 1994).&quot;</p><p>Consider citing Gentle et al. 2004 as well for the discovery of Sam50, it was called Omp85 in this original paper which also drew the link to bacterial Omp85 proteins.</p><p>The Omp85 component of the Toc, Toc75, is equivalent to a TpsB Omp85 and mediates the translocation of proteins through the plastid outer membrane. The likely counterpart to Sam50/BamA is a protein called Oep85 ((Töpel et al., 2012). The Schnell et al., 1994 reference is very old, much has happened in the field since then.</p><p>3) Introduction: &quot;The Bam complex is composed of five proteins (Sklar et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2005).&quot;</p><p>This statement could be modified to simply &quot;In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the Bam complex is composed of five proteins (Sklar et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2005).&quot;.

The key discovery is that the interior of the BamA barrel directly interacts with a nascent substrate, which is probably forming β-strands. The C-terminus of the substrate is held separately by other parts of the Bam complex. As more β-strands assemble, they progressively exit the lateral gate of the BamA barrel, until the final step when substrate releases from the BamA barrel interior. Cleverly designed mutagenesis within the substrate are used to investigate this key release step, with a mutant in BamA being identified that facilitates release. The findings are put together into a model of β-barrel assembly that makes energetic sense. This work is beautifully performed and the manuscript is written well. Of course, there are always many additional experiments one might ask for, but in my opinion, the findings make a convincing case that folding occurs on the interior surface of the BamA barrel and lead to a new model for β-barrel assembly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The process of outer membrane protein assembly is an essential aspect of bacterial cell biology.

Great advances have been made over the past few years – including key contributions from this group – in determining how β-barrel OMPs are folded and inserted into the OM. This study addresses an important gap in knowledge, which is the precise mechanism by which the Bam complex facilitates folding of the substrate β-barrel and where this occurs on the central Bam component, BamA, which is itself a β-barrel OMP. Using a slow-folding mutant of the LptD substrate, the authors present convincing evidence for the formation of direct contacts between N- and C-terminal regions of the substrate and BamA, including regions inside the lumen of the BamA β-barrel. These results support a model – in contrast to the current budding or periplasmic models – in which substrates fold within the lumen of BamA. In the proposed model, the luminal surface of the BamA β-barrel acts as a chaperone for folding of the substrate β-barrel, which then releases from BamA upon forming a stable, closed structure.

No experimental revisions were judged to be absolutely necessary to support the central conclusions, although one referee asked whether the claim of non-overlapping interactions between substrate and different parts of the Bam complex might benefit from additional work. I leave the choice to add more experiments to buttress this claim to your discretion. I've appended the reviews below for your information. The most substantive points to be addressed have been extracted from the individual reviews and are re-iterated here for convenience.</p><p>1) The crosslinks that are observed are highly specific to mutant LptD unless the wild type is over-expressed at high levels. Can the authors briefly summarize in the Introduction the main reasons why the reader should treat this mutant as an on-pathway intermediate as opposed to an off-pathway product? This is of course critical for interpreting the crosslinks that are observed, and if the issue is not addressed at the outset, a reader will be wondering for some time whether they should believe the crosslinking results as assembly intermediates. Similarly, the authors should provide a statement about whether, under over-expression conditions, all of the protein does indeed mature. The overall concern here is that the crosslinks that are seen reflect off-pathway interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>Cells expressing only LptD4213 are viable, which implies that at least some of this substrate can complete folding. LptD4213 folds slower than wild-type LptD and does accumulate on the Bam complex. To determine if the crosslinks we observed from the accumulated LptD4213 on the Bam complex are relevant to the wild-type folding pathway, we compared the crosslinking profiles between the wild-type LptD and LptD4213 and found similar crosslinks with wild-type LptD in many cases that were less intense than with LptD4213. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now included two additional experiments in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 that establish that the wild-type substrate overexpression conditions used to observe crosslinks still leads to folded substrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Introduction: &quot;Analogous machines exist in the outer membranes of mitochondria (Sam, for sorting and assembly machinery) (Paschen et al., 2003; Wiedemann et al., 2003) and chloroplasts (Toc, for translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts) (Schnell et al., 1994).&quot;</p><p>Consider citing Gentle et al. 2004 as well for the discovery of Sam50, it was called Omp85 in this original paper which also drew the link to bacterial Omp85 proteins.</p><p>The Omp85 component of the Toc, Toc75, is equivalent to a TpsB Omp85 and mediates the translocation of proteins through the plastid outer membrane.
