Here we report the results of an analysis of more than 24 million article titles and 18 million article abstracts published between 1950 and 2019. There was at least one acronym in 19% of the titles and 73% of the abstracts. Acronym use has also increased over time, but the re-use of acronyms has declined. We found that from more than one million unique acronyms in our data, just over 2,000 (0.2%) were used regularly, and most acronyms (79%) appeared fewer than 10 times. Acronyms are not the biggest current problem in science communication, but reducing their use is a simple change that would help readers and potentially increase the value of science.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meta-research</kwd><kwd>scientific writing</kwd><kwd>acronyms</kwd><kwd>communication</kwd><kwd>knowledge</kwd><kwd>scientific publishing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1117784</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barnett</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT190100244</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doubleday</surname><given-names>Zoe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A study of 24 million articles has revealed that scientists have created more than 1 million acronyms since 1950, most of which have been used fewer than 10 times.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Template</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As the number of scientific papers published every year continues to grow, individual papers are also becoming increasingly specialised and complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Delanty, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bornmann and Mutz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doubleday and Connell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cordero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Plavén-Sigray et al., 2017</xref>).

The general trend is of an increasing time to re-use from 1965 onwards, which indicates that acronyms are being re-used less often.

Titles and abstracts are also getting longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), meaning readers are now required to read more content of greater complexity.</p><p>There have been many calls to reduce the use of acronyms and jargon in scientific papers (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Talk Medicine BMJ, 2019</xref>, which recommends a maximum of three acronyms per paper), and many journal and academic writing guides recommend a sparing use of acronyms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sword, 2012</xref>). However, the trends we report suggest that many scientists either ignore these guidelines or simply emulate what has come before. Entrenched writing styles in science are difficult to shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doubleday and Connell, 2017</xref>), and the creation of new acronyms has become an acceptable part of scientific practice, and for clinical trials is a recognised form of branding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pottegård et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We believe that scientists should use fewer acronyms when writing scientific papers. In particular, they should avoid using acronyms that might save a small amount of ink but do not save any syllables, such as writing HR instead of heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pinker, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lang, 2019</xref>). This approach might also make articles easier to read and understand, and even help avoid potential confusion (as HR can also mean hazard ratio or hour). For more complex phrases with multiple syllables and specialist words, such as methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), acronyms may ease reading and aid understanding, although MMT might mean methadone maintenance treatment to some readers.</p><p>It is difficult to make a general rule about which acronyms to keep and which to spell out. However, there is scope for journals to reduce the use of acronyms by, for example, only permitting the use of certain established acronyms (although the list of allowed acronyms would have to vary from journal to journal). In the future it might be possible, software permitting, for journals to offer two versions of the same paper, one with acronyms and without, so that the reader can select the version they prefer.</p><p>Our work shows that new acronyms are too common, and common acronyms are too rare. Reducing acronyms should boost understanding and reduce the gap between the information we produce and the knowledge that we use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jeschke et al., 2019</xref>) ‚ without 'dumbing down' the science. We suggest a second use for DNA: do not abbreviate.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We use the word acronym to refer to acronyms (such as AIDS), initialisms (such as WHO) and abbreviations that include capital letters (such as BRCA). We use this broad definition because we were interested in shortened words that a reader is either expected to know or could potentially misunderstand. We did not define acronyms as those defined by the authors using parentheses, because many acronyms were not defined.</p><p>We defined an acronym as a word in which half or more of the characters are upper case letters. For example, mRNA is an acronym because it has three upper case letters out of four characters. Characters include numbers, so BRCA1 is also an acronym according to our definition, but N95 is not because two of the three characters are not upper case letters. (It should, however, be noted that N95 is an abbreviation for National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health mask that filters at least 95% of airborne particles). Our definition of an acronym was arrived at using trial and error based on the number of acronyms captured and missed.</p><p>We included common acronyms (such as AIDS) because it is difficult to make a simple ruling about what is common and hence well accepted.

Data were downloaded between 14 and 22 April 2020. Although the PubMed repository includes papers going back to the year 1781, we used 1950 as the first year. This is because although acronyms have been around for 5,000 years, their use greatly increased after the Second World War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cannon, 1989</xref>) and there were a relatively small number of papers in PubMed prior to 1950.

Examples of acronyms missed by our algorithm include those with a relatively large number of lower case letters, numbers, symbols or punctuation (such as circRNA). Examples of acronyms wrongly included by our algorithm include words written in capitals for emphasis and the initials of someone's name appearing in the title as part of a Festschrift.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Errors made by the algorithm in random samples of titles and abstracts, the number of times that error was made, the average error percentage, and the estimated upper limit.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Error</th><th valign="top">Count</th><th valign="top">Average error (%)</th><th valign="top">Upper limit on error (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Wrongly excluded whole title</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">0.3</td><td valign="top">1.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Missed valid acronym from title</td><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">1.2</td><td valign="top">2.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Wrongly included acronym from title</td><td valign="top">5</td><td valign="top">0.8</td><td valign="top">1.7</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Missed valid acronym from abstract</td><td valign="top">19</td><td valign="top">6.3</td><td valign="top">9.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Wrongly included acronym from abstract</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">0.7</td><td valign="top">2.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Exclusion reasons and numbers</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> lists the most common reasons why papers were excluded from our analysis.

The trends were the average number of words in the title and abstract, and the proportion of acronyms in abstracts and titles using word count as the denominator. To examine varied types of acronyms, we split the trends according to acronyms that were letters only compared with those using letters and numbers. We also examined trends according to the length of the acronym. We calculated 95% confidence intervals for the annual means, but in general these were very close to the mean because of the enormous sample size, and hence we do not present them.</p><p>We examined the re-use of acronyms after their first use by calculating the number of acronyms re-used in a different paper in the same journal up to one year after their first use. We used the same journal in an attempt to standardise by field and so reduce the probability of counting re-uses for different meanings (such as ED meaning emergency department in the field of emergency medicine and eating disorder in the field of psychology). We counted re-use in the title or abstract. We censored times according to the last issue of the journal. We examined whether re-use was associated with the length of the acronym.</p><p>All data management and analyses were made using R version 3.6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">R Core Team, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>The analysis code and data to replicate all parts of the analyses and generate the figures and tables are available from GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/agbarnett/acronyms">https://github.com/agbarnett/acronyms</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnett, 2020</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/acronyms">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/acronyms</ext-link>). We welcome re-use and the repository is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our algorithm missed a relatively large number of acronyms that included symbols, punctuation and lower case letters. This means our estimates likely underestimate the total number of acronyms. We assumed this error is balanced over time, meaning our trends reflect a real increase in acronym use. We only examined abstracts and titles, not the main text. This is because we used an automated procedure to extract the data, and large numbers of main texts are only available for open access journals and only for recent years, making these data unsuitable for examining broad trends across the scientific literature. We took a broad look at overall trends and did not examine trends within journals or fields. However, our code and data are freely available, and hence other trends and patterns could be examined.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Computational resources and services were provided by the eResearch Office at Queensland University of Technology.
