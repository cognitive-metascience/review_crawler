Environmental cues strongly influence feeding behavior, as they can dramatically induce or diminish the drive to consume food despite homeostatic state. Here, we have uncovered an excitatory neuronal population in the basal forebrain that is activated by food-odor related stimuli, and potently drives hypophagia. Notably, we found that the basal forebrain directly integrates environmental sensory cues to govern feeding behavior, and that basal forebrain signaling, mediated through projections to the lateral hypothalamus, promotes selective avoidance of food and food-related stimuli. Together, these findings reveal a novel role for the excitatory basal forebrain in regulating appetite suppression through food avoidance mechanisms, highlighting a key function for this structure as a potent integrator of sensory information towards governing consummatory behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>basal forebrain</kwd><kwd>circuit</kwd><kwd>olfactory</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>cholinergic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30DK112571</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Jay M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS078294</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selever</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><name><surname>Arenkiel</surname><given-names>Benjamin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54HD083092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selever</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><name><surname>Arenkiel</surname><given-names>Benjamin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK109934</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arenkiel</surname><given-names>Benjamin R</given-names></name><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Qingchun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Glutamatergic projection neurons downstream of cholinergic cells in the basal forebrain potently affect feeding behavior by modulating downstream reward and aversion circuits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory perception of food can induce salivation, increase appetite, and prepare the body for food intake through the release of gastric acid and insulin prior to consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rogers and Hill, 1989</xref>). Similarly, the perception of rotting or spoiled food can elicit the opposite effect, including diminished appetite and overt food aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li and Liberles, 2015</xref>). The integration of sensory information to either drive or diminish appetite involves a complex combination of both innate and learned behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li and Liberles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rozin and Fallon, 1987</xref>). Food perception can thus be interpreted as a higher-cortical function, beyond the level of hypothalamic feeding centers, and necessarily requires communication between hypothalamic circuits and extra-hypothalamic regions.</p><p>Previous research has shown that hypothalamic feeding-associated neurons are rapidly modulated by sensory perception of food prior to consummatory behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, nearby neurons within the lateral hypothalamus have also been shown to rapidly drive both appetitive and aversive feeding behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>). How multi-sensory information is relayed to these hypothalamic nuclei to influence feeding or non-consummatory behaviors is not known.</p><p>In humans and rodents, olfaction plays a key sensory perceptive role in feeding. Anosmic humans exhibit abnormal food perception and changes in appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonfils et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, olfaction in mice has been shown to impact food intake and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Riera et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, olfactory perception of food itself has been shown to affect neuronal activity in hypothalamic feeding centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). It remains unclear however, how olfactory perception of food is relayed to the hypothalamus to regulate feeding.</p><p>A recent non-hypothalamic structure that has been shown to influence feeding is the basal forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Traditionally identified as a cholinergic center, the basal forebrain has been shown to mediate aspects of wakefulness, attention, learning and plasticity, and sensory modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Golden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramanathan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Recent work, has also identified the cholinergic basal forebrain as a robust modulator of appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). However, these previous findings did not reveal what aspects of feeding activate basal forebrain neuronal subtypes types, or the direct down-stream cellular connections that mediate feeding behaviors.</p><p>Here we identified an excitatory neuronal population within the basal forebrain (BF) marked by vGlut2+ expression (vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dumalska et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hur and Zaborszky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sotty et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2015</xref>), that potently influences feeding. Data have shown that vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons promote wakefulness, and exhibit diverse activation patterns in response to behavioral and training tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). In the current study, using a combination of Fos activity measures and in-vivo microendoscopy-imaging methods, we identified activation of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons in response to feeding related events and food-odor stimuli. These data, alongside aforementioned work implicating the basal forebrain in appetite control, led us to further examine the role of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons in feeding behavior.</p><p>Utilizing targeted genetic and viral manipulations of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons, we discovered a novel and severe hypophagic phenotype that resulted in dramatic weight loss, starvation, and death, following genetically targeted vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neuron activation. Notably, the lethal starvation phenotype could be rescued by nutrient supplement and oral gavage, suggesting that vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> circuits directly gate behavioral induced hypophagia mechanisms. Further in vivo microendoscopic imaging revealed that both odors associated with rotten food, and aversive odorant signaling through trace-amine-associated receptors in the main olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dewan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Osada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saraiva et al., 2016</xref>) potently activated vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons. Cell type-specific synaptic tracing, and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping, revealed robust innervation of the lateral hypothalamic region by vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> cell bodies or their hypothalamic projections was sufficient to induce hypophagia and led to food avoidance upon the olfactory perception of food. Together, these data reveal that vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons comprise an odor-responsive excitatory neuronal population that projects to the lateral hypothalamus and is capable of reducing feeding behavior by modulating avoidance to food and/or food-related odors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons respond to food odors</title><p>The basal forebrain (BF) comprises a heterogeneous population of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zaborszky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zaborszky et al., 2012</xref>).

We selectively targeted the horizontal limb of the Diagonal Band of Broca (DBB), since previous studies have shown that cell types associated with feeding are connected to the DBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakurai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

Notably, these same neurons were activated by food odor presentation alone but showed minimal responsivity while eating food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Approximately 15.6% of DBB neurons were reactive to food odor alone, with 2.5% being responsive to not only food odors, but also other stimuli that included walking, grooming, or physical stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). 9.4% of neurons recorded responded to these other stimuli but not food, and the vast majority were unreactive or showed non-specific activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Towards this, we engineered an AAV that expressed a mouse, codon-optimized version of the sodium bacterial channel, NaChBac (AAV-Flex-eGFP-p2a-mNaChBac), which has previously been used as a genetic approach to upregulate neuronal activity by lowering firing thresholds to increase neuronal tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kelsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ren et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). We stereotaxically injected this virus into the basal forebrains of adult vGlut2-Cre +/- mice, thereby allowing cell type-specific expression in vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). First, by performing whole cell recordings 7–10 days after viral injection, we measured that vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons that expressed mNaChBac showed increased spontaneous frequencies, action potential half-widths, and action potential voltage thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Current-injection ramps showed increase area under the activation curve in mNaChBac versus control neurons, indicating neuronal activation was sustained and mNaChBac expressing neurons are capable of increasing the excitability of downstream targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also performed extracellular single-unit recordings to measure mNaChBac expression effects in vivo. For this, vGlut2-Cre +/- animals were either injected with AAV containing Cre-dependent Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) into the basal forebrain (AAV-Ef1a-Flex-hChr2::EYFP), or a 1:1 mixture of AAV containing Cre-dependent ChR2 and mNaChBac. Using photostimulation as confirmation of electrode placement and cell identification, we recorded spontaneous activity in the basal forebrain, and confirmed increased spontaneous frequency in animals containing mNaChBac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Experimental animals rapidly lost 30% of their initial body weight as food intake ceased, eventually leading to starvation and death within 9–12 days after viral injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). To determine whether the observed weight loss was initially due to either hypophagia, or metabolic dysfunction, we systematically measured a panel of endocrine hormone levels 4 days following viral delivery, at a time point when animals just began to exhibit weight loss. We found no changes in pituitary hormones, or peripherally circulating thyroid hormones T3 and T4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Furthermore, animals did not show altered levels of glucose or insulin, indicating that hypo-insulinemia was not the cause of weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Additionally, leptin levels were also similar between experimental mice and controls, indicating that altered leptin signaling did not induce weight loss or decreased food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). In a separate experiment, we also measured ghrelin levels. For this, measurements were taken prior to viral injection under ad libitum and post 12 hr fasting conditions. We then injected half of the experimental mice with mNaChBac virus, while the other half served as GFP-injected controls. In control GFP animals, ghrelin levels were measured once again under ad libitum and 12 hr fast conditions, whereas experimental animals expressing mNaChBac were measured for ghrelin levels 4 days post injection. We detected elevated ghrelin levels in fasted compared to ad libitum fed animals in both pre-injection, and GFP injected animals, indicating viral injection did not alter ghrelin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Interestingly, mNaChBac injected animals exhibited elevated levels of ghrelin comparable to the fasted state, indicating ghrelin was indeed being released due to diminished food intake. However, elevated ghrelin signaling was unable to induce feeding, as mice continued to exhibit self-starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the observed rapid weight loss in mice with increased vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neuron activity was primarily due to diminished food intake, and not an altered metabolism. This was further supported by transitioning a group of mice to a liquid diet prior to viral injection, which allowed us to orally gavage a subset of experimental mice and test whether food supplementation could rescue starvation, and/or prolong life in the hypophagic mice. Indeed, we found that food supplementation via oral gavage 2x/day ameliorated the starvation phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Together, these data further substantiate that over-activity of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons leads to hypophagia-induced weight loss.</p><p>To query the necessity of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons in controlling food intake, we next implemented chemogenetic inhibition.

In both scenarios, mice treated with CNO displayed increased food intake compared to saline-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>).

We first injected vGlut2-Cre+/+ animals with AAV-Flex-GCaMP6m into the BF, and two weeks later animals were placed on a head-fixed imaging apparatus that allowed for animals to move on a freely spinning wheel. Acutely, GRIN lenses were lowered over the BF, and cells were imaged using the same DORIC microendoscope as above. This setup allowed for precise odor delivery, and incorporation of multiple trials per animal. We presented mice with mineral oil as a control, food odor (chow dissolved in mineral oil), and naturally aversive odorants, including butyric acid - which is normally associated with rotten/spoiled food, and 2-methylbutylamine - a known trace-amine associated receptor ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dewan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Osada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saraiva et al., 2016</xref>).

Since vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons are a strong driver of appetite cessation, we hypothesized that they may represent an additional downstream target of cholinergic appetite suppression.

This led us to question whether the dramatic hypophagic phenotype that we observed while manipulating vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons, may in fact be attributed to food avoidance. To directly investigate this, we placed food pellets in 3 corners of a square arena, while leaving one corner devoid of food. Whereas fasted control animals spent most of the monitored time near and/or eating food pellets, and very little time in the non-food corner, experimental animals with optogenetic stimulation of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons showed a strong avoidance to areas of the arena that harbored food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–B</xref>).

To test this, we allowed mice expressing ChR2 in vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons with bilateral implants over basal forebrain cell bodies and lateral hypothalamic projections to form a passive association of food with the neutral odor R-limonene by spiking mouse chow for two weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Cholinergic basal forebrain neurons have been shown to suppress appetite, while inhibitory VGAT-positive and somatostatin positive neurons promote general and high caloric food intake, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we uncovered a previously unknown population of basal forebrain vGlut2 +excitatory neurons as extremely potent suppressors of appetite, some of which receive input from neighboring cholinergic neurons. We also found that a subset of these excitatory neurons responded to food-related odors, and an even larger portion of them responded to odors associated with aversive and/or spoiled food odorants. Therefore, it is plausible that by over-activating these neurons, we induced an overriding hypophagic state, where a typical rewarding food pellet became unappetizing. What remains unclear, is whether the valence assigned to consummatory odors versus aversive odors occurs at the level of the basal forebrain. Notably, given that activating vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons results in hypophagia, it is unlikely that valence assignment occurs downstream of the circuit. Further investigation into these sensory response features will be required to more fully understand vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neuron inputs from higher cortical regions, as well as diverse outputs to given stimulation paradigms. These data further add to the growing evidence of the importance of the basal forebrain as an integrator of multiple sensory stimuli. Additionally, non-cholinergic cells in the basal forebrain have been found to predict behavioral responses associated with attention, and their activity can be modulated by multiple sensory stimuli in a time scale of sub-seconds to seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). Our imaging data support these claims as vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons were responsive to cues harboring both positive or negative valences, which would be important responses in an attentive state. Together, these findings reveal the robust interconnected dynamics of basal forebrain signaling in governing food intake, appetite, and downstream metabolic change.</p><p>Nicotine is a potent appetite suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stojakovic et al., 2017</xref>). Recent work has identified key roles for nicotinic signaling in suppressing appetite through POMC neuron activation within the arcuate nucleus of the <italic>hypothalamus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mineur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Picciotto et al., 2012</xref>). Our electrophysiology results indicate that vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons functionally express acetylcholine nicotinic receptors, and thus provide an additional target by which exogenous nicotine could suppress appetite through extra-hypothalamic neurons.</p><p>Chronic hyperactivation of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons led to drastic hypophagia, and acute optogenetic activation of these neurons both reduced food intake and caused avoidance of food and food-associated odors. Such dramatic hypophagia has previously been reported in models of lateral hypothalamic lesions, permanent AgRP neuron ablation in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, and permanent loss of GABA signaling from AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gropp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luquet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). To our knowledge, the current study is the first instance of a model with precisely targeted manipulations to the basal forebrain that leads to hypophagia and starvation. The dramatic phenotype of precipitous weight loss and complete appetite suppression within days of viral mNaChBac expression, indicates the high sensitivity of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neuronal firing. While chronic activation persistent for tens of minutes to days most likely does not occur in nature, changes in appetite especially for neuropsychiatric conditions are often chronic in nature and do not manifest by simply avoiding a single food item once or skipping one meal. Given the sensitivity of this neuronal population and the correlated phenotype, it could be possible that small changes in the excitability of this neuronal population could have chronic phenotypes in altering feeding behaviors. Furthermore, the resistance of the phenotype in leptin deficient mice indicates the feeding pathways altered by our manipulation are either downstream or in parallel to leptin signaling, but capable of overriding leptin deficient induced hyperphagia. Importantly, the hypophagic phenotype seen here is similar to that observed with AgRP neuron ablation, suggesting that the activity of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons is a fundamental regulator of feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gropp et al., 2005</xref>, p. 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luquet et al., 2005</xref>). Further, moderately obese <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> animals survived AgRP neuron ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), whereas viral mNaChBac manipulation of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons in obese <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> animals did not rescue prolonged hypophagia and starvation. Accordingly, we and others have identified the lateral hypothalamus as a robust brain target of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons involved in feeding regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Do et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Genetic subpopulations in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) have been extensively studied for their role in feeding related behavior. VGAT-positive inhibitory neurons in the LH have been shown to promote feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>), while vGlut2 positive neurons in the LH elicit food aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>). We revealed that vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons form direct synaptic connections onto vGlut2 positive neurons in the LH, and that their signaling onto LH neurons also diminished food intake and lead to food avoidance, thereby aligning with the previously proposed roles for the lateral hypothalamus. Notably, these findings highlight that a deeper understanding of the connectivity among and between the different cell types within the basal forebrain and lateral hypothalamus promises to reveal more precise mechanisms of how feeding and avoidance behaviors are fully relayed between these two circuit nodes.</p><p>An important consideration is the rewarding aspect of consuming food, particularly after a period of fasting. Previous work has shown that lateral hypothalamic projections to the lateral habenula modulate rewarding aspects of food intake, and that basal forebrain projections to the lateral habenula by somatostatin-expressing neurons can also regulate the rewarding aspects of feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stamatakis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). The lateral habenula has been implicated in reward-related and aversive behaviors through indirect inhibition of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons, which is another projection site of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons. Therefore, given the interconnected nature of cell types between these structures, vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons could also play a pivotal role in encoding the rewarding aspects of food intake. In future experiments, it will be particularly interesting and important to determine the contribution of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> projections to other projection regions, including the lateral habenula and VTA, in controlling the valance of food and/or food-associated odors. Based on cell-body versus LH projection stimulation results, other nodes in this circuit are clearly important since lateral hypothalamic stimulation of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> terminals did not fully recapitulate the avoidance behavior seen when vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> cell bodies were stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Although unlikely based on this evidence, we can not completely rule out that terminal excitation may backpropagate and activate cell-bodies in the optogenetic experimentation.</p><p>Recent investigations in the medial septum (MS) have also revealed neuronal populations that are capable of influencing feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sweeney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sweeney and Yang, 2016</xref>). Importantly, vGlut2 neurons in the MS reduced food intake through paraventricular hypothalamic projections, but to date, have not been shown to synapse onto lateral hypothalamic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sweeney et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, we found that vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons make functional synapses onto LH neurons and mediate hypophagia in part through this connection. Additionally, anterograde tracing highlighted an absence of vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neuron innervation to the paraventricular hypothalamus. Excitatory neurons in the MS were also recently identified to influence auditory and somatosensory cue-based avoidance through lateral habenula projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). That study also identified a unique locomotor phenotype, attributed to MS excitatory neuron projections to the preoptic region. Importantly, when we photostimulated excitatory-neuron cell bodies in the DBB, we did not observe any changes in locomotion, nor did we see increased cellular activity by calcium imaging when head-fixed animals moved on a walking ball. Additionally, our data indicate vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons cause an avoidance phenotype due to food olfactory sensory cues. Together, these studies suggest that vGlut2 neurons in the medial septum and the diagonal band of Broca represent unique basal forebrain populations with distinct projections that mediate appetite suppressing roles.</p><p>The robust hypophagia and starvation phenotype seen with the overactivation model described here draws parallels to hypophagic eating disorders. However, it is important to consider the structures investigated in this paper represent subcortical regions, and that neuropsychiatric eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, binge eating disorders, and bulimia nervosa, are complex multi-faceted conditions involving higher-order cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuglset et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the DBB of the basal forebrain is not considered a primary sensory cortex for olfactory information, and therefore the function of other presynaptic inputs onto vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons need to be further investigated to understand how more complex cognitive states can utilize sensory cues to suppress appetite. Pre-synaptic tracing onto vGlut2<sup>BF</sup> neurons highlight the orbitofrontal and agranular insular cortex as potential targets which could integrate sensory perception and higher level cognition to suppress appetite through basal forebrain circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Do et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Sensory perception of food can stimulate or decrease appetite by providing information on a food’s palatability, caloric value, and taste. Our results reveal a group of neurons capable of responding to the sensory perception of food, diminishing appetite, and eliciting avoidance to food and food-associated odors. Notably, these findings reveal a previously unknown circuit that links cholinergic signaling in the basal forebrain to feeding behavior, appetite suppression, and food avoidance. In the future, it will be important to uncover potential functions of this circuit in behaviors associated with nicotine-mediated appetite suppression, addiction, and/or learned food aversion associated with eating disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="bottom">Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th valign="bottom">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (M.Muscularus)</td><td valign="bottom">Vglut2-Cre (<italic>Slc17a6-Cre</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:028863">IMSR_JAX:028863</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background <break/>(M.Muscularus)</td><td valign="bottom">Chat-Chr2 (ChAT-ChR2-EYFP Line 6)</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:014546">IMSR_JAX:014546</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Adeno-Associated Virus Serotype 2/9)</td><td valign="bottom">AAV-Ef1a-Flex-hChR2(H134)-EYFP-WPRE-hGHpA (2/9);

Sections for synaptophysin tracing were washed with PBS 4 times for 10 min and then mounted with DAPI Fluoromount-G. Detection of fluorescent expression was performed using a Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope, or Leica TCS SP8 STED microscope. For synaptophysin projection quantification all images were taken at 20X holding all imaging parameters constant for each animal. ROIs were drawn in imageJ over target fields and relative intensity was measured. These were normalized on a per animal basis to an ROI over the DBB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Neuronal activation after feeding</title><p>Male vGlut2-Cre animals were injected with AAV-Flex-mRuby2. Three weeks after viral injection, animals were fasted for 24 hr. They were then placed in individually housed cages for 15 min. One group of animals were presented with standard pellet chow for 1 hr (fed), while a second group of mice lacked chow (fasted group). Mice were then immediately euthanized and processed using the microscopy and immunohistochemistry procedure above. Using identified positions from bregma, BF was identified by borders of cholinergic neuronal populations. Cells within this area were evaluated and counted in order to quantify positively labeled cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vivo microendoscopy</title><p>vGlut2-Cre animals were injected with adeno-associated virus expressing a Cre-dependent fluorescent calcium reporter, GCaMP6M (AAV-Ef1a-Flex-GCaMP6m). For freely behaving experiments, following viral injection, two set screws were drilled into exposed skull tissue. Next, a DORIC GRIN lens (SICL_E_500_80) attached to a protrusion adjustment ring was lowered over the injection site, positioned approximately 80 µm above the virally targeted location. GRIN lenses used had NAs of 0.5, focal distances of 80 µm, 500 µm diameters, and 8.39 mm lengths- adjustable between 5.3 mm to 8.39 mm dependent on the adjustment ring. Dental cement was used to fix the adjustment ring containing the GRIN lens onto the skull. Mice were then allowed to recover for three weeks. Prior to imaging, mice were fasted for 24 hr while having a dummy camera attached to their head. A DORIC microendoscope was next attached to the GRIN lens/protrusion adjustment ring. Mice were then imaged at an exposure rate of 50–250 ms per image, dependent on image quality (4–20 Hz). All results were down-sampled to 4 Hz for freely behaving experiments, and 10 Hz for head fixed animals, since there was better image quality for these experiments. LED power used for imaging was 1–3 mW. During imaging, mice were also video recorded using a Doric high-speed behavior camera at 60fps, which was time-locked with GCAMP imaging using Doric Neuroscience Studio software. For odorant delivery, mice were presented either monomolecular odorants or crushed food pellets dissolved in mineral oil on a cotton swab placed in the corner of a cage. Food interaction was defined as mice approaching and smelling food pellets, but not yet having eaten the food. Physical stimulation of mice was done by gently poking the mice with a cotton swab.</p><p>For head fixed experiments, 2 weeks after viral injection a metal head-plate was secured to the mouse skull using dental cement. 24–72 hr after head plate surgeries, mice were attached to a custom head-fix apparatus that includes a running-ball on which mice are able to walk on while their head is affixed to a side bar. The skull hole used for viral injection was re-drilled, and a DORIC GRIN lens (same as above) attached to the microscope was slowly lowered until the basal forebrain was in focus. Odorants were then delivered using a pressurized custom odor delivery robot while basal forebrain responses were imaged. Odorants were delivered for 10 s every 30 s, while being time locked with the beginning of microscope recording. Odors used include: 2-Methylbutylamine (241407 Sigma) dissolved in 5 mL mineral oil to a concentration of 4.5 µM, 100 µL Butyric Acid (103500 Sigma) dissolved in 5 mL mineral oil, food pellets were sonicated in mineral oil, and mineral oil alone. Gently touching mice with a cotton swab resulted in mice running on the wheel and was used to measure calcium activity from physical movement. Responses were averaged from two trials of randomized odor delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Calcium image processing</title><p>Images, if necessary, were corrected for motion artifacts using DORIC neuroscience studio image analyzer. For freely moving animals, cells were identified by direct visualization due to accurate focusing. For head-fixed recordings, a combination of PCA cell identification and hand drawn ROIs were utilized to isolate cells in the DORIC neuroscience studio software. The software calculated Delta F/F for whole-field images and ROIs. Traces were extracted, and then further analyzed using existing plotting functions in MATLAB, including plot and images. For freely behaving animals, DF/F traces were normalized for individual animals from 0 to 1 using the animals’ own maximum and minimum DF/F trace values. These normalized traces were then averaged across animals in order to compare activation. Cells were considered active if they achieved at least a two standard deviation increase in response for freely behaving animals, and three standard deviation increase in response for head-fixed animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>For all slice experiments, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) solution pH 7.35 mOsm 305–315 containing: 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>-6H<sub>2</sub>O, 20 mM Glucose, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>.

They were then gradually lowered to room temperature 25 degrees Celsius for and allowed to acclimate for at least 15 min before recording. For recording, slices were transferred into a recording chamber continuously perfused at 1–2 mL/min at 25 degrees Celsius. Neurons were identified by transmitted light DIC and fluorescent imaging (BX50WI, Olympus). Recordings were obtained using an Axon MultiClamp 700B amplifier digitized at 10 kHz (Axon Digidata 1440A). Recording electrodes (3–5 megaohms) were fabricated from borosilicate glass microcapillaries (outer diameter, 1.5 mm) with a micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments). For current clamp recordings, a potassium gluconate internal solution was used consisting of 120 mM K-gluconate, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>-6H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 mM Mg-ATP, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub> phostphocreatine, 0.4 mM Mg-GTP, 10 mM HEPES EGTA, 0.05 mM EGTA, pH 7.3 with KOH, 290 mOsm.

Resting potential was recorded within seconds of breaking into a cell. Cells with a series resistance of less than 30 megaOhms and &lt;25% change for duration of the experiment were used for analysis. Analysis of current-clamp electrophysiological data was performed using pClamp10 (Molecular Devices). Single action potential parameters were measured at threshold, and action potential amplitudes were measured relative to action potential threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Channelrhodopsin electrophysiology</title><p>Brain slices containing either the basal forebrain or lateral hypothalamus were prepared from 12 to 16 week-old animals.

Each sweep consisted of 2 s of recording, with an excitation duration of 10 ms of blue light (470 nm) exposure with 30 s between each sweep. For evaluation of cholinergic connectivity onto VGlut2 +basal forebrain neurons, we used ACSF that had the following final pharmacological concentrations in the slice chamber: 20 µM AP-5 (Tocris), 10 µM CNQX (Tocris), 2 µM GABAzine (Tocris), 10 µM Atropine (Sigma), 1 µM TTX (Tocris), 0.5 µM 4-AP (Tocris), and/or 0.5 mM Mecamylamine (Tocris). For lateral hypothalamus recordings, ACSF with the following pharmacological concentrations in the slice chamber were used: 1 µM TTX (Tocris, 0.5 µM 4-AP (Tocris), 20 µM AP-5 (Tocris), 10 µM CNQX (Tocris).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>In vivo extracellular recordings</title><p>12–16-week-old vGlut2-Cre +/+mice were injected with either Flex-Chr2 or with both Flex-Chr2 and Flex-NaChBac.

The skull hole used for viral injection was re-drilled. A 32-channel NeuroNexus Optrode was stereotaxically lowered into the brain to the depth of the basal forebrain. Cells were identified by applying 10 Hz light stimulation. Data for spontaneous frequency was recorded for 5 min, ending with a 10 Hz photostimulation using a 465 nm laser (DORIC). Data were recorded using a multichannel Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) system (Alachua, Florida), and single unit spikes were isolated using a 3.0 standard deviation cut-off from noise and a Bayesian clustering algorithm pre-built into the TDT Synapse software. Data were exported into MATLAB and further quantified to obtain spontaneous frequencies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>vGlut2 basal forebrain neuron activation with mNaChBac Assay</title><p>12–16 week-old equal number of male and female vGlut2-Cre<italic> +/- </italic>mice were separated into individually housed cages for 1 week, and mice and chow were measured daily to establish average baseline weight and daily food intake.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Sensory perception drives food avoidance through excitatory basal forebrain circuits&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Richard D Palmiter as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Zachary A Knight (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper describes a series of experiments showing that glutamatergic neurons in the basal forebrain project onto glutamatergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and activation of these neurons can robustly inhibit food intake and can lead to starvation. On the other hand, inactivation of these neurons promotes food intake and weight gain. The authors also show that these neurons are activated by food odors and odor cues that have been associated with food.</p><p>While there is general enthusiasm for this study, there are a few major points that need to be addressed. There are more details in the individual reviews (below).</p><p>1) The relationship between activation of these neurons by food odors and anorexia needs to be explained because the smell of food does not normally lead to a loss of appetite, but rather has the opposite effect. Linking activation of these basal forebrain neurons to conditions that normally promote anorexia is needed.</p><p>2) If the first point can be addressed, then better analysis of imaging data is needed as described by the reviewers.</p><p>3) A more thorough explanation of how the bacterial sodium channel leads to hyperactivity of the neurons is needed. Figure 2C shows that the firing frequency is only 0.04 Hz but action potential width is increased 100 fold. Is that sufficient for the robust behavioral phenotype? Inclusion of data comparing spike frequency/current injection for these neurons would help. Inclusion of an alternative activation paradigm (e.g. expression of hM3Dq and chronic CNO delivery) would also help solidify the chronic-activation results.</p><p>4) A more thorough analysis of the axonal projections of the basal forebrain neurons is required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors of this study show that chronic activation of VGluT2+ neurons in basal forebrain (Diagonal Band of Broca, DBB) results in severe anorexia and starvation. Transient activation of these neurons (ChR2) or their projections onto VGluT2+ neurons in the lateral hypothalamus inhibits food intake. Conversely, inhibiting these neurons promotes food intake. These DBB are activated by food odors, but not by eating per se, and they can be activated by novel odors that have previously been paired with food. When the DBB neurons are activated, mice avoid the region of a box where food is present, suggesting that food odor is aversive when these neurons are activated.</p><p>1) The authors start their Introduction with the concept that animals are attracted to safe food odors but repelled by odors associated with spoiled food. Thus, after knowing that these neurons inhibit feeding, I was expecting them to show that DBB neurons are selectively activated by odors associated with spoiled food. However, it appears that they are activated by natural food odors and unnatural odors that have been associated with normal food. There is no doubt that these neurons are activated by food-related odors, but they are probably activated by all sorts of other stimuli, some of which one might expect to produce food avoidance, e.g. a wide variety of threatening or nausea-inducing conditions. Determining whether the DBB VGluT2+ neurons are activated by conditions that are known to promote anorexia should be included in this study.</p><p>2) In Figure 2, the authors show that chronic activation of DBB neurons (with the bacterial sodium channel) results in severe anorexia. The authors show that this strategy activates neurons, but it is difficult to decipher how that translates into firing rate in vivo. If the authors could determine the firing rate, that would make it easier to interpret the experiments in Figure 5, where the authors show that 5-Hz ChR2 stimulation also inhibits food intake (~ 50%). A dose-response experiment with increasing frequency of ChR2 stimulation would help the reader know whether robust activation can lead to complete cessation of feeding (like the chronic experiments).</p><p>3) The authors show projections of the DBB Vglut2 neurons to the LH, but I suspect that they project their axons to many other brain regions as well. A supplemental figure showing all the projections should be included. Showing that activation of one (or more) of the other projections has no effect on food intake would be a nice addition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript investigates the role of VGluT2+ neurons in basal forebrain (BF) in regulation of food intake. The authors show using miniscope calcium imaging that a subset of Vglut2-BF neurons are activated when mice interact with a food pellet or smell a food associated odor. Chronic activation of these cells via overexpression of a bacterial sodium channel results in hypophagia and starvation in wild-type and ob/ob mice, whereas silencing using hM4D increases food intake. Optogenetic stimulation of Vglut2-BF neurons or their projections to LH decreases food intake and causes mice to avoid places containing food or food associated odors.</p><p>This is an interesting paper that builds on recent work implicating GABAergic and cholinergic cell types in BF in the regulation of food intake by showing that VGLUT2-BF neurons can also have potent effects on feeding. A strength of the paper is the use of several different approaches to bidirectionally manipulate neural activity, resulting in consistent effects on food intake and body weight with big effect sizes. The major weakness is the analysis of the calcium imaging data and the logical connection between the dynamics and the results of manipulation experiments. These points can be addressed mostly with new analysis and discussion.</p><p>1) The miniscope data should be presented and analyzed in way that makes it clearer what exactly the neurons are encoding. To start, the authors should show in Figure 1 the total number of neurons that were imaged in BF and the percentage of neurons that were odor responsive. They should also report the percentage of non-odor responsive cells that showed responses to any of the other stimuli tested. Currently it is unclear how the cells in Figure 1E-G were selected or what the population distribution of activity of VGLUT2 neurons looks like.</p><p>Beyond this, Figure 1 gives the impression that Vglut2-BF neurons are activated transiently by the first presentation of a food related odor, and then remain silent throughout the course of the ensuing meal. Is this true? The authors should present some miniscope data recorded during natural behavior that are plotted on the timescale of a meal, rather a 10 second window around events. Do the neurons respond to repeated presentation of the same food odor? How long does the response to &quot;food interaction&quot; last, and how is this so cleanly distinguished from &quot;food eating&quot; (Figure 1E), given that these are overlapping behaviors, and that the mouse continues to smell the food while eating? The authors suggest that these responses do not depend on whether the animal is fasted or fed, but they should show the data that support this. They should also explain what the arrows mean in Figure 1E and how the y-axis is defined in Figure 1F,G.</p><p>The authors should clarify the specificity of the food-odor responses. The text states that &quot;we did not observe activation of Vglut2-BF neurons to non-food associated odors, novel odorants&quot; but Figure 1E shows responses to novel odorants (yellow trace). These responses are of similar magnitude to the food odor response but slightly delayed. What does this mean?</p><p>2) After clarifying the response properties of VGLUT2-BF neurons, the authors should outline their model for what these dynamics encode. For example, do they signal merely the presence of food in the environment or something broader related to salience, reward, etc. They should also explain in the discussion how this relates the broader literature about the function and in vivo activity of BF neurons.</p><p>3) Finally, the authors should explain how the manipulation data and natural dynamics are logically connected. This is important because it seems like the neurons are activated by the smell of food, but the smell of food does not inhibit food intake. Likewise given that these neurons are activated only transiently (a few seconds), it is unclear how to interpret feeding phenotypes that result from chronic manipulations that persist for tens of minutes to days. Does this ever happen naturally? The Discussion section would be better used to highlight these tensions and unresolved questions and make the interpretation clearer.</p><p>4) Figure 7 shows that stimulation of an anorexia circuit can lead animals to avoid places with food or food odors, which make sense, but this does not explain why the smell of food would activate an anorexia circuit (Figure 1). The authors should clarify this by rewriting the setup for Figure 7 (subsection “Acute activation of Vglut2BF neurons and their LH projections drives avoidance of food odors”), which at present seems to imply that Figure 7 is a test of the logical implications of Figure 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript by Patel et al., the authors identify and characterize a circuit originating from Vglut2 expressing neurons in the Basal Forebrain that project to the Lateral Hypothalamus to negatively regulate feeding behavior. The main results are that BF Vglut2 cells are activated by food odor or food interaction. Direct long-term activation of Vglut2 BF neurons via introduction of a constitutively active bacterial sodium channel results in hypophagia, weight loss, and starvation. BF Vglut2 cells receive (some) input from BF Cholinergic cells, and project out to the LH where they synapse onto glutamatergic neurons. Photostimulation of these fibers directly in the LH also reduced food intake and causes mice to avoid locations paired with food odors. Overall, the experiments are novel and well executed. The manuscript is also easy to follow and well written.</p><p>1) It would be helpful if more zoomed out confocal images showing the extent of viral labeling in the BF were shown. Are there cells outside of the BF that were labeled? Additionally, zoomed out images of fibers in LH would be helpful in order for the reader assess how specific this projection is for targeting the LH. Where other terminal fields (aside from the LH) discovered following labeling of Vglut2 BF neurons?</p><p>2) Are the data in Figure 1E trial averaged or example data from each neuron in only one trial?</p><p>3) Data in Figure 5C and D appear like they should be combined and analyzed with a two-way ANOVA. Same issue with Figure 6B.</p><p>4) For microendoscopic imaging experiments, please report the optical specs for the GRIN lenses used. Including NA, focal distance, and GRIN lens length. Additionally, please report LED power parameters in mW.</p><p>5) How was food interaction quantified? This should be clarified.</p><p>6) Discussion section, please clarify what particular gross hypothalamic lesions reduce feeding as some hypothalamic lesions (VMH lesions) can increase feeding.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44548.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors of this study show that chronic activation of VGluT2+ neurons in basal forebrain (Diagonal Band of Broca, DBB) results in severe anorexia and starvation.

With new experimentation (revised Figure 5), we presented mice with 2 separate classes of known aversive odorants while recording responses. Indeed, we found strong activation of vGlut2 basal forebrain neurons to aversive odorants that (1) activated a broader population of cells, and (2) more strongly activated similar cells as food odors. Together, these data provide a stronger conceptual framework as to why activation of these neurons leads to anorexia. We thank the reviewer for this impactful suggestion to bolster the findings and add conceptual rationale for the observed hypophagic phenotype associated with targeted activation.</p><p> <italic>2) In Figure 2, the authors show that chronic activation of DBB neurons (with the bacterial sodium channel) results in severe anorexia.

These data corroborate the low firing frequency seen in slice culture and show an increase in firing rate with NaChBac in a similar range to the original 5Hz Chr2 stimulation. These data are now highlighted in a new Figure 2—figure supplement 1D. We have also performed a dose-response experiment with increasing frequencies of ChR2 stimulation to compare with the chronic excitation experiments, since the neuronal activation properties of Chr2 vs NaChBac are different. Interestingly, we found increasing frequencies to 20 Hz reduced food intake even further. These data are now included in a new Figure 8D. In whole cell recording experiments in slices, current injections showed increased area under the curve, indicating longer activation of NaChBac expressing neurons per current injected. These new data are now represented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show projections of the DBB Vglut2 neurons to the LH, but I suspect that they project their axons to many other brain regions as well.

Since these outputs are diverse, and that we are currently investigating subsets of these outputs towards potential roles feeding and other types of behaviors, we have decided to focus here on LH outputs that we could clearly confirm previously unknown roles. Future experimentation beyond this study will uncover if these outputs act synergistically to regulating feeding, or if they each convey unique features.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) The miniscope data should be presented and analyzed in way that makes it clearer what exactly the neurons are encoding.

We routinely observe this in the basal forebrain devoid of sensory stimulation, but most cell types in the DBB become much more active with presentation of specific sensory cues or stimuli. To incorporate the reviewer suggestion, we now provide longer traces of cell responses, annotated with behavior to show that these neurons are activated by specific stimuli for both freely behaving and head-fixed animals. These new data are now presented in in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and Figure 5A, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the neurons respond to repeated presentation of the same food odor?

We have provided longer example traces to qualitatively illustrate this in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and Figure 5A. Moreover, times associated with food interaction was annotated as time spent investigating food until mice began to eat. We also noted that these same neurons reduce activity upon consumption of food. While these data do not allow us to rule out that animals continue to perceptually smell food while eating, we hypothesize there is a lack of attentive investigation or active pursuit when the mouse is eating, thus leading to inhibition of these neurons. Although this remains to be directly tested, we observe a similar response in some Vglut2 neurons when mice go from a moving to resting state as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest that these responses do not depend on whether the animal is fasted or fed, but they should show the data that support this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this point was confusing, and have since removed the claim from the manuscript given the lack of conclusive supporting data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They should also explain what the arrows mean in Figure 1E and how the y-axis is defined in Figure 1F, G.</p></disp-quote><p>For clarification to the reviewer, the y-axis represents normalized percent DF/F. Each animal’s percent DF/F was normalized to its own maximum and minimum to establish a range between 0-1. We noted significant variability in the maximum DF/F for each animal due to slight variations in GRIN Lens placement in freely behaving animals. We found normalizing the signal for each animal allowed for a more accurate comparison since with the DORIC system, the GRIN lenses are not adjustable after implantation. For head-fixed animals, where we were able to lower the lens to an optimal focal plane, all corresponding data are presented as DF/F, or an average DF/F between multiple mice. The arrows in the original figure were to indicate that each row corresponded to the same cell across heat maps. We have now removed the arrows, and included this description in the figure legend to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should clarify the specificity of the food-odor responses.

Considering new data presented in the revised manuscript, we now show how different odorants differentially activate basal forebrain excitatory neurons. Notably, we found aversive odorants to be strong and differential activators of Vglut2-BF neurons. These data are now presented in a modified Figure 5. In light of these new data, we have removed the statements associated with “non-food associated odors”, since Vglut2-BF neurons indeed appear to be differentially activated by various odors.</p><p> <italic>2) After clarifying the response properties of VGLUT2-BF neurons, the authors should outline their model for what these dynamics encode.

Briefly, it appears that differences in the number of neurons being activated, and strengths of their activation, dynamically change between types of odorants. This may indicate that valence is being assigned to odorant cues upstream, that are then relayed downstream to behavioral output circuits in the lateral hypothalamus and/or other downstream targets.

While chronic manipulations do not happen naturally, changes in neuronal excitability and tone can persist for days. Interestingly, eating disorders are often chronic in nature. Thus, by driving the activity of neurons that are responsive to aversive odors or odors associated with spoiled food, it is plausible that we are modeling an anorexic state by constant activation of hypophagia circuits.
