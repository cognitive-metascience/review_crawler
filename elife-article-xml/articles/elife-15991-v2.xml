clusters are essential for many cellular processes, ranging from aerobic respiration, metabolite biosynthesis, ribosome assembly and DNA repair. Mutations in <italic>NFU1</italic> and <italic>BOLA3</italic> have been linked to genetic diseases with defects in mitochondrial Fe-S centers. Through genetic studies in yeast, we demonstrate that Nfu1 functions in a late step of [4Fe-4S] cluster biogenesis that is of heightened importance during oxidative metabolism. Proteomic studies revealed Nfu1 physical interacts with components of the ISA [4Fe-4S] assembly complex and client proteins that need [4Fe-4S] clusters to function. Additional studies focused on the mitochondrial BolA proteins, Bol1 and Bol3 (yeast homolog to human BOLA3), revealing that Bol1 functions earlier in Fe-S biogenesis with the monothiol glutaredoxin, Grx5, and Bol3 functions late with Nfu1. Given these observations, we propose that Nfu1, assisted by Bol3, functions to facilitate Fe-S transfer from the biosynthetic apparatus to the client proteins preventing oxidative damage to [4Fe-4S] clusters.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15991.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15991.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15991.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins perform almost all of the tasks necessary for cells to survive. Some of these proteins need to contain collections of iron and sulfur ions known as iron-sulfur clusters to work properly. The iron-sulfur clusters are first assembled from individual ions and then attached to the correct target proteins. In humans, yeast and other eukaryotic cells, the first step of this process happens in compartments called mitochondria and makes a cluster that contains two of each ion, known as [2Fe-2S] clusters. These [2Fe-2S] clusters can either be directly incorporated into target proteins, or they may be used to make larger iron-sulfur clusters – such as [4Fe-4S] clusters – in the mitochondria or the main compartment of the cell (the cytoplasm).</p><p>Defects that affect the assembly of proteins with iron-sulfur clusters are associated with severe diseases that affect metabolism, the nervous system and the blood. Mitochondria contain at least 17 proteins involved in making iron-sulfur proteins, but there may be others that have not yet been identified. For example, a study on patients with a rare human genetic disease suggested that proteins called BOLA3 and NFU1 might also play a role in this process.</p><p>Melber et al. used genetics to study how [4Fe-4S] clusters are assembled in the mitochondria of yeast cells. The experiments show that the yeast equivalents of NFU1 and BOLA3 (known as Nfu1 and Bol3) act to incorporate completed [4Fe-4s] clusters into their target proteins. This process is particularly important when iron-sulfur clusters are in high demand, such as when a cell needs to produce a lot of energy. Melber et al. also showed that a protein called Bol1 – which is closely related to Bol3 – is needed in an earlier stage of iron-sulfur cluster assembly.</p><p>The next steps following on from this work will be to look more closely at how Nfu1 and Bol3 deliver iron-sulfur clusters to the right target proteins. A future challenge will be to find out how other types of iron-sulfur clusters are transferred to their target proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15991.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15991.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>iron-sulfur biogenesis</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>iron-sulfur clusters</kwd><kwd>oxidative damage</kwd><kwd>cofactor biogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 DK007115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Melber</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 1710</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lill</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Spp 1927</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lill</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM112763</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wohlschlegel</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 GM110755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winge</surname><given-names>Dennis R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA042014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winge</surname><given-names>Dennis R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LOEWE Zentrum für Synthetische Mikrobiologie SynMikro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lill</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial proteins Nfu1 and BolA3 mediate the transfer of preformed [4Fe-4S] clusters within the mitochondria to recipient proteins to shield clusters from oxidative damage during transfer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A severe syndrome characterized by the dysfunction of multiple mitochondrial enzymes has been described for a series of patients with mutations in four mitochondrial proteins IBA57, ISCA2, NFU1 and BOLA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seyda et al., 2001</xref>;

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hassnan et al., 2015</xref>). Patients with this Multiple Mitochondria Dysfunctions Syndrome (MMDS) are afflicted with lactic acidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia and infantile encephalopathy typically leading to death in their first year of life. The syndrome is associated with an impairment of lipoic acid-dependent 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases arising from defective lipoate synthesis and defects in respiratory complexes I and II in select tissues including muscle and liver. These phenotypes arise from defective iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly within the mitochondria. The deficiency in protein lipoylation is due to impaired activity of lipoic acid synthetase, which requires two [4Fe-4S] cluster cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hiltunen et al., 2010</xref>). The hyperglycinemic phenotype arises from failed lipoylation of the glycine cleavage enzyme. Whereas IBA57 and ISCA2 are known components of the ISA complex, along with ISCA1, which functions in the formation of [4Fe-4S] clusters within mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mühlenhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gelling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sheftel et al., 2012</xref>), the functions of NFU1 and BOLA3 in Fe-S cluster assembly remain an enigma.</p><p>Yeast cells lacking Nfu1 are partially compromised in mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] cluster formation, but the defect is not as pronounced as in cells lacking components of the ISA complex (Isa1, Isa2 and Iba57) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schilke et al., 1999</xref>). As in patient cells with mutations in NFU1, yeast <italic>nfu1</italic>∆ cells have diminished protein lipoylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</xref>). Humans and yeast have two mitochondrial BolA proteins termed BolA1 (Bol1 in yeast) and BolA3 (Bol3 in yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Willems et al., 2013</xref>), but little is known concerning their physiological function. The similarities of phenotypes in patients with MMDS mutations in NFU1 and BOLA3 suggest that BOLA3 may likewise function in mitochondrial Fe-S biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Fe-S cluster synthesis within the mitochondria occurs on a scaffold complex and preformed clusters are subsequently transferred to recipient proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lill et al., 2012</xref>). The initial cluster formed is a [2Fe-2S] cluster assembled on the ISU scaffold complex consisting of five proteins, Nfs1, Isd11, Yfh1, Yah1 and Isu1 (or Isu2; yeast nomenclature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmucker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsai and Barondeau, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lange et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Webert et al., 2014</xref>). The sulfide ions are provided by the Nfs1 cysteine desulfurase, along with its effector proteins Isd11 and Yfh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsai and Barondeau, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lill and Mühlenhoff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biederbick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bridwell-Rabb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parent et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fox et al., 2015</xref>). Assembled [2Fe-2S] clusters on Isu1 are transferred to the monothiol glutaredoxin Grx5 through the action of the Ssq1 ATPase and the DnaJ protein Jac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciesielski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Majewska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Uzarska et al., 2013</xref>).

The lack of NfuA in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> is associated with decreased viability under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Py et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelini et al., 2008</xref>). Nfu proteins from most species are multidomain proteins. <italic>E. coli</italic> NfuA and human Nfu1 are two domain proteins with the C-terminal domain containing the functionally important CxxC motif that is known to bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster at a homodimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2013</xref>). The N-terminal domains differ between the <italic>E. coli</italic> and human proteins and lack a related CxxC motif. Recombinant expression and purification of <italic>Azotobacter</italic> NfuA or human Nfu1 did not result in Fe-S cluster bound to the purified protein, but in vitro Fe-S reconstitution studies followed by Mössbauer spectral studies demonstrated the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Py et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelini et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Synechocystis</italic> NifU was reported to bind a [2Fe-2S] cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yabe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nishio and Nakai, 2000</xref>), but Mössbauer spectral studies were not done to validate the assignment. The ability of Nfu1 to bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster supported the suggestions that Nfu1 was either an alternative scaffold protein involved in Fe-S cluster formation or involved in a late cluster transfer step. The ability of bacterial NfuA to transfer its cluster to apo-aconitase in vitro is consistent with a role in a late step of cluster transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelini et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>BolA proteins are also known to coordinate Fe-S clusters in conjunction with monothiol glutaredoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Outten, 2012</xref>). One of the three BolA proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> BolA1 was shown to bind a [2Fe-2S] cluster in a complex with glutaredoxin (Grx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roret et al., 2014</xref>). The cluster associated with the BolA:Grx complex is coordinated by two thiolate ligands, one from Grx and the other from an associated glutathione, and two histidine ligands from BolA1. Likewise, the cytosolic BolA2 proteins of yeast and humans coordinate [2Fe-2S] clusters at the heterodimer interface with monothiol glutaredoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Outten, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Little is known about the physiological function of mitochondrial BolA proteins, designated Bol1 and Bol3. BolA proteins are found only in aerobic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Willems et al., 2013</xref>). Depletion of the mitochondrial BolA1 in HeLa cells caused an oxidative shift in the mitochondrial thiol/disulfide redox ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Willems et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We set out to define the functional steps of Nfu1 and two mitochondrial BolA proteins in yeast. We report that Nfu1 and Bol3 function at a late step in the transfer of Fe-S clusters from the ISA complex to mitochondrial client proteins as a protective measure for [4Fe-4S] clusters from oxidative stress damage. In contrast to Bol3, the related mitochondrial Bol1 shows an interaction with Grx5 but not with the ISA complex or [4Fe-4S] client proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nfu1 is associated with mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] cluster formation</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells lacking the mitochondrial Nfu1 protein (<italic>nfu1</italic>∆ cells) are markedly impaired in growth on synthetic complete medium with acetate as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Whereas Nfu1 is known to bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster at the homodimer interface, BolA proteins have been shown to bind [2Fe-2S] clusters in association with glutaredoxins as heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Outten, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roret et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2012</xref>). We evaluated the roles of potential Fe-S cluster ligands in Bol1 and Bol3. Bol1 has conserved His56 and His93 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which in the case of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> BolA1 the corresponding His residues are apparent ligands to a [2Fe-2S] cluster in association with a monothiol glutaredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roret et al., 2014</xref>). Bol3 has conserved Cys64 and His101 residues in corresponding loops to that of Bol1 and are expected to serve as ligands for a Fe-S cluster. We replaced the conserved histidine residues with alanines or cysteines and tested phenotypic effects. We observed that the C-terminal His in each BolA protein was important for the respiratory growth of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G and H</xref>). Whereas the H<sup>101</sup>A Bol3 mutant was non-functional, the variant containing a H<sup>101</sup>C substitution exhibited a synthetic sick phenotype in that the respiratory growth on glycerol/lactate medium was more impaired relative to the starting <italic>bol1</italic>Δ<italic>bol3</italic>Δ null strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and H</xref> lane 6). The Bol3 C<sup>64</sup>A mutant was only a partial loss-of-function allele. In contrast, the Bol1 H<sup>93</sup>A or H<sup>93</sup>C mutants exhibited similar loss-of-function phenotypes without any observed dominant negative effects. The upstream Bol1 H<sup>56</sup>A mutant retains function, but the H<sup>56</sup>C allele was a partial loss of function mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>, lane 5).</p><p>Since substitutions in the upstream conserved His56 in Bol1 and Cys64 in Bol3 failed to yield a significant phenotype, they may not contribute to a candidate FeS cluster binding. To confirm this prediction, we converting the His56 in Bol1 and Cys64 in Bol3 to lysine residues to create electrostatic repulsion to a candidate FeS cluster Fe atom. Bol1 H<sup>56</sup>K and Bol3 C<sup>64</sup>K mutants did not exhibit an enhanced phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) ruling out that they are important FeS cluster ligands. Together, these data show a functional importance of Bol1 and Bol3 in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis and highlights the need for the C-terminal conserved His in each protein for physiological function. Bol1 and Bol3, like Nfu1, are not essential for mitochondrial Fe-S protein biogenesis, as a bypass exists enabling limited respiratory growth on glycerol/lactate medium.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Nfu1 and Bol3 physically interact with [4Fe-4S] client mitochondrial proteins</title><p>To glean further insights into the function of Nfu1, Bol1 and Bol3 in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis, we performed proteomic analyses on affinity purified Nfu1, Bol1 and Bol3 proteins with each expressed as Strep fusions.

Due to their higher stability, we used the human proteins. Apo-GLRX5 or the holo-GLRX5 dimer containing the bridging [2Fe-2S] cluster were incubated with either recombinant human BOLA1 or BOLA3 proteins for assessment binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Holo-GLRX5 associated with BOLA1 with a 50-fold greater affinity than with BOLA3, while similar affinities of apo-GLRX5 were observed for the two human BOLA proteins. As a control, no significant interaction of the BOLA proteins with the human [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin FDX2 was observed. Together, these results indicate a strong preference of BOLA1 for the holoform of GLRX5. We predict, based on the yeast Bol1 H<sup>93</sup>C mutant, that BOLA1:GLRX5 interaction is mediated by a [2Fe-2S] cluster.</p><p>The Nfu1 and Bol3 proteomics experiments did not identify any novel mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] cluster client proteins. Interestingly, the [2Fe-2S] enzyme dihydroxyacid dehydratase (Ilv3) was recovered in multiple independent mass spectrometry analyses in Nfu1 and Bol3 samples. However, we were unable to verify that interaction when using a FLAG-tagged Ilv3 chimera in the Nfu1-Strep affinity capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, enzymatic activity of Ilv3 was not altered in <italic>nfu1</italic>∆ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, Nfu1 does not appear to be important for the function of the [2Fe-2S] Ilv3 enzyme.</p><p>We sought to address whether the binding of Nfu1 to a client protein was mediated through a bridging [4Fe-4S] cluster. Aco1 binds its [4Fe-4S] cluster through a conserved CxxC motif and one distant Cys residue in the primary sequence. We generated a double AxxA mutant and tested its ability to associate with Nfu1-Strep.

The triple deletion cell (<italic>bol1</italic>Δ<italic>bol3</italic>Δ<italic>nfu1</italic>Δ, designated <italic>b</italic>ΔΔ<italic>nfu1</italic>Δ) exhibited a strong synergistic growth defect on glycerol/lactate medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). While the defects are too severe to see the synergism by protein lipolyation and Sdh2 steady-state levels, the enzymatic activities of SDH and aconitase do reflect a synergistic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). In addition, the level of assembled F1F0 ATPase was markedly reduced in the triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The severity of the phenotype and the impairment in F1F0 ATPase in the triple mutant likely arises from reduced mitochondrial translation likely through RNaseP, similar to the dominant negative Nfu1 G&gt;C mutant discussed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

The proteomic results suggested an association of Bol1 and Grx5, whereas Bol3 was associated with Nfu1 function. Mitochondrial BolA proteins are low abundance molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) making co-immunoprecipitation studies challenging. Because of this, we tested whether increasing the levels of candidate interacting proteins would alter the abundance of Bol1 or Bol3.

Additionally, <italic>ISA1</italic> and <italic>ISA2</italic> overexpression resulted in a modest increase in Bol3, but not Bol1, protein levels. In contrast, Grx5 overexpression led to a marked enhancement in Bol1 levels without altering Bol3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). In these studies Strep-chimeras of Bol1 and Bol3 were expressed from heterologous promoters, so the changes in protein levels are likely occurring through post-transcriptional stabilization. These stabilization experiments corroborate the genetic and proteomic experiments, all of which suggest that Bol3 (BOLA3) functions with Nfu1 in [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer to client proteins and Bol1 functions with Grx5 for a yet to be determined purpose.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Nfu1 exists as a steady-state homodimer lacking Bol3</title><p>Mitochondrial lysates were subjected to gel filtration studies to assess the extent of interaction between Nfu1 and Bol3.

No significant co-elution was observed between Nfu1 and Bol3, indicating that any Nfu1/Bol3 interaction is transient in nature. An additional set of chromatographic studies were done with mitochondrial lysates containing Nfu1-Strep in which lysates were treated with either 0.1 mM DTT or 2 mM dithionite to assess whether the apparent Nfu1 dimer was a disulfide-linked homo-dimer or a Fe-S cluster bridged complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The abundance of Nfu1 in fraction 13 assessed by immunoblotting indicated that the elution properties of Nfu1 were unaffected by preincubation with DTT (followed by alkylation of cysteines by Iodoacetamide), whereas treatment with dithionite attenuated the apparent dimeric complex abundance. Fe-S clusters are susceptible of disassembly with dithionite treatment, suggesting that a significant fraction of steady-state Nfu1 in WT yeast mitochondria may be Fe-S loaded.

We specifically focused on Lip5 that catalyzes formation of lipoic acid. In its catalytic cycle, one of its [4Fe-4S] clusters is consumed to provide two sulfur atoms needed to generate lipoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cicchillo and Booker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cicchillo et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, [4Fe-4S] cluster regeneration is needed to support Lip5 catalysis and lipoic acid levels. To address a role of Nfu1 in cluster regeneration in Lip5, we utilized cells containing a chromosomal <italic>NFS1</italic> under the control of <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter enabling glucose-mediated repression of Nfs1 expression. The GAL-<italic>NFS1</italic> strain was transformed with an empty vector or a vector containing either <italic>NFU1</italic> under the control of the regulatable <italic>MET25</italic> promoter, <italic>BOL3</italic> or <italic>ACO1</italic>. If Nfu1 were a reservoir of [4Fe-4S] clusters, we predicted that elevated levels of holo-Nfu1 would enable sufficient [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer to Lip5 to support lipoic acid formation in cells depleted of Nfs1. Cells pre-cultured in galactose were shifted to glucose-containing medium to repress <italic>NFS1</italic> expression and mitochondrial lysates were collected 8 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The lipoic acid level in pyruvate dehydrogenase was reduced, rather than maintained, in cells expressing elevated levels of Nfu1 (low 1x methionine cultures) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lane 8, top band), but unaffected in cells overexpressing Bol3 (lane 11). Overexpression of the aconitase mimicked the reduced lipoic acid levels seen with elevated Nfu1 (lane 12). These results do not support a reservoir function of [4Fe-4S]-Nfu1 and suggest that elevated levels of a [4Fe-4S] protein, e.g. [4Fe-4S] Nfu1, may negatively impair routing [4Fe-4S] transfer to Lip5 for lipoic acid formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A role of Nfu1 in Fe-S cluster biogenesis has long been implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacobson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schilke et al., 1999</xref>); however, its molecular mechanism has not been definitely established. Patients harboring mutations in NFU1, as well as BOLA3, exhibit biochemical abnormalities in a set of [4Fe-4S] enzymes leading to speculation that Nfu1, and BolA3, function as a late Fe-S maturation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Py et al., 2012</xref>) or that Nfu1 is an alternate Fe-S cluster synthesis scaffold protein used for a subset of specific Fe-S client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tong et al., 2003</xref>). The phenotypic similarity between Nfu1 and BolA3 mutations suggests the two proteins function in a common step of the Fe-S protein maturation pathway.</p><p>We demonstrate in studies using yeast as a model system that the yeast orthologs of human NFU1 and BOLA3 function in a late step of transfer of [4Fe-4S] clusters to specific client proteins. Yeast lacking Nfu1 are partially deficient in the [4Fe-4S] enzymes aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase and lipoic acid synthase. The defect in lipoic acid synthase is highlighted by the pronounced defect in protein lipoylation in mitochondria. The defect in yeast lacking Bol3 is modest, but is exacerbated in cells lacking both mitochondrial Bol3 and Bol1. The double null cells show related partial defects in [4Fe-4S] enzymes aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase and lipoic acid synthase, although the defects are not as pronounced as in <italic>nfu1</italic>∆ cells. Yeast lacking all three proteins Nfu1, Bol1 and Bol3 show an exaggerated phenotype approaching the defect seen in cells lacking the ISA complex required for [4Fe-4S] cluster synthesis. Clearly, <italic>nfu1</italic>∆ cells do not exhibit any defects in enzymes dependent on [2Fe-2S] centers, suggesting that Nfu1 functions in the [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer pathway.</p><p>Our systematic approach to identify endogenous binding partners of Nfu1, Bol1 and Bol3 revealed the step in Fe-S cluster biogenesis in which they function. Affinity purification of Nful1 coupled with mass spectrometry led to the identification of [4Fe-4S] client proteins as physically associating proteins of Nfu1. It is of interest that the G<sup>194</sup>C Nfu1 variant exhibiting a partial dominant negative effect showed enhanced interaction with the same client proteins. This yeast mutant mimics the known G<sup>208</sup>C patient mutation in human NFU1 that causes MMSD. Recombinant Nfu1 has been shown to bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster and <sup>55</sup>Fe in vivo labeling studies showed a strong increase in <sup>55</sup>Fe binding by the patient mimic G<sup>194</sup>C Nfu1 yeast variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, it is also noteworthy that Gly194 is in juxtaposition to the CxxC motif, which has been shown to bind Fe-S clusters. Therefore, it is plausible that the dominant negative effect of the G<sup>194</sup>C Nfu1 variant may result from the inefficient release of [4Fe-4S] clusters from the Nfu1 variant to client proteins.</p><p>The dramatic phenotype of cells harboring G<sup>194</sup>C Nfu1 is likely due to secondary effects of impaired lipoic acid formation. As mentioned, yeast lacking enzymes involved in octanoic acid formation or lipoic acid synthase are deficient in tRNA processing by RNase P leading to attenuation in mitochondrial translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schonauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hiltunen et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with impaired RNase P function, G<sup>194</sup>C Nfu1 cells are markedly attenuated in levels of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> ATPase and Cox2 steady-state levels. In contrast, the RNase P function is normal in either <italic>nfu1</italic>∆ cells or <italic>bol1</italic>∆<italic>bol3</italic>∆ cells based on normal F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> ATPase assembled complexes.</p><p>The physical interactions of Nfu1 with Isa1 and Isa2 corroborate our model that Nfu1 functions in [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer to client proteins. Interestingly, we isolated Isa2 as a suppressor of the respiratory defect of <italic>nfu1</italic>∆ cells. Whereas the condensation of two [2Fe-2S] to form a single [4Fe-4S] cluster requires the participation of Isa1, Isa2 and Iba57, Isa2 is capable of forming homo-dimers that may exert a limited transfer function as proposed for Nfu1.</p><p>The same [4Fe-4S] client proteins were pulled down in affinity purification of Bol3, but not Bol1, compared to proteins interacting with Nfu1. In the case of Bol3, the dominant negative H<sup>101</sup>C Bol3 variant also showed enhanced interactions with [4Fe-4S] client proteins. The dominant negative phenotype of the H<sup>101</sup>C Bol3 mutant (putative Fe-S ligand) but only loss of function phenotype for the H<sup>101</sup>A mutant is consistent with a model that Bol3 His101 participates in Fe-S cluster transfer.</p><p>The partial deficiency of [4Fe-4S] enzyme activities in <italic>nfu1</italic>∆ cells suggests that the function of Nfu1 may be conditionally important in [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer and that a bypass mechanism exists in yeast. We demonstrate that Nfu1 in yeast has a heightened importance in cells undergoing oxidative metabolism as opposed to anoxic metabolism. In addition, <italic>nfu1</italic>∆ cell growth defect is partially suppressed with supplemental GSH in the growth medium. Identification of the Yap1 and Yap2, transcription factors that are important for oxidative stress tolerance, as high copy suppressors emphasized the importance of Nfu1 during oxidative metabolism.</p><p>One curiosity is that human patients with mutations in NFU1 or BOLA3 lack defects in mitochondrial aconitase, whereas the yeast mutants, <italic>nfu1</italic>∆ and the double <italic>bol1</italic>∆ <italic>bol3</italic>∆, exhibit a partial aconitase defect. There are two implications of this result. First, Nfu1 may exhibit different client selectivity in the actual transfer of [4Fe-4S] clusters. Although Nfu1 binds many [4Fe-4S] client proteins, it may facilitate cluster transfer to select clients and this may differ between human and yeast cells as in the case of aconitase. This postulate is supported by the observed role for Nfu1 in Aco1 and Lip5 activation, but not the function of Aco2 and Lys4. Second, since the partial respiratory function persists in <italic>nfu1</italic>∆ cells, Nfu1 may facilitate cluster transfer in oxidative growth conditions and this may differ between yeast and human cells.</p><p>One dramatic phenotype in human and yeast Nfu1 mutant cells is impaired protein lipoylation. Yeast and human cells require lipoylation on E2 subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and the glycine cleavage enzyme complex. In addition, the human branched chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase requires lipoylation for function. Lip5 catalyzing formation of the lipoate coenzyme binds two [4Fe-4S] clusters, one of which serves as the sulfur donor for lipoic acid formation in a radical S-adenosylmethionine dependent reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cicchillo and Booker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cicchillo et al., 2004</xref>). Two sulfide ions from this auxiliary cluster are used for formation of lipoate resulting in disassembly of the cluster. Each catalytic cycle of the enzyme requires repair or replacement of the auxiliary cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cronan, 2014</xref>). Nfu1 may have a specialized role in cluster repair in lipoic acid synthase or alternatively provides a [4Fe-4S] replacement.</p><p>For most [4Fe-4S] client proteins, Nfu1 appears to have evolved to shield its [4Fe-4S] cluster from endogenous oxidants during the cluster transfer step. Oxidants are generated by 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutigny et al., 2013</xref>), so Nfu1-mediated cluster transfer may be critical to ensure intact [4Fe-4S] insertion. Nfu1 may also serve as a chaperone of apo-client protein, preventing their aggregation in the absence of a bound Fe-S cluster. Additional studies are necessary to define these candidate roles.</p><p>Bol3, but not Bol1, was found to associate with [4Fe-4S] client proteins, whereas Bol1 reproducibly associated with Grx5 both in in vivo and in vitro studies. BolA:glutaredoxin complexes reported to date only bind [2Fe-2S] clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Outten, 2012</xref>). Thus, Bol1 is anticipated to function with Grx5 in a [2Fe-2S] cluster step, whereas Bol3 is likely to function, independent of Grx5, in a Nfu1-mediated [4Fe-4S] cluster step. These studies suggest that Bol1 and Bol3 have specialized functions within the same pathway, such that cells lacking both Bol1 and Bol3 have a synthetic defect.</p><p>In summary, the present work suggests that Nfu1 has a significant role in a late step transfer of [4Fe-4S] clusters to select client proteins. Nfu1 binds the client proteins independent of the ISA complex and its association with the ISA complex may serve to recruit apo-clients to the ISA complex where [4Fe-4S] clusters are formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Some [4Fe-4S] client proteins may get their [4Fe-4S] cluster directly from the ISA complex, whereas others may derive their clusters after prior transfer of a [4Fe-4S] cluster to Nfu1. In these cases Nfu1 facilitates the process as an adapter protein in oxidatively growing cells. Additional work is required to discern the client selectivity in [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer by Nfu1. This model of eukaryotic Nfu1 function resembles the role of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Nfu1 ortholog NfuA, which binds a subset of Fe-S apo-client proteins and facilitates cluster transfer especially under oxidative stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Py et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutigny et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, the <italic>Azobacter</italic> NfuA is reported to be critical under oxidative growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008</xref>). In the case of <italic>E. coli</italic>, NfuA cluster transfer is likely mediated directly by NfuA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Py et al., 2012</xref>). Bol3 likely functions with Nfu1 in cluster transfer, but its mechanism remains nebulous. Clearly, interaction studies separate Bol1 and Bol3 into two distinct classes, with Bol3 working with Nfu1 in [4Fe-4S] client binding and Bol1 working with Grx5, which has one known function upstream of the ISA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Uzarska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banci et al., 2014</xref>). However, cells lacking both mitochondrial BolA proteins show a synthetic defect. The Bol3 protein may facilitate [4Fe-4S] cluster dissociation from either the ISA complex or Nfu1 in [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer. Additional work will be required to discern their mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>BY4741 strains were used unless indicated otherwise.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Role of Nfu1 and Bol3 in Iron-Sulfur Cluster Transfer to Mitochondrial Clients&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Klaus Pfanner, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper by the Winge group is a rather comprehensive study of the role of Nfu1 and Bol1, 3 in the Fe-S cluster biosynthetic pathway confirming and extending the role of these proteins in the late delivery of 4Fe-4S to client enzymes. The study has been carefully done and quite clearly demonstrates especially the interaction of Nfu1 with the Isa complex and bol3 in Fe-S delivery. The role of Bol1 is less clear in this pathway as it is shown to interact with GRX5 and to bind 2Fe-2S clusters.</p><p>The manuscript is remarkably complete, although also remarkably complicated. It clearly establishes that Nfu1 and Bol3A in yeast function in a late stage in mitochondria 4Fe-4S protein maturation. The authors are careful to point out that it is not yet clearly established what the specific roles are and suggest that there could be more than one function. Of the two dominant possibilities (1) cluster transfer from the primary assembly complex to the target 4Fe-4S protein (2) serving as a stabilizer/redox buffer of the apo-target proteins, the authors appear to, reasonably, favor (1).</p><p>Given the complete and compelling nature of the data presented there is little to criticize from the technical perspective.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Abstract contains many details, but is not easy to understand for readers outside the field. It contains several abbreviations that are not explained, e.g. ISA complex. The Abstract should be re-written and also include a last sentence that summarizes the main findings of the paper.</p><p>2) Although the data are presented clearly, the manuscript is difficult to read. The information is scattered in so many different figures, with much of the relevant data buried in the supplemental information, it is very difficult to keep track of the variously associated genotypes, phenotypes, and interacting partners. It seems to me that it would be very useful to the general reader if this work could be summarized in a table or two. In this way information in the table(s) could have superscripts that direct the reader to the relevant data presented in the various figures. The compelling aspect of the manuscript that justifies publication in <italic>eLife</italic> is that it provides clear biochemical linkage to known genetic defects in human patients, yet it will be good to structure the manuscript in a better digestible way.</p><p>3) The statement that Bol1 and Bol3 are redundant is not clear. Maybe I am missing something, but it seems that the double mutant only shows that they likely participate in the same pathway. If, as the authors intimate, Bol1 acts upstream of the Isa complex which generates 4Fe-4S clusters, then it might make sense that anything compromising this would have synthetic affects with downstream proteins, like Bol3 which are involved in delivering these clusters to client proteins.</p><p>4) I found the mass spectrometry data to be the most compelling. Nevertheless, this work is not, in my opinion, sufficiently emphasized. Also, it seems curious to me that the proteins implicated as partners are the only ones shown in the table. Unless there is something about the data presentation I missed, it seems highly unlikely to me that the expected interacting proteins are the <italic>only</italic> proteins that are consistently pulled down by this type of experiment. If that is true then the authors should state so explicitly, or they should have a more complete data set.</p><p>5) Using mass spectrometry analysis, interaction partners of Nfu1 could be detected. One of the proteins associated with Nfu1 was Lys4. This interaction was enhanced when the mutant Nfu1G/T&gt;H (Nfu1m) was used as stated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> the pull-down using Nfu1m-Strep and decorated against Lys4-HA does not show a clear increase in association of Nfu1m with Lys4. The authors should comment on this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15991.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The Abstract contains many details, but is not easy to understand for readers outside the field.

The compelling aspect of the manuscript that justifies publication in eLife is that it provides clear biochemical linkage to known genetic defects in human patients, yet it will be good to structure the manuscript in a better digestible way.</italic> </p><p>We considered many options to enhance the clarity of the figures and text. Besides the extensive rewriting of the text, we elected to modify the figure set to move certain supplemental figures to the main figure set. This will obviate the need for readers to move back and forth between the main paper and supplement. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we moved one key supplement to become panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>. This is a key figure to illustrate the effects of [4Fe-4S] defects on mitochondrial DNA translation via RNaseP. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we moved one supplement to the main figure as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we eliminated one supplemental figure that was redundant with the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> Supplemental tables. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we moved one supplement to the main figure to making inspection of the data easier. We generated a summary table as suggested, but found that too cumbersome. We are confident that moving these four supplemental panels to the main figures makes critical reading of the manuscript easier.</p><p><italic>3) The statement that Bol1 and Bol3 are redundant is not clear. Maybe I am missing something, but it seems that the double mutant only shows that they likely participate in the same pathway. If, as the authors intimate, Bol1 acts upstream of the Isa complex which generates 4Fe-4S clusters, then it might make sense that anything compromising this would have synthetic affects with downstream proteins, like Bol3 which are involved in delivering these clusters to client proteins.</italic> </p><p>This is correct; they are not redundant proteins. The double mutant lacking both Bol1 and Bol3 exhibits a synthetic defect. We acknowledge that the text was not clear on this point. We revised the text in the Discussion to state the following:</p><p>&quot;These studies suggest that Bol1 and Bol3 have specialized functions within the same pathway, such that cells lacking both Bol1 and Bol3 have a synthetic defect.&quot;</p><p><italic>4) I found the mass spectrometry data to be the most compelling. Nevertheless, this work is not, in my opinion, sufficiently emphasized. Also, it seems curious to me that the proteins implicated as partners are the only ones shown in the table. Unless there is something about the data presentation I missed, it seems highly unlikely to me that the expected interacting proteins are the only proteins that are consistently pulled down by this type of experiment. If that is true then the authors should state so explicitly, or they should have a more complete data set.</italic> </p><p>We accumulated five MS data set with Nfu1 interactors. In each independent data set, there were many other proteins pulled down with WT Nfu1 or the Nfu1 mutant. A few proteins such as Pil1, Atp5 and Mdh1 were pulled down in two independent studies. However, in one of the studies Mdh1 was only pulled down by WT Nfu1 and not the enhanced interactor mutant Nfu1. Thus, the FeS client proteins were the only proteins pulled down reproducibly. With Bol1, the only proteins that were pulled down in all interaction studies were Grx5 and Prx1. The Prx1 peroxiredoxin was a reproducible hit that we did not include in the initial Table, since we wanted to focus an independent study on this interaction. However, we have done follow-up studies with Prx1 and cannot find a FeS defect in mutant cells. Thus, we have amended our Table to include Prx1. No other reproducible interactors are evident.</p><p><italic>5) Using mass spectrometry analysis, interaction partners of Nfu1 could be detected. One of the proteins associated with Nfu1 was Lys4. This interaction was enhanced when the mutant Nfu1G/T&gt;H (Nfu1m) was used as stated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> the pull-down using Nfu1m-Strep and decorated against Lys4-HA does not show a clear increase in association of Nfu1m with Lys4. The authors should comment on this.</italic> </p><p>The MS data was done in cells containing chromosomally expressed Lys4. In contrast, the study in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> was done in cells with Lys4-HA expressed from a high copy vector. In that situation, we do not see an enrichment of Lys4 with the Nful1 mutant likely due to a mass action effect. With normal Lys4 expression, the Nfu1 mutant exhibits enhanced interaction with Lys4 by MS.</p></body></sub-article></article>
