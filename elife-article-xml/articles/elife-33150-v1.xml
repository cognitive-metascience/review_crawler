regulates hundreds of maternal mRNAs that become translationally repressed or activated as the oocyte transitions to an embryo. In a previous paper (Hara et al., 2017), we demonstrated PNG activity is under tight developmental control and restricted to this transition. Here, examination of PNG specificity showed it to be a Thr-kinase yet lacking a clear phosphorylation site consensus sequence. An unbiased biochemical screen for PNG substrates identified the conserved translational repressor Trailer Hitch (TRAL). Phosphomimetic mutation of the PNG phospho-sites in TRAL reduced its ability to inhibit translation in vitro. In vivo, mutation of <italic>tral</italic> dominantly suppressed <italic>png</italic> mutants and restored Cyclin B protein levels. The repressor Pumilio (PUM) has the same relationship with PNG, and we also show that PUM is a PNG substrate. Furthermore, PNG can phosphorylate BICC and ME31B, repressors that bind TRAL in cytoplasmic RNPs. Therefore, PNG likely promotes translation at the oocyte-to-embryo transition by phosphorylating and inactivating translational repressors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>maternal mRNA</kwd><kwd>cytoplasmic RNPs</kwd><kwd>Pumilio</kwd><kwd>ME31B</kwd><kwd>BICC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hara</surname><given-names>Masatoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hara</surname><given-names>Masatoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM104047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turk</surname><given-names>Benjamin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM39341</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orr-Weaver</surname><given-names>Terry L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orr-Weaver</surname><given-names>Terry L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The threonine kinase controls maternal mRNA translation phosphorylate components of the translational machinery, including translational repressors, which appear to inactivate to promote the oocyte-to-embryo transition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the most dramatic events in development is the transition from differentiated oocyte to totipotent embryo, a transition that in nearly all animals occurs in the absence of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). Thus, translational control of stockpiles of maternal mRNAs is crucial as the oocyte completes meiosis and resets for embryogenesis, a series of events termed egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Von Stetina and Orr-Weaver, 2011</xref>). In Drosophila, profound changes in mRNA translation accompany egg activation, with hundreds of maternal mRNAs becoming repressed and nearly a thousand translationally activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kronja et al., 2014</xref>). These translation changes occur in a brief window of less than an hour, and the majority are controlled by the PNG kinase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kronja et al., 2014</xref>). This kinase complex is composed of the PNG catalytic subunit, whose activity requires the physical association of two activating subunits, GNU and PLU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elfring et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fenger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). We recently demonstrated that the activity of PNG is restricted to the window of egg activation by exquisite developmental control of the binding of GNU to PNG and PLU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hara et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>PNG is likely to have many targets, given that it controls both mRNAs that become repressed and those that become activated at the oocyte-to-embryo transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kronja et al., 2014</xref>). PNG promotes the translation of <italic>smg</italic> mRNA, a translational repressor that can promote deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>). Most, but not all, of the mRNAs whose translational repression is dependent on PNG undergo SMG-dependent deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the role of PNG in translation repression can largely be explained by its effect in activating translation of <italic>smg</italic> mRNA. The mechanisms by which PNG promotes translation of activated mRNAs remain to be uncovered. To determine whether PNG directly controls translational regulators through phosphorylation, we carried out an unbiased biochemical screen to identify PNG substrates. Here, we present the results of that screen and evidence that PNG phosphorylates and inactivates translational repressors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PNG is a threonine kinase</title><p>As an initial approach to identify substrates for the PNG kinase, predicted to be a Ser/Thr kinase, we sought to determine whether PNG phosphorylation occurs at consensus sequences.

Although no strong consensus sequence was identified, PNG was most strongly selective for hydrophobic amino acids at −3 relative to the phosphorylated residue, and it had some preferences for aromatic residues at position −2 and for arginine at position +2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We previously had identified a limited number of substrates by DIVEC screening, in vitro transcribing and translating Drosophila cDNAs, adding recombinant PNG, and scoring for phosphorylation by gel mobility shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). Because of the limitations of this approach, we designed an unbiased biochemical screen. First, we attempted to introduce a mutation into the gatekeeper residue in the ATP-binding pocket of PNG kinase. Replacing the gatekeeper residue, which is a bulky residue, with a small amino acid allows kinases to utilize ATP analogs to label substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bishop et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alaimo et al., 2001</xref>). Unfortunately, the desired PNG mutants were inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The alternative strategy we employed to isolate PNG substrates was to use purified recombinant PNG kinase to thio-phosphorylate substrates in embryonic extracts, identifying them by recovery of thio-phosphorylated peptides by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The endogenous kinases in the extracts from early embryos were inactivated by treatment with 5’-(4-fluorosulphonylbenzoyl)adenosine (FSBA), which covalently binds to kinases at a conserved lysine in the ATP hydrolysis site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knight et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Western blot analysis with an antibody against alkylated-thio-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2007</xref>) showed that endogenous kinases in the extract had been inactivated, and phosphorylation occurred with wild-type PNG but not the kinase-dead form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

A second screen was done in which extracts were treated in parallel with wild-type and kinase-dead PNG. In this second screen, the total representation of peptides in the extract was quantified by doing mass spec analysis of the peptides that did not bind to iodoacetyl agarose. In the second experiment, 36 proteins had at least two independent peptides phosphorylated by wild-type but not kinase-dead PNG.

Although the substrates don’t reveal a strong PNG consensus sequence, it is possible that interaction between substrates and the PLU or GNU activating subunits may provide specificity beyond that at the phosphorylation site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Phosphorylation of TRAL by PNG in vitro</title><p>We focused on TRAL, because although there were many more abundant proteins in the extracts, we recovered a high number of PNG-phosphorylated peptides for TRAL.

We tested whether PNG can phosphorylate TRAL in vitro. A powerful aspect of the thio-phosphate substrate screen is that the MS analysis identifies the phosphorylated amino acids. 15 amino acids (13 of them threonine), clustered in the C-terminal half of the protein, were phosphorylated by PNG in embryonic extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). MBP fusions of purified full length TRAL, or the N- and C- terminal fragments were incubated with purified PNG and [γ <sup>32</sup>P]-ATP and analyzed by autoradiography. The full-length protein and the C-terminal half, but not the N-terminal half, were phosphorylated by PNG in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To determine whether PNG-dependent phosphorylation required the amino acids identified in the substrate screens, all 15 were changed to alanine. For both the full-length protein and the C-terminal half, the level of phosphorylation by PNG was reduced with the alanine-substituted forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

RAP55 from Xenopus and Sdc6 from yeast are able to inhibit translation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tanaka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>), in yeast apparently by blocking the function of the eIF4G subunit of the eIF4F initiation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rajyaguru et al., 2012</xref>). We examined translation of an mRNA encoding Myc-tagged GFP in reticulocyte lysates and found that as for other family members, addition of Drosophila TRAL inhibited translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Because in the in vitro reaction purified PNG does not phosphorylate TRAL to full stoichiometry, we evaluated the effect of PNG phosphorylation by generating a phosphomimetic form of TRAL in which aspartic acid was substituted for the fifteen PNG phosphorylation sites. Strikingly, the phosphomimetic mutations suppressed the translational repression by TRAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The potential existence of additional PNG phosphorylation sites in the C-terminus of TRAL could account for why suppression of translational repression by the phosphomimetic form of TRAL was not complete. In contrast, TRAL in which these residues were replaced by alanine still inhibited translation of the reporter mRNA in the extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results are consistent with phosphorylation of TRAL by PNG relieving its ability to repress translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Interaction between PNG and TRAL in vivo</title><p>To confirm that PNG phosphorylates TRAL in vivo we analyzed TRAL phosphorylation by MS following immunoprecipitation from extracts of mature oocytes, in vitro activated oocytes or early embryos. The phosphorylation pattern of TRAL during egg activation was very complex, with many sites. As a consequence, we could find only a small number of phospho-peptides in our quantitative MS analysis, because multiple phosphorylation in a peptide can impede detection of other phosphosites on the peptide after LC/MS. Nevertheless, we did observe that one of the threonine residues (T644) phosphorylated in vitro became phosphorylated at egg activation in wild-type but not <italic>png</italic> mutant eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Phosphorylation levels of several residues (T35, S59, S472) were reduced in the activated oocytes from the <italic>png</italic> mutant, although they were not found in the substrate screen. These might be potential PNG kinase target sites, but they also could be phosphorylated downstream of PNG indirectly. The proposal of phosphorylation downstream of PNG is consistent with two of these being in the N-terminus of TRAL that is not phosphorylated by PNG in vitro, and the observation that S214 phosphorylation is increased in <italic>png</italic> mutant activated oocytes. Together these results support the conclusion that TRAL is a PNG substrate, but they reveal that TRAL phosphorylation is developmentally dynamic and involves several kinases.</p><p>Therefore, we looked for genetic interactions between <italic>png</italic> and <italic>tral</italic> mutants. The <italic>png</italic> gene was identified because mutant females produce eggs that complete meiosis but subsequently fail to initiate mitotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shamanski and Orr-Weaver, 1991</xref>). Nevertheless, DNA replication continues, resulting in embryos with giant, polyploid nuclei. In strong alleles of <italic>png</italic> there is no mitosis, whereas weaker alleles permit a few mitotic divisions but these nuclei ultimately also become polyploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shamanski and Orr-Weaver, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). The absence of mitosis in <italic>png</italic> mutants is due to a failure to promote <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA translation at egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kronja et al., 2014</xref>). We demonstrated that removal of one copy of some genes (such as the translational repressor <italic>pum</italic>, discussed below) can suppress the giant-nuclei <italic>png</italic> phenotype, resulting in embryos that undergo more mitotic divisions and thus have more nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). If the gene acts downstream of <italic>png</italic>, this suppression is consistent with <italic>png</italic> acting negatively on the gene. In contrast, removal of one copy of a gene such as <italic>cyclin B</italic> enhances the <italic>png</italic> phenotype, consistent with <italic>png</italic> having a positive effect on this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>We compared embryos laid by females with <italic>png<sup>1058</sup>/png<sup>3318</sup></italic> with one copy of <italic>tral</italic> mutated to sibling controls solely mutant for <italic>png</italic>. Reducing the dosage of <italic>tral</italic> (a heterozygous <italic>tral<sup>1</sup></italic> mutation, which has a P element insertion) suppressed the <italic>png</italic> phenotype, permitting additional mitoses and increased numbers of nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

These genetic epistasis results complement the in vitro translation results with the phosphomimetic TRAL form. They are consistent with TRAL being a target of PNG and phosphorylation negatively affecting TRAL.</p><p>To test whether the genetic interactions between <italic>tral</italic> and <italic>png</italic> affect <italic>cyclin B</italic> mRNA translation, we examined protein levels by immunoblotting of extracts from the mutant and control embryos. Strikingly, Cyclin B protein levels were increased in the <italic>png</italic> transheterozygous embryos when the dosage of <italic>tral</italic> was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistent with the suppression phenotypes, the amount of Cyclin B was restored more with the deletion than with the <italic>tral<sup>1</sup></italic> allele. Cyclin A, another PNG translational target, also was increased with reduced TRAL.</p><p>Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation results and the genetic interaction data indicate that phosphorylation of TRAL by PNG blocks its repressive effects on translation, permitting translation of <italic>cyclin B</italic> at egg activation to permit embryonic mitoses. This could be due to PNG phosphorylation directly repressing TRAL function or via an effect of phosphorylation on the localization of TRAL. TRAL is present in large cytoplasmic RNP granules in mature oocytes in both Drosophila and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and these disperse on egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weil et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noble et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, one model for the effect of PNG on TRAL is that phosphorylation could affect the localization of TRAL to RNP granules. We examined these large visible granules using a <italic>GFP-Tral</italic> FlyTrap line with or without <italic>png</italic> mutations and following TRAL localization during in vitro egg activation. We found that early in activation, by about 10 min, TRAL granules became diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In <italic>png</italic> mutant eggs, the TRAL granules also disappeared with normal timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We conclude that PNG does not appear to be involved in this reorganization of TRAL granules. Indeed, dispersal of TRAL from granules occurs prior to when PNG becomes active at 30 min after egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hara et al., 2017</xref>). PNG phosphorylation may more directly affect the ability of TRAL to inhibit translation initiation, as indicated by the effect of the phosphomimetic form on translation in reticulocyte lysates.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33150.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>PNG kinase phosphorylates translational repressors in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TRAL granules in oocytes diminished after egg activation independently of <italic>png</italic>.

Given its interaction with TRAL, we directly tested ME31B in vitro and found that PNG was able to phosphorylate it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We did not, however, recover BICC from the substrate screen. Despite this, PNG readily phosphorylates BICC in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>These results raise the possibility that PNG acts on a number of translational repressors.

The dominant genetic suppression of <italic>png</italic> observed with mutation of <italic>tral</italic> or <italic>pum</italic> generates the hypothesis that PNG may inactivate multiple translational repressors by phosphorylation to promote translation of different sets of mRNAs at egg activation. It is also possible that PNG’s effect on multiple repressors may target a single set of mRNAs localized to RNP granules. For example, ME31B is bound to TRAL. <italic>BicC</italic> genetically interacts with <italic>tral</italic>, the protein appears to localize to the RNP granules in which TRAL and ME31B reside, and it binds to GNU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kugler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chicoine et al., 2007</xref>).

After centrifugation at 14 krpm for 15 min at 4˚C, the supernatant was applied to a PD10 desalting column (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) to change its buffer into kinase buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 3 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 80 mM βGP, 0.5mM DTT, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN)] and treated with 1 mM FSBA for 45 min at room temperature.

They were separately resuspended in the same volume of kinase buffer as the initial extract volume and were dialyzed in kinase buffer to remove ammonium sulfate and free FSBA. If fractions had remaining endogenous kinase activities, they were treated with FSBA again and dialyzed to remove it.

For immunoblots, dechorionated embryos were lysed in 1x LSB and Cyclin A and B proteins were probed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hara et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>In vitro activation and GFP-TRAL imaging</title><p>Stage 14 oocytes were collected from <italic>png<sup>1058</sup>/FM7w<sup>a</sup>;GFP-Tral<sup>89</sup>/TM3Sb</italic> or <italic>png<sup>1058</sup>/png<sup>1058</sup>;GFP-Tral<sup>89</sup>/TM3Sb</italic> females in isolation buffer and placed between a glass slide and cover slip separated with double sticky tape as a spacer. The oocytes in the chamber were activated with activation buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mahowald et al., 1983</xref>). GFP-TRAL in the cytoplasm was inspected by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM700).</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Trailer Hitch phospho-site mapping</title><p>Stage 14 oocytes, in vitro activated eggs (30 min) and fertilized embryos (1 hr collection) from WT (<italic>OrR</italic>) or <italic>png</italic> mutant (<italic>png<sup>1058/1058</sup></italic>) females were homogenized in lysis buffer supplemented with RNase A (0.1 mg/mL). Soluble fractions were recovered after centrifugation and their protein concentration was adjusted to 5 μg/μL. Forty μL of the soluble fractions was used for immunoprecipitaion for TRAL. Protein G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were incubated with anti-TRAL antibody (a gift from Izaurralde lab), washed and cross-linked by BS<sup>3</sup> (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following protocols from the manufacturer. The beads were incubated with the soluble fractions from above for 2 hr at 4<sup>o</sup>C. After washing the beads three times with lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by adding LSB followed by boiling for 5 min. The eluted proteins were run on an SDS-PAGE and stained with CBB.</p><p>The TRAL bands were excised from the gel. After destaining with 40% ethanol/10% acetic acid, the proteins were reduced with 20 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 hr at 56°C and then alkylated with 60 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 hr at 25°C in the dark. Proteins then were digested with 12.5 ng/μL modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 50 μL of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH8.9 at 25<sup>o</sup>C overnight. Peptides were extracted by incubating the gel pieces with 50% acetonitrile/5% formic acid then 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, repeated twice followed by incubating the gel pieces with 100% acetonitrile then 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, repeated twice. Each fraction was collected, combined, and reduced to near dryness in a vacuum centrifuge. Peptides were desalted using C18 SpinTips (Protea, Morgantown, WV) then lyophilized and stored at −80˚C.</p><p>Peptide labeling with TMT 6plex (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was performed per manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were dissolved in 70 μL ethanol and 30 μL of 500 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH8.5, and the TMT reagent was dissolved in 30 μL of anhydrous acetonitrile. The solution containing peptides and TMT reagent was vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. Samples labeled with the six different isotopic TMT reagents were combined and concentrated to completion in a vacuum centrifuge.</p><p>Phosphorylated peptides were enriched as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ficarro et al., 2009</xref>). In brief, nickel was removed from the Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with 100 mM EDTA. The NTA Agarose was then incubated with 100 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub>. The peptides were acidified and incubated with the Fe-NTA agarose for 1 hr at room temperature. Phosophopeptides were eluted with 250 mM sodium phosphate.</p><p>The peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC using an EASY- nLC1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) over a 75 min gradient before nanoelectrospray using a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode. The parameters for the full scan MS were: resolution of 70,000 across 350–2000 <italic>m/z</italic>, AGC 3e<sup>6</sup>, and maximum IT 50 ms. The full MS scan was followed by MS/MS for the top 10 precursor ions in each cycle with a NCE of 32 and dynamic exclusion of 30 s. Raw mass spectral data files (.raw) were searched using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and Mascot version 2.4.1 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). Mascot search parameters were: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 10 mmu for fragment ion mass tolerance; two missed cleavages of trypsin; fixed modification were carbamidomethylation of cysteine and TMT 6plex modification of lysines and peptide N-termini; variable modifications were oxidized methionine, serine phosphorylation, threonine phosphorylation, and tyrosine phosphorylation. Only peptides with a Mascot score greater than or equal to 25 and an isolation interference less than or equal to 30 were included in the quantitative data analysis. TMT quantification was obtained using Proteome Discoverer and isotopically corrected per manufacturer’s instructions, and the values were normalized to the median of the non-phosphopeptides for each channel. Phosphopeptides were manually validated using CAMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Curran et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Amanda Del Rosario and Eric Spooner for MS analyses and Emir Avilés-Pagán for help with Drosophila stocks.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hara et al. follow up their <italic>eLife</italic> paper on the control of <italic>Drosophila</italic> PNG paper during egg activation to show that PNG is an active kinase and identify a major target as Tral, a translational repressor. They find that phosphorylation of Tral likely inhibits its repression of translation of proteins such as cyclins A and B, and that its action on their expression is within a pathway with PNG. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for how PNG activates translation of SMG, which then regulates translation of certain mRNAs. The authors further propose that PNG might regulate other translational regulators and examined three: PLU, Bic-C, and Me31B. They show that all three can be phosphorylated by PNG in vitro, although they do not test whether this affects their activity. Such a test would have strengthened the paper further but would require a separate large study, and the Tral data already support the idea. The authors hypothesize that their data on Tral show, and on other proteins suggest, that PNG phosphorylation inactivates translational repressors thereby activating translation upon egg activation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>No additional experiments are required but the following comments should be addressed by re-writing the manuscript and including extant raw data:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: the authors performed two replicates of MS to identify potential substrates of PNG, but only report detailed results for one replicate. The complete data from both replicates should be presented. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, the spectral count column headings should read &quot;peptide&quot; rather than &quot;protein.&quot; Finally, the authors should include an additional supplemental spreadsheet that lists the actual peptide sequences obtained from this analysis.</p><p>Related to this, Figure 2—figure supplement 3 shows the overlap between two experiments to define PNG targets. It was of concern that only about 1/3 of the hits were found in both runs. Some consideration or explanation for this would be important. Perhaps this also relates to the failure to detect PUM and BIC-C in the target datasets. Being conservative in focusing on the overlap genes is valid, but this raises a question about the sensitivity of the screen. Please discuss.</p><p>2) PNG itself is one of its targets.

In this experiment only wild-type PNG kinase was used, and the total peptide numbers (those that flowed through the iodoacetyl resin and thus were not phophosphorylated) were not recovered and quantified. Additionally, in the first experiment the two ammonium sulfate fractions of 25% and 40-75% were analyzed separately.</p><p>The second mass spec substrate screen was a thorough screen, and it was this one that was reported in the submitted manuscript. In this screen wild-type and kinase-dead samples were analyzed in parallel. The peptides that flowed through the iodoacetyl resin were recovered and quantified. The peptides from the 5 ammonium sulfate fractions were processed independently but they were pooled for the mass spec analysis.</p><p>The differences between the pilot and second experiment likely explain the restricted overlap between the two experiments. But we also do not think that the two substrate screens were saturating and state this in the revised text.</p><p>In response to the reviewers’ comments we reanalyzed the spectra and the data, demanding more restrictive criteria of comparing both experiments by Mascot analysis and removing any substrates for which phosphopeptides also were recovered in the kinase-dead sample. We also made the stringent requirement to only consider as substrates proteins for which two independent phosphopeptides were recovered. This altered the substrates identified in experiment 2 and changed the overlap.
