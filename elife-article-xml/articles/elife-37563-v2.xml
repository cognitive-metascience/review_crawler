We studied such a case where a large set of genes—those coding for the ribosomal proteins—gained <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences for a particular transcription regulator (Mcm1) in independent fungal lineages. We present evidence that these gains occurred because Mcm1 shares a mechanism of transcriptional activation with an ancestral regulator of the ribosomal protein genes, Rap1. Specifically, we show that Mcm1 and Rap1 have the inherent ability to cooperatively activate transcription through contacts with the general transcription factor TFIID. Because the two regulatory proteins share a common interaction partner, the presence of one ancestral <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence can ‘channel’ random mutations into functional sites for the second regulator. At a genomic scale, this type of intrinsic cooperativity can account for a pattern of parallel evolution involving the fixation of hundreds of substitutions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37563.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sometimes evolution repeats itself. For example, independent butterfly species can evolve the same warning pattern to ward off predators. In many cases, the reason that a certain trait crops up again and again in parallel evolution is unknown.</p><p>One example is from the evolution of fungi, where a particular DNA sequence appeared several times independently in a large range of genes in different fungus species. This DNA sequence binds to a protein called Mcm1, which regulates nearby genes. Exactly why this DNA sequence has evolved in parallel so often in fungi has not been clear until now.</p><p>Researchers want to find out what is so special about this DNA binding sequence for Mcm1, as there are many other proteins that could do the same job. Now, Sorrells et al. investigated this further by testing whether a binding site for another protein Rap1 often found close by had a role to play. Experiments using 162 different fungus species showed that Mcm1 binding sites had evolved 12 times in parallel. Rap1 and Mcm1 did indeed turn out to work together to regulate nearby genes. The two proteins interact with a large protein complex critical for activating genes.</p><p>As a result, Mcm1 binding sites are more likely to evolve and play a role in gene regulation in different species when they are located near Rap1 binding sites. This could explain why this particular DNA sequence has evolved in parallel so many times. The same principle may apply to other genetic sequences involved in parallel evolution. With this understanding, it could be possible to predict when and where this event might occur in the future in fungi. This could be particularly useful for working towards being able to predict and anticipate the evolution of drug-resistant fungal pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Kluyveromyces lactis</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM115892</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Amanda N</given-names></name><name><surname>Feigerle</surname><given-names>Jordan T</given-names></name><name><surname>Weil</surname><given-names>P Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM037049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sorrells</surname><given-names>Trevor R</given-names></name><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Conor J</given-names></name><name><surname>Britton</surname><given-names>Candace S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fowler</surname><given-names>Kyle R</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Alexander D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cooperativity between two transcription regulators occurs through protein-protein interactions with a general transcription factor complex and potentiates the parallel evolution of their DNA binding sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Contingency is widespread in evolution, with chance historical changes dictating the repertoire of future possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bershtein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blount et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ortlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sorrells et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Starr et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, repeated evolutionary events in different lineages demonstrate that evolution is, at least in some instances, predictable. Repeatability is broadly referred to as convergent evolution, and when a trait arises repeatedly by a similar molecular mechanism, it is referred to as parallel evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stern, 2013</xref>). Beginning with Darwin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Darwin, 1883</xref>), convergence has been taken as evidence for adaptation, but it can also be caused by drift within the constraints that arise from the properties of biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Losos, 2011</xref>). Instances of repeated events can be thought of as natural experimental replicates for finding general principles that result in convergent evolution, and this information could be used to predict which evolutionary paths are most probable.</p><p>Genomic studies have found sets of genes that underlie convergent evolution of a wide variety of traits from across the tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Denoeud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mycorrhizal Genomics Initiative Consortium et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Marvig et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McCutcheon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nagy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pfenning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sherwood et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Soria-Carrasco et al., 2014</xref>). Such sets of genes tend to evolve in functionally related groups and are controlled by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences for particular transcription regulators, forming a transcription network. One way that an entire network can be up- or down-regulated is through alterations in the expression of a ‘master’ regulator, propagating a new expression level to all of its downstream target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McGregor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rebeiz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reed et al., 2011</xref>). However, in many cases—instead of changing the expression pattern of a master regulator—each gene in the network independently acquires the same <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence, requiring hundreds of mutations across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Booth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borneman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gasch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kasowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lowe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Paris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Piasecki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tuch et al., 2008b</xref>). An outstanding question is how this process occurs.</p><p>Several molecular mechanisms for gene-by-gene rewiring have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Britten and Davidson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tuch et al., 2008b</xref>). Hitchhiking of a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory site on a transposable element is a mechanism well-documented in plant and animal evolution, and can rapidly bring genes under new regulatory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bourque et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chuong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kunarso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lynch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, one transcription regulator can gain a protein-protein interaction with another, followed by the evolution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lynch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pérez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tsong et al., 2006</xref>). This latter mechanism is able, at least in principle, to rewire an entire set of genes at once upon evolution of the new protein-protein interaction; the individual gains of binding sites could occur secondarily. Nevertheless, many—if not most—examples of network rewiring seem to have occurred in the absence of evidence for either of these two mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borneman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gasch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kasowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lowe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Paris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Piasecki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tuch et al., 2008a</xref>).</p><p>Here, we studied an example of transcription network rewiring in which ~100 ribosomal protein genes gained binding sites for the Mcm1 transcription regulator, and we describe evidence supporting a new mechanism for the concerted gains. The gain of Mcm1 binding sites in the ribosomal protein genes occurred in parallel in two respects: (1) the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sites were gained upstream of a large proportion of the ribosomal proteins in each species; and (2) they were gained independently approximately 12 – 13 times during Ascomycete evolution. At each gene, several point mutations were probably necessary to produce a close match to the 16-basepair Mcm1 binding site, thus requiring several hundred mutations across the entire gene set.</p><p>Based on results from a variety of experimental approaches, we argue that the gain of Mcm1 sites was potentiated in several different clades by the presence of an ancestral transcription regulator of the ribosomal protein genes, Rap1. We demonstrate that Rap1 and Mcm1 have the intrinsic ability to cooperate in the activation of transcription, even when artificially introduced in species in which their sites are not found together. Biochemical and genetic experiments show that both regulators interact with the general transcription factor TFIID. We propose that the intrinsic, ancient ability of both proteins to interact with a common component of the general transcription machinery facilitated the repeated evolution of the Mcm1 sites in independent lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gains of functional Mcm1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sites</title><p>Previously, genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and bioinformatics experiments revealed that Mcm1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sites evolved independently at the ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) in several yeast lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tuch et al., 2008a</xref>).

To estimate how many gains and losses occurred during the evolution of Mcm1 sites, we treated the presence of Mcm1 sites (-log10(<italic>P</italic>) &gt; 3) as a discrete character and sampled 10,000 stochastic character maps from the posterior probability distribution of each of two models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bollback, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Revell, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). One model assumed gains and losses to be equal in probability and the other estimated them as two different rates. Under both models, the number of gains was substantial: an average of 13.4 and 12.0 for the equal and different rates models, respectively (95% highest posterior density interval of 12 – 14 and 7 – 17 gains, respectively). The number of losses differed between the models resulting in an average of 3.0 losses for the equal rates model and 17.0 for the different rates model. These models indicate that the number of times Mcm1 sites were gained in the Ascomycete evolution was high (12 – 13 on average) whereas the number of losses is sensitive to the assumptions of the model.</p><p>Three observations support the idea that the pattern of Mcm1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences in the RPGs require independent gains for most of the monophyletic clades and species with Mcm1 sites. First, the gain model is more parsimonious because of the sparse distribution of clades with Mcm1 sites. This is still true when taking into account the ancient interspecies hybridization that occurred in two ancient members of <italic>Saccharomycetaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marcet-Houben and Gabaldón, 2015</xref>) because in most likely scenarios, the ancestors are concordant for the absence of Mcm1 sites. Second, other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences show similar patterns of evolution to that of Mcm1. The Dot6/Tod6 and Rim101 motifs are also found upstream of the RPGs in several distantly related clades, although fewer clades than for Mcm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Other regulators show clear single gains in the common ancestor of all Saccharomycotina yeasts (e.g. Rap1), or Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina (e.g. Cbf1) as well as losses in sparsely distributed individual clades and species. These results show that gains and losses of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences are common upstream of the RPGs, and that they can be distinguished from each other based on their distinct distributions among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lavoie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanay et al., 2005</xref>). Third, it was previously shown that the entire set of genes that Mcm1 regulates changes extensively over the timescale of Ascomycete evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tuch et al., 2008a</xref>), suggesting that conservation from a distant ancestor would be a marked exception to this trend.</p><p>To test whether the Mcm1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sites we identified upstream of the RPGs are functional, we linked several full-length RPG upstream intergenic regions to the fluorescent reporter GFP. We chose <italic>RPL37</italic> and <italic>RPS18</italic> from <italic>Kl. lactis</italic>, each of which has Mcm1 binding sites and measured the expression of these reporters under nutrient-replete conditions. To test whether they contributed to expression, we scrambled the Mcm1 sites. In both cases, the scrambled site reduced expression of the reporter (<italic>RPS18 p</italic>=0.017; <italic>RPL37 p</italic>=0.027; Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test) but left the cell-to-cell variability unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given that there are many known regulators of ribosomal protein transcription, this demonstrates that Mcm1 plays a non-redundant role in activating these genes in <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> under conditions that require high expression of the translational machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Selection on RPG expression levels</title><p>Yeast ribosomes are composed of four ribosomal RNAs and 78 ribosomal proteins, assembled in equal stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</xref>).

(2) The gain of Mcm1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences compensate for other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes that lower expression of the genes, with no net gain in expression levels.

Instead, it favors the second hypothesis: ongoing evolution of Mcm1 sites in the <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> clade compensates (perhaps incompletely) for other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes that reduce RPG transcript levels.

One possibility is that Mcm1 expression changes under certain environmental conditions, conferring optimal RPG expression levels for the <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> clade (as well as the other clades that gained Mcm1 sites).

To test directly whether Mcm1 also binds to TFIID (as suggested by mass spectrometry-based analyses of TFIID and associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sanders et al., 2002</xref>]), we performed a Far-Western protein-protein binding assay using purified <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> TFIID, <italic>Sc</italic>Mcm1, and individual TFIID subunits. We found that Mcm1 binds directly to the Taf4 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>); using deletions of Taf4, we further mapped the interaction to the N-terminal region of Taf4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>).

Because Rap1 is an essential gene, we took advantage of a version of Rap1 with altered DNA-binding specificity (Rap1<sup>AS</sup>) that binds to a non-natural <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence and confers expression of a reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson and Weil, 2017</xref>).

To address this question, we centered each RPG intergenic region on the best Mcm1 site and plotted the location of other RPG regulators relative to Mcm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This analysis revealed that, in some of these clades, Mcm1 sites were gained varying distances away from the pre-existing sites of other regulators (Tbf1, Rrn7, and Fhl1), suggesting that the evolutionary mechanism we identified with Rap1 and Mcm1 might be a generalizable to other instances of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Consistent with this idea, all three of these regulators are reported to interact (directly or indirectly) with TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gavin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knutson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mallick and Whiteway, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhong and Melcher, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the experiments we have presented describe a special relationship between Rap1 and Mcm1 by virtue of their interaction with different surfaces of the same rate-limiting component of transcription, TFIID. This relationship between Rap1 and Mcm1 is ancient, and in the next section, we discuss how this property can predispose transcription networks to evolve repeatedly along the same trajectory.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have investigated an example of parallel evolution where binding sites for a particular transcription regulator (Mcm1) were gained in a large group of genes (the ribosomal protein genes, RPGs). These gains occurred repeatedly in several independent fungal lineages. In three of these lineages, Mcm1 binding sites were gained a fixed distance from the sites for another transcription regulator, Rap1, and we show that these newly acquired Mcm1 sites are required for full activation of the RPGs. We also show that Mcm1 and Rap1 cooperatively activate these genes. The direct interaction of both of these regulators with a common target, the general transcription factor TFIID, provides a plausible mechanism for this cooperative transcription activation. It also explains why the ability of Rap1 and Mcm1 to work together was ancestral to the more recent gains of Mcm1 sites adjacent to Rap1 sites at the RPGs.</p><p>How do these observations account for the fact that Mcm1 sites (as opposed to sites for other regulators) were repeatedly gained in parallel next to the Rap1 site at the RPGs? And how do they account for the distance constraints? One common explanation for parallelism is a specific environmental adaptation that occurs through a similar molecular mechanism. However, the yeast species with Mcm1 sites at the RPGs are from diverse ecological niches (e.g. plant leaves, mangrove sediment, the human body, soil) and utilize different nutrient sources (e.g. lactate, xylose, feline skin, nematode predation), defying a specific environmental adaptation explanation. Consistent with this view is our observation, based on analyzing interspecies hybrids, that a species in which the Mcm1 sites were gained at the RPGs does not express these genes at higher levels than related species that evolved fewer Mcm1 sites.</p><p>The model that best fits all of our data holds that the parallel gains arose from the ease with which the functional Mcm1 sites (and not the sites of other regulators) appeared in evolution, rather than selective pressure for particular adaptation. Specifically, we propose that, in the <italic>Kluyveromyces-Saccharomyces</italic> ancestor (before the parallel gains of Mcm1 sites) Rap1 bound to the ribosomal protein genes and activated transcription through interactions with TFIID, as it does in extant species. We further propose that, in the ancestor, Mcm1 activated non-ribosomal genes by interaction with a second site on TFIID, as it does in the extant species <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Any suboptimal Mcm1 site that arose by chance point mutation at a specified distance from a Rap1 site would immediately be functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) because, as we show, even a weak Mcm1 DNA interaction would be stabilized by Mcm1’s intrinsic ability to directly bind TFIID (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and 6A</xref>). In this way, even suboptimal <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences (which are much more likely to appear by chance than optimal sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dermitzakis and Clark, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stone and Wray, 2001</xref>]) could form under selection. The appearance of Mcm1 sites likely occurred concomitantly with the gradual losses of other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sites in the RPGs; in other words, the Mcm1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sites would fall under selection as other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sites deteriorated by mutation. In essence, we propose that the free energy gained from the intrinsic interaction between Mcm1 and TFIID would favor formation of new Mcm1 sites at the expense of pre-existing <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences, particularly since the latter provide a larger target for inactivating mutations. This model accounts for why Mcm1 sites (and not those of other transcription regulators) were repeatedly gained at the RPGs and why the distance between Rap1 and Mcm1 sites is constrained in those species in which the gains occurred.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37563.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for evolution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sites through intrinsic cooperativity.</title><p>Multiple gains of new Mcm1 sites occur in the ribosomal protein genes because Rap1 and Mcm1 both bind to TFIID, a general transcription factor. Due to the intrinsic cooperativity of Rap1 and Mcm1 (which is ancestral to the gains of Mcm1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences) the evolution of even a weak Mcm1 site near an existing Rap1 site would produce an effect on transcription. Because they are more likely to be functional, weak Mcm1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences are preferentially retained in the population if they arise at a specified distance (as determined by the shape of TFIID) from Rap1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences. These sites would be preserved if there is direct selection to increase RPG expression, or if they are combined over time with the mutational degradation of other regulatory elements that bring the Mcm1 site under purifying selection.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-37563-fig7-v2"/></fig><p>Numerous experimental observations support this model and rule out alternative explanations: (1) in extant species, Rap1 and Mcm1 both interact with TFIID; (2) They interact with different parts of TFIID; (3) cooperative transcriptional activation by Mcm1 and Rap1 requires the activation domain of Rap1, which is known to interact with TFIID; (4) the spacing between Rap1 and Mcm1 sites in the ribosomal protein genes places the proteins on the same side of the helix but at least 50 bp apart, consistent with a physical interaction with a large complex; (5) engineered suboptimal Mcm1 sites are functional as long as they are adjacent to Rap1 sites; (6) Mcm1 and Rap1 have the intrinsic ability to cooperate (through interactions with TFIID) even in a species where Mcm1 sites were not gained at the RPGs.</p><p>We note that this model does not require any change in Rap1 or Mcm1 during the gains of Mcm1 sites at the RPGs. Presumably, Rap1 and Mcm1 activated many genes separately in the ancestor, thus preserving by stabilizing selection their ability to interact with TFIID. This idea is consistent with the observation that the two proteins were able to cooperate on artificial constructs introduced into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> even though their binding sites are not found together at the RPGs. Mutations that alter the function of transcription regulators (for example, creating a new protein-protein interaction) can be pleiotropic, decreasing the likelihood that they can arise without disrupting the proteins' ancestral functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carroll, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stern and Orgogozo, 2008</xref>). (We note that the transcriptional output was slightly more cooperative in <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> than in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, leaving open the possibility that additional fine-scale evolutionary changes may have occurred in how these proteins interact.) According to our model, the ability of the two regulators to work together was ancestral, part of each protein’s intrinsic mechanism of transcriptional activation; therefore, their coupling at the RPGs would avoid such pleiotropic changes.</p><p>How does this model account for the gains of Mcm1 sites observed in clades where Rap1 does not regulate the RPGs? In these cases, Mcm1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences also show preferred spacing relative to known regulators of the RPGs, specifically Tbf1 and Rrn7, and we propose that the same type of cooperativity with TFIID can also account for these cases. These two regulators are reported to interact with TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knutson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mallick and Whiteway, 2013</xref>). Indeed, TFIID occupies the promoters of RPGs in human cell lines as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2012</xref>), raising the possibility that TFIID is a conserved general activator of the RPGs across fungi and animals, while the specific transcription regulators that interact with TFIID simply interchange over this timescale.</p><p>While our cooperative activation model provides an explanation for the parallel acquisition of Mcm1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory site evolution, selection must have operated to preserve the Mcm1 sites as they arose in the population. As described earlier, we favor a model where the gains of Mcm1 sites compensated for the degradation of other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences and thereby fell under selection. The allelic expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) strongly supports this model for one clade, represented by <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> species. However, it is also possible that, in other clades or over shorter timescales, the Mcm1 sites could have been gained due to selection for higher levels of RPG expression. The widespread differences in RPG expression revealed by the published interspecies hybrid experiments suggest that RPG expression may experience strong and shifting selection, helping to account for the surprising observation that transcriptional regulators that control the RPGs vary substantially across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gasch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lavoie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mallick and Whiteway, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tuch et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zeevi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zeevi et al., 2011</xref>). We note that the intrinsic cooperativity model is sufficient to explain the gain of Mcm1 sites whether or not any change in selection occurs: if functional Mcm1 sites are relatively easy to form (because of intrinsic cooperativity) they will be favored over gains of other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences by mutational processes alone. Mutations creating Mcm1 sites and weakening other sites could occur sequentially in either order or simultaneously (on the same haplotype), depending on the expression requirements of the RPG at that point in its evolutionary history. We feel that it is likely that most or all of the selection scenarios outlined above have occurred in at least one RPG at some point during the multiple and ongoing gains of Mcm1 sites over millions of years of fungal evolution. While the precise circumstances of each Mcm1 site gain are unknown, intrinsic cooperativity biases the RPGs as a whole toward gaining these sites.</p><p>In conclusion, we have proposed a mechanism, supported by multiple lines of experimental evidence, to account for convergent regulatory evolution of a large set of genes. Although, on the surface, the parallel gains of Mcm1 sites at the ribosomal genes would seem to require a special evolutionary explanation, our model does not require an extraordinary mechanism beyond individual point mutations in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of each gene. However, the ancestral ability of the two key regulators to activate transcription simplifies the path to gaining these sites by producing a phenotypic output from even non-optimal sites. Mcm1, because of its intrinsic ability to cooperate with Rap1, can significantly activate transcription at the ribosomal proteins more easily than it would elsewhere in the genome; likewise, Mcm1 (or another regulator that interacted with TFIID) would be preferred at the RPGs over regulators that did not share this common direct protein interaction. Thus, the intrinsic cooperativity of Rap1 and Mcm1 ‘channels’ random mutations into functional Mcm1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences, accounting for the observed parallel evolution. We speculate that gene activation through intrinsic cooperativity may be a general mechanism to explain the rapid and ubiquitous rewiring of transcription networks.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Computational genomics of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences</title><p>Genomes were compiled from the Yeast Gene Order Browser (YGOB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 2011</xref>), the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute MycoCosm portal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grigoriev et al., 2014</xref>), and individual genome releases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

The motif was left as-is instead of correcting for the GC-content in each genome, because the purpose of this scoring was to identify DNA sequences that are most similar to the Mcm1 binding site, not those that are most statistically enriched given the GC-content. Calculating enrichment of the binding site in ribosomal protein genes relative to the rest of the genome was done to take into account forces (including, but not limited to GC-content) that affect the prevalence of the motif genome-wide.

This analysis was carried out using the scripts TFBS_score.py and rel_locs_RPs.py.</p><p>Genome-wide scoring of relative motif locations using rel_loc_RPs.py was used to identify additional genes beyond the RPGs that show a similar pattern of Rap1 and Mcm1 sites near to each other. Rap1 sites that faced toward the gene and had a score greater than 6.0 were identified, as were Mcm1 sites with a score above 6.0. Then, genes that had both a forward-facing Rap1 site and an Mcm1 site between 52 and 78 bp downstream (the spacing of most sites at the RPGs) were identified. The order of Rap1 and Mcm1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory site appearance in evolution was inferred by the distribution of the sites in closely related species with available genome sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Strain and reporter construction</title><p>The GFP and <italic>HIS3</italic> reporters used in <italic>K. lactis</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garbett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mencía et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sorrells et al., 2015</xref>). These reporters allow full intergenic regions to be cloned upstream of GFP or <italic>HIS3</italic>, with the break between the original gene sequence and the reporter gene occurring at the start codon. A second version of the GFP reporter uses the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guarente and Ptashne, 1981</xref>) with its upstream activation sequence replaced by two restriction enzyme sites. Different versions of these vectors were made to integrate into the <italic>K. lactis</italic> genome and into the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome. Plasmids and strains are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>.</p><p>To make the full-length RPG GFP reporters, the wild-type intergenic regions were obtained by PCR with ExTaq (Takara) from genomic DNA, flanked by directional restriction enzyme sites for SacI and AgeI. These were cloned using a 2:1 ratio into pTS16 digested with the same restriction enzyme sites, and ligated using Fastlink ligase (Epicentre) to make pTS170 and pTS174.</p><p>To scramble Mcm1 and Rap1 binding sites, these sites were put into a text scrambler, then the resulting sequences were queried in ScerTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Spivak and Stormo, 2012</xref>) to see if they contained matches to any other known transcription factor binding site motifs. If not, they were used for further experiments.</p><p>To make pTS171, pTS175, and pTS243-246 DNA sequences were synthesized containing scrambled Mcm1, Rap1 sites, or both. The insert for pTS171 and pTS243-244 were cloned into pTS170 using the restriction enzymes SacI and Bsu36i. The insert for pTS175 and pTS245-246 was cloned into pTS174 using SacI and EcoRV.</p><p>The vectors pTS176-179 contain the <italic>K. lactis RPS23</italic> Rap1-Mcm1 operator upstream of the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter. These vectors were made by annealing oligos and ligating them in a 50:1 ratio into pTS26 digested with NotI and XhoI. The equivalent vectors for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are pTS181-184 and were made by cloning into pTS180 with NotI and XhoI. The constructs testing the spacing between Rap1 and Mcm1 sites (pTS189-203 and pTS209-224) were cloned using the same approach. For pTS189-203 the intervening sequence between the sites was partially duplicated for some constructs to increase the spacing. For pTS209-224 the endogenous spacing was 80 bp so the entire series was made with deletions starting immediately downstream from the Rap1 site.</p><p>The reporters testing how weak Mcm1 sites cooperate with Rap1 were cloned by first adding a BamHI site along with a palindromic Mcm1 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acton et al., 1997</xref>) into the reporter containing the <italic>K. lactis RPS23</italic> Rap1-Mcm1 operator to make pTS247 and pTS248 (with a scrambled Rap1 site). Then variants of the palindromic site containing point mutations were cloned into these two vectors using BamHI and XhoI. For each variant, two point mutations were made to preserve the palindromic nature of the Mcm1 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acton et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>These reporters were digested with KasI and HindIII and integrated into the <italic>K. lactis</italic> genome by transformation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kooistra et al., 2004</xref>) and into the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome using a standard lithium-acetate transformation. Yeast were grown on non-selective media for 24 hr then replica plated onto plates containing at least 100 μg/mL Hygromycin B. For the spacing and weak Mcm1 reporter series, the reporters are enumerated in the plasmid list but not the strain list. This is because they were transformed into <italic>K. lactis</italic>, tested, then discarded due to their large numbers. For each reporter, four independent isolates were measured, but isolates where the full reporter had not integrated were discarded, resulting in 3 or four replicates per construct.</p><p>The <italic>HIS3</italic> reporters were generated by performing PCR on the equivalent GFP reporters to generate wild-type, Rap1<sup>AS</sup>, and scrambled versions of the <italic>RPS23</italic> fragment containing Rap1 and Mcm1 binding sites with NcoI and SacII restriction sites on the ends. These fragments were cloned in a 3:1 ratio into similarly digested <italic>UAS<sub>Rap1WT</sub>-HIS3</italic> reporter plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garbett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mencía et al., 2002</xref>). These reporters were digested with SpeI and SalI and integrated into the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome via lithium-acetate transformation.

The next day, cells were diluted into synthetic complete media to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.025 – 0.05 and grown for 3 hr. Cells were measured by flow cytometry on a BD LSR II between 3 hr and 4 hr after dilution. A total of 10,000 cells per strain were recorded. Cells were gated to exclude debris, and the mean fluorescence for each strain was used for comparing among different strains. For each reporter, three to four independent isolates were checked, as we were interested in large differences and standard deviations within samples were small. In the case that one of the isolates anomalously showed expression equivalent to background, while the other isolates showed similar but detectable fluorescence, the anomalous isolate was excluded from analysis. Experiments were performed a minimum of two times on different days. Strains were not blinded for data collection or analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title><italic>HIS3</italic> reporter assays</title><p><italic>HIS3</italic> reporter expression in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was scored by growth assays performed on three independent biological replicates. In these assays, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were grown overnight to saturation and serially diluted 1:4 in sterile water in 96-well plates. These dilution series were spotted using a pinning tool (Sigma) onto Synthetic Complete (SC) media (0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% (w/v) dextrose, 0.2% (w/v) amino acid dropout mixture) either with His (+His, non-selective media) or without His and with 3-aminotriazole (-His + 3 AT, selective media). Plate images were acquired using the ChemiDoc MP Imager (Bio-Rad) and processed using ImageLab software (Bio-Rad) after 2 days of growth at 30˚C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Interspecies hybrids</title><p>To construct the interspecies hybrids for allelic expression measurements, multiple isolates of different species were mated together. Strains with complementary markers were grown on YEPD plates for 2 days, then mixed together in patches on 5% malt extract plates for 2 – 4 days. These patches were then observed under the microscope to check for zygotes and streaked out onto plates that select for mating products. Hybrids were tested by PCR for products that were species, and mating-type specific. <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. dobzhanskii</italic> matings were attempted, but were unsuccessful, perhaps because the <italic>Kl. dobzhanskii</italic> isolate used was an <bold>a</bold>/α strain. <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>L. kluyveri</italic> zygotes were observed when the two species were mixed with <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> alpha-factor, but no mating products were obtained. One cross of <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> and <italic>Kl. aestuarii</italic> produced zygotes and mating products, but the <italic>Kl. aestuarii</italic> isolate turned out to be an isolate of <italic>Kl. wickerhamii</italic> instead (discovered upon genome-sequencing). In all, three <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. wickerhamii</italic> matings, and one <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic> mating—each with three isolates—were obtained and carried forward for analysis. <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. wickerhamii</italic> hybrids are yTS347 and yTS349 (two matings between yLB13a and yLB122), and yTS353 (a mating between yLB72 and yLB66c). The <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic> mating was yTS352 (a mating between yLB72 and CB63). Sample sizes were determined by the number of samples in our sequencing kit and the number of isolates we recovered from matings.</p><p>Both mRNA and genomic DNA were sequenced from the hybrids. Genomic DNA of one isolate of each of the <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. wickerhamii</italic> hybrids (yTS347, yTS349 and yTS353) was sequenced, along with all three isolates of the <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic> hybrid, and one isolate of each of the parental strains. Cells were grown in 5 mL cultures overnight in YEPD. Genomic DNA was prepared using a standard ‘smash and grab’ protocol, where cells are lysed with phenol/choloroform/isoamyl alcohol and glass beads. DNA was precipitated twice and treated with RNase A, then sheared on a Diagenode Bioruptor for 2 × 10 min (30 s on 1 min off) on medium intensity. Genomic DNA was prepared for sequencing using the NEBNext Ultra DNA Prep Kit for Illumina E7370 (New England BioLabs).</p><p>All three isolates of each of the four hybrids were prepared for mRNA sequencing. Cells were grown overnight, then diluted back into YEPD to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2 and grown for 4 – 8 hr until they reached OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.7 – 1.0. The growth rate of the <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> ×<italic>Kl. wickerhamii</italic> hybrids was slower and more variable between isolates. At this point, cells were pelleted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. mRNA was extracted using the RiboPure kit AM1926 (Applied Biosystems). Polyadenylated RNAs were selected using two rounds of the Oligotex mRNA Kit 70022 (Qiagen). The samples were then concentrated using the RNA Clean and Concentrator-5 (Zymo Research).</p><p>Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina E7420 (New England BioLabs). mRNA and library quality were assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). Sequencing was performed at the University of California, San Francisco Center for Advanced Technology on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Allelic expression analysis</title><p>Raw sequencing data was checked for quality control using FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). Next, each of the genomic DNA isolates was aligned separately to each of four genomes: <italic>Kl. lactis</italic>, <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic>, <italic>Kl. wickerhamii</italic>, and <italic>Kl. aestuarii</italic>. In each case, reads uniquely mapped to the expected genome(s) and few reads mapped to other genomes. The strain yTS349 was previously thought to be a <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> ×<italic>Kl. aestuarii</italic> hybrid, but sequencing revealed it was in fact a <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> ×<italic>Kl. wickerhamii</italic> hybrid, and was treated as such for the analyses.</p><p>The genomes for <italic>Kl. lactis</italic>, <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic>, and <italic>Kl. wickerhamii</italic> were annotated using the yeast genome annotation pipeline from YGOB to standardize the gene annotation and ortholog assignment. <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> is already included in YGOB. These files were converted to gff format using convert_YGAP_GFF.py and genes were extracted using pull_genes.py. Next, hybrid genomes were created in silico by concatenating fasta sequences of the genes of each species. mRNA and gDNA reads were aligned to the hybrid genomes on a computer cluster using the script aln_reads.py, which calls Bowtie 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). Default parameters were used, which allow mismatches in Bowtie 2. However, reads that mapped equally well to multiple locations in the genome were removed after alignment using discard_multimapping.py. Because ribosomal proteins are highly conserved, they contain stretches of more than 50 bp that are identical between the orthologs belonging to each species in the hybrid. Thus, this filtering step is necessary to assure reads map uniquely to the ortholog from one species or the other.</p><p>To quantify differential allelic expression, the reads aligning to each gene were counted using ASE_server.py. mRNA counts of the three <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic> replicates and seven of the nine <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. wickerhamii</italic> hybrids that were sequenced were highly similar. The two other isolates showed that one of the genomes in the hybrid was present at a lower level than the other suggesting it had been lost from some of the cells (although each of the two isolates lost a different parental genome). The seven reproducible isolates were then treated as replicates for the rest of the analysis. Genome sequencing also revealed that there were two copies of the <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic> genome in each of the <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic> hybrids, suggesting that our parental <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic> strain was a diploid. The mRNA read counts for each gene in each replicate were then normalized to the total reads in the experiment. Second, they were divided by the gDNA read counts from each gene, thus controlling for the effect of two <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic> genomes in the <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic> hybrids. (The gDNA read counts per gene were averaged across replicates for each hybrid, so all the replicates were divided by the same gDNA count). Finally, the <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> ortholog read count was divided by either the <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic> or the <italic>Kl. wickerhamii</italic> ortholog to get a differential allelic expression value for each ortholog pair in each replicate.</p><p>To calculate significance of differential allelic expression, a two-sided one-sample t-test was used on the log2(differential allelic expression), across replicates (three replicates in the case of the <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. marxianus</italic> hybrid and seven in the case of the <italic>Kl. lactis</italic> × <italic>Kl. wickerhamii</italic> hybrid). The significance of each gene was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false-discovery rate at 0.05. To test for concerted differential allelic expression in the ribosomal proteins, as well as across all gene ontology (GO) terms, the geometric mean of each group of genes was calculated, then tested by the hypergeometric test to see if they were enriched for genes at least 1.1-fold up or down in <italic>Kl. lactis</italic>. Altering this fold cutoff had little effect on the results. These tests were carried out using the ASE_local.py script.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>His<sub>6</sub>-Rap1 (<italic>S. cerevisaie</italic>) used in main text gel shift experiments was expressed using a previously generated pET28a-Rap1 expression vector in Rosetta II DE3 <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson and Weil, 2017</xref>).

Cells were lysed via glass bead lysis. Soluble cell extract was obtained via centrifugation and mixed with 2 mL DE-52 resin pre-equilibrated with Mcm1 Lysis Buffer for 5 min at 4˚C. Flowthrough from the DE-52 purification was collected and diluted with 20 mM HEPES-KOH, 10% v/v glycerol, and protease inhibitors to reduce the concentration of potassium acetate and Nonidet P-40 to 200 mM and 0.2% v/v, respectively. Binding to 600 μl amylose resin was performed in batch for 2 hr at 4˚C. Amylose resin-bound proteins were transferred to a disposable column, washed with 10 column volumes of Mcm1 Wash Buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH, 200 mM potassium acetate, 10% v/v glycerol, and protease inhibitors) and eluted with 10 column buffers of Mcm1 Wash Buffer containing 10 mM maltose.

Your article has been reviewed by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Brian P.H. Metzger (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers were overwhelmingly positive and believe that this manuscript is an important and rigorous contribution that presents a novel mechanism by which transcriptional regulatory networks can evolve.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The consensus is that no additional experiments or analyses are required. Nonetheless, the authors should revise the manuscript in the following ways:</p><p>1) Provide a more specific model(s) about how new Mcm1 binding sites could have been selected for and/or maintained, even if this model(s) should be tested in more detail by future studies.</p><p>2) Clearly document the sources of all genome sequences analyzed and, for unpublished data, verify that the present analyses meet any terms of use the authors may have agreed to.</p><p>3) Provide sufficient detail about the phylogenetic analyses that the results can be replicated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Several cases have been observed where large regulatory networks have acquired binding sites for the same transcription factor (TF) across dozens of genes during evolution. In previous cases, these seemingly improbable events have been shown to occur through facilitation by transposable elements or protein-protein interactions among TFs. The present work provides an attractive new model where the interactions of two TFs with a third protein (TFIID) seem to have facilitated the acquisition of binding sites.</p><p>In general, the model was well articulated, and the experiments performed were insightful and rigorous. The diverse methods included hybridization, gene expression analyses, protein biochemistry, genetic reporter tests of cooperativity, and a particularly insightful test of the importance of the second TF in allowing weak binding sites from the first TF to have a stronger effect (Figure 6A).</p><p>Nonetheless several major issues should be addressed:</p><p>The phylogenetic and ancestral state reconstruction analyses are not sufficiently documented, do not appear to be up to modern standards, and do not discuss conflicts with published phylogenomic analyses that are likely more rigorous.</p><p>Subsection “Gains of functional Mcm1 cis-regulatory sites”, &quot;data not shown&quot; does not meet <italic>eLife</italic> reporting standards for any type of data or analyses.</p><p>The trend of gene expression for <italic>K. lactis</italic> versus the other species is in the opposite direction from what one might have expected under a simple model where binding sites were adaptively added to increase expression.

The paper hypothesizes and tests a novel mechanism that the shared binding of two TFs with mediators of transcription can result in a bias of mutations towards functional effects on expression. Overall the paper is excellent, using multiple lines of evidence from genomics through functional tests to suggest that this mechanism may be important not only for the specific example studied but also more generally. I have only a few concerns that I believe are easily addressed.</p><p>1) A false dichotomy is set up in subsection “Gains of functional Mcm1 cis-regulatory sites”. It may be that Mcm1 doesn't change the overall expression, but instead changes regulation. This is addressed slightly in the next session, but the given impression is too clean given the lack of data that directly addresses this question.</p><p>2) Regardless of this concern, I like the experimental design. However, the species aren't that different in Mcm1 binding gains, i.e. both are in the full gain group. An alternative explanation for the results is that the organisms chosen simply aren't that different in their RPG regulation compared to what would happen upon the initial gain of Mcm1 binding sites. I believe that this needs to be acknowledged.</p><p>3) Compensation seems to imply an order, i.e. that the Mcm1 gain was after the loss of some other TF binding site. It seems more likely it was the other way around, that an Mcm1 gain permitted the loss of other binding sites. However, the extent to which the addition of Mcm1 binding site alone directly influenced expression isn't tested (i.e. adding a Mcm1 binding site to a promoter from a species without the Mcm1 gain). If the simple addition of Mcm1 alters expression, it becomes unclear how the authors think evolution proceeded given the strong purifying selection on RPG expression.</p><p>4) The figures don't show that Rap1<sup>AS7Ala</sup> doesn't act cooperatively as stated.</p><p>5) The experiments only address the mediator binding hypothesis from the Rap1 perspective, not Mcm1 (which is the thing that is new), nor TFIID. While these experiments aren't necessary, I think this omission needs to be acknowledged.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a convincing and enjoyable manuscript that presents evidence that multiple independent co-options of the transcription factor Mcm1 to regulate ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) occurred in different yeast clades (about 7-9 independent occurrences), building on the authors' previous work in Tuch et al. (2008a). The proposed mechanism is a pre-existing ability of Mcm1 to cooperate with Rap1, through their separate interactions with TFIID. The authors' evolutionary model is convincing and provides an explanation for several otherwise puzzling aspects such as the recurrence of particular spacings between Mcm1 and Rap1 sites. As always with Johnson lab papers, this one is very well written, the figures are excellent, and the experiments are rigorous. The work is of broad significance, because it provides a general rationale for how a cis-regulatory motif can abruptly emerge in a large set of genes such as the RPGs.</p><p>The one question that the manuscript did not seem to answer adequately is what is the selective pressure to maintain Mcm1 sites in RPG genes after they arise by chance (model in Figure 7)? Since these sites do not contribute to increased transcription of RPGs, I cannot see what prevents them from decaying again. The text mentions this issue: the Discussion section says that new Mcm1 sites at RPGs &quot;would fall under selection as other cis-regulatory sites deteriorated by mutation&quot; (citing Figure 7, though Figure 7 doesn't illustrate this situation) but leaves me wondering what TFs bind to these other sites, or if there is evidence to support this idea. In principle, if the idea is correct, the deterioration of the other sites should be evident in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. For example, Sfp1 sites seem to disappear in the <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> clade around the same time as Mcm1 sites appear, so is Sfp1 a candidate?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37563.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers were overwhelmingly positive and believe that this manuscript is an important and rigorous contribution that presents a novel mechanism by which transcriptional regulatory networks can evolve.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The consensus is that no additional experiments or analyses are required. Nonetheless, the authors should revise the manuscript in the following ways:</p><p>1) Provide a more specific model(s) about how new Mcm1 binding sites could have been selected for and/or maintained, even if this model(s) should be tested in more detail by future studies.</p></disp-quote><p>A model for how Mcm1 binding sites could be selected for requires two things: that the Mcm1 site is functional and that there is an evolutionary force that tends to preserve the site. We have focused primarily on a mechanism (intrinsic cooperativity) that causes weak Mcm1 sites to be functional in RPGs as they arise by mutation.</p><p>We can think of two plausible mechanisms explaining the preservation of Mcm1 sites once they arise. One mechanism would be direct selection for the increase of expression of the RPG, or the RPGs as a whole. This is plausible because the selection that acts on RPG expression as a whole changes significantly between species (as evidenced by our interspecies hybrid experiment as well as others). The selection acting on individual RPGs also probably changes on short timescales, potentially resulting on selection for a subset RPGs to have increased expression levels. However, we have no direct evidence for selection for increased expression of RPGs leading to the gain of Mcm1 sites.</p><p>We have direct evidence for a second model: a compensatory model in which the Mcm1 sites counteract losses of other regulatory elements. This is supported by the hybrid experiment results and cis-regulatory site analysis. The compensatory model is not incompatible with the first model (for example if selection for increased expression of RPGs alternated with relaxed selection or selection to reduce expression of RPGs). However, it could also be effected by neutral forces: if Mcm1 sites are allowed to be weak, they could present a smaller “mutational target” than the strong sites for another transcription regulator, resulting over time in the increase in Mcm1 sites at the expense of the other regulator due to mutational processes.</p><p>Compensatory changes could plausibly occur in multiple different orders on the scale of individual mutations, cis-regulatory sites, and genes. For example, mutations affecting the cis-regulatory sites could be fixed simultaneously (on the same haplotype) or alternate between strengthening the Mcm1 sites and weakening a second site. Alternatively, the Mcm1 site could become fixed some period of time before the loss of a second site (or vice-versa). We suspect that the precise order may differ for each gene as the Mcm1 sites were gained over millions of years.</p><p>We have done our best to indicate these scenarios in the text of the manuscript while making it clear what we have direct evidence for. We have modified Figure 7 to indicate the types of selection that could maintain Mcm1 sites, but because there are multiple plausible scenarios we have not directly illustrated them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clearly document the sources of all genome sequences analyzed and, for unpublished data, verify that the present analyses meet any terms of use the authors may have agreed to.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Supplementary file 3 which includes the sources and versions of the genome assemblies and annotations used. The principle investigators of all of the unpublished genomes used in this study were contacted and shown an example analysis (or the final analysis) and consented to the use of the genomic data for the purpose of this publication. This consent was obtained prior to the preprint and initial submission of the manuscript. In all, 24 genomes of interest were excluded from the analysis because investigators did not consent to their use. Consent from a subset of the investigators was confirmed during revision and all gave the same response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide sufficient detail about the phylogenetic analyses that the results can be replicated.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional detail was added to the methods to facilitate replication of the phylogenetic analyses. Specifically, we have added details about the tree construction, scoring of intergenic regions for cis-regulatory sites, and the newly added stochastic character mapping analysis to more rigorously estimate gains and losses. In addition to the scripts included in the initial submission, we have included Supplementary file 3 with the genome versions and Supplementary file 4 with the position weight matrices used for identifying the cis-regulatory sequences. We have also included a list of the ribosomal protein genes in each species and the presence of Mcm1 sites in Supplementary file 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>The phylogenetic and ancestral state reconstruction analyses are not sufficiently documented, do not appear to be up to modern standards, and do not discuss conflicts with published phylogenomic analyses that are likely more rigorous.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a reference and additional details in the methods on how the phylogenetic tree was created. Because we focus on the mechanism of parallel evolution and transcription activation, a detailed discussion of the tree topology is beyond the scope of the present study. Several differences in topology when compared to published studies may be ascribed to the use of unpublished genomes, but discussion of this is reserved for the principal investigators of these genome sequencing projects.</p><p>In response to this comment we have also implemented a new estimation of gains and losses to better quantify the uncertainty in this analysis. The model for evolution of binding sites is one of the most challenging questions we faced. In the end, rather than choosing a model specific to cis-regulatory sites whose assumptions were violated by the data we had, we chose a simple model of character evolution. (To be specific, the only sequence-independent model of binding site evolution we are aware of is CRETO from Otto et al. (2009) and to give an accurate estimate of evolutionary rates, it requires that the half-life of binding sites is on the order of the length of the tree from root to tip, whereas in our data Mcm1 site turnover is happening many times from root to tip.) Because of the large evolutionary distance, we decided to categorize species into presence or absence of Mcm1 sites and treat this as a discrete character under two different models. We strongly encourage the development of better computational models for cis-regulatory site evolution by experts in that area.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Gains of functional Mcm1 cis-regulatory sites”, &quot;data not shown&quot; does not meet eLife reporting standards for any type of data or analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have further explained these results in the text of the manuscript and removed the assertion about phylogenetic branches because we did not rerun the analysis under multiple different tree topologies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The trend of gene expression for K. lactis versus the other species is in the opposite direction from what one might have expected under a simple model where binding sites were adaptively added to increase expression.

However, as suggested by all reviewers, we provide additional details about how a compensatory model may work, the details of which would need to be tested in future studies. Briefly, the scale of evolution between the interspecies hybrid may be much longer than selection for increased expression of the genes, or the model could involve neutral mutational processes alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were promoters analyzed separately that had TATA boxes versus those that were TATA-less? How would this impact conclusions?</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed whether Rap1 or Mcm1 sites showed a relationship with the strength or location of TBP/Spt15 binding sites, but no clear pattern was observed. In general, yeast ribosomal protein genes lack strong TATA boxes which may explain their dependence on transcription regulators such as Rap1 and Mcm1 that can directly interact with TFIID.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors clarify that JGI is specifically allowing their unpublished genomes to be analyzed for this purpose?

This is a scale in which a significant fraction of RPGs can gain Mcm1 binding sites, suggesting that the gains aren’t completed by this time.
