proteins within cilia. Here we present the 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> IFT-B protein IFT80, which reveals the architecture of two N-terminal β-propellers followed by an α-helical extension. The N-terminal β-propeller tethers IFT80 to the IFT-B complex via IFT38 whereas the second β-propeller and the C-terminal α-helical extension result in IFT80 homo-dimerization. Using CRISPR/Cas to create biallelic <italic>Ift80</italic> frameshift mutations in IMCD3 mouse cells, we demonstrate that IFT80 is absolutely required for ciliogenesis. Structural mapping and rescue experiments reveal that human disease-causing missense mutations do not cluster within IFT80 and form functional IFT particles. Unlike missense mutant forms of IFT80, deletion of the C-terminal dimerization domain prevented rescue of ciliogenesis. Taken together our results may provide a first insight into higher order IFT complex formation likely required for IFT train formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</kwd><kwd>Cilium</kwd><kwd>Intraflagelllar transport</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd><kwd>ciliopathies</kwd><kwd>IFT80</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF15OC00114164</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lorentzen</surname><given-names>Esben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L009978/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jenkins</surname><given-names>Dagan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STU100044631</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jenkins</surname><given-names>Dagan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CRISPR/Cas knockout of intraflagellar transport protein 80 shows that this subunit is absolutely required for ciliogenesis, and biophysical studies reveal that this protein may dimerize the intraflagellar transport complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cilia and flagella are eukaryotic cellular organelles important for motility, sensory reception, and developmental signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>), and defects in ciliary structure and/or function result in human pathologies collectively known as ‘ciliopathies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fliegauf et al., 2007</xref>). Cilia are found on most cells in mammals, as well as on unicellular organisms such as <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<italic>Cr</italic>) and <italic>Trypanosoma brucei (Tb)</italic> that serve as model organisms for ciliary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vincensini et al., 2011</xref>). With only very few exceptions, cilia are built by intraflagellar transport (IFT), the bi-directional movement of proteinaceous material sandwiched between the microtubule (MT)-based axoneme and the ciliary membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozminski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>). The process of IFT in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> requires the 22 subunit IFT particle that associates with the hetero-trimeric kinesin 2 or cytoplasmic dynein 2 motors for anterograde (ciliary base to tip) or retrograde (ciliary tip to base) transport of cargo proteins, respectively. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensory cilia the situation is more complex, as a homo-dimeric kinesin 2 (OSM-3) cooperates with heterotrimeric kinesin 2 to drive anterograde IFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Snow et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The IFT particle consists of a six subunit IFT-A and a 16 subunit IFT-B complex, with the latter further divided into a 10 subunit IFT-B1 and a 6-subunit IFT-B2 sub-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>). Whereas IFT-A and IFT-B complexes dissociate even at low salt concentration when isolated from <italic>Cr</italic> flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cole et al., 1998</xref>), IFT-B1 and IFT-B2 sub-complexes associate strongly to form a stable IFT-B complex that can be reconstituted from recombinantly produced subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>). Electron tomographic reconstructions of IFT material in situ reveal that IFT particles organize into long strings known as IFT trains in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pigino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vannuccini et al., 2016</xref>). IFT trains have also been observed in <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absalon et al., 2008</xref>) and in some cases in human primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rogowski et al., 2013</xref>). IFT proteins are sequentially recruited at the basal body to form IFT trains that are loaded with tubulin cargo shortly before departure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wingfield et al., 2017</xref>). An elegant study coupling total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and electron microscopy recently revealed that anterograde and retrograde IFT trains travel on different tubules of the axonemal MT-doublets in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella, providing an explanation for the absence of head-to-head collisions of IFT trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stepanek and Pigino, 2016</xref>). Two morphologically different types of short (~200 nm in length, 16 nm repeat) arrays with IFT particle volumes of ~5000 nm<sup>3</sup> correspond to the moving anterograde and retrograde trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pigino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vannuccini et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, a longer (~650 nm in length, 40 nm repeat) IFT train type with two IFT particles related by 2-fold symmetry and a volume of ~10000 nm<sup>3</sup> was identified as a ‘standing’ train not moving in either direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pigino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stepanek and Pigino, 2016</xref>). It is currently not known how IFT particles associate to form either of these different types of IFT trains.</p><p>Since the discovery of the IFT complex in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> two decades ago, significant progress has been made in understanding its composition from studies of material obtained directly from <italic>Cr</italic> flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Piperno and Mead, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lucker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behal and Cole, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richey and Qin, 2012</xref>), as well as from work using recombinantly expressed proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lucker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taschner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taschner et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, an increasing number of crystal structures provide us with a detailed view of several parts of this sophisticated transport machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taschner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhogaraju et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhogaraju et al., 2013</xref>). However, none of these studies have so far provided any clues about how IFT complexes form larger assemblies, which presumably relies on the ability of one or several IFT proteins to oligomerize.</p><p>The hexameric IFT-B2 complex was recently identified in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boldt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katoh et al., 2016</xref>). Missense mutations in <italic>IFT80</italic>, which encodes an IFT-B2 subunit, have been identified in individuals with the skeletal ciliopathies Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) as well as Verma-Naumoff syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baujat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beales et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavalcanti et al., 2011</xref>), but it is still unclear how these alterations affect protein function. Previous gene knockdown studies of <italic>Ift80</italic>, which have used RNA interference in mammalian cell culture or conditional gene-targeting in mice, have reported a quantitative reduction, but incomplete loss, of axonemal acetylated tubulin of primary and motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beales et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yuan and Yang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). A constitutional hypomorphic <italic>Ift80</italic> gene-trap mouse model faithfully recapitulated features of JATD without affecting cilia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rix et al., 2011</xref>). It is therefore unclear whether IFT80 is absolutely required for IFT mediated recruitment and transport of ciliary cargo. It has also been speculated that <italic>IFT80</italic> missense mutations may be hypomorphic although this remains to be proven.</p><p>Here, we present the crystal structure of CrIFT80 to show an unusual N-terminal double β-propeller followed by α-solenoid structure. Despite a shared domain organization with vesicle coatomer subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jékely and Arendt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Dam et al., 2013</xref>), the 3D organization of IFT80 domains is remarkably unique and allows for homo-dimerization of the protein. We show that the N-terminal β-propeller tethers IFT80 to the IFT complex via direct binding to the calponin-homology (CH) domain of IFT38 (also known as CLUAP1, FAP22, DYF-3, Qilin or PIFTA1) whereas the C-terminal domain is required for IFT80 dimerization. Using gene-editing to knockout <italic>Ift80</italic> in IMCD3 mouse cells, we demonstrate that IFT80 is absolutely required for initiation of the ciliary axoneme. Using rescue experiments, we show that missense mutations in <italic>IFT80</italic> retain significant biochemical function, and that truncations where dimerization is abolished are unable to rescue cilium formation. This suggests that higher order IFT complex formation via IFT80 is functionally important for ciliogenesis, and that disease-causing missense mutations operate via a distinct mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Purification of IFT80 constructs</title><p>IFT80 is predicted to contain two N-terminal WD-40 β-propellers followed by α-solenoid structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taschner et al., 2012</xref>). This domain architecture is similar to vesicle coatomer proteins such as the coatomer subunits α and β’ of the COPI coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Goldberg, 2010</xref>), suggesting that IFT80 evolved from a proto-coatomer subunit in an ancestral cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jékely and Arendt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Dam et al., 2013</xref>). Given the increased endo- and exocytosis taking place at membrane invaginations known as the ciliary pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benmerah, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>), located at the base of the cilium where IFT trains enter and exit cilia, it is not inconceivable that IFT proteins such as IFT80 may be directly involved in these processes. Indeed, IFT proteins have been visualized on vesicles destined for the cilium in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wood and Rosenbaum, 2014</xref>) and membrane shedding from cilia has also been observed for a number of organisms and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wood and Rosenbaum, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nager et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). However, due to the absence of a high-resolution IFT80 structure it has so far been unclear if this similarity in predicted domain composition translates into similar 3D-architectures and functions of these proteins. We set out to shed light on this issue by screening several CrIFT80 constructs for crystallization. In addition to full-length (fl, residues 1–765) IFT80 of <italic>Cr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we purified constructs containing both β-propellers (BP1-BP2, residues 1–582), as well as only the most N-terminal β-propeller (BP1, residues 1–299) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). None of the constructs could be expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> in a soluble form and were thus produced in insect cells. The second β-propeller (BP2, residues 300–586) was insoluble even when recombinantly expressed in insect cells and could thus not be purified. In addition to these constructs designed based on domain predictions, we used limited proteolysis of fl IFT80 to determine additional stable fragments experimentally. This analysis resulted in the production of several fragments with molecular weights of ~65 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and further purification by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the IFT80 fragment generated by the protease GluC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) led to the identification of residues 1–654 by mass spectrometry (data not shown), consistent with proteolytic cleavage after residue E654. This fragment of IFT80 contains the two β-propellers followed by four of the eleven predicted C-terminal α-helices. Interestingly, expression of this truncated construct in insect cells did not yield soluble protein (data not shown), and it could only be obtained by proteolysis of full-length IFT80. The constructs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> facilitated a comprehensive analysis of the structure and function of IFT80.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33067.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Purification of CrIFT80 constructs.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) SEC profiles (left) and corresponding Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE pictures of CrIFT80 fragments designed based on domain prediction.

When crystals were later obtained for fl IFT80 diffracting to 1.8 Å resolution, this partial model was used in molecular replacement to finalize the IFT80 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In the crystal structure, IFT80 adopts the fold of two consecutive seven bladed β-propellers followed by an alpha-solenoid extension of 4 α-helices. These helices organize into two tetratricopeptide (TPR)-like repeats, and are held in position via interactions with an extension of blade 6 of BP2. This extension contains an insertion of two α-helices, which are themselves held in place by largely hydrophobic contacts with BP2 blade 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although the fl IFT80 protein was crystallized (verified by mass spectrometry), the C-terminal 126 residues have no visible electron density and are presumably disordered in the crystal. Our finding that this region is efficiently removed by incubation with all four proteases tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) supports this assumption. The missing residues are predicted to adopt the structure of seven α-helices and are connected to the four visible helices by a well-conserved 15 amino acid long linker region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the IFT80 structure, BP1 and BP2 interact intimately via numerous loop regions connecting the blades. BP1 adopts the fold of a canonical seven bladed β-propeller where the N-terminal residues contribute the first β-strand to blade 7, effectively closing the β-propeller by a zipper-like mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). BP1 of IFT80 is thus similar to a number of previously determined structures of β-propellers, and displays particularly high structural similarity to the N-terminal β-propellers of β‘-COP, β-COP and α-COP, which are coatomer subunits important in the formation of COP-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Goldberg, 2010</xref>). Although BP1 of IFT80 and β‘-COP only share ~15% sequence identity, the domains superimpose well with a root-mean-square-deviation (rmsd) of 2.2 Å over ~300 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This high degree of structural similarity is consistent with the notion that IFT80 evolved from a coatomer-like progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jékely and Arendt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Dam et al., 2013</xref>). The high degree of structural similarity between IFT80 and coatomer subunits is, however, limited to BP1. BP2 of IFT80 is non-canonical and differs in two important aspects from BP2 of β‘-COP. Firstly, in the IFT80 structure, the most C-terminal β-strand of BP1 connects to BP2 as one long continuous β-strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is quite different from β‘-COP where BP1 and BP2 are connected via a loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This structural divergence is important as it positions BP2 differently relative to BP1 in the two structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Secondly, the extended loop that connects β-strands 3 and 4 of blade 1, and interacts with the last strand in blade seven to effectively close BP2 in β‘-COP, is missing in IFT80 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–2E</xref>). This structural difference results in an unusual open conformation of BP2 of IFT80 where blades 1 and 7 do not interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Because of the very different positions of BP2 in IFT80 and β‘-COP, the C-terminal α-helical extensions are found on opposite sides in the structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, despite the similar domain composition of IFT80 and coatomer subunits, the relative 3D orientation of domains is remarkably different. Given the structural divergence, IFT80 is unlikely to function directly in the coating of vesicles destined for the cilium.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33067.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of the IFT80 protein.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural overview showing the overall domain organization of CrIFT80.

We previously showed that IFT80 interacts with the calponin-homology (CH) domain (residues 1–126) of IFT38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>), but the domain of IFT80 responsible is not known. Plotting the degree of amino acid conservation onto the IFT80 structure presented here revealed a number of conserved surface patches that may serve as interfaces for protein-protein interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Most prominent is the conservation of the N-terminal surface of BP1, which harbours several invariant residues. To elucidate which domain of IFT80 is responsible for the interaction with IFT38 we used GST-tagged IFT38 CH-domain to pull-down fl, BP1-BP2 or BP1 of IFT80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The result of this experiment shows that IFT80 BP1 is sufficient for complex formation with the IFT38 CH-domain. Indeed, a complex of IFT80(BP1) and the IFT38 CH-domain could be reconstituted and purified by SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) of the CH-domain of IFT38 and the BP1-BP2 construct of IFT80 (this construct was chosen as it displayed the best behaviour in ITC assays) revealed that IFT80-IFT38 is a stoichiometric complex with a dissociation constant (Kd) of ~225 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We previously reported that IFT80 also interacts with IFT54/20 within the IFT-B2 sub-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that this interaction requires the C-terminal α-helical extension of IFT80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The IFT80-IFT54/20 interaction does not require the N-terminal tubulin-binding CH-domain of IFT54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and only very weak binding was observed between IFT80<sub>1-654</sub> and IFT54ΔCH/20 demonstrating that the association depends on the 111 most C-terminal residues of IFT80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Given that the conserved N-terminal β-propeller (BP1) of IFT80 interacts with IFT38, such a triskelion arrangement is unlikely within the context of the IFT complex. Inspection of the crystal packing of the IFT80 structure presented here revealed an IFT80 homo-dimer organized around a crystallographic 2-fold axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The unusual position of the C-terminal BP2 and α-helical domains outlined above and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> allows IFT80 to homo-dimerize via an extended interaction interface contributed by BP2 and the α-helical C-terminal domain. Two separate interaction interfaces contribute to IFT80 dimerization. The first is a 6-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet where blade 7 of each BP2 domain contributes three β-strands (solid rounded rectangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, and zoom-in in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Such an arrangement is possible in IFT80 due to the lack of the loop connecting blades 1 and 7 in related BP2s such as the one in β’COP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Two residues (L575 and S577) in β-strand 54 make backbone interactions with their symmetry mates (partially mediated by water molecules) to keep the resulting β-sheet aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The second interface (present in two copies in the dimer due to symmetry) is formed by interactions of the first TPR-like repeat (alpha helices α4−α5) in the α-solenoid domain with blade 1 of BP2 (dashed rounded rectangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, and zoom-in in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Only one of the contacts here is hydrophobic in nature (F605 is located in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the aliphatic parts of the side chains of R316 and E329), all other interactions are hydrophilic and partially water-mediated, and also involve several backbone interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Two important predictions about IFT80 dimerization can be drawn from our analysis of the IFT80 dimerization interfaces described above. Firstly, the dimer should be sensitive to high salt concentrations in the buffer due to the largely hydrophilic nature of inter-subunit interactions. Secondly, deletion of the α-solenoid C-terminal domain (such as in the BP1-BP2 construct) should abolish dimerization, as this destroys the larger ‘interface 2’, which is present twice within the IFT80 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In SEC experiments, IFT80 eluted as a dimer at low salt conditions (150 mM NaCl), but as a monomer at higher salt concentrations (500 mM NaCl, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To confirm the dimeric and monomeric states of full-length IFT80 depending on the salt concentration in the buffer, we collected small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data in buffers with 150 mM or 500 mM NaCl. The measurements indicated that the molecular dimensions of the IFT80 protein were larger in low salt than in high salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), again suggesting that high salt converts the IFT80 dimer into monomers. Consistent with this, the SAXS envelope obtained in low salt conditions showed a significantly better fit to the crystal structure of the IFT80 dimer (χ<sup>2</sup> of 0.947) than to that of the monomer (χ<sup>2</sup> of 4.419) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), whereas the opposite was the case for the data obtained in high salt (χ<sup>2</sup>of 1.589 for dimer, χ<sup>2</sup> of 1.187 for monomer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

The result show that IFT80(1-654) is a dimer whereas IFT80(BP1-BP2) is a monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To further characterize the IFT80 monomer-dimer equilibrium, we employed dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements in addition to SAXS, using a range of concentrations of purified IFT80 protein. Consistent with the assumption that the BP1-BP2 construct of IFT80 is monomeric, DLS measurements resulted in a constant ~3.6 nm radius of the molecule independently of protein concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, left). This value agrees with the dimension of the BP1-BP2 region obtained from the IFT80 crystal structure. In contrast, the obtained radius for the full-length protein changed with increasing protein concentration, starting just below 4 nm at the lowest concentration examined, and reaching a plateau around ~5.5 nm when the concentration was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right).

This complex is similar to a previously reconstituted 15-subunit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>), but is missing IFT172. The IFT172 protein, which was omitted from the complex, binds more weakly to the IFT-B complex than the other subunits and has a tendency to dissociate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>). Both DLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and SAXS measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) over a range of concentrations of this 14-meric IFT-B complex revealed results paralleling those of fl IFT80 alone, with a concentration-dependent increase in the radius of the complex from a starting value of ~10 nm to a plateau at a value of approximately 15 nm. Due to the lack of suitable high-resolution structures of the IFT-B complex, we can at this point not compare these dimensions to measurements from the structure. The values are, however, compatible with a concentration dependent transition from monomeric to dimeric 14-subunit IFT-B complexes. The fact that the concentration-dependent behaviour of the 14-subunit IFT-B complex is similar to isolated IFT80 suggests that IFT80 is capable of organizing dimers of IFT-B complexes consistent with the multimerization of IFT particles in to train-like structures observed in situ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozminski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pigino et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>IFT80 is absolutely required for initiation of ciliary axoneme assembly</title><p>Assembly of the ciliary axoneme involves recruitment of α/β-tubulin heterodimers to the transition zone of cilia, possibly piggybacking on cytoplasmic vesicles, and their subsequent transport to the ciliary tip by IFT trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wood and Rosenbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Craft et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kubo et al., 2016</xref>).

GFP-tagged human wild-type IFT80 rescues the ciliogenesis phenotype demonstrating that the GFP tag does not impair IFT complex formation and that the human construct is a suitable replacement for mouse Ift80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Point mutations of IFT80 dimerization interface residues did not break up the homo-dimer, presumably because of the highly extended interface containing many sequence-unspecific backbone-backbone interactions (data not shown). The IFT80<sub>1-657</sub> construct that lacks the IFT54/20 binding domain but contains the IFT80 dimerization domain provides a partial rescue with about half the amount of cells forming cilia compared to the full-length IFT80 rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–C</xref>). The reduction of cilium formation in the IFT80<sub>1-657</sub> rescue experiment is likely a result of the reduced ability of this construct to bind IFT54/20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, given that IFT80 is absolutely required for cilium formation in these cells, the partial rescue demonstrates that the IFT54/20 binding domain of IFT80 is not mandatory for initiation of ciliogenesis or IFT. In contrast, cells expressing IFT80 constructs containing only BP1 (IFT80<sub>1-300</sub>) or BP1-BP2 (IFT80<sub>1-586</sub>) are completely unable to ciliate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–C</xref>), demonstrating that the C-terminal α-helical domain of IFT80 is essential for cilium formation. Both IFT80<sub>1-300</sub> an IFT80<sub>1-586</sub> constructs contain the BP1 domain that links IFT80 to the IFT complex via IFT38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The inability of IFT80<sub>1-586</sub> to rescue ciliogenesis is thus not a direct result of IFT80 not associating with the IFT complex. As IFT80<sub>1-586</sub> fails to rescues ciliogenesis and IFT80<sub>1-657</sub> provides a partial rescue of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–C</xref>), residues 587–657, which are required for IFT80 dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), thus appear to be essential for cilium formation.

One possibility is that each fully assembled IFT-B complex contains two copies of IFT80, but only one copy of the other IFT-B proteins. However, this is unlikely for two reasons. Firstly, judging from previous reconstitutions of both a 6-subunit IFT-B2 complex as well as of a 15-subunit IFT-B (B1 and B2) complex, these assemblies appear to contain stoichiometric amounts of all subunits, including IFT80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>). Secondly, the ITC data displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> reveal a 1:1 IFT80:IFT38 complex. The second possibility is that only 1 copy of IFT80 is present per IFT-B complex, but that the entire IFT-B complex can dimerize via the IFT80 subunit. This possibility is compatible with the IFT80 dimer shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> as the most N-terminal β-propeller is available to interact with IFT38 thus allowing incorporation of an IFT80 dimer into the IFT complex. However, the exact molecular basis of IFT train formation will have to await the structural elucidation of higher order IFT complexes by X-ray crystallography, single particle EM or high-resolution EM tomographic reconstructions of isolated or reconstituted IFT trains.</p><p>The crystal structure of IFT80 presented here, together with our characterisation of distinct interaction domains, provides a framework to consider the functional effects of disease causing missense mutations. These mutations are distributed throughout the protein, occurring in distinct functional domains of the protein. All mutant forms of IFT80 contributed to IFT trains within cilia and, unlike a deletion mutant lacking the dimerization domain, rescued ciliogenesis in <italic>Ift80</italic> null-mutant cells to the same degree as wild-type protein. Taken together, these observations suggest that missense mutations do not ablate IFT-B complex interactions or homodimerization of the protein. Given the genetic threshold relationship between IFT80 dosage and ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rix et al., 2011</xref>), it is more likely that missense mutations cause partial protein instability to a degree that is consistent with recruitment of cargo to cilia and IFT. In the future, it will be necessary to test this hypothesis in missense mutant mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and purification of IFT protein constructs used in this work</title><p>Full-length CrIFT80 (residues 1–765), and shorter C-terminal truncations (BP1-BP2, residues 1–582; and BP1; residues 1–299), were amplified from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> cDNA with a forward primer containing an EcoRI restriction site, and a reverse primer containing six additional histidine codons and an XbaI restriction site.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Andrew Musacchio (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors of this study combine structural and biophysical techniques to characterise the IFT80 subunit of the Intra-flagellar Transport (IFT) B complex. Crystal structures of full-length IFT80 reveal high structural similarity between the first β-propeller and coatamer subunits. The second β-propeller assumes an unusual open conformation, which, together with an extended C-terminal α helix, forms the interface for IFT80 homo-dimerization. Using a number of biophysical methods and deletion analyses, they present data to suggest that IFT80 predominantly exists as a dimer in solution.</p><p>In order to understand how IFT80 is incorporated into the IFT-B2 complex, the authors investigate its binding to IFT38. By pull-down experiments of full length IFT80 and several truncated versions of the protein, they show that the IFT80 β-propeller 1 tethers IFT80 to the IFT complex through a high affinity interaction with IFT38.</p><p>The authors also use CRISPR/Cas to show that IFT80 is absolutely required for initiation of ciliary axoneme assembly and IFT80 homo-dimerization is required for cilium formation in mammalian cells. They conclude by suggesting that IFT80 is responsible of the dimerization of the complete complex B in the IFT train structure.</p><p>The reviewers were generally positive about the paper and felt that it is appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> as it represents an important structural advance towards the structure of the IFT particle. However there are some points that need addressing before it can be accepted.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) It is important to ascertain by immunoblotting that mutant alleles generated by CRISPR represent complete protein nulls for IFT80. Also, it is important to check the protein expression levels of the missense mutants. In the rescues of IFT80ko cells with the various GFP-IFT80 constructs, the authors need to compare the levels of each GFP fusion with respect to one another by quantitative western blotting with an anti-GFP antibody and with respect to the endogenous IFT80 using and anti-IFT80 antibody. This will confirm the 'hypomorphic' nature of the pathogenic mutations and strengthen their conclusion that these mutations likely destabilise IFT80. This type of experiment becomes particularly important when the authors want to claim that 'The reduction of cilium formation in the IFT80 1-657 rescue experiment is likely a result of the reduced ability of this construct to bind IFT54/20'.</p><p>2) The IFT80 structure is minimally leveraged when the authors are attempting to test the importance of dimerization on ciliogenesis. While reasonable, the argument that 'Point mutations of IFT80 dimerization interface residues did not break up the homo-dimer, presumably because of the highly extended interface containing many backbone-backbone interactions (data not shown)' suggests that multiple mutations need to be introduced at once. The authors should generate and test a multiply substituted variant of IFT80 defective in dimerization.</p><p>3) 'In SEC experiments, IFT80 eluted as a dimer at low salt conditions (150 mM NaCl), but as a monomer at higher salt concentrations (500 mM NaCl, Figure 5A).' A proper analysis of the elution peaks compared to size markers, void volume and excluded volume needs to be presented.</p><p>4) There needs to be stronger evidence that IFT80 dimers play a role in train assembly and not just IFT-B complex assembly. If IFT80 was responsible for the dimerization of complex B for train formation, the authors should be able to obtain such a dimer from in vitro reconstituted complex B particles (Taschner et al., 2016). The authors should have all the reagents and tools to address this point. For instance, they could perform SAXS or negative-stain EM on reconstituted complex B (15 proteins) and complex B2 (6 proteins) and check for the presence of dimers. Such an experiment would provide convincing evidence for their hypothesis. The authors should otherwise reformulate their conclusions and provide alternative interpretation for the role of IFT80 dimerization in the assembly of IFT trains.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33067.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) It is important to ascertain by immunoblotting that mutant alleles generated by CRISPR represent complete protein nulls for IFT80.

We also found that these antibodies did not work well on immunofluorescence.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33067.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>IFT80 Western blots.</title><p>Western blots performed on lysates of parental and <italic>Ift80null</italic> mIMCD-3 cells expressing human truncation mutants using various conditions and antibody concentrations could not detect mouse or human IFT80.

Firstly, we have demonstrated that the p.C288fsX and p.G289fsX mutations result in considerable levels of transcript instability (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). By contrast the frameshift mutations at residues p.T23, p.T24 and p.V20 did not lead to transcript instability – this may reflect the use of an internal translation initiation codon. As shown in Figures 3B and 9A, all frameshift mutations will lack the IFT80 dimerisation domain as well as the α helical extension required for IFT54/20 binding, while any protein generated through use of an internal translation initiation complex would lack BP1 essential for IFT38 binding. Finally, we showed in Figure 9B that a construct with a truncation at residue 587 was non-functional, failing to rescue ciliogeness. As such, it is likely that the frameshift mutations we created using CRISPR are also functional null alleles.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have also monitored the expression levels of mIFT80-GFP wild-type and missense mutant constructs and also the GFP-IFT80 truncation constructs using anti-GFP Western blotting and in-gel fluorescence (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-E and Figure 8—figure supplement 3). This analysis shows that all missense mutant forms of mIFT80-GFP produce specific bands at 106.9 kDa. This band was not detected in mock-transfected cells, or in cells transfected with empty vector, in which GFP was detected at 26.9 kDa. We noted that both of these bands were considerably diminished in intensity for all missense mutant transfections, as compared to wild-type. This showed that significant levels of all missense mutant forms of mIFT80-GFP were expressed, but that the levels were much lower than for wild-type. Therefore, IFT80 missense mutations are likely to cause protein instability. When considered in combination with the rescue data, this supports the contention that these mutations are hypomorphic. Using in-gel fluorescence, we also found that all truncation forms of GFP-IFT80 studied in Figure 9 were expressed at similar levels to wild-type protein showing that the failure of the dimerization domain deletion mutant to rescue ciliogenesis represents loss of protein function rather than reduced protein production (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-E).</p><p>We have added the Western blot data for transfected mIFT80-GFP constructs in a new Figure 8—figure supplement 3, and described the result as follows: ‘Western blotting showed that all transfected missense mutant forms of mIFT80-GFP were expressed at significantly lower levels that wild-type, suggesting that these mutations cause protein instability’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The IFT80 structure is minimally leveraged when the authors are attempting to test the importance of dimerization on ciliogenesis. While reasonable, the argument that 'Point mutations of IFT80 dimerization interface residues did not break up the homo-dimer, presumably because of the highly extended interface containing many backbone-backbone interactions (data not shown)' suggests that multiple mutations need to be introduced at once. The authors should generate and test a multiply substituted variant of IFT80 defective in dimerization.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comments that point-mutations resulting in a break-up of the dimer are indeed preferable and this was indeed our initial approach. However, as we state in the manuscript, single point mutations did not result in dimer disruption as analysed by SEC/SAXS and DLS. This was both the case for mutations to alanines as well as to larger more bulky residues. Constructs where several residues were simultaneously mutated were also cloned but these did not express in small-scale tests using insect cells. We think the reasons for these observations are not only that the interface is quite extended but also that it contains many sequence-unspecific backbone interactions as illustrated by β-sheet formed between blades of the second β-propeller in the dimeric structure. We thus had to rely on the more crude approach of truncating the IFT80 protein to address the functionality of the dimerization domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) 'In SEC experiments, IFT80 eluted as a dimer at low salt conditions (150 mM NaCl), but as a monomer at higher salt concentrations (500 mM NaCl, Figure 5A).'

Given that SEC is a shape-dependent method, Mw values will deviate from the theoretical values (now mentioned specifically in the figure legend). Also, a colour code consistent with Figure 5B has been introduced. All elution peaks are far from the void volume (45 mL, now mentioned in the figure legend) but we prefer not to show the entire elution profile (0-120mL) because of space restrictions and the fact that the four IFT80 elution peaks would cluster very close together.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There needs to be stronger evidence that IFT80 dimers play a role in train assembly and not just IFT-B complex assembly. If IFT80 was responsible for the dimerization of complex B for train formation, the authors should be able to obtain such a dimer from in vitro reconstituted complex B particles (Taschner et al., 2016). The authors should have all the reagents and tools to address this point. For instance, they could perform SAXS or negative-stain EM on reconstituted complex B (15 proteins) and complex B2 (6 proteins) and check for the presence of dimers. Such an experiment would provide convincing evidence for their hypothesis. The authors should otherwise reformulate their conclusions and provide alternative interpretation for the role of IFT80 dimerization in the assembly of IFT trains.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point and have carried out additional experiments with an IFT80 containing 14-subunit IFT-B complex. We left out IFT172 from the reconstitution as this protein tends to dissociate from the IFT-B complex at lower concentrations, which would make the DLS/SAXS data hard to interpret. Both DLS and SAXS data demonstrate a concentration-dependent increase in size of the complex consistent with a monomer-dimer equilibrium. The data have been included in a new Figure 6 and are discussed in the subsections “IFT80 dimerization requires the first residues of the C-terminal α-helical extension” and “Concentration dependent multimerization of a reconstituted 14-subunit IFT-B complex”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
