motors, traffic proteins in cilia. To study how trains assemble, we employed fluorescence protein-tagged IFT proteins in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. IFT-A and motor proteins are recruited from the cell body to the basal body pool, assembled into trains, move through the cilium, and disperse back into the cell body. In contrast to this ‘open’ system, IFT-B proteins from retrograde trains reenter the pool and a portion is reused directly in anterograde trains indicating a ‘semi-open’ system. Similar IFT systems were also observed in <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> and IMCD3 cells. FRAP analysis indicated that IFT proteins and motors of a given train are sequentially recruited to the basal bodies. IFT dynein and tubulin cargoes are loaded briefly before the trains depart. We conclude that the pool contains IFT trains in multiple stages of assembly queuing for successive release into the cilium upon completion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26609.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26609.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>flagella</kwd><kwd>IFT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>General Medicine - R01GM110413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lechtreck</surname><given-names>Karl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003653</institution-id><institution>Korea National Institute of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>General Medicine - R37GM030626</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witman</surname><given-names>George B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multimegadalton intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains assemble by sequential recruitment of IFT subcomplexes from the cell body to the ciliary basal bodies and tubulin, the main IFT cargo, is loaded briefly before trains depart.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The assembly of most cilia and flagella (terms used interchangeably) depends on bidirectional intraflagellar transport (IFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>). Anterograde IFT trains move from the ciliary base to the tip powered by kinesin-2; in retrograde IFT, the trains return to the cell body employing IFT dynein. The IFT trains transport proteins in and out of cilia to support ciliary assembly, maintenance, and signaling (for review: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lechtreck, 2015</xref>]). They are composed of IFT motors and IFT particles, the latter consisting of 22 conserved IFT proteins organized into biochemically stable IFT-A, IFT-B1 and IFT-B2 subcomplexes each consisting of equimolar amounts of 6, 10 and 6 proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katoh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taschner et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2016</xref>). At the ultrastructural level, the trains possess a periodic substructure presumably resulting from the 22-subunit IFT particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pigino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stepanek and Pigino, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vannuccini et al., 2016</xref>). Numerous protein-protein interactions within the IFT particle have been identified and a 15-subunit IFT-B complex has been assembled from recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hirano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>). The oligomerization of purified IFT complexes to the size of trains observed in vivo under cell free conditions has not yet been reported. In summary, our knowledge on how trains assemble is limited.</p><p>Western blot analyses showed that 90% or more of the IFT proteins reside in the cell body, a portion of which is concentrated around the basal bodies forming an IFT pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deane et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richey and Qin, 2012</xref>). The IFT trains emerge from the basal body pool (bb-pool) and enter the cilia in a kinesin-2 dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kozminski et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast to the discrete IFT trains observed inside cilia, the IFT bb-pool appears to be amorphous at the ultrastructural level, i.e., bona fide IFT trains with their characteristic zigzag structure are visible only near the distal end of the basal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rogowski et al., 2013</xref>). IFT-B loss-of-function mutants often fail to assemble cilia presumably due to impaired IFT train formation. In such mutants, the stability of the remaining IFT proteins and their spatial distribution in the bb-pool are altered (see for example: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lv et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richey and Qin, 2012</xref>]). Studies on such mutants clarify the interdependence among IFT proteins during subcomplex assembly and recruitment into the bb-pool. They are, however, less suited to determine the dynamics of IFT proteins in the bb-pool during the assembly of functional IFT trains. In a pioneering study, Buisson and colleagues used GFP-tagged IFT52 and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to study the assembly of IFT trains in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buisson et al., 2013</xref>). After photobleaching of the bb-pool, anterograde traffic of fluorescent IFT trains was transiently interrupted, indicative of bleached trains exiting the bb-pool. The pool signal recovered partially and anterograde IFT traffic resumed albeit with reduced signal strength suggesting that photobleached proteins in the bb-pool mix with unbleached IFT proteins supposedly derived from retrograde trains. This led to the proposal of a closed IFT system in which the IFT proteins perpetually cycle between the flagellum and the bb-pool with limited exchange of proteins between the flagellum-basal body entity and the rest of the cell body.</p><p>Here, we used a collection of eight fluorescent protein (FP)-tagged IFT proteins to study the assembly of IFT trains in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, which allows for high quality imaging of protein traffic inside flagella by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lechtreck, 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lechtreck, 2016</xref>). Our analysis revealed a largely open IFT system in which proteins are continuously recruited from the cell body to the basal bodies, assembled into trains, and released back into the cell body after traveling through the cilium. Bleaching of the bb-pool was followed by a temporal gap in fluorescence anterograde IFT traffic of several seconds before unbleached trains reentered the cilium. Notably, the duration of this gap differed among the IFT proteins analyzed suggesting that IFT-A, IFT-B, and finally the motor proteins are sequentially recruited into assembling trains. Our data indicate a high temporospatial organization of the IFT bb-pool with IFT trains in various stages of assembly queuing near the basal bodies for sequential release into the cilium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IFT proteins occupy distinct regions of the basal body pool</title><p>To analyze the dynamics of IFT proteins in the pool surrounding each of the two flagella-bearing basal bodies of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, we employed strains expressing fluorescent protein (FP)-tagged IFT particle and motor proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). IFT27 was expressed in a wild-type strain and KAP-GFP was expressed in <italic>fla3</italic>, which has a mutant KAP of reduced function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mueller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qin et al., 2007</xref>). The other proteins were expressed in loss-of-function mutants and rescued the corresponding flagella assembly phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The transgenic strains had normal or nearly normal length flagella and displayed IFT traffic with mostly wild-type IFT velocities and anterograde frequencies (~1/s); retrograde frequencies were more variable which we attribute mostly to the weaker signals of retrograde trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Trajectories representing retrograde traffic of KAP-GFP, which in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> mostly dissociates from IFT trains at the tip, were faint and infrequent. For our experiments, we selected cells displaying frequent IFT traffic avoiding cells with stationary IFT proteins accumulated inside the flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stepanek and Pigino, 2016</xref>). To image IFT proteins in the basal body pool, the incident angle of the laser beam was increased to allow for a deeper penetration of the light into the specimen. The various FP-tagged IFT proteins were present in dot-, colon-, or dumbbell-shaped regions near each basal body; most of them also showed weak X-shaped signals representing the microtubular flagellar roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Focal series from the flagella down into the cell body revealed that most of KAP-GFP was close to the distal end of the basal bodies followed by accumulations of the tagged IFT-B proteins; the IFT-A proteins and D1bLIC were concentrated deeper in the cell (not shown; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2015</xref>]). The IFT140-sfGFP signals were more peripheral than those of most IFT-B proteins. Within the limitations of the technique used, live cell imaging confirms and extends pervious observations on fixed cells indicating that different IFT proteins inhabit non-identical spatial domains within the bb-pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hou et al., 2007</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26609.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IFT proteins are concentrated at the flagellar base.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) top: Still images from live cells showing the distribution of FP-tagged IFT proteins in the basal body pool.

To determine which source resupplies the IFT bb-pool, we used a fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) approach by placing a focused laser beam near the tip of one flagellum preventing the return of unbleached IFT proteins to the basal body via retrograde IFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The duty ratio of the bleaching laser was set to 100–200 ms on and 400–900 ms off and in many experiments, images were only recorded while the bleaching laser was off to eliminate over-exposed frames (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Focusing onto the basal bodies, the fluorescence intensity of the bb-pool attached to the experimental flagellum was determined and normalized for general fluorescence loss using the control basal body. For the IFT-B proteins IFT20-NG, IFT46-YFP, and NG-IFT54 the signal intensity of the experimental basal body decreased significantly during FLIP illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D,F,G</xref>). The fluorescence loss was substantially lower for the tagged IFT27, motor protein subunits, and in particular IFT-A proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).

In the latter scenario, the signal strength of anterograde traffic should decrease progressively as the return of unbleached protein from the flagellum to the bb-pool is prevented. However, anterograde IFT trains containing unbleached IFT20/46/54 continued to enter the experimental flagella even after prolonged (&gt;60s) FLIP illumination with a frequency comparable to anterograde IFT in the control flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The signal strength of such trains, however, was generally below those in the control flagellum indicating that these trains contain both bleached proteins derived from retrograde trains and unbleached proteins recruited from the cell body. The signal strength of such trains could provide a measure of how much bleached and unbleached IFT-B protein was used for their assembly. A precise quantification is impeded because signal strength is affected by the absence of retrograde traffic and progressive loss of signal from stationary IFT in the experimental flagellum. To adjust for these shortcomings, we first analyzed the IFT-A protein IFT43-YFP, whose bb-pool signal is not affected in the FLIP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The signal strength of trains exiting the experimental bb-pool under FLIP illumination was ~10% below those in the control flagellum (n = 8, 4–7 IFT trains were measured in each cilium). A similar comparison for NG-IFT54 showed a 40% intensity decrease of trains in the experimental flagellum compared to trains in the control flagellum (n = 11; 4–8 measurements per cilium). The data indicate that a portion of the IFT-B protein NG-IFT54 in anterograde IFT trains is directly derived from retrograde IFT trains. With the qualification that IFT20/46/54 are partly salvaged, we conclude that <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> possess a largely open IFT system, in which proteins are recruited from the cb-pool to the basal bodies, assembled into trains, and travel once through the flagellum before being disassembled and released back into the cell body pool.</p><p>When FLIP bleaching at one ciliary tip of a given cell was continued for several minutes the signal of IFT trains progressively diminished in both cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). After ~6–9 min of FLIP, fluorescent IFT traffic diminished indicating that the entire cellular IFT-FP pool was near exhaustion. Sporadic residual NG-IFT54 traffic allowed for the observation of individual trains presumably containing only one or a few copies of unbleached NG-IFT54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Unbleached NG-IFT54 was evenly distributed between the two flagella. In control cells imaged for similar periods of time without being directly hit by the FLIP laser, dense IFT traffic albeit of reduced intensity persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The data suggest that NG-IFT54 returning to the cb-pool will eventually be reused and that bleached and unbleached proteins mix in the cb-pool and are stochastically recruited to the basal body pools.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Half of the NG-IFT54 pool is derived from retrograde trains</title><p>The above data indicate that the bb-pool consists in parts of disassembling IFT-B complexes. The approach of bleaching trains only at the tip still allows unbleached retrograde trains <italic>en route</italic> and IFT proteins transiently stationary along the length of the cilium to return to the bb-pool. To determine the dynamics of the disassembling IFT-B bb-pool, we moved the focused laser beam from the flagellar tip to the base bleaching almost the entire NG-IFT54 population in the experimental flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This approach offers a clear onset and an extended period during which only bleached trains return to the bb-pool. After the bleaching step, the signal strength of the experimental bb-pool declined by 52% (STD 8.5%, n = 6) over a period of 5.8 s (STD 0.9 s, n = 6) before reaching a plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). Thus, ~50% of the NG-IFT54 in the bb-pool is derived from retrograde trains. The first unbleached retrograde train returned after 10.9 s (STD 1.8 s, n = 22) to the experimental basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>).

The data suggest that NG-IFT54 entering the bb-pool by retrograde traffic remains for ~6 s in the pool before its release into the cell body or reuse in anterograde trains. In similar experiments using KAP-GFP or the IFT-A protein IFT43-YFP, the signal strength of the bb-pool attached to the experimental flagellum remained essentially unaltered indicating that these proteins are released into the cb-pool upon return from the cilium (n = 4 and 5, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E–H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mammalian IMCD3 cells and <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> have open IFT systems</title><p>In contrast to our data on <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, observations made in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> indicated a closed IFT system in which proteins move back and forth between the bb-pool and flagellum with negligible exchange with the cb-pool during the duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buisson et al., 2013</xref>).

The departure of an IFT train resulted in a transient reduction of signal strength at the bb-pool of ~16.1% (STD 7.2%, n = 18) for KAP-GFP, and 12.7% (STD 5.8, n = 20) for NG-IFT54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). Similarly, the arrival of a train increased the NG-IFT54 bb-pool signal by up to 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In this analysis we focused on bright trains allowing for a clear correlation between train trajectories and fluorescence loss in the bb-pool. Bright trains alternated with dimmer trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ludington et al., 2013</xref>), which changed the bb-pool signal by an estimated 5–10%. The data reveal that the departure (or arrival) of a single IFT train appreciably affects the strength of the bb-pool suggesting that the amount of IFT protein in the bb-pool is equivalent to a number of IFT trains in the upper single or lower double digits. NG-IFT54 trains, which could be best studied due to their bright and stable signal, exited the bb-pool at distinct sites resulting in a local depletion of the bb-pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). Kymograms obtained by scanning along two or three distinct lines parallel to the basal body-flagellum axis of a given cell were merged to visualize the exit of trains from distinct sites of the bb-pool and their journey along the flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–I</xref>).

Axonemal cargoes could already bind to IFT complexes in the cb-pool (e.g., on post-Golgi vesicles) or later during train assembly in the bb-pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wood and Rosenbaum, 2014</xref>). The above described approach of determining the duration of the gap in anterograde traffic after bleaching of the bb-pool has the potential to discriminate between these possibilities: If a cargo binds to IFT already prior to the recruitment to the bb-pool the gap should be in the range of that determined for the IFT proteins; shorter gaps would indicate loading at a later stage of train assembly. A prerequisite for this approach is a dense and regular cargo traffic as it has been reported for sfGFP-tubulin, which during flagellar regeneration enters cilia with an anterograde frequency of ~20/minute and even higher frequencies during early regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Craft et al., 2015</xref>). Cells expressing sfGFP-α-tubulin at ~10% of the endogenous α-tubulin were first deflagellated by a pH shock and allowed to initiate flagellar regeneration for &gt;20 min. sfGFP-tubulin already incorporated into the flagella was photobleached until IFT traffic of sfGFP-tubulin became visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Then, one basal body region was photobleached using the microtubular roots to position the beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). sfGFP-tubulin traffic into the attached flagellum resumed almost immediately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>). In detail, the gap between the bleach and the first sfGFP-tubulin trajectory was 1.9 s (STD 1.7 s, n = 25) for the experimental flagellum and 2.1 s (STD 1.6 s, n = 25) for the control flagellum; the difference was not significant (2-tailed t-test p=0.74). To ensure proper bleaching of sfGFP-tubulin near the flagellar base, we used an extended laser beam with a diameter of ~2 µm. sfGFP-tubulin traffic into the flagella resumed after on average 2.5 s (STD 1.5 s, n = 22). Notably, a similar short gap was also observed for D1bLIC, a subunit of IFT dynein, which is transported as a cargo on anterograde trains. Based on these data, we propose that sfGFP-tubulin and IFT dynein associate to IFT trains at the flagellar base and briefly before departure into the cilium.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26609.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Tubulin is loaded briefly before IFT trains enter the cilium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic presentation of the experimental design used to determine the gap in anterograde traffic of sfGFP-tubulin after photobleaching of the basal body.

Correlative light-electron microscopy identified IFT trains at as electron opaque arrays with a repetitive ultrastructural moving between the ciliary membrane and the axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kozminski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stepanek and Pigino, 2016</xref>). The pool of IFT proteins surrounding the basal bodies apparently lacks the well-defined ultrastructure of the trains moving inside cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rogowski et al., 2013</xref>). Based on the brightness of signals representing immunostained or FP-tagged IFT proteins, the bb-pool is several times the size of a single train. Due to this crowded situation, imaging of individual IFT trains from their inception to release into the cilium has not been achieved. Here, we used in vivo imaging and photobleaching to study the assembly of IFT trains. Our two main conclusions are that the IFT system is largely open with proteins constantly exchanging between the basal body-flagellum compartment and the cell body and that the bb-pool consists of a queue of IFT trains in different stages of construction.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The IFT system is open</title><p>IFT trains perpetually enter and exit the flagellum but the source of IFT proteins in the bb-pool and the fate of the IFT proteins returning to the pool are less clear. Two not mutually exclusive models have been proposed: A closed IFT system in which retrograde trains are remodeled in the bb-pool and reused in anterograde traffic and an open IFT system in which proteins are recruited to the bb-pool, move as trains through the cilium, and disperse back into the cb-pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buisson et al., 2013</xref>). Photobleaching of FP-tagged IFT proteins allows us to distinguish between these models. In a closed system, fluorescent anterograde traffic should quickly cease when the return of unbleached proteins to the flagellar base is prevented by photobleaching. In contrast, fluorescent anterograde traffic will continue in an open system until the entire cellular pool of the protein in question is bleached. Our data in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> revealed a largely open system for the IFT-B protein IFT27-GFP and the tested IFT-A and motor subunits and semi-open systems for the IFT-B proteins IFT20/46/54, where portions of the retrograde trains are reused in the assembly of anterograde trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). FRAP analysis of one IFT-B protein each indicates that open or semi-open IFT systems are also in place in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> and IMCD cells.</p><p>In contrast, a closed IFT system was proposed for the IFT-B protein IFT52 in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buisson et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to our observations on <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> IFT-B proteins, bleaching of the IFT52-GFP bb-pool in <italic>T. brucei</italic> was followed by a gap in anterograde traffic and IFT52-GFP from retrograde trains reentered the bb-pool. However, when anterograde IFT resumed the signal intensity of the trains was markedly below that of trains prior to the bleaching step and the total recovery of the bb-pool reached only ~50% of the prebleach intensity suggesting that the bleached proteins continue to cycle within the flagellum-basal body domain while an exchange with the cb-pool is negligible within the time span of the experiment. Possible reasons for the disparities between <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> range from differences in the experimental set-up to fundamental differences in IFT. For example, in a semi-open system as described for the IFT-B proteins, the ratio between new recruitment from the cb-pool and reusage of proteins derived from retrograde trains could be different between species with <italic>T. brucei</italic> favoring reusage. To study IFT52 dynamics in <italic>T. brucei,</italic> the bb-pool was photobleached. This technique cannot distinguish whether the unbleached proteins in postbleach trains are derived from retrograde trains or recruited from the cb-pool. In contrast, the observation of stable fluorescent IFT traffic after prolonged bleaching of retrograde IFT clearly indicates that unbleached proteins are continuously recruited from the cell body for incorporation into IFT trains. Single molecule imaging showed that kinesin-2 and IFT dynein returning from cilia in <italic>C. elegans</italic> diffuse briefly near the base to turn around and re-enter the cilium supporting a closed IFT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mijalkovic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>). While our data do not exclude that some motors remain in the basal body-cilium compartment for several rounds of IFT, the bulk of the motor subunits KAP-GFP and D1bLIC-GFP in anterograde trains of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> is recruited from the cb-pool (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3G,H</xref> for KAP-GFP). In their mature state, <italic>C. elegans</italic> cilia possess altered basal bodies and lack the transitional fibers (TFs), two structures that are likely to be critical for the recruitment of IFT proteins from the cb-pool to the ciliary base; these changes in could favor a more closed IFT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nechipurenko et al., 2017</xref>). Future studies using a range of imaging approaches and organisms are needed to evaluate the prevalence of closed and open IFT systems.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Temporal and spatial organization of the IFT pool</title><p>Comparison of the in vivo signals of eight FP-tagged proteins revealed differences with respect to their distribution along the basal body axis and their distance to the basal bodies confirming previous observations based on antibody staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richey and Qin, 2012</xref>). It appears that different IFT proteins occupy distinct territories indicating that the bb-pool contains IFT subcomplexes or individual proteins rather than entire IFT particles. Super-resolution imaging is likely to provide a clearer image of IFT protein territories within the bb-pool. Our data also indicate a functional compartmentalization of the bb-pool into assembling anterograde trains and disassembling IFT-B complexes.</p><p>The FRAP pattern of anterograde traffic after bleaching of the IFT bb-pool further informs on the assembly of IFT trains. Bleaching of the bb-pool is typically followed by a marked gap in IFT traffic during which no visible or only a few dim anterograde IFT trains enter the flagellum. A distinct gap in IFT traffic was also observed for IFT52-GFP in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buisson et al., 2013</xref>). The presence of a gap indicates that bleached trains exit the bb-pool ahead of trains assembled later from unbleached proteins. Based on these data, we propose that the IFT trains queue in the bb-pool to be released in order with newly assembling trains added to the end of the queue.</p><p>The length of the postbleach gap varied between the IFT proteins analyzed. A short gap, as it was observed for the KAP and D1bLIC, indicates recruitment of a given subunit shortly before the train exits the bb-pool; conversely, a long gap as observed for the IFT-A and IFT-B2 subunits, indicates that a protein was recruited early during train assembly. The data imply that the bb-pool should contain more IFT-A proteins (in equivalents of IFT trains) than KAP. The use of different FPs, the distinct spatial distribution of IFT protein in the bb-pool, and the expected small scale of the expected differences prevented us from comparing the amounts of the different IFT proteins in the pool. The post-bleach gaps were similar for proteins within each subcomplex suggesting that IFT proteins at the flagellar base are organized into subcomplexes, rather than entire IFT particles. In detail, the data suggest that during the assembly of a given train IFT-A and B2 are recruited first, followed by addition of B1, and finally binding of the anterograde motor as visualized by KAP-GFP.</p><p>The sequential arrival of IFT subcomplexes in the bb-pool does not necessarily indicate that the recruitment of a late arriving subcomplexes depends on the presence of the earlier arriving ones. Knock-out of the IFT-A core protein IFT144, for example, prevents the assembly of functional IFT-A complexes but IFT-B proteins still enter cilia and accumulate at the tip due to the lack of retrograde traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hirano et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the sequential recruitment of IFT subcomplexes into the pool does not automatically reflect the interdependence during train assembly. We consider it more likely that IFT subcomplexes are recruited independently of each other and line up in (spatially) separated queues to be then combined into trains. To summarize, our data indicate a functional, spatial, and temporal organization of the IFT basal body pool.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Tubulin is loaded briefly before the IFT trains enter the cilium</title><p>It has been suggested that axonemal proteins including tubulin and radial spoke subunits already associate to IFT proteins on IFT-coated post-Golgi vesicles and remain in this association during the arrival at the ciliary base, vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane, train formation, and transport into the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wood and Rosenbaum, 2014</xref>). To gain insights into the timing and location of cargo loading, we used sfGFP-tubulin, which due to its high frequency of transport by IFT is well suited for our photobleaching approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Craft et al., 2015</xref>). The calponin-homology (CH) domain of IFT81 and the N-terminal domain of IFT74 bind tubulin in vitro, and cilia assembly is impaired in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> strains carrying mutations in both domains indicating that the IFT81/74 module is the dominant tubulin binding site of IFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhogaraju et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kubo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2017b</xref>). While these two proteins were not analyzed here, we consider it unlikely that pre-formed IFT81/74/tubulin complexes are incorporated into trains shortly before departure because IFT81 and IFT74 are core structural components of the IFT-B1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lucker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taschner et al., 2014</xref>). If IFT-B1 proteins were already bound to tubulin at the time of their recruitment and incorporation into the trains, the gap in tubulin traffic after bleaching of the bb-pool should correspond in duration to that of the IFT-B1 proteins. However, the gap in sfGFP-tubulin traffic was actually shorter than that of KAP or any IFT particle protein studied here. The data indicate that tubulin loading occurs in the basal bodies pool and briefly before the trains move into the cilium. Axonemal cargoes are mostly released from IFT trains at the ciliary tip where IFT trains partially disassemble to reorganize for retrograde traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bower et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Craft et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson and Rosenbaum, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lechtreck et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wren et al., 2013</xref>). We speculate that cargo binding and unloading could be linked to train assembly and disassembly.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A model for the stepwise assembly of IFT trains</title><p>A critical role in train assembly can be attributed to the transitional fibers (TFs), which link the basal body triplets to the plasma membrane. <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants in the TF protein Dyf-19 have severely reduced amounts of IFT proteins and IFT traffic inside cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wei et al., 2013</xref>). The IFT-B1 protein IFT52 is associated with the TFs and the TFs are required to recruit kinesin-2, but not the IFT particle proteins, into the bb-pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deane et al., 2001</xref>). The entry of IFT proteins into the cilium depends on kinesin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kozminski et al., 1995</xref>), the binding of kinesin-2 to IFT is regulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liang et al., 2014</xref>), and we show here that the addition of kinesin-2 is a late step of train assembly.</p><p>The longest average gap in IFT traffic was ~9s for the IFT-A/B2 proteins. <italic>In C. reinhardtii</italic>, IFT trains exit the bb-pool with a frequency of ~1/s suggesting that one train is completed each second and that ~9 trains in different stages of assembly are in the pool at a given time. This value fits with our estimates of the bb-pool size based on the fluorescence loss or gain upon departure/arrival of a single train. In a speculative model, each of the nine basal body triplets with its associated structures could assist to assemble one IFT train. The nascent trains move upwards along the triplet blades combining with additional IFT subcomplexes. Then, they will associate with kinesin-2 at the TFs, which will pull the nascent train upwards and into the cilium, compressing and concentrating the IFT material between the microtubules and the membrane. Once a position is vacated by a departing train, the assembly of a new train is initiated near the proximal end of the basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and culture conditions</title><p>The IFT20-FP (sfGFP or NG), IFT27-GFP, IFT43-YFP, KAP-GFP (CC-4296), and D1bLIC-GFP (CC-4488) strains were previously described; the corresponding strain numbers of the Chlamydomonas Resource Center (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014960">SCR_014960</ext-link>) are added in brackets when available.

The excitation lasers were cleaned up with a Nikon GFP/mCherry TIRF filter and the emission was separated using an Image Splitting Device (Photometrics DualView2 with filter cube 11-EM). Images were mostly recorded at 10 fps using an iXON3 (Andor) and the NIS-Elements Advanced Research software (Nikon); µManager (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://micro-manager.org/">https://micro-manager.org/</ext-link>) was used to record some FLIP experiments.</p><p>To obtain a focused laser beam, the 488 nm laser beam was split using a 488 nm zero-order half-wave plate and a broad band polarized beam splitter; one of the beams was used for TIRF illumination. The other beam was expanded using a 3x beam expander, focused using 200 mm plano-convex lens and a 35 mm plano-convex lens and recombined with the TIRF laser beam using polarized beam splitter (all parts from Thorlabs Inc.). A motorized mirror connected to a joystick (Newfocus) was used to move the bleaching laser and the size of the laser spot was altered manually by moving the 35 mm lens. For FLIP experiments, the shutter and shutter driver (Uniblitz) for the bleaching laser were controlled via an Arduino Uno device and a custom-written macro for µ-Manager (see Supplementary methods). The FLIP experiments were recorded using either µ-Manger, which allowed us to prevent the acquisition of frames while the shutter was open or Nikon Elements; in the latter, the camera continued to record while the bleaching laser shutter was open resulting in over-exposed frames. FIJI (National Institutes of Health) was used to generate kymograms and quantify signals. Excel was used for statistical analysis; the kinetics of fluorescence recovery was determined manually based on the Excel scatter plots (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> as an example). Adobe Photoshop was used to adjust image contrast and brightness, and figures were prepared in Adobe Illustrator.

Grayscale profiles were plotted along lines covering the basal body signals, the data were converted to an Excel sheet, and the fluorescence of the experimental basal body was calculated in % of the intensity of the control basal body in a frame-by-frame manner. The recovery time and intensity were determined manually as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. In IMCD cells and <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, basal bodies with the attached cilium were bleached completely by moving the focused laser beam along the length of the cilium. To determine the rate of signal loss in FLIP experiments, we used the slope of a trendline added in Excel to the frames representing the initial 10–25 s of the experiment. For the gap analysis, a fiduciary mark on the monitor was used to position the cell so that one basal body was targeted by the laser spot; the focus level was adjusted to the level of the flagella, the recording was started, and a laser pulse of &lt;100 ms to ~600 ms was applied.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Erwin J G Peterman (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The process of intraflagellar transport is a complex intracellular transport system critical for assembly of cilia and flagella, organelles involved in a wide range of physiological and developmental processes. The mechanisms by which cells assemble such a complex structure as the cilium remain poorly understood, and IFT provides an excellent system in which to study the interplay between assembly and transport. The IFT system is itself highly complex, raising the question of how IFT particles and trains assemble and disassemble as they journey between the cell body and cilium. In this manuscript, which is a tour de force of live-cell imaging, the authors address the assembly of IFT particles, and the dynamics of their exchange between intracellular compartments, at an unprecedented level of molecular and temporal resolution.</p><p>By combining photobleaching with a battery of fluorescent protein tagged IFT constructs, the authors are able to reach several important conclusions. First, they find that unlike the situation reported for Trypanosomes, IFT in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> seems to be an open system in which retrograde particles are returned to a general cytoplasmic pool rather than being sequestered in a flagellum-basal body system. Second, they are able to show that the size of a basal body-associated IFT pool is small relative to the total cellular pool. Further quantitative analysis of photobleaching and FLIP experiments allowed the authors to calculate how much of the basal pool is regenerated from retrograde particles, and how much of the pool is released for each anterograde train. Finally, using different constructs they are able to estimate the time-line of IFT particle assembly, for example showing that motors assemble relatively late in the process, and cargo even later. This hints at a stepwise assembly process and provides critical in vivo kinetic information to complement some of the biochemical associate studies currently underway in other labs.</p><p>All three reviewers agree that the design of the experiments is clever, that the quality of the data is very good, that quantification is (in most cases) reliable, that appropriate and clever control experiments have been performed (e.g. evidence that the fluorescent proteins are functional, use of the basal body of the second flagellum as FRAP/FLIP controls, recovery of normal IFT after FLIP removal) and that the manuscript is clear and reads well.

In agreement with this notion, the signal of the experimental basal body at the end of the experiment can be somewhat stronger or weaker than that of the control basal body. Thus, negative data points are to be expected.</p><p>Due to the large spread of data points (~ -20 – 60), the differences between the three IFT-B proteins and the other proteins are difficult to appreciate in the box plot presentation. We therefore kept the bar diagram in the main figure and added the corresponding box plot of the data as a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel E).</p><p><italic>4) Subsection “The dispatched IFT-A and motor proteins do not return to the basal body pool”.

Please explain and show data.</italic> </p><p>In the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, the experimental basal body pool indeed loses its signal quite slowly. While we do not know why this particular cell behaves this way, possible reasons for such a slow rate of signal loss are insufficient strength of the bleaching laser or incorrect position of the laser with respect to the ciliary tip as it can result from small cell or flagella movements. Both would allow for some retrograde trains to return to the bb-pool delaying the loss of fluorescence. Such residual retrograde IFT would not have been out of focus in such recordings such as the one shown here. We replaced this panel with a kymogram from a more typical recording.</p><p>To quantify the loss of signal in the basal body pool in FLIP experiments, we recorded the cells using micromanager (and our macro that to avoid recording while the bleaching laser was on; see supplement). A quantification of such a recording is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> (original and revised manuscript). For this set of experiments we mostly ensured that retrograde traffic was abolished by changing the focus level toward the end of the recording to check for residual retrograde traffic (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The rate of signal loss in FLIP experiments was determined as follows (the sentence was added to the Materials and methods section):</p><p>“To determine the rate of signal loss in FLIP experiments, we used the slope of a trendline added in Excel to the frames representing the initial 10 – 25 s of the experiment.”</p><p>Time to reach the plateau and level of plateau: For NG-IFT54, we provide box plots of the time required to reach the plateau and the signal strength at the plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). The data were analyzed by manual inspection of the scatter plots.</p><p><italic>5) Subsection “Anterograde trains are largely assembled from proteins freshly recruited to the basal bodies”, last paragraph: &quot;After 6 minutes of FLIP the IFT pool was largely exhausted&quot;. Can it be excluded that photobleaching due to imaging (and not FLIP) plays a role here?</italic> </p><p>Yes, at least for mNeonGreen-tagged IFT54 we can exclude that the loss of signal is simply due to bleaching caused by the observation light. mNG is very bright and photostable allowing us to image the cells at low laser intensities (avoiding photobleaching) for extended periods of time.</p><p>In the original (and revised) manuscript we stated:</p><p>“In control cells imaged for similar periods of time without being directly hit by the FLIP laser, dense IFT traffic albeit of reduced intensity persisted (not shown).”</p><p>Since this question is listed as an essential revision, we added the kymogram of a control cell (from a recording using the same settings of the lasers for bleaching and recording as the experimental cells) as a new panel D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> to the revised manuscript.</p><p>(“In control cells imaged for similar periods of time without being directly hit by the FLIP laser, dense IFT traffic albeit of reduced intensity persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>).”)</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. The average gap time before visible anterograde particles is used to infer differences in loading time of different IFT proteins. I would suggest that the authors also show us the actual distribution in gap times. This might give insight in the mechanism of assembly (in case every protein is incorporated independently, one would expect exponential distributions, in case there are distinct intermediates, one might expect γ-distributions).</italic> </p><p>Box plots with data points have been included in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p><italic>The gap times are now interpreted as representing the assembly times. However, it could also reflect the abundance of a given fluorescent protein at the basal body pool. This could be lower for motors and IFT-A than for IFT-B and could explain the results (faster recovery of the signal at the base, faster injection of fluorescent trains). This would be difficult to quantify precisely since different expression systems and different fluorescent proteins were used; this deserves, however, discussion.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is an important point, which was insufficiently considered in the original manuscript. We added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>“The data imply that the bb-pool should contain more IFT-A proteins (in equivalents of IFT trains) than KAP. The use of different FPs, the distinct spatial distribution of IFT protein in the bb-pool, and the expected small scale of the expected differences prevented us from comparing the amounts of the different IFT proteins in the pool.”</p><p>Our conclusion that proteins (of a given train) are sequentially recruited to the pool implies that the respective pools will be different in size as well (larger for IFT-A and smaller for the motors); for the IFT-B proteins, which also return to the pool, the situation is more complicated.</p><p><italic>In addition, the stoichiometry of tubulin and IFT trains is unknown: tubulin-binding domains have been found on several IFT proteins (Bhogaraju et al. 2014). Please discuss how this complexity could affect the data.</italic> </p><p>The theoretical work of Bhogaraju et al. 2014 has been superseded by Taschner et al. (2016) showing that only the CH domains of IFT81 and IFT54 bind tubulin and microtubules. Further, while our manuscript was under revision, Zhu et al. (2017) showed that the CH domain of IFT54 is not required for flagellar assembly in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. In addition, Kubo et al. (2016) showed that a combination of mutations in the CH of IFT81 with an N-terminal truncation of IFT74 (IFT81’s binding partner) renders <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells unable to assemble flagella. Thus, tubulin binding sites independent of the IFT81/74 module appear to be absent in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. To address this point we updated the references and rewrote the corresponding part of the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“To gain insights into the timing and location of cargo loading, we used sfGFP-tubulin, which due to its high frequency of transport by IFT is well suited for our photobleaching approach (Craft et al., 2015). […] While these two proteins were not analyzed here, we consider it unlikely that pre-formed IFT81/74/tubulin complexes are incorporated into trains shortly before departure because IFT81 and IFT74 are core structural components of the IFT-B1 complex (Lucker et al., 2005; Taschner et al., 2014).”</p><p><italic>7) The discovery of open and semi-open IFT system adds up to the already known apparently closed systems of T. brucei and C. elegans. These are important results and their biological significance deserves to be discussed in a specific paragraph.</italic> </p><p>We extended our discussion on the differences in the IFT systems of <italic>Chlamydomonas, T. brucei</italic>, and <italic>C. elegans</italic> by adding the following two phrases to the corresponding section of the Discussion:</p><p>“For example, in a semi-open system as described for the IFT-B proteins, the ratio between new recruitment from the cb-pool and reusage of proteins derived from retrograde trains could be different between species with <italic>T. brucei</italic> favoring reusage.”</p><p>And</p><p>“In their mature state, <italic>C. elegans</italic> cilia possess altered basal bodies and lack the transitional fibers, two structures that are likely to be critical for the recruitment of IFT proteins from the cb-pool to the ciliary base; these changes in could favor a more closed IFT system (Nechipurenko et al., 2017)<italic><underline>.”</underline> </italic></p></body></sub-article></article>
