development. However, how these systems function to achieve transcriptional regulation remains very poorly understood. Here, we discover that the histone H2AK119 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is defined by the composition of its catalytic subunits and is highly regulated by RYBP/YAF2-dependent stimulation. In mouse embryonic stem cells, RYBP plays a central role in shaping H2AK119 mono-ubiquitylation at PcG targets and underpins an activity-based communication between PRC1 and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which is required for normal histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Without normal histone modification-dependent communication between PRC1 and PRC2, repressive Polycomb chromatin domains can erode, rendering target genes susceptible to inappropriate gene expression signals. This suggests that activity-based communication and histone modification-dependent thresholds create a localized form of epigenetic memory required for normal PcG chromatin domain function in gene regulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18591.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18591.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>histone modification</kwd><kwd>Polycomb repressive complex</kwd><kwd>E3 ubiquitin ligase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Consolidator grant, 681440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Research Fellowship, 098024/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001255</institution-id><institution>Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097813/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>Benedikt M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004789</institution-id><institution>John Fell Fund, University of Oxford</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>133/075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>Benedikt M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000647</institution-id><institution>Kennedy Memorial Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>Benedikt M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of polycomb repressive complex 1 is stimulated by RYBP to support a histone modification-dependent communication between polycomb repressive complexes in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In multicellular eukaryotes the capacity to express defined subsets of genes at the correct time and place underpins normal development. While genetically encoded regulatory pathways define the nature of these gene expression patterns in individual cell types and tissues, these systems must ultimately converge on a DNA substrate that is not unadorned, but instead wrapped around histone proteins to form nucleosomes and chromatin. Through studying chromatin function in the context of gene regulatory networks it is now clear that modification of DNA and histones is essential for controlling normal regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In animals, Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play central roles in gene regulation through their chromatin modifying activities. First identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as important regulators of body plan specification, orthologous PcG systems were subsequently identified in vertebrates and also shown to be essential for developmental gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lewis, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwartz and Pirrotta, 2013</xref>). Biochemical characterization of PcG proteins has revealed that they form large multiprotein complexes that function as chromatin-modifying or -remodelling enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Müller and Verrijzer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Simon and Kingston, 2013</xref>). PcG proteins generally fall into one of two multiprotein complexes, called Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). PRC1 functions as a histone E3 ubiquitin ligase that mono-ubiquitylates histone H2A at position 119 (H2AK119ub1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Napoles et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2004a</xref>) and PRC2 is a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Czermin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Müller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>). Together, the activities of these two PcG protein complexes play important roles in maintaining repressive chromatin states and controlling gene expression during cell fate transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Leeb and Wutz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Endoh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Terranova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Koche et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bracken et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The defined molecular mechanisms that underpin how PcG complexes regulate transcription still remain poorly understood. However, it has been proposed that the occupancy of PRC1 and PRC2 at genomic target sites and their capacity to modify histones may function to create structurally compacted chromatin which is inhibitory to transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eskeland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Francis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boettiger et al., 2016</xref>). To achieve this, the function of PRC1 and PRC2 appear to be intimately linked. For example, some PRC1 complexes are able to recognise and bind PRC2-dependent H3K27me3, recruiting those PRC1 complexes to sites occupied by PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Min et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2004b</xref>). Similarly, PRC2 can recognize PRC1-deposited H2AK119ub1, regulating PRC2 occupancy on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cooper et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, in vitro assays have suggested that H2AK119ub1 may also stimulate the enzymatic activity of PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kalb et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these observations it has been proposed that feedback mechanisms, whereby one Polycomb repressive complex supports the recruitment and possibly activity of the other complex, may in part underpin chromatin-based transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackledge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steffen and Ringrose, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>). In other scenarios the relevance of histone modifications to gene repression, particularly the role of H2AK119ub1, has remained unclear, with the repressive nature of PRC1 being proposed to reside within its capacity to alter chromatin structure and compaction independently of its H2A ubiquitylating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pengelly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Illingworth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Francis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eskeland et al., 2010</xref>). However in most cases, the defined contribution of H2AK119ub1-dependent and –independent pathways, and their relevance to Polycomb chromatin domain function in vivo have remained incompletely defined.</p><p>In order to understand the mechanisms by which the PcG systems function together in vivo, it will be critical to discover how, if at all, their enzymatic activities contribute to chromatin structure and gene regulation. While significant effort has been placed on understanding in vitro how the H3K27 methyltransferase activity of PRC2 is controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Margueron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jiao and Liu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cao and Zhang, 2004</xref>), far less is known about how PRC1 complexes catalyse H2AK119ub1 and how this relates to the function of PRC1 in vivo. This paucity in our understanding of PRC1 activity is in part due to the diverse nature of individual PRC1 complexes. At the simplest level, PRC1 complexes are formed by their catalytic subunit, RING1A or RING1B, which dimerises with a PCGF protein to form an active E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets histone H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Levine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Satijn et al., 1997</xref>). In mammals, there are six PCGF proteins (PCGF1–6), and the identity of the PCGF protein incorporated into PRC1 appears to direct interaction with a specific complement of auxiliary proteins, giving rise to an array of diverse PRC1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>). Based on the protein subunit composition of these individual PRC1 complexes, they are often then divided into ‘canonical’ or ‘variant’ complexes. Canonical PRC1 complexes form around either PCGF2 or 4, and incorporate a chromobox (CBX) protein, which can directly bind to PRC2-catalysed H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fischle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Min et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, variant PRC1 complexes can form around all six PCGF proteins, but these complexes engage with RYBP or YAF2, two proteins that bind to a site on RING1B that is mutually exclusive with CBX protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">García et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Despite the diversity of PRC1 complexes, biochemical characterization of their catalytic activity has largely been focused on canonical PCGF2/PCGF4-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Elderkin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buchwald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-saadon et al., 2006</xref>). For example, in vitro ubiquitylation assays using reconstituted complexes and nucleosome substrates demonstrated that RING1(A/B) could form an active E3 ligase in the presence of either PCGF2 or PCGF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Elderkin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buchwald et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, a minimal complex comprised of a dimer between the N-terminal RING finger domains of PCGF4 and RING1B was sufficient to deposit H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buchwald et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, the RING finger domains of individual PCGF proteins are highly similar, suggesting that they will likely all support formation of an active E3 ligase complex. However, more recent work examining PCGF(1–6)/RING1(A/B) catalytic RING-RING dimers revealed that PCGF(2/4)/RING1(A/B) were less active than PCGF(1/3/5/6)/RING1(A/B) in autoubiquitylation and E2 lysine discharge assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Taherbhoy et al., 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, when these same assemblies were challenged with physiologically relevant nucleosome substrates, complex-specific activities were no longer apparent. Nevertheless, consistent with the possibility that individual PRC1 complexes may have distinct activities related to protein complex composition, in vivo studies in both mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic> have suggested that less-well characterized variant PRC1 complexes may contribute more significantly to H2A mono-ubiquitylation than canonical PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lagarou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>). For example, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> dRAF complex, which appears to have similarities to mammalian variant PRC1 complexes, is a highly active H2A ubiquitin ligase in vitro and appears to be the predominant H2A ubiquitin ligase in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lagarou et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, a PCGF3 orthologue contributes widely to H2AK119ub1 in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). This raises the possibility that individual PCGF proteins might confer differing E3 ligase activities on PRC1, either directly, or via interaction with complex-specific regulatory subunits. Indeed, incorporation of the auxiliary subunits RYBP, PHC2 or CBX2/8 into a PCGF4/RING1B complex has been reported to affect its E3 ligase activity in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), though this was not the case for PCGF2/RING1B, in which auxiliary subunits had little impact on catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore a more detailed understanding of how H2AK119 ubiquitin ligase activity is shaped by different PRC1 assemblies, both in vitro and in vivo, is required to better understand PRC1 involvement in polycomb chromatin domain function and gene regulation.</p><p>To address these important questions we have exploited biochemical and genomic approaches to interrogate PRC1 enzymatic activity in vitro and in cells. This revealed that PRC1 complexes are highly modular, and that the enzymatic activity of PRC1 is defined by the choice of PCGF protein combined with the influence of RYBP/YAF2, uncovering an enzymatic logic within the assembly of individual PRC1 complexes. Building on these discoveries, genetic ablation and genomic approaches uncover a widespread role for RYBP in stimulating H2AK119 E3 ligase activity in vivo, and we demonstrate that the absence of this activity leads to defects in the deposition of H3K27me3 by PRC2. Importantly, in the absence of RYBP, loss of PRC1 stimulation and subsequent defects in PRC2 activity can lead to erosion of Polycomb chromatin domains and susceptibility to inappropriate gene activation signals. Together, these observations identify an activity-based communication between PRC1 and PRC2 in vivo, and suggest that histone modification-dependent thresholding mechanisms sustain Polycomb chromatin domains, connecting the activity of PcG systems to their occupancy on chromatin and transcriptional repression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PCGF1-PRC1 is a highly modular protein complex</title><p>In embryonic cells and tissues where the PcG system is thought to play a pivotal role in developmental gene regulation, the PCGF1-PRC1 complex is highly abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kloet et al., 2016</xref>), and is required for H2AK119ub1 and normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gearhart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boulard et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, tethering experiments had previously suggested that the variant PCGF1 complex might be more active than PCGF2/4 complexes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>). Given the essential nature of this PRC1 complex and its apparent elevated activity in vivo, we sought to use it as a model system to understand the biochemical mechanisms that underpin the assembly and catalytic activity of PRC1. To achieve this, we used a baculovirus co-expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bieniossek et al., 2012</xref>) to assemble and affinity-purify the five component PCGF1-PRC1 holocomplex containing RING1B, PCGF1, RYBP, KDM2B and BCOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). To understand in more detail the topology of the PCGF1-PRC1 complex we subjected it to crosslinking followed by tandem mass spectrometry analysis, which identifies the relative proximity of proteins within large protein complex assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Leitner et al., 2014</xref>). This revealed clear spatial relationships between individual components of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For example, RING1B was in close proximity to PCGF1 and RYBP. Importantly RING1B and RYBP crosslinks were consistent with atomic resolution information detailing their physical interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).

However, there was no evidence for significant crosslinks between either BCOR or KDM2B and RING1B, suggesting they are not in close proximity within the complex. This suggests a high degree of modularity within the PCGF1-PRC1 complex, where individual combinations of proteins engage extensively with each other, while others exhibit little or no clear proximity.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18591.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PCGF1-PRC1 is a highly modular complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of the PCGF1-PRC1 complex indicating the core catalytic dimer of RING1B and PCGF1 and auxiliary components RYBP, KDM2B, and BCOR.

To achieve this we generated a series of co-expression vectors in which individual proteins were iteratively omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This revealed that KDM2B and BCOR, which appear to interact with the complex through PCGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), can be completely removed, either individually or in combination, to leave an intact PCGF1-RING1B-RYBP sub-complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D(i–iii)</xref>). Similarly, when RYBP was removed from the PCGF1-PRC1 complex, BCOR and KDM2B were still able to independently interact with the PCGF1-RING1B dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D(iv–v)</xref>). This indicates that inclusion of BCOR and KDM2B in the PCGF1-PRC1 complex does not require RYBP, or an interaction with each other. Finally, in agreement with analysis of other PCGF/RING1 interactions, PCGF1/RING1B formed dimers in the absence of other PCGF1-PRC1 components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D(vi)</xref>). Therefore, the PCGF1-PRC1 holocomplex assembles around a core PCGF1-RING1B dimer, and does so in a highly modular fashion. Interestingly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the related dRAF complex exhibits similar modularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lagarou et al., 2008</xref>). This contrasts the assembly of the PRC2 holocomplex, which appears to rely on extensive and highly integrated protein-protein interactions for its efficient formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ciferri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jiao and Liu, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RYBP/YAF2 stimulates H2A ubiquitylation by PCGF1-PRC1</title><p>Within multiprotein enzyme complexes, non-catalytic components can function to regulate enzymatic activity, substrate recognition, or targeting. Our understanding of how PRC1 complexes function in these regards remains very poorly defined. However, the inherent modularity of the PCGF1-PRC1 complex provided a unique opportunity to examine if individual components of the complex contribute to the H2AK119 E3 ligase activity of PRC1. To address this important question, we first established a quantitative in vitro E3 ligase activity assay using nucleosome substrates and confirmed that reconstituted PCGF1-PRC1 was active by detecting the conversion of H2A to mono-ubiquitylated H2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then compared the relative E3 ligase activity of the PCGF1-RING1B core dimer to the five component PCGF1-PRC1 holocomplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Surprisingly, the PCGF1-PRC1 holocomplex was substantially more active than the PCGF1-RING1B core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To understand the molecular determinants controlling this activity, we then iteratively measured the H2AK119 E3 ligase activities of individual PCGF1-PRC1 sub-complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This revealed that interaction of RYBP with the RING1B-PCGF1 core dimer was responsible for elevated enzymatic activity of the PCGF1-PRC1 holocomplex. In contrast, KDM2B and BCOR appeared to contribute little or nothing to this activity, suggesting that they confer alternative, non-enzymatic functions to the PRC1 complex. Variant PRC1 complexes can contain either RYBP or YAF2, and their inclusion appears to be mutually exclusive, presumably because they bind to the same region of RING1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>). Given the stimulatory activity of RYBP on PRC1, we wanted to determine whether YAF2 was also capable of stimulating PCGF1-RING1B. Therefore, we purified recombinant YAF2 and RYBP and added them to PCGF1-RINGB E3 ligase reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, this revealed that YAF2 also stimulated PCFG1-RING1B activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together these observations reveal that RYBP and YAF2 regulate PCGF1-PRC1 activity in vitro, where they act to stimulate the PCGF1-RING1B core dimer and enhance H2AK119ub1 deposition.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18591.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>RYBP stimulates the catalytic core of PCGF1-PRC1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A histone H2AK119 E3 ligase assay monitoring the conversion of H2A to mono-ubiquitylated H2A by western blotting, which demonstrates that the activity of PCGF1-PRC1 requires E1 (UBE1), E2 (UBCH5C), Ubiquitin and ATP.

Therefore, we sought to understand whether differences in E3 ligase activity between individual PRC1 complexes are inherent to the PCGF-RING1B catalytic core, or whether RYBP may have selective stimulatory activity. This was important as previous in vitro work had only directly compared the H2AK119ub1 E3 ligase activity of differing PCGF/RING1 assemblies in the context of minimal RING-RING catalytic dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Taherbhoy et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, when intact PCGF(2/4)/RING1 dimers had been examined, differing conclusions were made as to whether RYBP stimulated E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore to examine these points in more detail, we expressed and purified intact PCGF1-RING1B and PCGF4-RING1B dimers and compared their relative activities in H2AK119 E3 ligase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, this revealed that PCGF1-RING1B was significantly more active than PCGF4-RING1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that the enzymatic activity of a given PRC1 complex is inherently defined by the PCGF-RING dimer which forms its catalytic core. Given that PCGF1-RING1B is robustly stimulated by RYBP, we were then curious to understand whether RYBP stimulated PCGF4-RING1B. This was an important question as previous studies examining the effect of RYBP on PCGF4-RING1B and the related PCGF2-RING1B dimer had come to differing conclusions, with one study observing no effect on activity and the other claiming elevated H2AK119 E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>). In the context of our experiments, we observe a small stimulatory effect when RYBP was added to PCGF4-RING1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Despite this low level of stimulation, PCGF4-RING1B-RYBP was still much less active than PCGF1-RING1B-RYBP. Together these observations indicate that the PCGF component of the PRC1 complexes defines the inherent H2AK119 E3 ligase activity of individual PRC1 dimers and that inclusion of RYBP/YAF2 further matures these assemblies into robust enzymes that can efficiently modify chromatin.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18591.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The PCGF1 catalytic dimer is inherently more active and stimulated more robustly than the PCGF4 catalytic dimer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coomassie-stained gels showing the recombinant PCGF1-RING1B or PCGF4-RING1B catalytic cores with or without the addition of RYBP.

We were therefore interested to understand the molecular nature of this stimulatory activity, as it could have profound implications for how PRC1 functions in vivo. Interestingly, RYBP has been shown to function as an ubiquitin-binding protein via its zinc finger NZF domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arrigoni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fereres et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore reasoned that the capacity of RYBP to recognize ubiquitin, perhaps in the form of H2AK119ub1, could account for its stimulatory activity on PRC1. To examine this possibility we generated recombinant RYBP, and RYBP with mutations in the NZF domain that abrogate ubiquitin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arrigoni et al., 2006</xref>), and added them to E3 ligase reaction containing PCGF1-RING1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Importantly, both forms of RYBP stimulated the activity of PCGF1-RING1B to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Given that the ability of RYBP to recognise ubiquitin did not account for its stimulation of PRC1, we wondered whether RYBP may instead affect how the core dimer assembles to function as an H2AK119 E3 ligase. We therefore turned to crosslinking mass spectrometric analyses to examine whether inclusion of RYBP in the complex resulted in any gross alterations in the proximity of individual domains. To address this possibility we directly compared the PCGF1-RING1B dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and the RYBP-PCGF1-RING1B trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Within the PCGF1-RING1B dimer, we observed multiple high-confidence crosslinks between the RING domain of RING1B and its C-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, suggesting that there are likely significant intramolecular interactions occurring between these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Intriguingly, most of the RING domain/RING-UBL domain crosslinks within RING1B were lost in the trimeric complex (PCGF1-RING1B-RYBP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that RYBP causes an alteration in PCGF1-RING1B which limits association between its N- and C-terminal domains, possibly to stabilize the formation of an optimally assembled and active E3 ligase. Interestingly, upon closer inspection of our reconstituted complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), it was noticed that the level of PCGF1 was reduced in complexes lacking RYBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is in agreement with our crosslinking mass spectrometry analysis, and suggests that RYBP helps to reconfigure and stabilize the PCGF1-RING1B dimer. Importantly however, reduced PCGF1 inclusion does not explain the effect that RYBP has on the activity of PCGF1/PRC1 complexes, as the presence of RYBP stimulated the relative activity of PRC1 to a much larger extent than can be simply explained by PCGF1 levels alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Furthermore, RYBP and YAF2 were able to significantly stimulate the activity of pre-existing PCGF1-RING1B assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Future structural work will be imperative to understand the defined biochemical nature of this RYBP-dependent stimulation.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18591.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>RYBP-dependent stimulation of PCGF1-PRC1 is associated with changes in the PCGF1-RING1B dimer but not ubiquitin binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coomassie-stained gels showing the recombinant PCGF1-RING1B affinity purified via RING1B with wildtype RYBP or a ubiquitin-binding mutant (RYBP TFAA).

Studying this in a cellular context could however be complicated by previous conflicting observations suggesting that RING1B may, or may not, be destabilised when RYBP is removed in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morey et al., 2013</xref>). To examine this possibility we first determined whether loss of RYBP affected the level of RING1B. In the context or our new <italic>Rybp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Yaf2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>conditional system, deletion of RYBP did not lead to an appreciable reduction in total RING1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), in agreement with our observation that PRC1 complex assembly in vitro is modular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The stability of the PRC1 complex in the absence of RYBP allowed us to then examine the direct contribution of RYBP to H2AK119ub1 in vivo. Somewhat surprisingly, despite the dramatic affects that RYBP has on H2AK119 E3 ligase activity in vitro, removal of RYBP did not significantly affect total H2AK119ub1 as measured by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Again this contrasts previous observations in which shRNA-mediated knockdown of RYBP led to global reductions in H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), and suggests that these affects may have been the indirect result of decreased RING1B levels.</p><p>Given these observations, we reasoned that RYBP may play a more defined or locus-specific role in regulating H2AK119ub1 as had previously been suggested from single gene analysis following RYBP depletion in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morey et al., 2013</xref>). To address this possibility we exploited a calibrated ChIP-seq approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonhoure et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Orlando et al., 2014</xref>) to measure H2AK119ub1 genome-wide in the <italic>Rybp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Yaf2<sup>−/−</sup> </italic>cells, before and after RYBP ablation. Importantly, H2AK119ub1 signal in wild-type cells was highly correlated with both RING1B and RYBP occupancy genome-wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, a visual inspection of these data revealed enrichment of H2AK119ub1 at genes associated with Polycomb-mediated repression in embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). When we compared the levels of H2AK119ub1 before and after RYBP removal at individual Polycomb target sites, we observed clear reductions in H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), suggesting that RYBP supports deposition of H2AK119ub1 at these genomic locations. To explore the breadth of these affects, we identified a set of 2407 genomic regions that were enriched for H2AK119ub1. Quantitation of H2AK119ub1 after removal of RYBP revealed widespread effects on H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), with approximately 45% of regions showing significant reductions in the levels of H2AK119ub1 (1091/2407; p&lt;0.05). However, this appeared to be an underestimation of the effect, as nearly all PRC1 targets displayed reductions in H2AK119ub1, albeit below the significance threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). These effects are consistent with our in vitro observations demonstrating that RYBP shapes the E3 ligase activity of PRC1 complexes. Given the widespread reductions in H2AK119ub1 observed in ChIP-seq, it is perhaps surprising that we did not detect global alterations in H2AK119ub1 by western blot. This is likely due to a proportion of total cellular H2AK119ub1 residing outside of classical polycomb target sites as has been proposed previously in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Goldknopf et al., 1975</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>RYBP regulates the activity, not chromatin occupancy, of PRC1 in vivo</title><p>Although our in vitro studies provide compelling evidence that RYBP regulates PRC1 activity, previous work has suggested that RYBP may also contribute to PRC1 function through regulating its stability or targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, single gene studies had suggested that following depletion of RYBP, RING1B targeting to polycomb sites may not be overtly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hisada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morey et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, having demonstrated that the stability of PRC1 is unaffected following RYBP deletion in the <italic>Rybp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Yaf2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we set out to test at the genome-scale whether H2AK119ub1 losses following RYBP deletion in vivo were the result of defective PRC1 targeting or supressed E3 ligase activity. To achieve this, we carried out RING1B ChIP-seq before and after tamoxifen treatment of <italic>Rybp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Yaf2<sup>-−/−</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Initially, we considered RING1B occupancy at PRC1 target sites where H2AK119ub1 was dependent upon RYBP, to examine whether H2AK119ub1 reductions were coincident with reduced chromatin occupancy of PRC1. However, visual inspection of several of these sites revealed that despite displaying large decreases in H2AK119ub1, RING1B occupancy was often unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We extended this analysis genome-wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and found that the majority of PRC1 target sites (78%; 1870/2407) failed to show a significant change in RING1B occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and we validated these observations at a number of sites using ChIP quantitative PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, there were only a modest number of sites showing decreases in RING1B binding (20%; 487/2407) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Importantly, following RYBP deletion we observed clear and widespread reductions in H2AK119ub1 at PRC1 target sites where RING1B occupancy remained unchanged. These observations are in agreement previous observations at selected target sites following shRNA-mediated knockdown of RYBP which also appeared to show loss of H2AK119ub1 in the absence of perturbed RING1B binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morey et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the subset of PRC1 targets which lost RING1B appeared on average to exhibit a unique depletion of H2AK119ub1 in the centre of the peak when compared to other PRC1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This was coincident with a more highly positioned TSS at the centre of the peak but did not appear to correspond with a depletion of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Furthermore, these sites tended to be more enriched for variant PRC1 (RYBP), as opposed to canonical PRC1 (CBX7) occupancy, suggesting that these PRC1 targets might depend more on RYBP for normal H2AK119ub1 and RING1B occupancy than canonical targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>) as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morey et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these genome-wide observations strongly support our in vitro conclusions that RYBP stimulates the E3 ligase activity of PRC1, and reveal that decreases in H2AK119ub1 at PRC1 target sites are not due to defects in targeting PRC1.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18591.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>RYBP regulates the activity, not chromatin occupancy, of PRC1 in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A genomic snapshot of RING1B and H2AK119ub1 ChIP-seq in <italic>Rybp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Yaf2<sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> </italic>mouse embryonic stem cells before (UNT) and after 96 hr tamoxifen (OHT) treatment demonstrates that decreases in H2AK119ub1 occur in the absence of altered RING1B occupancy.

Nevertheless it was clear that at individual sites the magnitude of H2AK119ub1 loss often differed greatly, perhaps suggesting that features inherent to individual Polycomb target sites could dictate their reliance on the stimulatory activity of RYBP. To examine this possibility we divided PRC1 target sites into quartiles based on their relative loss of H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Initially, we examined the levels of RYBP at these different groups to determine whether the effect on H2AK119ub1 following loss of RYBP was not simply related to the absolute amount of RYBP at a given target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, RYBP enrichment was similar across groups of RYBP-dependency, and counterintuitively more lowly occupied sites often exhibited more profound reductions in H2AK119ub1. We then examined the occupancy of the PRC1 catalytic core component RING1B at these same sites, and observed that the sites which were most dependent upon RYBP for H2AK119ub1 had the lowest occupancy of RING1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This suggests that sites with limiting amounts of PRC1 have a more defined requirement for RYBP-dependent stimulation to achieve normal H2AK119ub1. To explore this possibility, we calculated the ratio of RYBP relative to RING1B at PRC1 target sites over the range of H2AK119ub1 dependencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This revealed that the sites where loss of RYBP most profoundly affected H2AK119ub1 exhibited the highest ratios of RYBP to RING1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). At these PRC1 target sites it appears that the inherent activity of the core catalytic complex is insufficient to sustain H2AK119ub1, and that RYBP-dependent stimulation is required to define normal H2AK119ub1 levels. We then wondered whether dependency on RYBP might also be related to the occupancy of canonical PRC1 at these sites. Indeed, PRC1 targets that were occupied by RYBP but displayed reduced levels of CBX7 (i.e. ‘variant-enriched’) tended to show the largest reductions in H2AK119ub1 following RYBP removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>), whereas variant and canonical PRC1 occupied sites (i.e. ‘shared’) appeared to rely on RYBP to a lesser extent. Intriguingly, shared-PRC1 targets, tended have the largest polycomb domains, and were enriched for genes related to sequence-specific transcription factor binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), perhaps reflecting a contribution of both variant and canonical PRC1 in shaping H2AK119ub1 at these regulatory genes. Interestingly, and in contrast to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morey et al., 2013</xref>), our ChIP-seq based analysis of RYBP binding did not reveal a class of PcG target sites that were enriched for canonical PRC1 (CBX7) but lacked variant PRC1 (RYBP). This suggests that canonical PRC1 binding occurs at PcG target sites that are also occupied by variant PRC1. Together, our detailed genome-wide analysis in vivo establishes a clear role for RYBP in stimulating the H2AK119ub1 E3 ligase activity of PRC1, particularly at variant PRC1-enriched sites with low levels of RING1B.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18591.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>RYBP-dependent stimulation is essential for H2AK119ub1 at sites with low PRC1 occupancy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A box plot illustrating the separation of H2AK119u1 peaks into quartiles based on their relative reduction in H2AK119ub1 upon deletion of RYBP.

This, coupled with CBX-dependent recognition of H3K27me3 by canonical PRC1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fischle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Min et al., 2003</xref>), could effectively create a feedback mechanism sufficient to help sustain Polycomb chromatin domains in a histone modification-dependent manner. Given that RYBP stimulates the E3 ligase activity of PRC1, we wondered whether this activity may play a role in these proposed feedback mechanisms. To address this we performed ChIP-seq for SUZ12, a core component of PRC2, and H3K27me3 in the <italic>Rybp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Yaf2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells before and after tamoxifen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Strikingly, deletion of RYBP resulted in genome-wide reductions in H3K27me3 at Polycomb target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). However, like H2AK119ub1, H3K27me3 reductions were not evident from western blot analysis of total histones, suggesting that H3K27me3 is affected most profoundly at classical Polycomb target sites and not the larger pool of H3K27me3 which is proposed to exist elsewhere in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Grzybowski et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, H3K27me3 reductions at Polycomb target sites occurred without any apparent loss in the chromatin occupancy of the PRC2 component SUZ12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the observed decreases in H3K27me3 likely arise as a result of reduced activity of the PRC2 complex. Like the observed changes in H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>), the largest reductions in H3K27me3 were evident at variant-enriched PRC1 target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), consistent with a more defined role for RYBP in maintaining PcG-associated histone marks at these regions. Importantly, reductions in H3K27me3 across all PRC1 target sites correlated closely with reductions in H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), indicating that the effects on H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 are linked and directly related to the activity of RYBP. These important observations demonstrate that RYBP-dependent H2AK119ub1 shapes the activity of PRC2 in depositing H3K27me3, and suggests that the observed stimulation of PRC2 by nucleosomes containing H2A mono-ubiquitylation in vitro is also relevant in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kalb et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18591.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>RYBP-dependent H2AK119ub1 shapes PRC2 activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A genomic snapshot of H3K27me3, SUZ12 and H2AK119ub1 ChIP-seq in <italic>Rybp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Yaf2<sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup></italic> mouse embryonic stem cells before (UNT) and after tamoxifen (OHT) treatment.

One possible explanation is that normal PcG protein occupancy can only be effectively maintained as long as histone modifications remain above a certain level or threshold. Conversely, if this threshold is crossed, effective Polycomb chromatin occupancy may no longer be maintained, and the Polycomb chromatin domain could begin to erode. If this were the case, one might predict that thresholds for Polycomb domain erosion would differ between individual target sites. We therefore hypothesized that in the context of our experiments, erosion of Polycomb chromatin domains following RYBP deletion might occur at the sites that experienced the greatest relative reductions in their Polycomb-associated histone modifications. To examine whether this was the case, we examined the subset of Polycomb target sites that experienced significant losses in PRC1 and PRC2 occupancy following RYBP deletion, and compared these to target sites at which occupancy was unaffected. Interestingly, we observed that the sites with the most profound losses of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 were the same sites that showed reductions in PRC1 and PRC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Together these observations reveal two important and fundamental features associated with the function of Polycomb chromatin domains. Firstly, there is an intimate relationship between the histone-modifying activities of PRC1 and PRC2 at target sites, which is regulated by auxiliary PcG complex subunits and not simply dictated by occupancy of PRC1/PRC2 core catalytic subunits. This is evident in instances where RYBP removal leads to reductions in both H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3, without major alterations in PcG complex occupancy. Secondly, the occupancy of PcG complexes at target sites is not driven in a linear fashion by H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 levels. However, if activity-based communication between the PcG complexes is compromised there appears to be a modification threshold below which complex occupancy can no longer be sustained. Again this is evident following RYBP removal, where sites displaying the greatest loss of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 also show reductions in PcG complex occupancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Loss of RYBP culminates in gene reactivation at sites where Polycomb chromatin domains are compromised</title><p>Studies in mice have demonstrated that RYBP plays a fundamental role in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pirity et al., 2005</xref>), and that it is also important at later developmental stages including haematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Calés et al., 2016</xref>), presumably due to its involvement in PcG-mediated gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, RYBP-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> die at varying stages during development and RYBP can function as an enhancer of PcG phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gonzalez et al., 2008</xref>). Given the widespread effects that RYBP has on shaping H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3, and the erosion of normal Polycomb chromatin domains that ensues at some target sites following RYBP removal, we wondered whether genes associated with these target sites were aberrantly transcribed. To this end, we isolated nuclear RNA from cells before and after RYBP deletion and carried out RNA-seq analysis. This revealed that loss of RYBP resulted in a limited number of robust and statistically significant transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), in agreement with previous studies examining gene expression by microarray analysis in RYBP deleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hisada et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with a role for RYBP in shaping PRC1-dependent gene repression, more genes were significantly upregulated (n = 230) than downregulated (n = 37), and these tended to be lowly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Furthermore, when we compared these gene expression changes to those observed in the complete absence of PRC1 activity (RING1A<sup>−/−</sup>;RING1B<sup>−/−</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schoenfelder et al., 2015</xref>), most RYBP-repressed genes fell within the set of genes that are also regulated by RING1A/B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In addition, when we compared the expression of genes that were upregulated following RYBP loss to the gene expression changes in cells where RING1B was catalytically inactivated (RING1B I53A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Illingworth et al., 2015</xref>), RYBP-dependent genes were also partially upregulated, although the effects in this context were modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). The extent of gene reactivation at Polycomb target genes following RYBP removalwas generally of lower magnitude than gene reactivation following deletion of RING1A/RING1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), in agreement with our observations that RYBP stimulates, but is not absolutely required for, PRC1 activity and occupancy.

We reasoned that if the integrity of a Polycomb chromatin domain was required for normal transcriptional repression, one might expect that gene reactivation following RYBP loss would correspond to sites where there was a loss of PcG complex occupancy. Indeed, when we examined individual RYBP-dependent genes, increased transcription was often coincident with TSS-associated decreases in PcG complex occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), although this was more apparent for PRC1 than PRC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>). When we extended this analysis genome-wide there was a very clear relationship, albeit not perfectly linear, between reduction of PRC1 occupancy at TSSs and increased gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Consistent with a role for PcG systems in helping to maintain genes in a repressed state in tissues where they should not normally be expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Klose et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Riising et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>), the magnitude of gene reactivation events was often modest. This likely reflects genes that are in a very lowly transcribed or off state, transitioning to a more transcribed but not fully activated state. This is presumably because the signals necessary to drive transcriptional activation of these genes are low or absent in embryonic stem cells.</p><p>Together, our transcription and Polycomb chromatin domain analyses reveal an activity-based communication between PcG complexes regulated by RYBP-dependent stimulation of PRC1. Furthermore it provides clear evidence that the histone modifying activities of PRC1 and PRC2 underpin feedback mechanisms that are important for maintaining Polycomb chromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackledge et al., 2015</xref>), counteracting inappropriate gene activation signals, and shaping normal gene repression, at least at a subset of polycomb target sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>PcG proteins play an important chromatin-based role in controlling gene expression. The PRC1 and PRC2 complexes work together to achieve this, and in vertebrates both their occupancy on chromatin and functionality appear to rely, at least in part, on their capacity to modify histones. However, mechanisms controlling the activity of PRC1, and its relationship with PRC2, remain poorly understood. Here we reveal a defined requirement for specific PCGF components and the auxiliary subunits RYBP/YAF2 in regulating the H2AK119 E3 ligase activity of PRC1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). In vivo, RYBP plays a central role in shaping normal H2AK119ub1 at Polycomb target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) where it functions to stimulate the E3 ligase activity of PRC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) and regulate PRC2-dependent H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). At a subset of Polycomb target sites, the absence of RYBP leads to a more profound effect on histone modifications leading to Polycomb chromatin domain erosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and inappropriate reactivation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Together this extends our understanding of the interesting and important activity-based communication between PcG complexes that has been previously proposed from in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kalb et al., 2014</xref>), and demonstrates that the enzymatic activity of PcG complexes can communicate through chromatin in vivo in order to maintain normal PcG function in gene regulation.</p><p>A striking and central conclusion from our enzymatic analysis of PRC1 complexes in vitro was that the enzymatic activity of PRC1 is determined not only by its interaction with auxiliary factors like RYBP/YAF2 but also the PCGF protein that forms the PCGF/RING1 catalytic core. This therefore suggests that the activity of individual PRC1 complexes is likely to depend upon the inclusion of specific PCGF proteins and to be highly regulated in vivo. An important focus for future work will be to directly compare the E3 ligase activities of other less well-characterized PRC1 complexes, to understand how widespread these regulatory mechanisms are amongst distinct PRC1 assemblies, including those PRC1 complexes formed by PCGF3/5/6. In an important first step towards achieving this, a recent study examined PCGF1–6/RING1 catalytic dimers and concluded that they displayed little inherent difference in their H2AK119 E3 ligase activity on nucleosome substrates in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Taherbhoy et al., 2015</xref>). However, these experiments relied on truncated proteins which lack important domains, including the C-terminus of RING1 which is the interaction site for RYBP/YAF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast our observations using full length proteins demonstrate that PRC1 activity is governed by the nature of the catalytic dimer and the stimulatory activity of auxiliary factors like RYBP/YAF2. An important focus of future work will also rely on understanding the relative contribution of individual PRC1 complexes in placing H2AK119ub1 in vivo, given that RYBP/YAF2 appears to interact with diverse PRC1 complexes.</p><p>As we begin to learn more about the mechanisms that shape PRC1-dependent E3 ligase activity, our understanding of how this contributes towards PcG system function in gene regulation and development remains an important and outstanding question. Indeed, it still remains incompletely defined how the H2AK119ub1-dependent and independent activities of PRC1 are leveraged by the PcG systems to regulate gene expression, particularly in mammals. However, early biochemical work very clearly demonstrated a structural role for PRC1 in chromatin compaction and counteracting chromatin remodelling in vitro, independently of H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Grau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Francis et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, RING1B null cells which display transcriptional reactivation and chromatin decompaction of the PcG-occupied <italic>Hox</italic> loci, are rescued of these deficiencies with a form or RING1B lacking catalytic activity, suggesting a structural role on chromatin for PRC1 in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eskeland et al., 2010</xref>). In agreement with a role for canonical PRC1 in shaping chromatin structure at PcG target sites, the PHC component of canonical PRC1 can polymerize in vitro and this activity appears to be import for the formation of cytologically identifiable structures referred to as ‘polycomb bodies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Isono et al., 2013</xref>). Similar studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have also provided evidence via super resolution imaging that Polycomb body formation relies on Ph (orthologous to mammalian PHC) to shape chromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boettiger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wani et al., 2016</xref>) and perturbation of Ph in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leads to widespread effects on normal gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lagarou et al., 2008</xref>). This abundance of work clearly indicates that PRC1 has essential structure-based effects on chromatin that are related to normal PcG-dependent gene regulation and in some cases this appears to be independent of the E3 ligase activity of PRC1. Consistent with H2AK119ub1-independent roles for PRC1 in normal <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, a catalytic mutant of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RING1 orthologue (Sce1) is less phenotypically severe than that of Sce1 null animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pengelly et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, mutation of histone H2A such that it is no longer a target for PRC1-dependent mono-ubiquitylation did not lead to <italic>Hox</italic> gene misregulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal disc clones, suggesting that H2A ubiquitylation is not required to maintain repression of these PcG target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pengelly et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly a <italic>Ring1b<sup>I53A/I53A</sup> </italic>mouse model, in which the E3 ligase activity of RING1B-containing PRC1 complexes is perturbed, indicated that the catalytic activity of RING1B is also not essential for early mouse development, with <italic>Ring1b<sup>I53A/I53A</sup> </italic>mice succumbing to embryonic lethality at a later embryonic stage than <italic>Ring1b</italic>-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Illingworth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Voncken et al., 2003</xref>). Because these <italic>Ring1b</italic> mouse models do not completely phenocopy each other it would suggest that RING1B may contribute functions during mammalian development that are independent of H2A mono-ubiquitylation, possibly related to its role in chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eskeland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Francis et al., 2004</xref>). However, it still remains unclear whether early mammalian development and normal polycomb mediated repression can be sustained in the absence of PRC1 E3 ligase activity, as this requires the generation of a mouse model that lacks the enzymatic activity of RING1A and RING1B, both of which are expressed in early development and contribute to deposition of H2AK119ub1 and gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Napoles et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Endoh et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, however, <italic>Ring1b<sup>I53A/I53A</sup></italic> embryonic stem cells have dramatically reduced levels of H2AK119ub1, show reductions in H3K27me3 and reactivate a subset of PcG target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Illingworth et al., 2015</xref>). This scenario is reminiscent of the reductions in H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 that occur following loss of RYBP-dependent stimulation of PRC1. Together these observations support the general argument that in mammals H2AK119ub1 helps to shape communication between PRC1 and PRC2 in order to sustain normal Polycomb chromatin domain function in gene regulation. However it is clear that a more detailed analysis of both RING1A and RING1B activity will be imperative in defining how important H2AK119ub1 is for mammalian development and gene regulation by the PcG system.</p><p>PRC1 and PRC2 complexes have the capacity to recognise H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3, and it has been proposed that this supports PcG protein binding to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackledge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kalb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Margueron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Min et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Simon and Kingston, 2013</xref>). Here we show that RYBP deletion causes reductions in H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 yet PRC1 and PRC2 occupancy remains largely intact. However, a subset of PcG target sites exhibit larger reductions in H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 and have pronounced losses of PcG complex occupancy. Based on these observations we speculate that activity-based communication between PRC1 and PRC2 may support PcG complex occupancy through a histone modification-dependent thresholding mechanism. In the context of such a mechanism we speculate that the majority of PcG target genes have H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 levels that are in excess of that required to support normal PRC1 and PRC2 binding. However, if H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 levels fall below a given threshold, as some sites do in the absence of RYBP, normal activity-based communication between PRC1 and PRC2 can no longer be maintained, leading to a reduction in PcG protein occupancy and an increased propensity for gene reactivation.</p><p>If histone modification-dependent thresholding mechanisms contribute at least at some sites to the function of the Polycomb system, how or why might this be beneficial to the control of gene expression? Given the highly dynamic nature of PRC1 and PRC2 interactions with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fonseca et al., 2012</xref>), histone modifications could provide a form of local epigenetic memory to bridge the intervening time between individual engagement events to reinforce PcG protein occupancy. Assuming that PcG protein occupancy is important for gene repression and that histone modifications can stabilize PcG protein binding, it would seem sensible that some fluctuation in histone modification levels would need to be tolerated in order to protect the stability of the PcG system at individual sites. However, this hysteresis could be rapidly counteracted by altering the activity of individual PcG complexes, or by removing their associated histone modifications. In both scenarios this would impair PcG complex occupancy and render these normally inactive states reversible and responsive to strong gene activation signals during cell lineage commitment. In combination with chromatin-modifying activities of the Trithorax group systems that are associated with gene activation, this could support a form of chromatin bistability at gene regulatory elements, as we and others have previously proposed, to allow switch-like activation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Deaton and Bird, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Klose et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steffen and Ringrose, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, alterations in the histone modifying activities of PcG complexes are key molecular defects associated with various cancers, suggesting that perturbing PcG-associated histone modifications, or potentially altering histone modification thresholds, may be important in the pathological adaptation of gene expression in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Scelfo et al., 2015</xref>). Clearly more work is required to understand the relative contributions of the histone modification-dependent and -independent activities of PcG complexes to both chromatin structure and gene repression at polycomb chromatin domains.</p><p>In conclusion, our enzymatic analysis of PRC1 in vitro and genomic dissection of how RYBP shapes its activity in vivo, reveal an interesting activity-based communication between Polycomb repressive complexes on chromatin. Furthermore, they indicate that histone modification thresholds could play an important and previously unrealized role in shaping Polycomb chromatin domain function in the context of gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Mouse <italic>Ring1b</italic>, <italic>Pcgf1</italic>, <italic>Rybp</italic>, <italic>Bcor</italic> and <italic>Kdm2b</italic> (short isoform) were cloned into the Multibac plasmid set.

This is in the context of recent studies reporting that the ubiquitination of H2A (mediated by ncPRC1 complexes) is both capable of recruiting the PRC2 complex to an artificial gene locus (Blackledge et al., 2014, Cell; Cooper et al., 2014) and increasing the activity of PRC2 in vitro (Kalb et al., 2014, Nature Structural Molecular Biology). However, more recent genetic evidence in Ring1a/b double knockout cells have shown that a complete ablation of ncPRC1 activity did not affect global H3K27me3 levels in gut tissues (Chiacchiera et al., Cell Stem Cell, 2016). Furthermore, while the loss of PRC2 mediated H3K27me3 leads to HOX gene derepression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Pengelly et al., Science, 2013), the complete loss of H2A ubiquitination did not phenocopy this (Pengelly et al., Genes &amp; Development 2015). Likewise, recent genetic studies questioned the importance of H2A ubiquitination for Polycomb silencing in mice (Illingworth et al., Genes Dev. 2015). Despite this, we know from these studies and others, that ncPRC1 and indeed H2Aub are essential for embryonic development. Finally, that RYBP can stimulate H2Aub1 by a subset of PRC1 complexes is already established in ES cells and in flies (Gao et al., 2012; Fereres et al., 2014, PLoS One). Moreover, cross-talk between PRC1/H2Aub1 and PRC2/H3K27me3 has been examined previously (Tavares et al., 2012; Blackledge et al., 2014; Cooper et al., 2014; Kalb et al., 2014; Illingworth et al., Genes Dev. 2015; Pengelly et al., Genes Dev 2015; Fereres et al., 2014, PLoS One; Morey et al., Cell Reports 3, 2013), but these studies resulted in rather diverse conclusions.</p><p>In this overall well-done study, the authors firstly establish an in vitro ubiquitination assay for ncPRC1, and use it to explore the role of the RYBP subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). They discover that RYBP is capable of considerably boosting H2A ubiquitination in vitro. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, they use knockout mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to explore the roles of RYBP in vivo. They compare a Yaf2 knockout ES cells and Rybp/Yaf2 double knockout ES cells to examine the effect on the global levels of H2AK119ub1 (Western blot) and at selected Polycomb target genes (ChIP-seq). While surprisingly, they observe that the overall global levels of H2AK119ub1 are apparently unchanged in the RYBP/Yaf2 double knockout ES cells, they detect moderate local reductions of H2AK119ub1 at sites normally occupied by Rybp and Ring1b. Taken together with their in vitro observations, these results suggest that Rybp and Yaf2 are not essential for the H2AK119ub1 activity of ncPRC1 complexes and rather are co-factors that can augment activity, perhaps at more weakly bound sites. They then go on to correlate local reductions in H2AK119ub1 with moderate reductions in H3K27me3 and slight increases in transcription at some of the affected Polycomb target genes. However, they report that this reduced H3K27me3 does not correlate with reduced PRC2 complex occupancy, as measured by ChIP-seq analysis of Suz12 in their Rybp/Yaf2 double knockout ES cells. The authors use these observations to propose a model for the communication between PRC1 and PRC2, at least on a number of gene regulatory loci.</p><p>Whereas the reviewers found the manuscript potentially interesting for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, because it shed light on the function of RYBP and the communication between PRC1 and PRC2, several major concerns were raised that will need to be addressed experimentally.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should avoid making quantitative conclusions about Ring1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and Suz12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) in the wild-type versus Rybp/Yaf2 double knockout ES cells. They rightly point out that the ChIP-RX method (Orlando et al., Cell Reports, 2014,) is the correct approach to quantify potential changes in the H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 histone marks. However, they employ non-quantitative ChIP-seq to look at the Ring1b and Suz12 binding profiles. They should instead employ a careful, quantitative ChIP-qPCR approach, checking multiple representative sites, in order to properly evaluate if Ring1B and Suz12 occupancy change in the Rybp/Yaf2 double knockout ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). This is especially important for both their model that RYBP primarily influences ncPRC1 activity (and not level, or localization of the complex, as published by others see e.g. Gao et al., 2012; Tavares et al., 2012; Morey et al., Cell Reports 3, 2013) and the open question whether the presence of H2AK119ub1 might either lead to increased recruitment of PRC2 or increase its activity (again, the authors should content with the already published work). Based on ChIP data the authors conclude that H2A ubiquitination is required for normal H3K27 methylation and proposed an &quot;activity-based communication between PRC1 and PRC2&quot;. While this conclusion is likely to be correct (this point has basically been made in earlier publications), this cannot be concluded solely from ChIP data in this manuscript. In fact, Kalb et al. (2014) already did an experiment that allows such a mechanistic interpretation by showing that nucleosomes containing H2Aub1 are a better substrate for H3K27 methylation by PRC2.</p><p>2) The authors should carry out gene ontology (GO) analysis of the genes that lose both H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 at their promoters in the Rybp/Yaf2 double knockout ES cells in a bid to identify ncPRC1 specific sets of target genes and compare to similar work in previous studies. It would be interesting to further delineate those H3K27me3 positive genes that do and don't have reduced H3K27me3 in the Rybp/Yaf2 double knockout ES cells. This would be important for the readers in light of previous work delineating the biological roles of cPRC1 and ncPRC1 (Pengelley et al., 2015 and Illingworth et al., 2015). These studies found that H2A ubiquitination appears to be dispensable for Polycomb dependent repression of the Hox genes. However, since H2Aub is required for both fly and mouse viability, it becomes interesting to begin to determine which genes are dependent on ncPRC1 mediated H2AK119ub1 for their regulation.</p><p>3) To better report the genome-wide binding profiles of cPRC1 and ncPRC1 in ES cells, the authors should include heat maps of their ChIP-seq data for all transcription start sites (+/- 5kb) for Cbx7 (Morey et al., 2013, Cell Reports), Ring1b (+/-OHT), Rybp (+/-OHT), H2AK119ub1 (+/-OHT) and H3K27me3 (+/-OHT). This would help delineate the cPRC1 and ncPRC1 unique target genes and it may shed light on whether loss of Rybp affects H3K27me3 levels at shared ncPRC1 and cPRC1 target genes or on ncPRC1 specific target genes only.</p><p>4) Following this heat map analysis, the authors should investigate whether the 230 Polycomb target genes that have an increase in transcription in their Rybp/Yaf2 double knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) are ncPRC1 specific, cPRC1 specific or ncPRC1 and cPRC1 shared target genes. They should provide ChIP-qPCRs of Suz12, H3K27me3 and Ring1b at a representative set of these gene promoters.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> reconstituted histone H2A ubiquitination assays are used in which different recombinant PRC1 assemblages are compared by titrating increasing amounts of enzyme with a fixed substrate and the% conversion at the end of the reaction is determined. The correct way to compare enzymatic activities is to determine reaction rates. I.e. measure conversion over time using a fixed amount of enzyme and substrate! This experiment should be included for a few key complexes. Another critical issue is that the ratio enzyme vs substrate (nucleosomes) is not clear. It is essential that the substrate is in excess over the enzyme (this should be shown). Finally, a better analysis of the nucleosomes used in the assays need to be provided. E.g. are there free histones in the prep? An additional nucleosome purification step (e.g. glycerol centrifugation or size exclusion chromatography) would give more confidence. This is also important because the results in this manuscript are at odds with published work from other groups (e.g. Gao et al. 2012; Tavares et al., 2012). Finally, subsection “PCGF1-PRC1 is a highly modular protein complex” – and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. It appears that the absence of RYBP leads to consistently reduced levels of PCGF1 (lanes 4 to 6) and possibly a slight reduction in BCOR (lane 5). This suggests that RYBP may help to stabilize these interactions. Quantitation of this blot should be performed and these result discussed in the text.</p><p>6) The Introduction, and actually most of the manuscript, does not give a clear overview of what has already been published on this topic. It is not that many major references were missing (although e.g. the work of the Sixma lab (Buchwald et al., 2006) should be included), rather the Introduction does not clearly summarized the work already done. In addition, somewhat more attention to work in the fly would be helpful to the reader as well. E.g. ncPRC1 complexes and there role in histone ubiquitylation were first described in the fly (Lagarou et al., 2008). Finally, in the Results and DDiscussion sections, findings by others with similar experiments should be mentioned and where appropriated differences should be discussed. The whole manuscript strongly emphasizes the catalytic functions of PRC1/2 but this needs to be much better balanced by a discussion of the substantial evidence – both in vitro and in vivo, and in flies and mammals – that PRC1 executes many of its functions through a structural change in the underlying chromatin and that is independent of its catalytic activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18591.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[…]</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors should avoid making quantitative conclusions about Ring1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and Suz12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) in the wild-type versus Rybp/Yaf2 double knockout ES cells. They rightly point out that the ChIP-RX method (Orlando et al., Cell Reports, 2014,) is the correct approach to quantify potential changes in the H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 histone marks. However, they employ non-quantitative ChIP-seq to look at the Ring1b and Suz12 binding profiles. They should instead employ a careful, quantitative ChIP-qPCR approach, checking multiple representative sites, in order to properly evaluate if Ring1B and Suz12 occupancy change in the Rybp/Yaf2 double knockout ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). This is especially important for both their model that RYBP primarily influences ncPRC1 activity (and not level, or localization of the complex, as published by others see e.g. Gao et al., 2012; Tavares et al., 2012; Morey et al., Cell Reports 3, 2013) and the open question whether the presence of H2AK119ub1 might either lead to increased recruitment of PRC2 or increase its activity (again, the authors should content with the already published work).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer(s) that this is an important point and we have now performed new ChIP-qPCR analysis for RING1B, SUZ12, H2AK119ub1, and H3K27me3 in biological triplicate at multiple representative sites. This analysis has confirmed that RING1B and SUZ12 are largely retained, or even in some instances elevated in the case of SUZ12 (consistent with our ChIP-seq meta-analysis for SUZ12 – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), while H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 are reduced following removal of RYBP/YAF2 as suggested by our original ChIP-seq analysis. These new ChIP-qPCR results have been integrated as new supplementary figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), and further support the argument that RYBP/YAF2 acts to influence PRC1 and PRC2 activity rather than their binding to chromatin.</p><p><italic>Based on ChIP data the authors conclude that H2A ubiquitination is required for normal H3K27 methylation and proposed an &quot;activity-based communication between PRC1 and PRC2&quot;. While this conclusion is likely to be correct (this point has basically been made in earlier publications), this cannot be concluded solely from ChIP data in this manuscript. In fact, Kalb et al. (2014) already did an experiment that allows such a mechanistic interpretation by showing that nucleosomes containing H2Aub1 are a better substrate for H3K27 methylation by PRC2.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer(s) are correct in pointing out that our in vivo ChIP-seq analysis and the ‘activity-based communication’ model we arrive at is in agreement with, and strengthened by, the elegant in vitro work performed by Kalb et al. (2014) in which they demonstrated that the activity of PRC2 was stimulated by H2AK119ub1. Our new observations provide clear genome-wide evidence that reduced H2AK119ub1 at PcG target sites in vivo predominantly influences PRC2 activity and not target site binding. We have included the following statement to clarify this point in subsection “RYBP-dependent H2AK119ub1 shapes PRC2 activity”:</p><p>“These important observations demonstrate that RYBP-dependent H2AK119ub1 shapes the activity of PRC2 in depositing H3K27me3, and suggests that the observed stimulation of PRC2 by nucleosomes containing H2A mono-ubiquitylation in vitro is also relevant in vivo (Kalb et al., 2014).”</p><p><italic>2) The authors should carry out gene ontology (GO) analysis of the genes that lose both H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 at their promoters in the Rybp/Yaf2 double knockout ES cells in a bid to identify ncPRC1 specific sets of target genes and compare to similar work in previous studies. It would be interesting to further delineate those H3K27me3 positive genes that do and don't have reduced H3K27me3 in the Rybp/Yaf2 double knockout ES cells. This would be important for the readers in light of previous work delineating the biological roles of cPRC1 and ncPRC1 (Pengelley et al., 2015 and Illingworth et al., 2015). These studies found that H2A ubiquitination appears to be dispensable for Polycomb dependent repression of the Hox genes. However, since H2Aub is required for both fly and mouse viability, it becomes interesting to begin to determine which genes are dependent on ncPRC1 mediated H2AK119ub1 for their regulation.</italic> </p><p>We agree this is an interesting and important question and thank the reviewer(s) for the suggestion. To examine these relationships in more detail we undertook two complementary new analyses.</p><p>Firstly, as suggested by the reviewer(s), we identified polycomb targets which relied the most (RYBP-dependent) or the least (RYBP-independent) on RYBP for H3K27me3, and compared their gene ontology (GO) enrichment terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>). Both groups of polycomb targets were enriched for GO terms implicated in development (e.g. “system development”, “developmental process”, “organ development” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1A and B</xref>)), consistent with polycomb complexes playing an important role in regulating developmental genes in embryonic stem cells. However, interestingly, sites which retained the most H3K27me3 in the absence of RYBP/YAF2 exhibited enrichment for DNA binding and sequence-specific transcription factors (Autho response <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">image 1A and B</xref>). These transcription factors are often master regulators involved in developmental decision making processes, and are found in large and very CpG dense islands that have high levels of polycomb protein occupancy, H3K27me3, and H2AK119ub1 ((Long et al., 2013) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1C</xref>). In this context the stimulatory activity of RYBP and H2AK119ub1 appears less pronounced, suggesting that these sites may have sufficient PRC2 occupancy to render RYBP and H2AK119ub1-dependent stimulation less relevant.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18591.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>GO analysis of RYBP-dependent and –independent H3K27me3 genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>,<bold>B</bold>) PRC1 target genes with the largest reductions in H3K27me3 (RYBP-dependent H3K27me3; Top 25%), or the PRC1 targets with the smallest reductions in H3K27me3 (RYBP-independent) were used for gene ontology analysis using HOMER.

In agreement with the segregation of sites based on changes in H3K27me3, both groups were strongly associated with developmental processes; however the shared sites exhibited a slight preference for sequence-specific transcription factors. Variant enriched sites also encompassed transcription factors, but in general represented a set of genes that included a more broad range of biological processes.</p><p>Together this suggests that sequence-specific transcription factors may have evolved to use a more robust complement of cPRC1 and vPRC1 activities to help maintain H2AK119ub1 while vPRC1 may play a broader role in shaping H2AK119ub1 associated with a range of biological processes. We have integrated these analyses into the revised manuscript, with GO term analysis included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. We have also discussed these findings where relevant (see subsection “RYBP-dependent stimulation is essential for H2AK119ub1 at sites with low PRC1 occupancy”).</p><p><italic>3) To better report the genome-wide binding profiles of cPRC1 and ncPRC1 in ES cells, the authors should include heat maps of their ChIP-seq data for all transcription start sites (+/- 5kb) for Cbx7 (Morey et al., 2013, Cell Reports), Ring1b (+/-OHT), Rybp (+/-OHT), H2AK119ub1 (+/-OHT) and H3K27me3 (+/-OHT). This would help delineate the cPRC1 and ncPRC1 unique target genes and it may shed light on whether loss of Rybp affects H3K27me3 levels at shared ncPRC1 and cPRC1 target genes or on ncPRC1 specific target genes only.</italic> </p><p>We thank for the reviewer(s) for this useful suggestion, and agree that the manuscript would benefit from a better understanding of the relative contribution of RYBP towards previously proposed canonical and/or variant PRC1 targets (as also covered in essential reviewer point 2). To address this important point, we implemented the reviewer(s) suggestion and profiled H2AK119ub1, RING1B, RYBP, and SUZ12 in the presence and absence of RYBP/YAF2 at TSS ± 5kb clustered based on the presence of RING1B and the relative levels of RYBP (vPRC1) and CBX7 (cPRC1). This revealed a set of “shared” sites, with high levels of vPRC1 and cPRC1, and “variant-enriched” sites, which exhibited lower levels of CBX7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2A</xref>). In contrast to previous work (Morey et al., 2013) we failed to identify cPRC1 (CBX7)-enriched sites that lack vPRC1 (RYBP). Initially this was puzzling to us, but a closer inspection of the genes that were previously reported to lack RYBP yet have CBX7 binding ((Morey et al., 2013) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) revealed a clear enrichment for RYBP in our experiments and this signal was lost in response to tamoxifen-induced removal of RBYP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 3</xref>). The differences in RYBP ChIP enrichment between our studies is presumably the result of differing ChIP protocols (e.g. formaldehyde only crosslinking (Morey et al) versus formaldehyde/EGS crosslinking (our study)). Nevertheless, it is clear that CBX7 occupied sites fall into the shared category that are also occupied by RYBP. In the revised manuscript, we now highlight this important point (subsection “RYBP-dependent stimulation is essential for H2AK119ub1 at sites with low PRC1 occupancy”). Intriguingly, we observed that both shared and variant-enriched PcG TSS appeared to be similarly affected in their reductions of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2A</xref>), and we did not observe any obvious changes in RING1B or SUZ12 occupancy at either group. However, a visual examination of polycomb domains and their associated genes indicated that the use of a simple fixed window surrounding the TSS would not likely capture the behaviour of the entire domain, particularly when considering H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 which are often broad in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2B</xref>). Therefore, we instead opted to use a clustering and heat mapping approach focused on H2AK119ub1 intervals. This revealed that although all polycomb target sites experience reductions in H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3, variant-enriched sites showed a slightly larger reduction in both of these modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We have now incorporated these analyses and interpretations into the revised Figures and manuscript highlighting the preferential contribution of RYBP towards vPRC1-enriched sites and described these observations on in the revised manuscript.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18591.025</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>TSS clustering and heatmap analysis of variant and canonical PRC1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Non-redundant mm10 refGene TSSs (n=20634) were clustered into Polycomb (PcG) or non-PcG TSS.

Our RYBP ChIP-seq data (complete with RYBP knockout control (OHT)), clearly shows enrichment for RYBP at these genes.

This analysis showed that upregulated genes fell roughly into both categories. We have now indicated this in the text of the revised manuscript in subsection “Loss of RYBP culminates in gene reactivation at sites where Polycomb chromatin domains are compromised” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>They should provide ChIP-qPCRs of Suz12, H3K27me3 and Ring1b at a representative set of these gene promoters.</italic> </p><p>As requested, we have performed new ChIP-qPCRs for RING1B, SUZ12, H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub1 in biological triplicate at a set of representative genes that are up-regulated upon loss of RYBP/YAF2. The results of these analyses further support the contention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) that up-regulated genes tended to have compromised polycomb domains, as evidenced by reductions in RING1B and SUZ12 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> reconstituted histone H2A ubiquitination assays are used in which different recombinant PRC1 assemblages are compared by titrating increasing amounts of enzyme with a fixed substrate and the% conversion at the end of the reaction is determined. The correct way to compare enzymatic activities is to determine reaction rates. I.e. measure conversion over time using a fixed amount of enzyme and substrate! This experiment should be included for a few key complexes.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct in noting this experimental setup does not conform to Michaelis-Menten analysis of reaction rates. This was a deliberate decision that we made in designing these experiments and we will explain why in more detail here. Currently, the only method we have found to easily measure PRC1 activity in vitro is to follow the conversion of H2A to ubiquitylated H2A by western blot. As indicated by the reviewer, to set up an experiment to measure classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, one must (a) have substrate in large excess over enzyme, and (b) vary substrate amount relative to fixed enzyme concentration. In the available experimental set-up, western blot analysis has not proven sensitive enough to robustly detect conversion of H2A to uH2A at low substrate concentrations, effectively excluding Michaelis-Menten analysis. Furthermore, the analysis of Michaelis-Menten kinetics in the multi-reaction ubiquitylation cascade (E1, E2, and E3) necessary to achieve uH2A would be extremely challenging to design and to interpret correctly. To our knowledge this has not previously been achieved for histone ubiquitylation reaction cascades. Therefore we chose to employ a dose-response approach in order to measure and compare the relative E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of different PRC1 complex assemblies by following percentage conversion of a fixed amount of substrate. In fact, similar approaches have previously been used to compare the relative activities of PRC1 complexes (Gao et al., 2012, Tavares et al., 2012, Buchwald et al., 2006, Cao et al., 2005, Li et al., 2006), enabling us to broadly compare our new findings with previous work in this area. Nevertheless, to avoid any confusion we have now clarified this point in the text of manuscript and explicitly indicate that we are comparing relative activities as opposed to reaction rates in the Results section.</p><p><italic>Another critical issue is that the ratio enzyme vs substrate (nucleosomes) is not clear. It is essential that the substrate is in excess over the enzyme (this should be shown).</italic> </p><p>As noted above, this point is particularly relevant in situations where Michaelis-Menten-type kinetic analyses are being conducted, which we have not attempted to do here. However, we realise that in the initial submission the concentration of nucleosome in ubiquitylation reactions was inadvertently omitted. We have now added this information to the Materials and methods in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Finally, a better analysis of the nucleosomes used in the assays need to be provided. E.g. are there free histones in the prep? An additional nucleosome purification step (e.g. glycerol centrifugation or size exclusion chromatography) would give more confidence. This is also important because the results in this manuscript are at odds with published work from other groups (e.g. Gao et al. 2012; Tavares et al., 2012).</italic></p><p>Octamers were purified by gel filtration and displayed the expected equimolar ratio of histones. In the nucleosome reconstitutions, DNA was always in slight excess over octamer, and tris-borate native agarose gels used to examine the reconstituted nucleosomes indicated that only a small proportion of unincorporated DNA was present relative to nucleosomal DNA. This suggests a near complete incorporation of octamers into nucleosomes under our reconstitution conditions as we have previously published (Zhou et al., 2012). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that PRC1 is highly specific towards H2A in the context of nucleosomes, and any non-specific activity on free histone results in polyubiquitylation (Elderkin et al., 2007), which would not be detected in our western blotting measurements of H2AK119ub1. Finally we do not believe that the results of our in vitro assays are at odds with either of the studies mentioned by the reviewer. In Gao et al., it was also demonstrated that RYBP stimulates the activity of a PCGF4-containing complex (see (Gao et al., 2012) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), which is in agreement with our observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. In Tavares et al., the influence of RYBP on catalytic activity of PRC1 was tested using a PCGF2-containing complex, which we did not directly examine in our study.</p><p><italic>Finally, subsection “PCGF1-PRC1 is a highly modular protein complex” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. It appears that the absence of RYBP leads to consistently reduced levels of PCGF1 (lanes 4 to 6) and possibly a slight reduction in BCOR (lane 5). This suggests that RYBP may help to stabilize these interactions. Quantitation of this blot should be performed and these result discussed in the text.</italic> </p><p>We have now quantified PCGF1 in the indicated complex preparations and find the levels are reduced in the absence of RYBP as suggested by the reviewer. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out as we believe it further supports the observations from crosslinking mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>) that RYBP inclusion in the complex may lead to structural alterations that limit the self-association of RING1B, possibly helping to support a stable and enzymatically competent PRC1 complex. We have now included the quantification of these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and described this interesting observation in the text (subsection “RYBP-dependent stimulation of PCGF1-PRC1 is associated with changes in the PCGF1-RING1B dimer but not with ubiquitin binding”). Importantly, however, the reduced level of PCGF1 does not explain activity differences between complexes, as complexes that contain RYBP simulate the relative activity of PRC1 to a much larger extent than can be explained by elevated PCGF1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>) and both RYBP and YAF2 also significantly stimulate the activity of pre-existing RING1B/PCGF1 assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further structural work in the future will be imperative to understand the nature of this RYBP dependent stimulation.</p><p><italic>6) The Introduction, and actually most of the manuscript, does not give a clear overview of what has already been published on this topic.

Unfortunately, from our current study we can infer very little about non-catalytic functions of PRC1, with the exception that gene expression changes appear to be more closely linked to reductions in the occupancy of PRC1/PRC2, not simply reductions H2AK119ub1/H3K27me3.
