FRET has the potential to measure conformational dynamics in vitro and in intact cells, but technical barriers have thus far limited its accuracy, particularly in membrane proteins. Here, we combine amber codon suppression to introduce a donor fluorescent noncanonical amino acid with a new, biocompatible approach for labeling proteins with acceptor transition metals in a method called ACCuRET (Anap Cyclen-Cu<sup>2+</sup> resonance energy transfer). We show that ACCuRET measures absolute distances and distance changes with high precision and accuracy using maltose binding protein as a benchmark. Using cell unroofing, we show that ACCuRET can accurately measure rearrangements of proteins in native membranes. Finally, we implement a computational method for correcting the measured distances for the distance distributions observed in proteins. ACCuRET thus provides a flexible, powerful method for measuring conformational dynamics in both soluble proteins and membrane proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>MBP</kwd><kwd>protein dynamics</kwd><kwd>noncanonical amino acid</kwd><kwd>transition metal</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY017564</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Sharona E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM125351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Sharona E</given-names></name><name><surname>Zagotta</surname><given-names>William N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM100718</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Sharona E</given-names></name><name><surname>Zagotta</surname><given-names>William N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10RR025429</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Sharona E</given-names></name><name><surname>Zagotta</surname><given-names>William N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30EY001730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Sharona E</given-names></name><name><surname>Zagotta</surname><given-names>William N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30DK017047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Sharona E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH102378</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zagotta</surname><given-names>William N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY010329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zagotta</surname><given-names>William N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ACCuRET is a flexible new method for measuring the structural dynamics of proteins in solution and membrane proteins in their native environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Structural dynamics of proteins, particularly those at cell membranes, underlie many cell-signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Henzler-Wildman and Kern, 2007</xref>). Structural rearrangements in membrane proteins can occur in response to binding of extracellular or intracellular ligands, covalent modification (e.g. phosphorylation), changes in membrane voltage, and mechanical forces in the membrane. These rearrangements, in turn, regulate enzyme activity, open pores, and transport molecules across the membrane. In this way, membrane proteins serve as molecular transducers that mediate the communication and transport between the cell and the external world. The molecular mechanisms, however, for these transduction processes remain largely unknown.</p><p>The number of solved membrane protein structures has grown exponentially in the last 30 years, and there are now more than 750 unique structures in the protein structure database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stephen White Laboratory, 1998</xref>). These structures provide high-resolution information on the position of each atom in the protein, but provide little information about the functional states, number of states, relative energies of the states, or allowed transitions. In contrast, functional measurements like electrophysiology provide high-resolution information on states and energetics, but little information on structure. In addition, electrophysiology gives an excellent readout on rearrangements in the pore domain but is a poor surrogate for probing structural rearrangements and energetics in other regions, for example agonist/antagonist binding sites. This state of affairs has left a gap in our ability to link structure and function, as we often do not know the functional state for a particular structure or the structural state(s) that underlie a particular function.</p><p>To fill this gap, a method is needed that allows us to measure the structural dynamics and energetics of membrane proteins, preferably in their native membrane environment. Many of the existing methods for measuring structural dynamics have limitations. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have greatly facilitated the measurement of multiple protein conformations, often in the same sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng, 2015</xref>). However, these conformational states can only be distinguished if they have substantial structural differences, and their functional state and energetics are still unknown. Magnetic resonance methods have proven useful for measuring structural dynamics but require high concentrations of purified protein, a particular challenge for membrane proteins. Finally, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) provides a sparse measurement of protein structure and can be recorded on a biological time scale (milliseconds to seconds) on small quantities of protein (even single molecules) in their native environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taraska and Zagotta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stryer and Haugland, 1967</xref>). Standard FRET, however, suffers from nonspecific labeling, inappropriate distance range for intramolecular measurements, and inaccurate measurements of distances and distance changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Best et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schuler et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our goal was to establish and optimize a method for measuring and analyzing the structural dynamics of membrane proteins in their native membrane environment. Our approach, which we call ACCuRET (<italic>A</italic>nap <italic>C</italic>yclen<italic>-Cu</italic><sup>2+</sup><italic>R</italic>esonance <italic>E</italic>nergy <italic>T</italic>ransfer), combines together three technologies: (1) transition metal ion FRET (tmFRET) for accurately measuring interatomic distances, (2) amber codon suppression to specifically label the protein with a fluorescent, noncanonical amino acid as the FRET donor, and (3) a novel orthogonal and biocompatible method for introducing a specific, a high-affinity binding site for a metal ion that serves as the FRET acceptor.</p><p>To measure interatomic distances, we have used tmFRET between a fluorophore and a transition metal divalent cation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taraska et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taraska et al., 2009b</xref>). Transition metal cations, such as Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, and Cu<sup>2+</sup>, act as non-fluorescent FRET acceptors, quenching the fluorescence of donor fluorophores with an efficiency that is highly distance dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horrocks et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Latt et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Richmond et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sandtner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Latt et al., 1970</xref>). Thus, tmFRET provides a sparse, dynamic measurement of structure on minute amounts of functioning proteins in their native environment. tmFRET has a number of significant advantages over standard FRET methods for measuring rearrangements in proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taraska and Zagotta, 2010</xref>). (1) tmFRET has a working range of about 10–20 Å, much shorter than standard FRET, and on the order of the distance between proximal structural elements in proteins. (2) tmFRET is steeply distance dependent, but has little orientation dependence because the metal ion has multiple transition dipole moments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Selvin, 2002</xref>). (3) The method utilizes minimal metal binding sites, making the position of the metal a more faithful representation of the position of the protein backbone. (4) Metal binding is rapid and reversible so the fraction of fluorescence quenched at a saturating concentration of metal gives the absolute FRET efficiency and therefore the distance. And (5) metals with different R<sub>0</sub> values (distance producing 50% FRET efficiency) can be chosen to tune the measurement to the distance of interest.</p><p>The power of using fluorescence to probe protein dynamics within the cell is limited by the specificity with which a protein can be labeled with a fluorophore. For measuring the structure and dynamics of a protein, it is also important to use a small fluorophore attached to the protein with a short linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taraska and Zagotta, 2010</xref>). To achieve this specific fluorescent labeling with a small fluorophore, we used amber codon suppression to introduce the fluorescent, noncanonical amino acid L-Anap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). We chose L-Anap, a derivative of prodan, because of its small size (about the same as the amino acid tryptophan) and useful spectral properties. By introducing a fluorophore as the side-chain of an amino acid, we eliminated the need for a linker whose distance from the protein backbone and flexibility reduces the accuracy and empirical sensitivity of FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Best et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schuler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taraska et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sobakinskaya et al., 2018</xref>). L-Anap is therefore useful as a tmFRET donor for distance measurements.</p><p>Membrane proteins are fully functional only in their native membrane environment. For many membrane proteins, studying the relevant structural rearrangements demands access to the cytoplasmic side of the protein for introduction of ligands, probes, etc. To study membrane proteins, we have recently implemented cell unroofing, an approach borrowed from the EM literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heuser, 2000</xref>), as a medium-throughput platform for measuring tmFRET from membrane proteins in native cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gordon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zagotta et al., 2016</xref>). This technique utilizes a mechanical shearing force to dislodge the dorsal surfaces of cells and remove all soluble cellular contents and organelles, leaving the ventral surfaces of the cells intact as plasma membrane sheets containing their native lipids and membrane proteins. Cell unroofing provides access to the intracellular surface of the bilayer for application of transition metals and intracellular ligands in an environment more physiological than membrane proteins reconstituted into synthetic liposomes and much higher throughput than inside-out patch-clamp recording.</p><p>Previous studies using FRET on membrane proteins have produced uncertain results about the size of structural rearrangements, often underestimating changes in distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taraska and Zagotta, 2010</xref>). Here, we validate our tmFRET approach using maltose-binding protein (MBP) as a model system. MBP is a bacterial periplasmic protein that undergoes a significant structural rearrangement upon binding maltose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The structure and rearrangement of MBP has been extremely well characterized, with over 260 structures in the protein structure database to date, both with and without ligands bound. Using both soluble and membrane-bound forms of MBP, we have determined the precision and accuracy of ACCuRET for measuring intramolecular distances and changes in distance due to ligand binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Using MBP we show that: (1) ACCuRET provides an accurate measurement of intramolecular distances between 10 and 20 Å; (2) ACCuRET measures small changes in distance; (3) L-Anap can be introduced efficiently and specifically into proteins; (4) minimal metal binding sites can be introduced using a small, reversible cysteine reactive metal chelate; and (5) similar ACCuRET measurements can be made in membrane proteins in unroofed cells. These experiments establish this approach as a powerful method to measure the structural dynamics of membrane proteins.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37248.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MBP as a model system for optimizing and validating ACCuRET.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) X-ray crystal structure of MBP bound to maltose (PDB ID: 1N3X) showing the positions of the donor and acceptor FRET pairs at the top (295 and 237, respectively) and bottom (322 and 309, respectively) of the clamshell, with the distance represented by dashed lines.

In addition, maltose binding leads to a smaller opening of the backside of the clamshell. By introducing one FRET pair at the top of the clamshell and a second FRET pair on the backside of the clamshell, we can address the accuracy and precision of ACCuRET to measure absolute distances as well as ligand-dependent increases and decreases in distance.</p><p>Our criteria for selection of FRET pairs were (1) the sites are solvent exposed, (2) the sites are on rigid secondary structural elements (α helices in MBP), (3) the distance between the sites is predicted to fall in the working range of tmFRET (~10–20 Å), and (4) the distance between sites undergoes a moderate change between apo and holo MBP.

MBP-Anap was the primary band visible in gels of crude cell lysates using in-gel L-Anap fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that L-Anap was not appreciably incorporated at other amber codon-containing sites. In addition, Western blots of FLAG-MBP containing the K295TAG or E322TAG mutation revealed full-length MBP only when the cells were incubated with L-Anap-ME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). However, even when L-Anap was present in the medium, a moderate amount of truncated product, in which translation terminated at the introduced stop codon, was observed for both MBP-295TAG and MBP-322TAG, as shown by the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref> (fraction of full-length MBP was 30% and 10%, respectively). These results indicate that L-Anap incorporation at positions 295 and 322 in MBP in HEK293T/17 cells was specific, but not particularly efficient.</p><p>To increase the efficiency of L-Anap incorporation, we co-expressed the MBP-TAG and pAnap plasmids with a third plasmid encoding a dominant negative form of eukaryotic Release Factor 1 (DN-eRF1). Previously, Jason Chin’s group showed that DN-eRF1 increases the efficiency of incorporation of noncanonical amino acids in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schmied et al., 2014</xref>), presumably by delaying release of the translation product from the ribosome when encountering an amber stop codon. For both sites in MBP, coexpression with DN-eRF1 substantially increased the fraction of full-length product from cells incubated with L-Anap-ME (from 30% to 86% for MBP-295TAG and from 10% to 79% for MBP-322TAG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Coexpression with DN-eRF1 also increased the absolute amount of full-length protein relative to that observed with wild-type MBP, from 1.6% (±0.4%; n = 3) to 6.3% (±0.5%; n = 3) for MBP-295TAG and from 5.5% (±4%; n = 3) to 50% (±27%; n = 3) for MBP-322TAG. We observed little or no read-through (i.e. incorporation of a natural amino acid at the stop codon), even when co-expressing DN-eRF1, as little full length MBP-TAG protein was observed when L-Anap was omitted from the cell growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). These results establish a method for achieving specific, high-efficiency fluorescent labeling of MBP for ACCuRET experiments.</p><p>L-Anap’s small size, short linker, and spectral properties makes it useful for tmFRET experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zagotta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zagotta, 2017</xref>). The peak absorption wavelength of L-Anap is 360 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>). The emission of L-Anap is environmentally sensitive, blue shifting as the environment becomes less polar. The emission peak of L-Anap was 494 nm in our buffer and 475 nm in ethanol (see Materials and methods, Figure 13B). For the MBP-295Anap and MBP-322Anap in this study, the peak emissions were 491 nm and 478 nm, respectively (Figure 13A), suggesting that neither 295Anap nor 322Anap is fully solvent exposed and that the environment of 322Anap is more hydrophobic than that of 295Anap. We found that the quantum yield of L-Anap was also site dependent, measured to be 0.31 for MBP-295Anap and 0.47 for MBP-322Anap (see Materials and methods and Figure 13C). L-Anap’s low quantum yield, together with its low extinction coefficient (~20×10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zagotta et al., 2016</xref>]), makes L-Anap relatively dim compared to most visible light fluorophores; however, its fluorescence intensity is sufficient for most macroscopic fluorescence experiments. L-Anap’s emission spectrum overlaps the absorption spectra of many transition metal ions (such as Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, and Cu<sup>2+</sup>) making it a useful FRET donor for tmFRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37248.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Incorporation of transition metal ions as the FRET acceptor using standard HH sites and TETAC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram illustrating tmFRET between L-Anap (left) and transition metal (right) for two different types of metal-binding sites: a standard HH site (top) and TETAC site (bottom).

TETAC is a cysteine-reactive compound with a short linker to a cyclen ring that binds transition metal ions with very high-affinity (sub-nanomolar; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kodama and Kimura, 1977</xref>]). Single cysteines can then be introduced in the protein at sites of interest and reacted with TETAC to create a mixed disulfide linkage to a cyclen metal-binding site.</p><p>ACCuRET uses TETAC to introduce minimal metal binding sites. TETAC has many advantages compared with standard HH sites for tmFRET: (1) it requires only nominal concentrations of free Cu<sup>2+</sup> eliminating off-target binding of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to endogenous binding sites on the protein; (2) it can be used with any type of secondary structural element; (3) its reaction with endogenous cysteines produces tmFRET only for sites that are very close (&lt;20 Å), so endogenous cysteines need not be eliminated; (4) it can be easily removed with reducing agent, making its use compatible with physiological concentrations of other metals, for example Ca<sup>2+</sup>; and (5) it significantly blue shifts and increases the absorbance of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, extending the range of R<sub>0</sub> values available for tmFRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, the distance dependence of the FRET efficiency predicted by the Förster equation for each of our two L-Anap sites in MBP is shifter by almost 4 Å to longer distances for Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC compared to Cu<sup>2+</sup>-HH. ACCuRET, therefore, offers a flexible and biocompatible method for measuring distances in the biological distance range.</p><p>For each of our two FRET pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we made three constructs: one with no metal-binding site, one with a standard HH-binding site, and one with a Cys, for modification by TETAC.

For MBP-322Anap, the HH was introduced at positions 305 and 309 (MBP-322Anap-HH) and the Cys was introduced at position 309 (MBP-322Anap-C). For both donor sites, control constructs were also made with no introduced metal-binding sites (MBP-295Anap and MBP-322Anap) to measure other forms of energy transfer and nonspecific decreases in fluorescence, and correct the FRET efficiency measurements accordingly (see Materials and methods). These constructs were all expressed in HEK293T/17 cells as amino-terminal FLAG fusions and purified using anti-FLAG beads for subsequent analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ACCuRET measures FRET and ligand-dependent changes in FRET</title><p>ACCuRET was readily observed in both MBP-Anap-C constructs.

These constructs exhibited FRET efficiencies expected for the maltose-bound states, and did not exhibit the maltose-dependent changes in tmFRET even after extensive washing and ion exchange chromatography (data not shown). Therefore, in all the MBP constructs in this paper we introduced a mutation into the maltose-binding site (W340A) that has previously been shown to reduce the maltose affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martineau et al., 1990</xref>).

Other sources of energy transfer (e.g. solution quenching and off-target metal binding) and nonspecific decreases in fluorescence (e.g. bleaching and loss of protein) can confound calculations of FRET efficiency. The extent of this background quenching can be determined using constructs without an introduced metal-binding site and the FRET efficiencies corrected for as described in Materials and methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taraska et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zagotta, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Puljung and Zagotta, 2013</xref>).</p><p>From the FRET efficiencies, we calculated the distances between the donors and acceptors using the Förster equation <italic>r</italic> = <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>(1/<italic>E</italic>− 1)<sup>1/6</sup> where <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> is the distance producing 50% FRET efficiency.

Compared to soluble proteins, membrane proteins typically express at much lower levels, are difficult to purify in their native state, and often require their native membrane environment to exhibit physiological structural and functional properties. ACCuRET is well suited to address these challenges because it leverages the exquisite sensitivity of fluorescence measurements, the efficient incorporation of L-Anap into proteins in mammalian cells, the ability to work on unpurified proteins, and the ability to record from proteins in their native membranes. We therefore set out to validate and optimize ACCuRET for measuring conformational dynamics of proteins in the membrane.</p><p>To record fluorescence from native membranes we utilized a method called cell unroofing.

Our approach to reduce this effect has been to minimize these linkers by using a fluorescent amino acid and minimal metal binding sites closely associate with the backbone (HH or TETAC). Still, we observed a small, systematic bias in our tmFRET measurements where the distances greater than <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> have somewhat greater FRET efficiency and the distances less than <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> have somewhat lower FRET efficiency than predicted by the Förster equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>).

For the donor fluorophore, ACCuRET utilizes a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid, L-Anap, site-specifically incorporated into the protein using amber codon suppression. Orthogonal labeling with metal acceptor was achieved by modifying an introduced cysteine with Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC. Using MBP as a benchmark, we show that ACCuRET accurately measures absolute distances and changes in distance that faithfully represent the backbone dynamics underlying function in soluble and membrane proteins. Measurements of distance display an RMSD of 1.5–2.9 Å between our experimentally determine distances and the X-ray crystal structures. These experiments validate ACCuRET as a powerful new method for measuring structural dynamics of proteins in their native environment.</p><p>The noncanonical amino acid L-Anap has been previously used to label membrane proteins. However, most of these studies focused on state-dependent changes in fluorescence due to the environmentally-sensitive emission of L-Anap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zagotta, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sakata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wulf and Pless, 2018</xref>). L-Anap has also been recently used as a FRET donor in studies to discern movement in ion channels between domains or between the channel and the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zagotta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zagotta, 2017</xref>). Although these studies demonstrated the potential power of using L-Anap as a donor for tmFRET, the distances and distance changes measured were difficult to interpret, given the limited structures available. By using MBP as a benchmark, we have been able to assess the accuracy of tmFRET for measurements of distances and changes in distance.</p><p>The use of amber codon suppression to introduce noncanonical amino acids has become more common in prokaryotic expression systems, but has been limited in eukaryotic expression systems by the much poorer efficiency of incorporation observed. We found that cotransfection of a plasmid encoding our TAG-containing MBP with one encoding the DN-eRF1 was critical in achieving sufficiently high levels of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schmied et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to increasing the total amount of protein, DN-eRF1 also enhanced the fraction of the protein that was full-length without significant incorporation of natural amino acids at the amber codon site. Furthermore, in-gel fluorescence showed that, when L-Anap is present in the medium, MBP-Anap is the only major protein species observed. Thus, DN-eRF1 extends the power of amber codon suppression to mammalian cells and is particularly useful for eukaryotic membrane proteins that typically cannot be expressed in bacteria.</p><p>ACCuRET uses a novel metal-labeling strategy for tmFRET that is complementary, and in some ways superior to, the standard method of labeling via HH sites. Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC has previously been used in paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) and DEER experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunningham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sengupta et al., 2015</xref>). The DEER experiments showed that it has a narrow inter-label distance distribution, very similar to that of the widely used spin label MSL and much narrower than MTS-EDTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunningham et al., 2015</xref>). TETAC labels cysteines in any secondary structure and has a subnanomolar affinity for Cu<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kodama and Kimura, 1977</xref>), allowing ACCuRET to be implemented in a wider variety of conditions. Native cysteines are mostly compatible with the use of TETAC. Only native cysteines within ~20 Å of the L-Anap, or for which modification produces functional effects, are problematic. Such native cysteines can easily be identified using the control construct without the introduced cysteine, and only those that are problematic need be mutated. Because the affinity of Cu<sup>2+</sup> for TETAC is so high, Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC can be rinsed from the bath solution prior to imaging unroofed cells, allowing measurements to be made in the absence of free Cu<sup>2+</sup>. Labeling with Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC can be reversed with a reducing agent such as DTT, obviating the need for a metal chelator such as EDTA that can strip off endogenous metals and divalent ions. Although we expected the position of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to be less constrained when bound to TETAC compared to HH, our distance measurements were as accurate for Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC as for Cu<sup>2+</sup>-HH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Finally, binding to the cyclen ring of TETAC increases the absorption of Cu<sup>2+</sup> and blue shifts the peak of its spectrum relative to Cu<sup>2+</sup>-HH by 20 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), giving Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC an R<sub>0</sub> value almost 4 Å longer than Cu<sup>2+</sup> bound to HH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This longer R<sub>0</sub> value increases the range of distance measurements that can be accurately measured with tmFRET.</p><p>Previously, the same donor/acceptor sites on MBP we use here have been studied with tmFRET using standard methods of labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). At the donor site, the fluorophore fluorescein-5-maleimide or monobromobimane was reacted with an introduced cysteine, and, at the acceptor site, Cu<sup>2+</sup> or Ni<sup>2+</sup> was bound to a HH site. For the same donor/acceptor sites, our measurements of distances and changes in distance with ACCuRET were comparable with the measurements made using bimane as the donor, but more accurate than the measurements made using fluorescein as the donor, emphasizing the need for small donor fluorophores with short linkers. Importantly, however, these previous experiments required the use of purified protein with no native cysteines or metal-binding sites. By employing a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid as the donor, ACCuRET can be performed on unpurified protein in its native environment with most or all of the native cysteines and weak metal-binding sites left intact.</p><p>The dearth of approaches for studying conformational dynamics of proteins in their native environment makes ACCuRET especially valuable for studies of membrane proteins such as ion channels and transporters. We therefore compared ACCuRET in membrane-bound MBP in unroofed cells to soluble, affinity-purified MBP. Overall, the distance measurements in the membrane-bound MBP were similar to those in soluble MBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We observed, however, a trend toward slightly lower FRET efficiency for membrane-bound MBP than observed with soluble MBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). The most likely explanation for this difference, which translated into ~2–3 Å increase in distance for our measurements in membrane-bound MBP compared to soluble MBP, is that our background subtraction method (see Materials and methods) did not fully account for all the L-Anap-dependent background signal. One potential source of L-Anap-dependent background that would lead us to under-estimate FRET efficiency is incomplete labeling with the acceptor transition metal. This could occur if, for example, oxidation or post-translational modification of the introduced cysteine prevented it from reacting with TETAC. A number of our results indicate this was not, however, a concern. We observed very similar distances with Cu<sup>2+</sup> bound to HH sites and Cu<sup>2+</sup> bound to TETAC, indicating that the Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC reaction with cysteines was as efficient as Cu<sup>2+</sup> binding to HH sites. We also measured the reaction kinetics of Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC at each site to ensure the reaction had gone to completion. Finally, Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC quenched &gt;80% of L-Anap fluorescence in MBP-295Anap-C in the presence of maltose, and the remaining fluoresacence signal is what is expected from the known donor-acceptor distance and the R<sub>0</sub> of the FRET pair. Determining the remaining source of background fluorescence and developing better corrections will further improve the accuracy of ACCuRET for membrane proteins and, perhaps, proteins in intact cells.</p><p>ACCuRET mitigates a number of limitations that have hampered measurements of FRET efficiencies and calculations of absolute distances. Because ACCuRET measures L-Anap fluorescence in the absence and presence of the acceptor for both the apo and ligand-bound states, it accounts for any ligand-dependent changes in environment that would otherwise affect the calculation of FRET efficiency. Our measurements of the emission spectra of L-Anap incorporated at the two sites in MBP allowed us to use the R<sub>0</sub> determined for each site in our calculations of distance. The difference in R<sub>0</sub> between MBP-295Anap (17.7 Å) and MBP-322Anap (16.5 Å), however, was small and would not have substantially affected our estimates of distances or changes in distance. The difference in quantum yield between our two sites (MBP-295Anap:0.31 and MBP-322Anap:0.47) is larger than generally observed for the state-dependent changes in fluorescence at any given site, suggesting that state-dependent changes in R<sub>0</sub> are not usually a concern.</p><p>Experimental limitations that could compromise the accuracy of distance determinations include: a broad distance distribution between donor and acceptor; measuring distances (<italic>r</italic>) outside the range of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.5</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mn>1.5</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>); nonspecific labeling with the donor; incomplete labeling with the acceptor; and unexpected sources of background fluorescence. ACCuRET mostly overcomes these limitations. Using small probes with short linkers narrows the distance distribution, and FCG analysis improves distance determinations for distributed distances. The increase in absorption of Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC, and the corresponding increase in R<sub>0</sub> values, expands the utility of tmFRET over a broader distance range. Using amber codon suppression to introduce the donor substantially reduces nonspecific labeling with donor compared to using cysteine-reactive donors for labeling. Using a slight excess of Cu<sup>2+</sup> with TETAC minimizes incomplete labeling with the acceptor. As discussed above, unexpected sources of background fluorescence appear to reduce the accuracy of distance measured for membrane-bound MBP, but this effect was small in our experiments.</p><p>The distance dependence of FRET is, in practice, less steep than predicted by the Förster equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). This is at least partly explained by the idealized assumption of the Förster equation that relative distances between donors and acceptors are homogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Best et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schuler et al., 2005</xref>). In fact, proteins have been shown to exhibit significant heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frauenfelder et al., 1991</xref>), with distances between side-chains well described by normal distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeschke, 2012</xref>). Convolving the Förster equation with Gaussian distance distributions (FCS analysis) gives distance-dependence curves that are less steep than the Förster equation itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). From DEER studies, the distribution of distances between Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions bound to TETAC were well described by Gaussian distributions with FWHM values ranging from 6 to 9 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunningham et al., 2015</xref>). We used FCG analysis to convert FRET efficiencies to distances. These distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, asterisks calculated using FWHM = 8 Å) more closely match the donor-acceptor distances, as well as the maltose-induced distance changes, determined from the Cβ-Cβ values from X-ray crystal structures. Although we did not measure the distributions of donor-acceptor distance in our experiments, it seems clear that assuming a distribution of distances in the range found in the literature is a better assumption than assuming a fixed distance.</p><p>In summary, these experiments establish a new method called ACCuRET for measuring structural dynamics of proteins in their native environment, particularly membrane proteins. The method can measure distances with an accuracy of 1.5–2.9 Å and has the potential to measure structural dynamics on a time scale of milliseconds. For ion channels and transporters, ACCuRET can also be combined with patch-clamp fluorometry (PCF) to measure protein structure and function simultaneously. Although we used the unnatural amino acid L-Anap, our approach could employ fluorophores introduced with other unnatural amino acids (perhaps called unACCuRET). Ultimately, better fluorophores will enable tmFRET measurements with faster time resolution and single-molecule sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T/17</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC: CRL-11268; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1926">CVCL_1926</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pANAP</td><td>Addgene: DOI: 10.1021/ja4059553</td><td>Addgene: 48696;</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>DN-eRF1 <break/>(peRF1-E55D.pcDNA5-FRT)</td><td>Jason Chin: DOI: 10.1021/ja5069728</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs, cell culture, and transfection</title><p>All constructs were made in the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), except as noted below. The amino acid sequence of MBP was based on the pMAL-c5x vector (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), and was codon optimized for mammalian cell expression. To reduce the affinity of MBP for endogenous ligands and allow subsequent testing of maltose binding, we introduced a point mutation, W340A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martineau et al., 1990</xref>), in all constructs.

For each stop codon, three constructs were produced: no metal-binding site, a di-histidine, and a cysteine. For MBP-295TAG, the di-histidines were introduced at positions 233 and 237 (MBP-295TAG-HH), and the cysteine was introduced at position 237 (MBP-295TAG-C).

Aliquots of the originally expanded stock were used for no more than 8 years, at which point a new stock was purchased. No additional authentication was performed.

Between 0.25 to 0.5 mL of a 200 ng/mL solution of FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in SBT was added to the rinsed beads, which were then nutated at 4°C for between 90 min and 12 hr to elute the protein. The purified protein was harvested by spinning the beads and collecting the supernatant.

Cleared cell lysates were then were run on NuPage 10% bis-tris gels (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with MOPS SDS running buffer (50 mM MOPS, 50 mM Tris, 3.5 mM SDS and 1 mM EDTA).

Anti-FLAG primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Cat F3165, St. Louis, MO) was used at a dilution of 1:20,000 and secondary antibody (Amersham Cat NA931, Pittsburgh, PA) HRP-linked anti mouse IgG was used at 1:30,000 dilution in TBS-T. Secondary antibodies were visualized with Super Signal West Femto Substrate (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) and imaged with a Proteinsimple gel imager (San Jose, CA). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). Regions of interest were drawn around each band and paired with adjacent background regions of the same size. The mean gray value within each background region was subtracted from the mean gray value within its corresponding band. We attempted to achieve similar intensities for wild-type and L-Anap incorporating MBP by loading different amounts of lysate for the different constructs. In all cases, the dilution of samples was taking into account after densitometry to allow comparisons to be made among lanes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Fluorometry and spectrophotometry</title><p>Starna (Atascadero, CA) sub-micro fluorometer cells (100 µL) were used for both fluorometry and spectrophotometry. Fluorometry experiments were performed using a Jobin Yvon Horiba FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer (Edison, NJ). For emission spectra of L-Anap, we used an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and 5 nm slits for excitation and emission, except for experiments to measure quantum yield in which 1 nm slits were used. For time course measurements, we excited samples at 370 nm and recorded the emission at 480 nm every 10 s using anti-photobleaching mode of the instrument. Reagents (transition metals, Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC, and DTT) were added manually as 100x stocks during the interval between measurements by pipetting up and down in the cuvette without removing it from the instrument.</p><p>Protein samples were diluted 1:10 to 1:200 in SBT to keep the fluorescence intensity within the linear range of the spectrofluorometer. We found that it was essential to use Tris buffered solutions for experiments with Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC, as Cu<sup>2+</sup> appeared to precipitate in HEPES-based solutions (data not shown). Transition metal ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup>) were prepared from sulfate (CuSO<sub>4</sub>) or chloride (CoCl<sub>2</sub> and NiCl<sub>2</sub>) salts as 100 mM stocks in water or SBT, with stocks of lower concentrations diluted from this stock in SBT. We noted no difference between CuSO<sub>4</sub> and CuCl<sub>2</sub> binding to TETAC, but chose to use CuSO<sub>4</sub>. TETAC (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada) was prepared as a 100 mM stock in DMSO and stored at −20°C until the day of use. The TETAC stock appeared stable over a time scale of months and tolerated multiple freeze-thaw cycles. To prepare Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC, 1 µL each of 100 mM TETAC stock and 110 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> stock were mixed together and allowed to incubate for one minute as the solution turned a deeper shade of blue, reflecting binding of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to the cyclen ring. To this mixture, 98 µL of SBT was added, giving a solution of 1.1 mM Cu<sup>2+</sup> and 1 mM TETAC. The high concentrations in the binding reaction and 10% over-abundance of Cu<sup>2+</sup> ensured that all the TETAC was bound with Cu<sup>2+</sup>. This stock solution was then diluted 1:100 when added to the cuvette for fluorometer experiments, giving a final concentration of 10 µM Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC. Co<sup>2+</sup> did not appear to be compatible with TETAC, eliminating its cysteine reactivity. 1,4-Dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was prepared as a 100 mM stock in water.</p><p>Absorption measurements were made using a Beckman Coulter DU 800 (Brea, CA). To measure the absorption of Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup> bound to HH, we used an α-helical peptide with the following sequence: Ac-ACAAKHAAKHAAAAKA-NH<sub>2</sub>, which was custom synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taraska et al., 2009b</xref>). The peptide was dissolved in SBT to a final concentration of 1 mM. N-ethyl maleimide was prepared as a 200 mM stock in DMSO and added to the peptide solution at a final concentration of 2 mM to prevent the peptide from precipitating upon addition of Cu<sup>2+</sup>. To determine the extinction coefficient of Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC, we measured the absorption spectrum of 2 mM Cu<sup>2+</sup>-cyclen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Calculation of quantum yield</title><p>Because the emission spectrum of L-Anap is sensitive to its environment, we measured the emission spectrum and quantum yield for L-Anap incorporated into each of our two sites in MBP.

Briefly, coverslips were mounted in a homemade chamber on a microscope stage and perfused for several minutes with HBR via gravity-flow perfusion. Poly-lysine solution (0.1 mg/mL 30,000–70,000 MW in PBS) was then added to the chamber and the cells were incubated for 15 s. A 1:3 dilution of SBT was then added to the chamber, and the cells were incubated for 30 s. The solution was then replaced with SBT and the cells immediately exposed to a single pulse from a Branson Sonifier 450 with MicroTip with power = 2 and duty cycle = 50%. Unroofed cells were then perfused with SBT for at least 2 min to remove debris from the chamber before images were collected.</p><p>Experiments were performed using a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope (Melville, NY) and a Nikon CFI Apo TIRF 60x oil immersion objective. Excitation light was provided by a Xenon arc lamp (model Lambda LS, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). For L-Anap excitation we used a 375/28 nm excitation filter and a 480/50 nm emission filter. Each experiment commenced with a pre-bleaching step, comprised of a 7-s exposure of the coverslip to L-Anap excitation light. Pre-bleaching has been previously shown to reduce small, non-specific L-Anap dependent background fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gordon et al., 2016</xref>). Images for analysis were collected using exposures ranging from 100 ms to 500 ms, depending on sample intensity, using a QuantEM EMCCD camera (Photometrics, Tuscon, AZ) with readout speed of 5 MHz and the multiplier set to 20. The illumination and camera settings were the same for all fluorescence images acquired for a given field of view. Different metal concentrations and EDTA were applied via gravity perfusion. Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC and DTT were applied directly to the chamber via a transfer pipette. Five times the chamber volume was added in each case to ensure complete changeover of the solution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Images were imported into ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) for analysis. Regions of interest were drawn by hand to include most of a given cell, but excluding any regions that appeared only partially unroofed, which tended to occur at the cell edges. For each cell, a background region was selected nearby that did not contain cells. The mean gray value of the background region of interest was subtracted from the mean gray value of the region of interest of the corresponding cell. This background subtraction was repeated for each image collected in an experiment using the same regions of interest. The mean and standard error of the mean for the FRET efficiency were calculated as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Distance calculations</title><p>The R<sub>0</sub> values for each L-Anap site paired with each type of bound metal (i.e. Cu<sup>2+</sup> or Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC) were calculated using the measured emission spectrum and quantum yield of L-Anap at each site and the measured absorption spectra for each type of bound metal using the following equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ5"><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mroot><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mroot></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>C</italic> is a scaling factor, <italic>J</italic> is the normalized spectral overlap of the emission of the donor and absorption of the acceptor, <italic>Q</italic> is the quantum yield of L-Anap at the given site (see above), η is the index of refraction (1.33 in our case), and κ<sup>2</sup> is the orientation factor, assumed to be 2/3, a reasonable assumption for an isotropic acceptor (15).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Leon D Islas as Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.

The technique is based in the transition metal (TM) FRET technique developed by the same group. FRET-based methods are very useful, but difficult to apply to measure small distances. TM-FRET is similar to lanthanide-based FRET methods (LRET) in which the orientation dependence of the acceptor is reduced and smaller distances can be resolved. The present technique represents an advance and has the potential to be widely used. The reviewers commend the authors on a thorough approach, with many controls that support the conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewer's main concerns are:</p><p>1) While it is mentioned in the Discussion (eighth paragraph) that the possibility of incomplete labeling with the acceptor metal ion is a limitation, it is difficult to diagnose how incomplete the labeling is in any given experiment. This is quite important, as the transformation of fluorescence to distance rests on the assumption of 100% labeling. If cysteines have been postranslationally modified (e.g. oxidation to sulfinate or sulfonate), or are sterically blocked, they could be unreactive to the copper ligand. As the FRET in unroofed cells was systematically less than with protein in solution, this seems a consideration that should be given more credence. Are there any controls that could assess the degree of incomplete labeling? Perhaps post hoc labeling with a fluorophore or some kind of superquencher could do the trick.</p><p>2) It is not clear what are the measurements used in Figure 12 to argue for the FCG. There are only two positions that were tested with two acceptors, TETAC and HH, that makes at most four points. The figure also combines measurements from soluble and membrane bound MBP. Although the idea behind the correction of the FRET curve taking into account the dynamics is probably correct, I think that to make a strong argument for it, one should make ACCuRET measurements in the same protein from pairs at many positions. The problem is actually more complicated, because one would expect different dynamics (RMSD) for each pair and even different kappa square values.</p><p>3) While the authors suggest that the use of TETAC to modify cysteines should be barely affected by unspecific modification of other (non-interest) cysteines or cysteines located farther than ~20 angstroms from the donor, this is not immediately evident and can be a big problem for membrane proteins, since TETAC will not only modify other proteins but one would expect unspecific binding to the membrane. The authors should at least acknowledge and discuss these potential problems.</p><p>4) Figure 2 describes site-specific labeling with Anap. Described data seem to be incomplete, e.g. it is not clear how the amount of full length protein was quantified; how many samples were analyzed; WB contains no loading control so it is not easy to interpret differences between the lanes (just by looking at panels B and C there is a difference in the level of WT protein), etc.</p><p>- Control for non-specific incorporation of Anap seems to be missing. Have the authors done experiments without tRNA and aa-tRNA-synthetase in the presence of Anap?

However we don’t believe that unreacted cysteines are a likely source of incomplete labeling for the following reasons: 1) we have measured the time course of labeling (in both the fluorometer (Figure 6) and microscope (Figure 10)) and shown that it is at steady state; 2) the labeling of HH with free Cu<sup>2+</sup> gave very similar distance measurements to the labeling of cysteine with Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC (Figure 8); and 3) the quenching in MBP-295C with maltose in the fluorometer was greater than 80%, and the 20% unquenched that remains is expected from the known distance and R<sub>0</sub>. Post-translational modifications of cysteine is not likely to explain the lower FRET seen in unroofed cells as the lower FRET is also observed with free Cu<sup>2+</sup> in HH constructs. It seems more likely it is due to a small amount of background fluorescence in unroofed cells. We now state this more clearly in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear what are the measurements used in Figure 12 to argue for the FCG.

In every case, the FRET efficiency for distances longer than R<sub>0</sub> is larger than the Förster prediction, and the FRET efficiency for distances less than R<sub>0</sub> is smaller than the Förster prediction. This observation, seen previously in other experimental and theoretical FRET studies, is consistent with the nonlinearity of FRET and the known heterogeneity in intramolecular distances in proteins. Here we show that we can largely accounted for this decreased distance dependence use our simple FCG model (Figure 12A colored curves). Our FCG model is not intended to be the ultimate solution to this problem, and we agree that different FRET pairs would have different RMSDs and more FRET pairs would help. Nevertheless, our FCG model with an RMSD of 8 Å (typical from DEER studies) provides a better fit to our distance dependence than the Förster equation alone, which assumes and RMSD of 0 Å. Since all FRET measurements are going to involve some heterogeneity, we believe that some correction for the heterogeneity is better than no correction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the authors suggest that the use of TETAC to modify cysteines should be barely affected by unspecific modification of other (non-interest) cysteines or cysteines located farther than ~20 angstroms from the donor, this is not immediately evident and can be a big problem for membrane proteins, since TETAC will not only modify other proteins but one would expect unspecific binding to the membrane. The authors should at least acknowledge and discuss these potential problems.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that endogenous cysteines can be a problem. However, this problem can be largely mitigated by: 1) selective mutation of nearby reactive endogenous cysteines and 2) correcting the FRET efficiency with the observed FRET in constructs without an introduced cysteine (no Cys). In cases where the no Cys construct reveals problematic cysteines, they can be mutated if they produce appreciable FRET or changes in FRET. Otherwise, the FRET efficiency can be corrected for these background sources using the methods described in this paper. We now elaborate more on this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2 describes site-specific labeling with Anap.

Densitometry analysis of the gels is now described in the Materials and methods, and the number of samples is in the figure legend. Although in retrospect loading controls would have been useful, the samples were instead normalized to the mass of the cell pellet, with 25 µL of lysis buffer used per 10 mg of cells. We have improved our description of this process in the Materials and methods section. The darker band for wt MBP observed by the reviewer in Figure 2C compared to Figure 2B is due to a different amount of lysate loaded for the two gels (8 x more in Figure 2B than 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Control for non-specific incorporation of Anap seems to be missing.

Here we show that MBP is the only detectable band with Anap fluorescence, even in the crude cell lysates. We have expanded our discussion of these data in the Results and Discussion. We also explain that the use of amber codon suppression substantially reduces nonspecific labeling relative to using cysteine-reactive donors for labeling.</p></body></sub-article></article>
