populations remains a considerable challenge. We take advantage of the unique population structure of <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic>, a bacterial pathogen of humans and shrimp, to perform a genome-wide screen for coadapted genetic elements. We identified 90 interaction groups (IGs) involving 1,560 coding genes. 82 IGs are between accessory genes, many of which have functions related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism. Only 8 involve both core and accessory genomes. The largest includes 1,540 SNPs in 82 genes and 338 accessory genome elements, many involved in lateral flagella and cell wall biogenesis. The interactions have a complex hierarchical structure encoding at least four distinct ecological strategies. One strategy involves a divergent profile in multiple genome regions, while the others involve fewer genes and are more plastic. Our results imply that most genetic alliances are ephemeral but that increasingly complex strategies can evolve and eventually cause speciation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vibrio parahaemolyticus</kwd><kwd>coadaptation</kwd><kwd>ecotype</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFC1601503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Yujun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC1603902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Yujun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund12"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Program for Infectious Diseases of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018ZX10101003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Ruifu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund13"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Program for Infectious Diseases of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018ZX10714-002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Ruifu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund14"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012151</institution-id><institution>Sanming Project of Medicine in Shenzhen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SZSM201811071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Yujun</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund15"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Yujun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund16"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZDRW-ZS-2017-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund17"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M501608/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Falush</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund18"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019SHZDZX02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Falush</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first overview of fitness interactions within a species provides information how genetic interactions and ecology combine together to determine trait evolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The importance of coadaptation to evolution was recognized by Darwin in the 6<sup>th</sup> edition of Origin of Species, where he wrote: 'In order that an animal should acquire some structure specially and largely developed, it is almost indispensable that several other parts should be modified and coadapted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Darwin, 1859</xref>). As Darwin’s argument implies, complex phenotypic innovation require adaptation at multiple genes and it is inevitable that some of the changes involved will be costly on the original genetic background, implying epistasis - that is non-additive fitness interactions - between adaptive loci.</p><p>The consequences of epistasis for the evolution of phenotypic diversity depends on transmission genetics, that is how genetic material is passed from one generation to the next, and population structure. For example, in outbreeding animals, mating mixes up variation every generation. A consequence of continuous reassortment is that genes only increase in frequency if they have high average fitness across genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neher and Shraiman, 2011</xref>). As a result, extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) due to natural selection is rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pritchard and Przeworski, 2001</xref>) and it is difficult to maintain dissimilar genetic strategies concurrently in the same population unless the strategies are encoded by a small number of loci. This means that the coadaptation necessary for extensive phenotypic diversification can only take place when facilitated by barriers to gene flow, such as geographical separation, mate choice or the suppression of recombination for example by inversion polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dobzhansky, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wallace, 1991</xref>). This feature also makes it difficult to study the process of complex coadaptation without temporally sampled genetic data, which remains rare despite the advent of technology for sequencing ancient DNA.</p><p>In bacterial populations, recombination happens much less frequently than cell division. For example, <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> lives in coastal waters and causes gastroenteritis in humans and economically devastating diseases in farmed shrimps. It is capable of replicating in less than 10 min in appropriate conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Makino et al., 2003</xref>), while the doubling time in the wild of the related bacteria <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> has been estimated as slightly over an hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibson et al., 1880</xref>). Approximately 0.017% of the genome recombines each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>), implying that there are approximately 50 million generations on average between recombination events at a given genetic locus. The consequence of these transmission genetics are that mutations that are beneficial only on specific backgrounds have a chance to rise to high frequency on those backgrounds even if they are harmful on others. Epistatic interactions that involve only small selective coefficients <italic>s</italic> (for example <italic>s</italic> = 1.0 × 10<sup>−4</sup>) can therefore create an imprint on the genome in the form of strong LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although recombination happens slowly on the timescale of bacterial generations, the Asian population of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> has had a large effective population size for at least the last 15,000 years, or approximately 130 million bacterial generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). As a result, the population of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> is unusual amongst bacteria in that there is approximate linkage equilibrium between most loci greater than 3 kb apart on the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). This feature increases the power of tests for interaction based on identifying non-random associations, which relies on identifying the same combination of alleles on independent genetic backgrounds and can therefore be confounded by clonal or population structure unless this is appropriately controlled for.</p><p>We perform a systematic screen for coadaptation in the core and accessory genome, based on a larger sample of genomes than (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cui et al., 2015</xref>), here for the first time performing a screen for the co-occurrence of accessory genome elements. We have taken a conservative approach to identifying statistical associations, rigorously filtering the set of genomes used in our discovery dataset to eliminate any hint of population structure. We performed more than 14 billion Fisher exact tests between variants in the core and accessory genomes, using a cut-off of P &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup> with the aim of assembling a comprehensive list of common genetic variants that have strong LD between them due to fitness interactions.</p><p>We find that the great majority of interactions involve small numbers of accessory genome elements, with surprisingly little involvement of the core genome. However, we also identify a complex multi-locus interaction, in which core and accessory genomes have evolved in parallel to create coadapted gene complexes encoding at least four distinct strategies. We show that it is possible to characterize these strategies, both at the level of strains and at the level of the genetic variants encoding them, using hierarchical clustering. Our results demonstrate that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> have progressively modified their own fitness landscape through coadaptation and demonstrate the fundamental importance of lateral flagella variation to their ecology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Detection and characterization of interaction groups</title><p>The presence of clonal and population structure within a dataset results in genome-wide LD that can confound screens for epistatic interactions based on LD patterns. To minimize the effect of population structure we first removed closely related strains within our global collection of 1,103 isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>) to generate a non-redundant set of 469 genomes that each differed from each other by more than 2,000 SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). As previously described, the sample is subdivided into four distinct populations, which have different, although currently overlapping, geographical distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>). These four populations are clearly visible in Principle Coordination Analysis (PCoA) of the SNP variants in this dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The great majority of strains in our sample are from the Asian population, VppAsia, so we excluded isolates from other populations. We then used fineSTRUCTURE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lawson et al., 2012</xref>) to look for signals of clonal structure within the remaining isolates, iteratively removing isolates until all of the isolates were assigned to a single population (Materials and methods), leading to a discovery dataset of 198 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neighbor-joining (NJ) trees and principle coordination analysis (PCoA) of 469 non-redundant dataset and 198 strain discovery dataset.</title><p>(<bold>a, c</bold>) NJ trees of strains from two datasets.

In order to exclude associations that arise only due to physical linkage, we excluded all sets of associations that spanned less than 3 kb, including between accessory genome elements. This left us with 452,849 interactions with P &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>, which grouped into 90 interaction groups (IG, a set of SNP/accessory gene connected by at least one significant interaction), all of which involved at least one accessory-genome element, with 8 also including core genome SNPs and 35 including multiple genome regions.

However, hierarchical clustering revealed that strains fall into four distinct ‘ecogroups’ (EGs) based on IG1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). Three of these groups, EG1a, EG1b and EG1d have a large number of variants (50-965) that are associated with them, and we used the clustering to sort these variants into tiers, with ‘Tier 1’ (T1) corresponding to the variants that showed the strongest association for each EG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Chromosome painting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) shows evidence for sharp peaks of differentiation of different EGs around the IG1 loci identified by our coadaptation scan, especially for EG1a strains, but with little evidence for differentiation elsewhere. This pattern is qualitatively distinct either for that observed between geographically differentiated populations or for clonally related strains, which show higher-than-expected copying probability (probability of genetic variants inherited from the same population or ecogroup) throughout the genome but without sharp peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Geographically based population structure is correspondingly less important, with weak differentiation of two of the populations (VppAsia and VppX) from the other two evident within PCo2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,d</xref>), which is consistent with our previous observation that few population-specific genes were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Functional differentiation of IG1 ecogroups</title><p>Within IG1, genes of COG classes M and N, cell wall biosynthesis and cell motility, are substantially overrepresented, relative to their overall frequency in the genome (COG M 32% vs 8%, COG N 13% vs 3%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, Fisher exact test). 27% (509/1879) of the IG1 SNPs localize to the lateral flagella gene cluster (VPA1538-VPA1557). The variants are scattered widely in the heatmap in many different configurations, with Tier 1 and Tier 2 SNPs from lateral flagella gene cluster showing strong associations with EG1a (a-T1 and a-T2 variants) and EG1b (b-T1 and b-T2 variants) and other patterns (O-1 variants, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

These SNPs are strongly associated, despite being on different chromosomes, suggesting a specific functional interaction. Tier O-2 includes 18 SNPs in two core genes encoding <italic>LuxR</italic> family transcriptional regulators (VPA1446-VPA1447), which is associated with c-di-GMP signaling and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ferreira et al., 2012</xref>). Within Tier O-2, ARACNE identified an accessory gene group_3560 as being a driver locus, with a particularly large number of causal interactions. This gene codes for a polysaccharide biosynthesis/export protein and retains interactions with 9 genome blocks after filtering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Tier O-3 contains SNPs that are at high frequency in strains containing the group_3560 gene but are rare in the rest of the dataset.

In the current dataset, it is differentiated from other strains at 5 SNPs in a transmembrane gene (VPA1081) and 45 accessory genes. A 23 gene block encoding T6SS (type VI secretion system, VP1391-VP1420, Ref1-10, d-T1) is present or partly present in all EG1d strains, and absent or largely absent in the other three EGs. Most EG1a-c strains instead encode a block of genes that are annotated as being cellulose synthesis related (Ref2-01, d-T2).

Because there are many unique variations in the lateral flagella gene cluster of EG1a isolates, we expected a different motility ability between EG1a and other isolates, but we failed to observe differences in swimming or swarming capability under the conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). However, EG1a strains revealed faster growth rate and significantly higher biofilm formation ability than EG1b-d strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>), and they revealed rough colony morphology, also an indication of increased biofilm formation, under low salinity (1% NaCl) culture condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>There are in total 60 EG1a strains in the global collection of 1,103 <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> strains.

The strains revealed no clear geographical clustering pattern in China, as they can be isolated from all six provinces that under surveillance. Notably, only 4 EG1a strains were isolated from clinical samples, including wound and stool, representing a lower proportion than for EG1b-d isolates (453/1043), including if the two major pathogenic clonal lineages (CG1 and CG2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>) are removed (268/798), suggesting this ecogroup has low virulence potential in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Other interaction groups</title><p>The most common type of interaction group is ‘genome island-like’, which is a single accessory genome region of between 3 kb (IG50) and 57 kb (IG38), of which there are 52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For example, IG2 consists of 10 genes in a single block (VPA1700-VPA1709). Nine of the genes code for various functions related to carbohydrate metabolism and transport while the 10<sup>th</sup> is a transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Four strains have 9 out of the 10 genes but otherwise the genes are either all present or all absent in every strain.

In our data, one example is IG14 which contains 4 genes annotated as being phage related and a further 19 hypothetical proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In the reference strain, 16 of the genes occur in a single block VP1563-VP1586, while 7 genes are present elsewhere in the genome. 56% of the 469 strains had none of the 23 genes, while 36% had more than 12 of them and 8% had between 1 and 5, which presumably represent remnants of an old phage infection. Only one gene (VP1563) in IG14 was found in appreciable frequency in strains that had none of the other genes. This gene might represent cargo of the phage infection that is able to persist for extended periods in the absence of infection due to a useful biological function of its own. Alternatively, it might additionally be transmitted by other mechanisms.</p><p>Another common interaction is incompatibility between different accessory genome elements, which is found in total 24 of the interaction groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For example, in IG3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), all of the 469 strains either have the gene <italic>yniC</italic>, which is annotated as being a phosphorylated carbohydrates phosphatase, or at least 4 out of a set of 5 genes VP0363-VP0367 that includes a phosphotransferase and a dehydrogenase in the same genome location. Only one strain has both sets of genes. This interaction also involves a core genome SNP, in the adjacent gene VP0368, which is annotated as being a mannitol repressor protein. Another pattern is found in IG42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), where there are three genes (polar flagellar sheath protein and hypothetical proteins) that are mutually incompatible in our data, and 12% strains have none of the three genes.</p><p>Amongst interaction groups other than IG1, class G, encoding carbohydrate transport and metabolism are substantially overrepresented (22% vs 6%, p&lt;0.01, Fisher exact test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), particularly amongst groups involving incompatibilities.

To make the results as directly comparable as possible we used the same 198 isolates that were used for the Fisher exact test. The most important discrepancy is that although SNPs associated with a specific group of strains, EG1a, involves perfect associations, with <italic>P</italic> values as low as 1.4×10<sup>−30</sup>, the coupling strengths are lower than for the other groups we identified and none appear amongst the top 5,000 couplings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Individual strains assemble a set of variants from the gene pool of the population that allow them to overcome the challenges involved in colonizing specific niches. Genomics makes it possible to characterize both the overall genetic variation within the population and which sets of variants co-occur together, and which do not. Each combination of coadapted variants represents a distinct evolutionary solution to dealing with the multifaceted challenges that bacteria experience in finding viable niches to colonize. Therefore, studies of coadaptation provide a unique opportunity to see the world from the point of view of a bacterium.</p><p>We performed a genome wide scan for coadaptation in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, performing pairwise tests for interactions amongst genetic variants and then clustered the significant pairwise interactions into 90 interaction groups. Because we focused on VppAsia population when identifying the coadapted genetic elements, we will not have detected genetic strategies any that are specific to non-VppAsia populations. We found that ecogroups found in VppAsia were always shared with at least one other population, but a more comprehensive coadaptation landscape of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and its relationship to geography and other features will require more extensive sampling.</p><p>Our analysis demonstrated that genome wide epistasis scans can be used successfully to identify diverse interactions involving both core and accessory genomes but also highlighted unsolved methodological challenges. First, pairwise tests should, at least in principal, have reduced statistical power compared to methods that analyze all of the data at once, such as Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Morcos et al., 2011</xref>). However, while there was a strong correlation between DCA and our results for core-genome interactions, DCA failed to identify the clearest, most extensive interaction in our dataset, namely the SNPs associated with EG1a. DCA was designed to identify coupling interactions that take place during protein folding and implicitly entails that pairwise interaction between a given pair of sites make it less likely that other sites will interact with either of them. For many types of interaction, a prior that makes the opposite assumption seems more appropriate, for example because master regulation loci are likely to interact with many different sites. Thus, in order to develop statistical tests that exploit the full power of genomic data, new types of statistical test that search for a more diverse range of interactions would need to be developed.</p><p>Second, distinguishing direct associations – either through gene function or ecology – from those that arise due to mutual correlation with other interacting genes, is a substantial, and largely unaddressed challenge. For the complex interaction groups in our data, the criteria used by ARACNE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Margolin et al., 2006</xref>) to remove interactions still left far too many interactions to be interpreted usefully as being causal. We found that hierarchical clustering organized the interactions in a manner that allowed informal interpretation, but once again new statistical methodology is needed to facilitate detailed dissection of associations.</p><p>Notwithstanding the unresolved challenges, our results highlight the central role of lateral motility in structuring ecologically significant variation within the species.

Using the same statistical threshold to assess significance, our interaction screen identifies many more examples of coadaptation between different accessory genome elements than of interactions between the core and accessory genomes or within the core genome, implying that natural selection has a central role in determining accessory genome composition.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given the extensive literature highlighting the importance of genomic islands to functional diversity of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dobrindt et al., 2004</xref>), the most common form of adaptation detected by our screen is the coinheritance of accessory genome elements located in the same region of the genome. Based on a minimum size threshold of 3 kb, we find 52 (56%) such interactions, the largest of which is 57 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Previous approaches to detecting genome islands emphasize traits associated with horizontal transmission, for example based on differences in GC content with the core genome, the presence of phage-related genes or other markers of frequent horizontal transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Langille et al., 2010</xref>). Our approach, based simply on co-occurrence identifies a wider range of coinherited units and suggests that many islands have functions related to carbohydrate metabolism.</p><p>Amongst interactions not involving physical linkage, the most common is incompatibility of different accessory genome elements, representing 27% (24/90) of our IGs. For example, two different versions of a phosphorous-related pathway, one involving one gene, the other involving 5 (IG3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>We propose that the rarity of interactions between core and accessory genome in our scan reflects the evolution of ‘plug and play’-like architecture for frequently transferred genetic elements. Accessory genome elements are more likely to establish themselves in new host genomes if they are functional immediately on arrival in a diversity of genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, from the point of view of the host bacteria, acquisition of essential functions in new environments is more likely if diverse accessory genome elements in the gene pool are functional as soon as they are acquired. These selection pressures will tend to promote a genomic architecture that facilitates casual gain and loss of genetic elements from particular genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sometimes it makes sense to go steady</title><p>When an accessory genome element with an important protein coding function arrives in a new genome, it is likely that some optimization of gene regulation will be possible, coordinating the expression of the gene with others in the genome. This can lead to longer-lasting associations between genetic elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). We found 8 different interaction groups involving core and accessory genome regions. One simple example included a regulatory gene VP0368 and an accessory genome element (IG3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this example, it is feasible for the core genome SNP and the associated accessory element to be transferred together between strains in a single recombination event. Where coadaptation involves two or more separate genome regions, this makes assembling fit combinations more difficult and is likely to slow down the rate at which strains gain and lose the accessory genome elements involved. The difficulty of evolving the trait <italic>de novo</italic> is likely to slow down the rate at which it is gained and loss, which in turn makes further coadaptation at additional genes more likely.</p><p>IG1d, is an example of a complex coadaptation involving multiple core and accessory genome regions. A large majority of strains in our dataset (439/469, EG1d) either carry a cluster of genes encoding a T6SS, or a cluster encoding cellulose biosynthesis genes (EG1a-c), but few strains have genes from both clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Cells uses the T6SS to inject toxins into nearby bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salomon et al., 2013</xref>) and cellulose production to coat themselves in a protective layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tischler and Camilli, 2004</xref>). Incompatibility might have a functional basis, for example because cellulose production prevents the T6SS functioning efficiently, or an ecological one, for example because cells that attack others do not need to defend themselves. The evolution of dissimilar strategies has led to differentiation in gene/SNP frequencies in a large number of regions. Strains that do not have the T6SS use at least three distinct sets of strategies, corresponding to ecogroups EG1a, EG1b and EG1c, encoded by alleles that are rare or absent in EG1d strains.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Marriage changes everything</title><p>EG1a variants differ from the other interaction groups in our coadaptation screen in both the number of associated regions and the strength of the associations. The interaction group includes 454 SNPs in the lateral flagellar gene cluster (VPA1538-1557, 18 kb, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), a further 917 core genome SNPs in 62 genes and 152 accessory genes in 35 clusters. Many of the variants represent fixed or nearly fixed differences between EG1a and other strains (a-T1 and a-T2). These include loci encoding flagellar genes, T2SS and other membrane transport elements. There are also 285 loci (27%, a-T3) in weaker disequilibrium, typically because they are polymorphic in EG1a or the other EGs. Many of these variants are likely to represent more recently evolved coadaptations. Some of these genes are also associated with flagella or the T2SS related function but also encompass a broader range of functional categories, including cell division and amino acid transport and metabolism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Our laboratory phenotype experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggest that biofilm formation is likely to be a key trait underlying the different ecological strategies of EG1a and other EGs. However, the variation in phenotypic response at different salinity levels, and the absence of measurable difference in swarming behavior despite the large genetic difference within the lateral flagella genes, highlight some of the manifold difficulties of interpreting natural variation using phenotypes measured under laboratory conditions.</p><p>Despite the extensive differences that have accumulated between EG1a strains and the other EGs, there is no evidence of restricted gene flow in most of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Even within the flagellar gene cluster, strongly differentiated regions are separated by a weakly differentiated one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), implying that the coadaptation is being maintained by selection in the face of frequent recombination. Initial divergence in flagellar function is likely to have led to ecological differentiation, which led to bacteria for example having different nutritional inputs or requirements and a broadening of the functional categories undergoing divergent selection.</p><p>How can the difference between EG1a variants and the other interaction groups in both the number of associations and their strength be explained? <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> is ubiquitous in shellfish in warm coastal waters, within which it occurs at densities of around 1,000 cells per gram, so a back of the envelope calculation suggests there are likely to be substantially more than 10<sup>15</sup> bacteria in the VppAsia population. The species also has a high estimated effective population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cui et al., 2015</xref>) and has strong codon bias, which is often argued to be evidence that even tiny selective coefficients can drive adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sharp et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, recombination only breaks up linkage disequilibrium between loci slowly. Therefore, weaker and more variable patterns of association found for associations other than EG1a variants is unlikely to be a simple consequence of the ineffectiveness of selection and is instead likely to reflect complexity in the fitness landscape.</p><p>Strains gain flexibility by being able to switch between or modulate genomically encoded strategies by homologous recombination. The evolution of promiscuity, and plug and play-like architecture is self-reinforcing because the presence of strains using multiple strategies in the population also favors the presence of accessory genes and core gene haplotypes that have high or intermediate fitness on a wide range of different genetic backgrounds.</p><p>On the other hand, an absence of intermediate genotypes in the population can favor the evolution of fastidiousness, with particular accessory genes and haplotypes becoming essential components of some genetic backgrounds but deleterious on others. A likely scenario is that EG1a initially involved epistatic interactions between lateral flagellar variants and one or more additional loci elsewhere in the genome. Additional SNP differences accumulated making the two different versions of the lateral flagellar locus functionally more distinct. Greater functional distinctiveness of the two phenotypes in turn generated divergent selection pressures at additional loci, which led to further coadaptation, which made the phenotypes of the ecogroups still more distinct.</p><p>These arguments imply that the evolution of fastidiousness, like the evolution of promiscuity, can be self-reinforcing. At some point in the differentiation of EG1a strains from the remaining ones, the coadaptation of the core loci to each other is likely to have become more-or-less irreversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). In this respect, the interaction between loci resembles the human institution of marriage, which has historically been thought of as an irreversible bond, although this notion loosened in the Christian world following the reign of King Henry VIII in England.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Coadapted gene complexes as speciation triggers</title><p>Running the tape forward, it is easy to envisage the number of coadapted regions of the genome within EG1a undergoing progressive enlargement, until the entire genome becomes differentiated. As coadapted regions become more numerous, the proportion of recombination events between eco-groups that are maladaptive will increase, which might prompt the evolution of mechanistic barriers to genetic exchange between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>).</p><p>Mechanisms by which new bacterial species arise are frequently discussed in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shapiro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fraser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Falush et al., 2006</xref>) but there is currently little data on how the process unfolds. EG1a isolates are of interest both as an example of an intermediate stage of divergence, prior to speciation, and because it suggests that substantial adaptive divergence between gene pools can precede any barriers to genetic exchange, other than natural selection at the loci involved. This – unique to our knowledge – example is exciting because the distinct signature of selection should make it possible to dissect the genetic basis of coadaptation in unprecedented detail. Broadly similar patterns of differentiation including ‘genomic islands of speciation’ have been observed for example between ecomorphs of cichlid fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malinsky et al., 2015</xref>), but the evolution of ecomorphs has been facilitated by fish preferring to mate with similar individuals, which will have also inevitably lead to some level of differentiation at neutral loci throughout the genome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, it has been possible to distinguish clearly between adaptive processes, reflecting fitness interactions between genes and neutral ones, reflecting clonal and population structure.

We have focused on interactions that generate strong linkage disequilibrium, but weaker and more complex polygenic ones also have the potential to provide biological insight.</p><p>Most bacteria have population structure that deviates more markedly from panmixia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). In some species, this is likely due to smaller effective population sizes, lower recombination rates or mechanistic barriers to genetic exchange between strains. However, coadaptation can itself generate genome-wide linkage disequilibrium that might be difficult to distinguish from clonal or population structure. Because the linkage disequilibrium associated with IG1 is highly localized within the genome, it can, on careful inspection be clearly be attributed to selection, but in other bacteria patterns are likely to be less straightforward, making it challenging to understand to whether adaptive processes drive population structure, or vice versa. Natural selection is the jewel of evolution but distinguishing it from other processes requires in depth understanding of the relevant biology in addition to suitable data and statistical methods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>fineSTRUCTURE</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://paintmychromosomes.com">http://paintmychromosomes.com</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002453">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002453</ext-link></td><td>SCR_018170</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MUMmer</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mummer.sourceforge.net/">http://mummer.sourceforge.net/</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2004-5-2-r12">https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2004-5-2-r12</ext-link></td><td>SCR_018171</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prokka</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tseemann/prokka">https://github.com/tseemann/prokka</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu153">https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu153</ext-link></td><td>SCR_014732</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td>Roary</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/">https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv421">https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv421</ext-link></td><td>SCR_018172</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>TreeBest</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://treesoft.sourceforge.net/treebest.shtml">http://treesoft.sourceforge.net/treebest.shtml</ext-link></td><td>SCR_018173</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>iTOL</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://itol.embl.de/">https://itol.embl.de/</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw290">https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw290</ext-link></td><td>SCR_018174</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SuperDCA</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/santeripuranen/SuperDCA">https://github.com/santeripuranen/SuperDCA</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000184">https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000184</ext-link></td><td>SCR_018175</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SpydrPick</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/santeripuranen/SpydrPick">https://github.com/santeripuranen/SpydrPick</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz656">https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz656</ext-link></td><td>SCR_018176</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Circos</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://circos.ca/">http://circos.ca/</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.092759.109">https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.092759.109</ext-link></td><td>SCR_011798</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genomes used in this work</title><p>Totally 1,103 global <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> genomes were used in this work, which also were analyzed in our other study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>).

of core and pan-genomes, but as the study shows, there are significant genetic associations. Additionally, the work provides insight into how sympatric speciation might occur in the face of rampant gene flow.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The landscape of coadaptation in Vibrio parahaemolyticus&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an interesting and clever study assessing the extent and implication of pan-genome genetic associations at a species-wide scale. The study takes advantage of a fairly unique phylogenetic structure of Vibrio parahaemolyticus to eliminate the extremely challenging population structure issue, and by doing so enables what is really a conceptually straight-forward, genome-wide analysis of associations among genetic variation (both gene presence/absence and SNPs). The analysis revealed 90 interaction groups, including one that encompassed 1540 SNPs in 82 core and 338 accessory genes, many of which are associated with the lateral flagella and cell wall. But even more interesting is the relative paucity of associations between the core and accessory genomes. Finally, the authors propose a number of valuable hypotheses concerning how these associations come about and the consequences of the interactions for adaptation and divergence. Overall, the work is novel, illuminating and advances the field, particularly the microbial population genetics community because of the unique perspective on how sympatric speciation may initiate despite the presence of gene flow.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>None of the reviewers had particularly major issues, but both, along with the BRE, agree that more needs to be done to help the reader traverse and remain connected to the Results. The figures and especially the legends need to be improved.</p><p>Additionally, we would like to see the fineSTRUCTURE analysis augmented by a simple PCoA (or MDS) done separately for both the core and accessory variants.</p><p>I have included all the comments from the referees and trust the authors will pay attention to these valuable and additional suggestions/requests when revising the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic> </p><p>The figures are complex and only minimally explained.

Same for similar notations elsewhere.</p><p>Subsection “Marriage changes everything”. While the references to Henry VIII is funny, I'm not sure that all members of the international science community will understand.</p><p>Subsection “Detection of coadapted loci”. A little more thorough description of SuperDCA and SpydrPick would be appreciated.</p><p>Figure 1. I don't think panel B is a Q-Q plot. It is really a frequency distribution of P-values. As mentioned for for subsection “Detection and characterization of interaction groups”, you haven't introduced EG1 yet, so minimally write out ecogroup.</p><p>Figure 4. Although you state it in the legend, it would help readers if you labeled the x- and y-axes in panel A with 'Strains' and 'Loci'. The whole nomenclature is pretty confusing and is indecipherable to a reader who is skimming the figures. You should repeat some of the description you make in the text (around subsection “Detailed characterization of the largest interaction group”). Why is panel B broken out? Explain this in the legend. I still don't fully understand panel D. You state that 4 reference genomes are shown. Presumably these correspond to the text such as RIMD2210633, but this is not stated anywhere. Why do you have Ref1 and then 3 different Ref2s next to these designations? How come the tan and blue blocks on the left side of panel 1 don't have a designation? Are they all from Ref1: RIMD221063? I don't understand how that could be. And what exactly is the copying probability? This figure legend needs a lot of work.</p><p>Figure 5. The legend is very non-descriptive and needs work.</p><p>Bottom line regarding these figure legends. I was so annoyed trying to work through the figures that I almost suggested rejecting the manuscript. Fortunately, I decided to put it aside for the day and come back with a cooler head. But don't make this so hard on readers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic> </p><p>I would appreciate a more thorough description of the genome diversity used in different places in the study. Primarily, the interaction groups are identified using a very carefully curated set of strains without population structure, but analyses on the distribution of those SNPs and elements is made in a larger set that is not similarly characterized in the manuscript. I would like to see a similar figure for Figure 1A for the set of 469 strains used throughout the analysis.</p><p>Additionally, the star phylogeny from Figure 1A convinces me that there is no population structure present in the dataset used for identifying the IGs, but I have a poor intuition for how closely related the strains are because I am unsure how their SNP filtering could affect the tree produced. I think a maximum likelihood ribosomal gene tree with the scale in substitutions per site would better orient readers to the scale of diversity included in these analyses. This would be especially interesting to know how the strain groups from IG1 heirarchical clustering maps onto this tree.</p><p>Related to this point of understanding the genome diversity of these strains as how they relate to the distribution of IGs, I would be curious to see if the strain groupings from the hierarchical clustering of IG1 could be reproduced by hierarchical clustering of strains based on flexible genome content.</p><p>Regarding the analogy presented in Figure 6, it was not explained when it is introduced in the Discussion section and the figure legend for this figure is not detailed in its explanation of how to read the schematic so I am not confident in my understanding of the meaning of the various details included in it. I think the manuscript would benefit from a more explicit description of their model for how such complex interaction groups could come to exist in natural microbial populations.</p><p>Concerning making the results easier to follow, I recommend changing figure legends and sub-headings within the Results section to be more descriptive and convey the take-away message the reader should have from reading that figure or section. Similarly, summary and topic sentences throughout the results would make appreciating the implications of results easier.</p><p>Subsection “Detailed characterization of the largest interaction group” – &quot;more-or-less strongly associated&quot; please clarify your wording here.</p><p>Figure 4 legend – restate color scheme of heatmap in both Figure 3 and Figure 4 legends instead of referring to previous figure legend.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54136.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>None of the reviewers had particularly major issues, but both, along with the BRE, agree that more needs to be done to help the reader traverse and remain connected to the Results.

We have revised the manuscript, especially the figure legends to make it clear.</p><p>The suggestion of adding a PCoA analysis was an extremely valuable one, particularly from an expository point of view. We have added a largely new Figure 1 which contains phylogenetic trees and PCoA results for both the non-redundant dataset and the discovery dataset. The different PCoA analyses illustrate the effect of geographic population structure and ecogroup structure and therefore provides a very useful link connecting together all of the different analyses. IG1 ecogroups are clearly visible in the PCoA plots so we have restructured the results to discuss IG1 before the other interaction groups. We believe this restructuring has greatly improved the digestibility of the manuscript. We have clarified these in the main text as follows:</p><p>Subsection “Detection and characterization of interaction groups”: These four populations are clearly visible in Principle Coordination Analysis (PCoA) of the SNP variants in this dataset (Figure 1B). […] We then used fineSTRUCTURE (12) to look for signals of clonal structure within the remaining isolates, iteratively removing isolates until all of the isolates were assigned to a single population (Methods), leading to a discovery dataset of 198 strains (Figure 1C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Subsection “Complex structure of interaction group 1”: Although fineSTRUCTURE did not detect any population structure within the discovery dataset, PCoA analysis of SNPs identifies axes of variation that reflect the ecogroup structure within EG1 (Figure 1d). […] Geographically based population structure is correspondingly less important, with weak differentiation of two of the populations (VppAsia and VppX) from the other two evident within PCo2 (Figure 1B, D), which is consistent with our previous observation that few population-specific genes were identified (Yang et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>The figures are complex and only minimally explained.

We found that ecogroups found in VppAsia were always shared with at least one other population, but a more comprehensive coadaptation landscape of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and its relationship to geography and other features will require more extensive sampling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Detection and characterization of interaction groups”.

Because the presence of EG1a and EG1b specific SNPs (a-T1~T3, b-T1~2), EG1a and EG1b strains generally clustered together, but EG1c and EG1d strains were mixed.

Although you state it in the legend, it would help readers if you labeled the x- and y-axes in panel A with 'Strains' and 'Loci'. The whole nomenclature is pretty confusing and is indecipherable to a reader who is skimming the figures. You should repeat some of the description you make in the text (around subsection “Detailed characterization of the largest interaction group”). Why is panel B broken out? Explain this in the legend. I still don't fully understand panel D. You state that 4 reference genomes are shown. Presumably these correspond to the text such as RIMD2210633, but this is not stated anywhere. Why do you have Ref1 and then 3 different Ref2s next to these designations? How come the tan and blue blocks on the left side of panel 1 don't have a designation? Are they all from Ref1: RIMD221063? I don't understand how that could be. And what exactly is the copying probability?

Thank you very much for giving us opportunity to revise. We have extensively revised the figure legends and hope this has now been rectified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>I would appreciate a more thorough description of the genome diversity used in different places in the study. Primarily, the interaction groups are identified using a very carefully curated set of strains without population structure, but analyses on the distribution of those SNPs and elements is made in a larger set that is not similarly characterized in the manuscript. I would like to see a similar figure for Figure 1A for the set of 469 strains used throughout the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you this is an excellent suggestion, we now have a new Figure 1 that compares 469 strains with the 198, including PCoA. We believe that this new figure will help this reviewer and other readers to understand the pattern of diversity in the species much more easily. We have described different dataset at the beginning of Results section and performed PCoA analysis for two datasets (please see our response to the first comment).</p><p>Subsection “Detection and characterization of interaction groups”:</p><p>“The presence of clonal and population structure within a dataset results in genome-wide LD that can confound screens for epistatic interactions based on LD patterns. […] We then used fineSTRUCTURE (12) to look for signals of clonal structure within the remaining isolates, iteratively removing isolates until all of the isolates were assigned to a single population (Methods), leading to a discovery dataset of 198 strains (Figure 1C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>Subsection “Complex structure of interaction group 1”: In order to interpret these associations in a broader ecological and geographical context, we performed further analyses on the interactions that we identified in the discovery dataset on the non-redundant set of 469 strains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the star phylogeny from Figure 1A convinces me that there is no population structure present in the dataset used for identifying the IGs, but I have a poor intuition for how closely related the strains are because I am unsure how their SNP filtering could affect the tree produced. I think a maximum likelihood ribosomal gene tree with the scale in substitutions per site would better orient readers to the scale of diversity included in these analyses. This would be especially interesting to know how the strain groups from IG1 heirarchical clustering maps onto this tree.</p></disp-quote><p>The new Figure 1 shows how IG1 groups map onto the tree (only EG1a is distinct). We did construct a ribosomal gene tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), but in our view the main conclusion that can be drawn from it is that the 53 ribosomal genes provide substantially less information to infer relationships than the whole genome, for example providing a less clear split between populations. Since this is far from the point of our study, we have chosen not to include it. The new scale bars of NJ trees in Figure 1 shows the scale, which is substitutions per site and together with the new elements in Figure 1, we believe this gives a clear picture now of the overall pattern of diversity in the species.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Maximum likelihood tree of 469 non-redundant strains based on 53 concatenated ribosomal gene nucleotide sequences.</title><p>Red branches indicate strains in the discovery dataset.

We have now provided the hierarchical clustering results separately for accessory genes, as well as core genes as Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B, and described the relationship in the text as follows.</p><p>Subsection “Complex structure of interaction group 1”: Similar but not identical structuring of strains was obtained if clustering was performed only using core genome SNPs (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A) or accessory genome elements (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the analogy presented in Figure 6, it was not explained when it is introduced in the Discussion section and the figure legend for this figure is not detailed in its explanation of how to read the schematic so I am not confident in my understanding of the meaning of the various details included in it.
