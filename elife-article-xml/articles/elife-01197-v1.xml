differentiation, but the mechanisms by which BMP controls differentiation are not well understood. We report that BMP regulates differentiation by blocking downregulation of Cdh1, an event that accompanies the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. We find that loss of Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells, and that experimental suppression of Cdh1 activity rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. We further show that BMP acts prior to and independently of Cdh1 to prime pluripotent cells for mesoderm differentiation, thus helping to reinforce the block to neural differentiation. We conclude that differentiation depends not only on exposure to appropriate extrinsic cues but also on morphogenetic events that control receptivity to those differentiation cues, and we explain how a key pluripotency signal, BMP, feeds into this control mechanism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01197.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01197.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01197.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human body is made up of about 200 different types of cell, all of which are descended from a single fertilised egg. As an embryo develops, its cells divide and specialise into distinct lineages. Cells in each lineage go on to form a restricted number of cell types that are required to make a specific tissue. As such, during early development, cells switch from being ‘pluripotent’, with the potential to become the many different cell types, to committing to one particular cell lineage.</p><p>Controlling this process involves a huge number of signalling proteins and pathways. One such protein is bone morphogenetic protein, or BMP for short, which has a number of different roles in embryo development: for example, it stops pluripotent cells turning into nerve tissue, and it also encourages embryonic stem cells to contribute to the ‘mesoderm’ of the early embryo (which goes on to form the muscles, connective tissues and some blood cells). How these two actions are linked, and whether they depend on similar signalling pathways, was unknown.</p><p>BMP is also known to trigger the production of proteins known as ‘Id factors’—which stands for ‘inhibitor of differentiation’. Now, Malaguti et al. have investigated the roles of BMP and Id factors in controlling mouse embryo development and found, somewhat surprisingly, that these proteins needed help from a third protein to stop pluripotent cells turning into nerve tissue. This third protein, which is called E-Cadherin, normally helps cells to adhere to other cells. Malaguti et al. showed that losing this protein encourages cells to become either nerve or mesoderm tissues, and that a drop in E-Cadherin levels must occur before nerve tissue can form.</p><p>Malaguti et al. also showed that encouraging cells to become part of the mesoderm requires BMP to activate another pathway, which does not require E-Cadherin. The two effects of BMP can be uncoupled by adjusting the levels of this protein. At low concentrations, BMP can keep cells pluripotent, but it cannot encourage cells to commit to a mesoderm fate. At higher doses, however, BMP ‘primes’ cells to respond to the signals that trigger their development into mesoderm tissue.</p><p>The findings of Malaguti et al. suggest that manipulating both E-Cadherin and BMP signalling could improve our ability to generate useful cell types, such as neurons, from stem cells grown in laboratory cultures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01197.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01197.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>BMP</kwd><kwd>Id1</kwd><kwd>pluripotent stem cell</kwd><kwd>Cdh1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT082232AIA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lowell</surname><given-names>Sally</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/I006680/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lowell</surname><given-names>Sally</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT100133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blin</surname><given-names>Guillaume</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The differentiation decisions made by pluripotent cells depend on their exposure to appropriate extrinsic signals and also on morphogenetic events that control receptivity to those differentiation cues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The events that drive the transition from pluripotency to lineage commitment remain poorly understood. It has been known for many years that BMP signalling protects pluripotency and suppresses neural specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ying et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stern, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di-Gregorio et al., 2007</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. BMP signalling is also required for the formation of mesoderm <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mishina et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Winnier et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lawson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beppu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2004</xref>), and BMP is commonly used to induce mesoderm from embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murry and Keller, 2008</xref>). However, it is not clear how the effects of BMP on mesoderm differentiation relate to its pro-pluripotency and anti-neural effects: are these separable independent events or do they represent the outcomes of one common mechanism? This question underlines our poor understanding of the mechanisms by which BMP influences neural and mesodermal specification.</p><p>BMP acts through transcriptional upregulation of Inhibitor of Differentiation (Id) factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ying et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) in order to prevent neural differentiation. Id factors generally act as dominant negative inhibitors of the bHLH family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Norton, 2000</xref>), but the mechanism by which Id proteins block neural induction is not known. Furthermore, it is not clear to what extent the pro-mesoderm effect of BMP within the epiblast is mediated by Id or by other BMP target genes: redundancy between the four Id family members may mask gastrulation phenotypes in Id mutants.</p><p>We set out to examine more closely the effects of BMP and Id1 on neural and mesoderm differentiation by taking advantage of an ES cell differentiation system, which allows differentiation to be carefully monitored in a well-defined environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ying and Smith, 2003</xref>), and by using a reporter strategy to ask which cells usually express Id1 during early development.</p><p>We find an unanticipated ability of BMP/Id to block differentiation by maintaining the expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-Cadherin (Cdh1). We find that loss of Cdh1 is tightly associated with neural as well as mesodermal differentiation and that this change in Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for neural differentiation. A number of recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Soncin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Redmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">del Valle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faunes et al., 2013</xref>) suggest that Cdh1 helps protect pluripotency. Despite this emerging appreciation of Cdh1 as a regulator of the pluripotent state, the upstream regulators of Cdh1 in pluripotent cells have not been reported. BMP favours mesenchymal to epithelial transitions in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kondo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samavarchi-Tehrani et al., 2010</xref>), but its ability to control Cdh1 activity during early fate specification has not previously been appreciated.</p><p>We also find that BMP acts through Id1 to impose a proximal posterior identity on epiblast cells, priming them for mesodermal fates whilst transiently restraining them from overt mesoderm differentiation. Id1 may therefore play an early role in anterior-posterior (AP) patterning and mesoderm priming, independent from any effect on overt mesoderm differentiation. This helps to reconcile why BMP is required both for mesoderm differentiation and for the maintenance of pluripotency.</p><p>Taken together, our data help to unify the distinct effects of BMP signalling during differentiation of pluripotent cells. BMP maintains high levels of Cdh1, which help to protect the pluripotent state, whilst imposing a posterior identity that ultimately favours mesodermal over neural differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The BMP target gene <italic>Id1</italic> is expressed in the post-implantation pluripotent epiblast</title><p>The BMP target gene <italic>Id1</italic> has been reported to inhibit neural induction and instead favour either pluripotency or mesoderm differentiation from pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ying et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), but the precise events controlled by Id1, and the mechanism by which it acts, are not known.

However, despite expressing T, BMP-treated cells do not progress to overt mesoderm differentiation. Differentiation of epiblast to mesoderm is characterised by the loss of Oct4 and Cdh1, whereas BMP4-treated cells remain uniformly Cdh1+ at least for the first 5 days of BMP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). Furthermore, in the presence of BMP4, downregulation of <italic>Oct4</italic> is delayed, and markers that characterise EMT and overt mesoderm differentiation are not upregulated within the 5-day time frame of this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We therefore considered whether the ability of BMP4 to upregulate T may represent an effect on positional identity within the epiblast rather than a direct effect to drive mesoderm commitment. In support of this idea, we found that in the presence of BMP4, T is coexpressed with Cdh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

These data are consistent with the idea that Id1, like BMP, favours a posterior proximal epiblast identity whilst delaying overt differentiation.

We confirmed that <italic>Nanog</italic> in this context is likely to be marking a posterior epiblast-like cell rather than an earlier naïve pluripotent state because other markers of naïve pluripotency, <italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Rex1</italic> and <italic>Esrrb</italic>, are rapidly lost in Id1 overexpressing cells, as they are in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).</p><p>In further support of the idea that Id1 delays differentiation, we used quantitative immunofluorescence to demonstrate that in the presence of exogenous Id1, T+ cells remain predominantly Cdh1+ and &gt;90% of them coexpress Oct4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). These T+ cells are therefore unlikely to be differentiated mesoderm cells and are more likely to be equivalent to the T+ cells in the proximal epiblast of the early embryo that have not yet entered the primitive streak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rivera-Pérez and Magnuson, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Dox treatment does not entirely block differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Indeed, around 50% of cells are negative for Flag on day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Therefore, in order to address whether Id1 is sufficient to block differentiation, we turned to a constitutive expression system. We generated clonal lines of ES cells stably overexpressing <italic>Id1</italic> under the control of the ubiquitously expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niwa et al., 1991</xref>) CAGS promoter.

However, it is not sufficient to completely block differentiation. Id1-overexpressing cells eventually differentiate predominantly into mesoderm rather than neurectoderm or endoderm, even under neural differentiation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In this regard, exogenous Id1 does not recapitulate the effect of exogenous BMP4 described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

Under these conditions, activation of TwistE eliminates Cdh1 expression from the majority of cells and upregulates the mesenchymal and neural marker Vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), but we did not observe any Tuj1+ neurons either in the presence or the absence of dox treatment (data not shown). We next confirmed that 5 ng/ml BMP4 upregulates posterior epiblast markers whilst delaying overt differentiation into mesoderm and endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, black bars), as expected. Under these conditions, suppression of Cdh1 via dox-induction of TwE efficiently rescues mesoderm and endoderm differentiation, but not neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that part of the mechanism by which BMP helps to maintain pluripotency is through maintenance of Cdh1, which interferes with efficient neural and mesodermal differentiation. Higher levels of BMP also impose a posterior identity that primes cells for mesoderm and is incompatible with a neural fate. Taken together, these findings help to explain why BMP can at the same time protect pluripotency and promote mesoderm differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Changes in the expression of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-Cadherin (Cdh1) are often associated with changes in cell identity throughout development and into adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thiery et al., 2009</xref>). For example, downregulation of Cdh1 is associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that accompanies the formation of mesoderm at the primitive streak and the emergence of neural crest cells from the dorsal neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thiery et al., 2009</xref>). The formation of the early neural plate from the epiblast does not bear all the hallmarks of a classical EMT, but it is accompanied by loss of Cdh1 and gain of N-Cadherin (Cdh2) and Vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatta and Takeichi, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaku-Saraste et al., 1996</xref>). There is already evidence that EMT is required for overt mesoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martínez-Estrada et al., 2010</xref>), and we find here that downregulation of Cdh1 is similarly a limiting event for neural differentiation.</p><p>Although it is well established that BMP signalling contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ying et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di-Gregorio et al., 2007</xref>), the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We propose that BMP suppresses differentiation by maintaining expression of Cdh1. We support this idea by showing that suppressing Cdh1 is sufficient to rescue the BMP-imposed block to multilineage differentiation.</p><p>It is also unclear how BMP signalling favours mesodermal over neural fates. We find that the BMP target gene <italic>Id1</italic> imposes a proximal posterior identity on undifferentiated cells, priming them towards mesoderm. The ability of Id1 to block neural differentiation is therefore unlikely to be explained entirely by inhibition of a neural-inducing transcription factor as is commonly assumed, nor by a direct activation of mesoderm differentiation, but rather to a shift in the positional identity of pluripotent cells that occurs in the absence of overt differentiation. This may explain why, to our knowledge, no Id-regulated pro-neural bHLH transcription factor has been found that explains the ability of Id1 to influence neural induction.</p><p><italic>Id1</italic> null ES cells have a defect in the maintenance of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Romero-Lanman et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with our finding that Id1 delays exit from an epiblast-like state. We note, though, that the <italic>Id1</italic> null phenotype is also likely to reflect an earlier pre-implantation role for Id1: to suppress the activity of Tcf15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies et al., 2013</xref>). The consequence of this would be to maintain expression of Nanog and suppress the transition to a T+ epiblast-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies et al., 2013</xref>), in keeping with the <italic>Id1</italic> null ES cell phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Romero-Lanman et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The two effects of BMP, to maintain Cdh1 and to impose a posterior identity, can be uncoupled by varying the dose of BMP. Lower doses of BMP are sufficient to maintain Cdh1 and to suppress neural fate, but insufficient to impose a stable posterior identity. Strikingly, suppressing Cdh1 at these lower doses of BMP is sufficient to rescue neural differentiation, indicating that the primary mechanism by which BMP inhibits neural differentiation in this context is through its ability to control Cadherin activity. This is an unexpected finding that highlights the importance of cell adhesion and tissue organisation in controlling receptivity of cells to differentiation cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stepniak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faunes et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>There is a growing body of evidence that Cdh1 influences growth factor receptiveness of ES cells, and that it can consequently stabilise particular pluripotent states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Soncin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Redmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hawkins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">del Valle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faunes et al., 2013</xref>), but it is not known what controls Cdh1 expression in this context. We fill this gap with our finding that BMP/Id maintains Cdh1 expression during differentiation of ES cells. Interestingly, <italic>Id1</italic> is excluded from the anterior streak in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jen et al., 1997</xref>), so it is possible that it plays a more general role in regulating EMT in the early embryo.</p><p>In vivo, the BMP signals that are generated from the extraembryonic ectoderm not only block neural induction but are also required for formation of mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mishina et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Winnier et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lawson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beppu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2004</xref>). However, BMP signalling is also necessary for maintenance of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di-Gregorio et al., 2007</xref>), and mouse embryos in which BMP has been experimentally overactivated have an impairment in mesoderm differentiation that cannot easily be explained by models in which BMP drives mesoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoyama et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings unite these observations by showing how BMP can prime cells for mesoderm fate by imposing a posterior identity, but restrain them from undergoing overt mesoderm formation by suppressing EMT.</p><p>In frogs, antagonism of BMP by the organiser induces anterior-posterior axis formation. It has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Constance Lane et al., 2004</xref>) that BMP antagonism acts by stimulating mediolateral intercalation of caudal progenitors, releasing them to participate in the formation of the axis, and that the normal role of BMP is to preserve a reservoir of progenitors throughout axis elongation. We propose that BMP acts by a similar mechanism during differentiation of pluripotent mouse cells, preserving a population of undifferentiated cells by preventing the loss of Cdh1. The mechanism by which BMP signalling controls EMT will be an interesting area for future study. This may be connected with BMP’s ability to antagonise Nodal signalling, given that Nodal is required for the initiation of EMT at the primitive streak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our work also has implications for controlling uniform differentiation of mouse ES cells. It has been known for some time that a subpopulation of ES cells tends to resist neural differentiation, but the reasons for this are not clear. We propose that this subpopulation of cells fail to respond appropriately to a neural-inducing environment because they are unable to downregulate Cdh1. We demonstrate this directly by showing that experimental suppression of Cdh1 activity can rescue neural differentiation capacity in this recalcitrant subpopulation resulting in a more homogenous differentiation response. Importantly, this can be achieved by non-genetic means, such as function-blocking E-Cadherin antibodies, providing a convenient and readily applicable means to improve our control over pluripotent cells.</p><p>In summary, we have identified the loss of Cdh1 activity as a limiting event for the earliest stages of neural differentiation and we propose that BMP controls differentiation in part by maintaining Cdh1 expression. The strategy of coupling changes in cell adhesion to transcriptional control of cell fate specification is used several times during development as a way of coordinating tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Owens et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martínez-Estrada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watt and Fujiwara, 2011</xref>), and it will be interesting to investigate the implications of our findings for germ-layer formation in the early embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse ES cell culture</title><p>ES cells were maintained in GMEM supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol, non-essential amino acids, glutamine, pyruvate, 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 units/ml LIF on gelatinised tissue culture flasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith, 1991</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>To generate dox-inducible <italic>Id1</italic>-overexpressing ES cells, E14tg2α ES cells were transfected with a plasmid containing a CAGS promoter driving expression of the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA), followed by an IRES and a Blasticidin S resistance gene.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Freda Miller, Reviewing editor; Tristan Rodriguez and Alfonso Martinez Arias, peer reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript addresses the mechanisms whereby BMP4 and its downstream target Id1 regulate the transition between pluripotent cells and their differentiated neural and mesodermal progeny. The study is largely pursued in murine ES cells, and provides evidence for the interesting conclusion that BMP4 and Id1 play an important role in regulating pluripotency and these early stages of differentiation via Cdh1 and potentially EMT.</p><p>1) A major limitation of this work as currently presented is that it is difficult to be definitive about EMT transitions in ES cells. For example, the repression of EMT might be an indirect consequence of the role of BMPs in promoting a posterior epiblast identity. One way the authors could address this question is to test if BMPs can repress EMT in the directed mesoderm assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. However, while this experiment might strengthen their general conclusion, we also feel that it would be better to rewrite the paper so that the conclusions regarding EMT (particularly with regard to neural induction) are more cautious and not couched as the major conclusion of the manuscript (such as in the title).</p><p>2) Much of this manuscript relies upon qPCR-based approaches for markers associated with certain states. However, although the authors have error bars on these and their other experiments, statistical significance is largely absent from the manuscript. Since their conclusions are largely quantitative ones, the authors need to explicitly indicate how many times each experiment was done, and to perform appropriate tests of significance.</p><p>3) In their studies on Id1, the authors establish a very nice control for their manipulated ES cells by floxing their Id1 transgene so that it can be deleted. They then show that this works with regard to neural differentiation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement. 1</xref>. However, they never take advantage of this control for any of their EMT/mesoderm experiments. It would significantly strengthen the paper if they included these data, since in a sense this is the ultimate control.</p><p>4) The studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> looking at Oct4 versus Cdh1 during neural induction/neural tube establishment should be improved. Also, previous work from Derek van der Kooy's lab has shown that Cdh1 is expressed in the neural tube at later timepoints (Karpowicz et al., J. Neurosci., 2007). Do the authors also find this?</p><p>5) As a general comment, many of the figure legends are unclear. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, this appears to be the levels of expression of the various genes that are indicated in individual cells taken at 3 days that are sorted out for their relative levels of these markers. Is that the case? And how did the authors obtain the R values for correlation with Cdh1 as shown in 4B? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> cold also benefit from better labeling. Thus, in general, clarification in the figure legends would significantly improve “readability”.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01197.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) A major limitation of this work as currently presented is that it is difficult to be definitive about EMT transitions in ES cells</italic>.</p><p>This is a very good point. Upon reflection, we realise that the terms “EMT” or “EMT-like” are not appropriate for the events that we are discussing: what we are really talking about are changes in E-Cadherin (Cdh1). We have now removed all inappropriate references to EMT throughout the text and in the title and replaced them with reference to changes in Cdh1. We only use the term EMT where we are referring specifically to conventional EMT events such as those that accompany formation of the mesoderm at the primitive streak, or where we refer to markers of EMT.</p><p>It is interesting, however, to note that the changes in Cdh1 that accompany neural specification are accompanied by some other changes that characterise conventional EMT, such as upregulation of N-Cadherin and Vimentin. We have included a brief discussion on this point at the start of the Discussion, whilst making it clear that these changes do not bear all the hallmarks of a classical EMT.</p><p>We appreciate this constructive advice and feel that our paper is now clearer and more to the point framed in terms of E-Cadherin rather than EMT.</p><p><italic>For example, the repression of EMT might be an indirect consequence of the role of BMPs in promoting a posterior epiblast identity</italic>.</p><p>This is a perceptive point. One piece of evidence that argues against this interpretation is that suppression of Cdh1 alone is sufficient to rescue neural differentiation at moderate doses of BMP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). If the primary effect of BMP is to promote posterior identity, with repression of EMT being a secondary consequence of this, then experimental suppression of Cdh1 in the presence of BMP might be expected to always drive mesoderm rather than neural differentiation. Since this does not happen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>) we tentatively conclude that repression of “EMT” is not entirely an indirect consequence of the role of BMPs in promoting a posterior epiblast identity. However, we fully accept the wider point that we should be more cautious in our conclusions regarding EMT. We have rewritten our manuscript accordingly as described above.</p><p><italic>One way the authors could address this question is to test if BMPs can repress EMT in the directed mesoderm assays shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref><italic>. However, while this experiment might strengthen their general conclusion, we also feel that it would be better to rewrite the paper so that the conclusions regarding EMT (particularly with regard to neural induction) are more cautious and not couched as the major conclusion of the manuscript (such as in the title)</italic>.</p><p>This is a great suggestion. We added BMP to the directed mesoderm protocol based on Collagen IV and FCS (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Exogenous BMP had profound effects during the protocol although unfortunately these effects appear to be somewhat toxic for the cells and so the data is difficult to interpret. We do not feel that these data are sufficiently informative to include in the paper, but we outline our findings below for your consideration.</p><p>Briefly, addition of BMP induced a clear morphological change in the cells. Rather than adopting the usual mesenchymal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1A</xref>), the cells became very large and flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1B</xref>). Whilst it is tempting to interpret this as an inhibition of EMT, these flatted cells do not have the typical morphology of healthy epithelial cells: rather they seem unhealthy, unable to proliferate, and destined to die. This is the type of morphology that we typically see in ES cell cultures that have been subjected to environmental or genetic stress.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-01197-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>If BMP were simply inhibiting EMT during mesoderm differentiation we would expect these cells to remain, at least for some time, in a T+ pre-ingression epiblast-like state. However, qPCR analysis (for what it is worth from such unhealthy looking cells) reveals that BMP treatment promotes rapid loss of Oct4 (Figure R1C) and abolishes the upregulation of T-Brachyury that usually accompanies epiblast and subsequent mesoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1D</xref>). We tested two different doses of BMP4 (10ng/ml and 50ng/ml) with similar results.</p><p>We conclude that BMP treatment in the context of this undefined directed mesoderm differentiation protocol strongly interferes with the normal differentiation process in ways that are difficult to interpret, but that clearly extend beyond a simple suppression of EMT. We think it most likely, based on morphological observations, that the cells adopt an unhealthy non-physiological state, perhaps due to exposure to conflicting environmental signals. We would therefore not feel comfortable drawing any conclusions from these experiments with relation to our proposed model.</p><p>More generally, we entirely agree with the reviewers' point that it is not appropriate for us to draw strong conclusions about control of EMT by BMP signalling, and we have followed their advice and rewritten the paper to remove reference to EMT as described above.</p><p><italic>2) Much of this manuscript relies upon qPCR-based approaches for markers associated with certain states. However, although the authors have error bars on these and their other experiments, statistical significance is largely absent from the manuscript. Since their conclusions are largely quantitative ones, the authors need to explicitly indicate how many times each experiment was done, and to perform appropriate tests of significance</italic>.</p><p>We have included this information in the revised version of the manuscript. Significance is depicted on figures, and details are provided in figure legends and in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>3) In their studies on Id1, the authors establish a very nice control for their manipulated ES cells by floxing their Id1 transgene so that it can be deleted. They then show that this works with regard to neural differentiation in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>–figure supplement. 1. However, they never take advantage of this control for any of their EMT/mesoderm experiments. It would significantly strengthen the paper if they included these data, since in a sense this is the ultimate control</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the control we used was not ideal. Whilst the floxed reverted line is a better control, this is also not the absolute ideal. We have recently developed a superior system that is much more tightly controllable. This is a dox-inducible Id1 overexpression system that allows us to compare the behaviour of the same cell line in the presence or absence of Id1 activation, described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>–figure supplement 1. We have used this new inducible system to generate a new set of data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We have additionally improved <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> by including a full time course from d0 to d5 (our original data examined d0 to d3 only).</p><p>We are pleased to report that the data shown in the original version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is fully recapitulated with the better-controlled inducible system and indeed the effects are even more striking with the new system (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This is despite the fact that this new inducible expression system provides more modest levels of exogenous Id1 than the original constitutive expression system (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore feel that the new data is not only better controlled but also even more strongly supportive of our model than our original data set.</p><p>When it comes to analysing longer-term consequences of Id1 overexpression on lineage bias we encounter a slight caveat with the dox inducible system. A significant proportion (around 50%) of cells lack expression of the flag-tagged transgene on day 5 of differentiation and the flag-negative population are able to generate neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the differentiation delay is more pronounced with the inducible system than with the constitutive system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Taken together, these two things make it difficult to use the dox-inducible system to test the eventual lineage preference of overexpressing cells. To strengthen this particular point we therefore turned back to the constitutive overexpression system, which a) allows for more uniform maintenance of Id1 activity throughout the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>) and b) allows for a more rapid ‘escape’ into differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>). We performed a new series of experiments this time using the appropriate floxed-reverted control cell line as suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>These new better-controlled data confirm that cells that are able to persistently maintain exogenous Id1 activity eventually favour mesoderm rather than ectoderm or endoderm fates, in keeping with our original observations. These new data are provided in the new version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The studies in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>looking at Oct4 versus Cdh1 during neural induction/neural tube establishment should be improved</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the correlation between Oct4 and Cdh1 during neural development was difficult to see clearly in the original version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We have now strengthened these data by repeating these experiments and performing quantitative analysis. We first quantified the expression of Oct4 and Cdh1 in the epiblast at E7.5 to provide a baseline starting figure. We then compared this with expression of Oct4 and Cdh1 within the developing neural tube at three developmental stages spaced approximately four hours apart, spanning the time period over which Oct4 is lost from the developing neural tube, i.e., during formation of the first 12 somites. Note that our timing is assessed by somite number, and that the first several somites form in the mouse at hourly intervals (Tam 1981).</p><p>All antibody staining was performed simultaneously to minimize artifactual variation between time points, but we also directly controlled for technical variability between sections by quantifying E-Cadherin expression in the surface ectoderm immediately adjacent to the neural tube and confirming that these measurements are similar across all time points.</p><p>These new data confirm a striking correlation between the decline of Oct4 and the decline of Cdh1 within the neural tube.</p><p><italic>Also, previous work from Derek van der Kooy's lab has shown that Cdh1 is expressed in the neural tube at later timepoints (Karpowicz et al., J. Neurosci., 2007). Do the authors also find this</italic>?</p><p>It is indeed interesting that E-Cadherin becomes re-expressed in foetal and adult neural stem cells as reported by Karpowicz et al. We have not examined these later stages of foetal and adult development ourselves as our focus is on the transition from pluripotency to lineage commitment. Interestingly, these authors also report a steep decline in E-Cadherin expression in the early neural tube by E9.0 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karpowicz et al., 2007</xref>]). This fit exactly with our own observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>) and we apologise for failing to reference this work in our original manuscript:Karpowiczet al.are cited in our revised manuscript and we modify our text to clarify that “Cdh1 is downregulated during the early stages of neural tube formation”.</p><p><italic>5) As a general comment, many of the figure legends are unclear. For example, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref><italic>, this appears to be the levels of expression of the various genes that are indicated in individual cells taken at 3 days that are sorted out for their relative levels of these markers. Is that the case? And how did the authors obtain the R values for correlation with Cdh1 as shown in 4B?</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5E</italic></xref> <italic>cold also benefit from better labeling. Thus, in general, clarification in the figure legends would significantly improve “readability”</italic>.</p><p>We have improved the figure legends and hope that they are now easier to follow.</p></body></sub-article></article>
