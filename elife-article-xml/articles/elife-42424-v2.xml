susceptibility to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis is frequently studied in mice. We have now turned this idea to melanoma using the collaborative cross (CC), a resource of mouse strains designed to discover genes for complex diseases. We studied melanoma-prone transgenic progeny across seventy CC genetic backgrounds. We mapped a strong quantitative trait locus for rapid onset spontaneous melanoma onset to <italic>Prkdc</italic>, a gene involved in detection and repair of DNA damage. In contrast, rapid onset UVR-induced melanoma was linked to the ribosomal subunit gene <italic>Rrp15</italic>. Ribosome biogenesis was upregulated in skin shortly after UVR exposure. Mechanistically, variation in the ‘usual suspects’ by which UVR may exacerbate melanoma, defective DNA repair, melanocyte proliferation, or inflammatory cell infiltration, did not explain melanoma susceptibility or resistance across the CC. Instead, events occurring soon after exposure, such as dysregulation of ribosome function, which alters many aspects of cellular metabolism, may be important.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42424.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. Melanoma tumors form in the skin’s pigment-producing cells or melanocytes. Growing evidence points to complex interactions between genetics and environmental exposures that contribute to the risk of developing melanoma. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun causes genetic mutations in melanocytes. This sun exposure interacts with genetic variations that may make people more or less vulnerable to such DNA damage. For example, genetic variations that control skin color or the cell’s ability to repair DNA, and that influence how easily people develop sunburn, all affect whether UV damage leads to melanoma. However, some forms of melanoma are not caused by sun exposure at all.</p><p>Most of the genetic variations linked to melanoma have a small effect on the risk of developing the disease. So, it is unlikely that these genes alone cause melanoma. Few studies have been able to map the complex interactions between genes and the environment that lead to melanoma. So far, it has been unclear if there are different genetic mechanisms that lead to an increased risk for sun-exposure linked melanoma and non-sun linked melanoma.</p><p>Now, Ferguson et al. show that variations in the genes involved in DNA repair during normal cell growth are linked to non-sun linked melanoma. Sun-linked melanoma, on the other hand, was associated with genes involved in the production of proteins in part of the cell called ribosomes. In the experiments, the effects of both UV light and various genetic variations were assessed across many different strains of mice. Mutations that impair the cell’s ability to repair UV-induced DNA damage or that contribute to excessive inflammation in response to sunburn did not increase melanoma susceptibility in these experiments.</p><p>Ferguson et al. show that the amount of UV-induced DNA damage alone does not explain melanoma risk, which may not always depend on skin pigmentation. The experiments also suggest that non-UV linked melanoma is caused by a different mechanism than sun exposure-linked melanoma. Learning more about different genetic factors that affect the risk of developing different types of melanoma may help scientists develop more specific treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ultraviolet radiaton</kwd><kwd>genes</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>QTL</kwd><kwd>mice</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005190</institution-id><institution>Melanoma Research Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Grant Award Number: 346859 2015-2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>Graeme J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic variation determines whether or not UV exposure accelerates melanoma development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM) is well known to be associated with high levels of sun exposure. However, this is only true for intermittent rather than chronic exposures, with indoor workers having a higher risk for MM than outdoor workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gandini et al., 2005</xref>). Examples of intermittent sun exposures include number of waterside vacations and number of severe sunburns. One melanoma subtype, lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM), is invariably linked to chronic sun exposure. Individual risk for the development of MM is in part due to the number of UVR-induced mutations incurred (i.e. the environmental factor), but it is also due to genetic variation that controls skin color (degree of protection due to pigment), DNA repair capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DiGiovanna and Kraemer, 2012</xref>), propensity to burn (inflammation), failure of programmed death of a damaged cell, and/or other factors that control melanocyte behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sample and He, 2018</xref>). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) point to genes regulating aspects of cell division control (e.g. <italic>CDKN2A</italic>/<italic>MTAP</italic>, <italic>PLA2G6</italic>, <italic>TERT</italic>), DNA repair (e.g. <italic>PARP1</italic>, <italic>APEX1</italic>, <italic>ATM</italic>), and pigmentation (e.g. <italic>MC1R</italic>, <italic>ASIP</italic>, <italic>TYR</italic>, <italic>SLC45A2</italic>, <italic>TYR</italic>) as the main players in conferring MM risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerstenblith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duffy et al., 2018</xref>). However only a small fraction of the variance in MM risk is explained by these genes, suggesting that there are still other genes involved in conferring MM risk in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hulur et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, MM is a heterogeneous disease with respect to both innate and somatic genetics, and also to environmental factors since each individual with MM was exposed to different levels of sun exposure. The most common superficial spreading melanomas (SSM) are sometimes found on sun-exposed body sites, but more often on non-sun exposed sites, and there can be great diversity in terms of the number of UVR signature mutations in individual lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2017</xref>). While the number of UVR signature mutations in MMs strongly suggests a role for UVR in MM, the number of mutations present in a MM is due to not just obvious levels of exposure, and protective and repair differences between individuals, but also other factors, for instance the type of exposure. There is in vivo evidence that less intense exposures may be more important for skin cancer induction than more intense doses which cause more apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lan et al., 2016</xref>), and even for a single exposure there are significant differences in skin responses between the same dose (i.e. the same levels of DNA damage) administered with high intensity over a short period versus a low intensity for a longer period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iida et al., 2016</xref>). Our skin can protect itself via pigmentation responses (tanning), but also by ‘photo-adaption’, which is independent of pigmentation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmer et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the skin of different individuals can respond and adapt to various forms of sun exposure in different ways, and there are potentially multiple and interacting mechanisms which might explain how UVR exposure could initiate or accelerate MM development in the general population.</p><p>For the above reasons, most experimental work on UVR carcinogenesis has used animal models. Natural genetic variation can confer resistance to many cancer types in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balmain, 2002</xref>), and it is of great interest to determine why this is so. Most mouse MM models rapidly develop tumours after neonatal UVR exposure. Such models have provided tractable experimental systems to determine a MM action spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Fabo et al., 2004</xref>), to assess which type of UVR-induced DNA adducts are required, and to study the role of UVR-induced DNA damage, inflammation, and immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Walker, 2008</xref>). It is not yet clearly known why a single neonatal UVR exposure so efficiently accelerates MM onset. We have shown previously that it is not via the acquisition of unrepaired UVR-induced damage leading to mutations in important cancer genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016</xref>). A number of factors have been proposed to play a role: 1) there is a muted inflammatory response to UVR in neonates associated with immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wolnicka-Glubisz et al., 2007</xref>); 15,16), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muller et al., 2008</xref>) there is a heightened sensitivity of neonatal melanocytes to proliferate following UVR (Walker et al., 209) that is driven by inflammatory cytokines, especially interferon-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zaidi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We used the <italic>Cdk4<sup>R24C</sup>::Tyr-NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup></italic> (hereafter termed <italic>Cdk4::NRAS</italic>) mouse as a UVR-induced MM model. Somatic <italic>NRAS</italic> mutation is carried by 27% of MMs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org">http://www.cbioportal.org</ext-link>), and in ~90% of MMs the p16/CDK4/pRb pathway is deregulated via mutations in <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, <italic>CDK4</italic>, or <italic>RB1</italic>, and/or <italic>CDK4</italic> or <italic>CCND1</italic> amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheppard and McArthur, 2013</xref>). We studied the development of MM in mice of 70 diverse genetic backgrounds carrying these transgenes. To do so, we utilized the Collaborative Cross (CC), a set of recombinant inbred mouse strains generated from eight original founder strains, designed to enable rapid gene mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Churchill et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morahan et al., 2008</xref>). The CC is ideal for systematic analysis studies to discover modifier genes for complex diseases. Mice from each inbred CC strain may be considered as ‘clones’ of each other. Related to the CC is the diversity outbred (DO) population, in which mice descended from the same eight founders are generated as outbred stock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Churchill et al., 2012</xref>). The DO system allows very high levels of heterozygosity and recombination of CC founder alleles, but each DO mouse is genetically unique and not reproducible for experimentation requiring testing of multiple mice. The CC system has allowed us to study the influence of germline genetic background on MM induction using experimentally controlled UVR exposures. This approach tries to explain UVR-induced MM susceptibility and resistance by integrating the complex interaction of many kinds of genetic and biological information, and as such should provide much more realistic insights into MM than simple disease models focusing on single genes or proteins in isolation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamilton and Yu, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assessment of NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup> and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> transgenics as models for UVR-induced melanoma</title><p>Before embarking on the screen for melanoma modifier genes in mice, we assessed whether there may be better murine models to work with. All models tested were on the FVB strain background. Given that <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> mutation is more common than <italic>NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup></italic> in MM overall, we studied the inducible <italic>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></italic> model developed by the MacMahon lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dankort et al., 2009</xref>) combined with the knock-in mutant <italic>Cdk4<sup>R24C</sup></italic> mouse. <italic>Cdk4<sup>R24C/R24C</sup>::Tyr-Cre<sup>ER</sup>::Braf<sup>V600E</sup></italic> mice were studied in three groups. In one group, the spontaneous MM group, Braf was induced by topical tamoxifen (tam) at P1, P2, and P3. In the next group, we applied Tam at P1, P2, and P3, then exposed the mice to a single neonatal UVB dose at post-natal day 3 (P3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For the final group, we first exposed to UVR at P3, then treated with Tam at P7, P8 and P9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Thus for both <italic>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic>-inducible models the ability of neonatal UVR to accelerate MM may not be dependent upon whether the engineered mutation is present in melanocytes at the time of UVR exposure. Instead, it may be due to a more generalized effect via differences in DNA repair, melanocyte number and proliferative response, or inflammatory response, as has been outlined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zaidi et al., 2011</xref>).

This software uses a logistic regression matrix model over the reconstructed haplotypes matrix to produce genome-wide distribution of P values (ANOVA chi-squared). We used a false discovery rate of p&lt;0.001 to define significant genome wide linkage. We identified a major effect QTL on mouse chromosome (chr) 16. The -Log<sub>10</sub>(P) −1 interval = 14.8–21.4 megabases (Mb), a region containing 45 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Examination of the founder haplotype coefficients in the significantly linked interval on chromosome 16 showed that the causal variant for early age of onset of MM was derived from the 129/SvJ founder (hereafter termed 129S). We ascertained which genes within the interval were the best candidates by cataloguing DNA variants that are carried on the causal 129S haplotype, and not any of the other founder haplotypes. Mining the Sanger Mouse Genomes and ENCODE databases for 129S-specific variants revealed eight candidates, two of which (<italic>Prkdc</italic> and <italic>Arvcf</italic>) carry non-synonymous mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), while all 8 (<italic>Prkdc, Pkp2</italic>, <italic>Yars2</italic>, <italic>Arvcf</italic>, <italic>Gp1bb</italic>, and <italic>Abcc5</italic>) had 129S-specific single nucleotide potentially regulatory polymorphisms (SNPs) in their 5’ or 3’ UTR, or introns. It is possible that one of the 129S-specific SNPs near the candidates may regulate another gene elsewhere in the genome, or that there are other 129S-specific regulatory SNPs nearby any of the 45 genes in the region that were not detected by ENCODE.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42424.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mapping genes for spontaneous melanoma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of breeding protocol to generate mice carrying 50% of their genome from the relevant CC strain. (<bold>B</bold>) Kaplan-Meier MM free survival curve showing age of onset on MM for all 38 strains.

We then performed global gene expression analysis (RNAseq) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) of skin from adult mice from various laboratory strains (AJ, NOD, B6, FVB, and 129S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), four of which are CC founders, for which the genome sequences are available in the Sanger database We found no differences between susceptible (129S allele-carrying) and resistant strains (non 129S allele- carrying; AJ, NOD, FVB, B6) that would help demarcate a candidate(s). Only one gene (<italic>Lamp3</italic>, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 3) of the potential expressed sequences within the region was significantly differentially expressed between the susceptible and resistant strains assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), but the nearest 129S-specific regulatory SNP is located 10 Kb away, near <italic>Gp1bb</italic>, and the next about 500 Kb away, near <italic>Avcrf</italic>. Unfortunately, there is no skin expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data for mouse skin, and it was not possible to consult the GTEX eQTL database for eQTLs in human skin since the <italic>LAMP3</italic>, <italic>GP1BB</italic>, and <italic>ACVRF</italic> genes in humans are scattered on different chromosomes.</p><p>Therefore, we hypothesized that a functional effect on phenotype was most likely the presence of missense mutations rather than regulatory expression changes on the causal allele. <italic>Prkdc</italic> carried two missense mutations, one defined as deleterious by SIFT.

PRKDC (also known as DNA-PKc) plays a critical role in ensuring genome integrity and in cancer in general by mediating ligation of double stranded breaks in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodwin et al., 2015</xref>). The other gene within the interval that is a likely candidate is <italic>Arvcf</italic> (armadillo repeat gene deleted in velo-cardio-facial syndrome), a catenin protein family member. This family plays an important role in the formation of adherens complexes, which are thought to facilitate communication between the inside and outside environments of a cell. This carries on the causal 129S allele a missense mutation that is defined as tolerated by SIFT, so is perhaps not as likely to be the causal gene. In sum, while we cannot in effect rule out another gene within the region, the most likely candidate is <italic>Prkdc</italic>, since it carries a missense mutation on the causal allele shown before to confer cancer susceptibility, with <italic>Acvrf</italic> and <italic>Lamp3</italic> arguably less likely candidates.</p><p>We noted that other genes involved in sensing DNA damage and repairing double stranded breaks (e.g. <italic>PARP1</italic>, <italic>ATM</italic>, <italic>APEX1</italic>) are in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs associated with melanoma risk in GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hulur et al., 2017</xref>). We reasoned that even though <italic>PRKDC</italic> is not a GWAS hit, we could determine whether variation in its expression is correlated with expression of these GWAS genes. We examined global gene expression in non-sun exposed human skin across the GTEx cohort (Genenetwork.org).

Thus, while we cannot rule out <italic>Tgfb2</italic> and <italic>Gpatch2</italic>, by those criteria <italic>Rrp15</italic> is the best candidate. The causal allele (AJ/NOD) carried two <italic>Rrp15</italic> missense variants, both defined by SIFT as likely to be ‘tolerated’.

We hypothesized that some DO animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Churchill et al., 2012</xref>) would have informative recombinants of the causal AJ/NOD allele to make them useful for fine mapping the linked chr.1 interval. We tested DNA from 314 DO mice, initially using six polymorphic markers across an 8 Mb region around <italic>Rrp15</italic>. We selected a subgroup of 8 DO mice with apparent recombinations within the AJ/NOD alleles across the region and genotyped them using a panel of 60 SNPs (20 of which are the most informative and shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. SNPs were chosen based on their ability to discriminate the AJ/NOD allele from the other eight founders, especially those variants private for AJ, NOD, or both. While this NOD/AJ allele was scattered throughout the region in different DO mice, as expected we observed many recombinations across the chr.1 region of interest. However there were many gaps and alleles for which we could not unambiguously call the founder haplotypes on both strands across the region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To adequately do this, many more SNPs would have to be tested. Nonetheless we crossed each of the eight selected DO mice with <italic>Cdk4::NRAS</italic> transgenics, and studied UVR-induced MM onset in the progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Because of the limitations of our SNP-based map of the region, to genotype the DO mice we used manual Sanger sequencing to genotype more densely, in particular in the region of our candidate gene <italic>Rrp15</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, the predicted causal SNPs in <italic>Rrp15</italic> do not segregate with fast MM onset as they did in the CC strains. We hypothesized that lack of penetrance of the <italic>Rrp15</italic> allele was due to the introduction of additional resistance alleles elsewhere in the genome due to the high levels of recombinations and heterozygosity in the DO genomes. We tried to circumvent this by backcrossing transgenic-DO mice onto C57BL/6. Mice from several litters were followed, and after two backcrosses we assessed UVR-induced MM age of onset, with progeny genotyped immediately around <italic>Rrp15</italic> by Sanger sequencing. We found that the penetrance of the causal <italic>Rrp15</italic> variant was restored on backcrossing: mice carrying the NOD/AJ alleles of <italic>Rrp15</italic> had significantly earlier MM onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Thus, the propensity for neonatal UVR to accelerate melanoma is highly dependent upon genetic background influences. In addition, there are additional potential resistance alleles which can, if present, interact with the <italic>Rrp15</italic> susceptibility allele.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Neonatal UVR acceleration of melanoma age of onset is dependent upon innate genetics</title><p>We further analyzed the role of neonatal UVR in accelerating melanoma age of onset by subtracting the average age of onset of spontaneous from that of UVR-accelerated melanoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). This provides us with a further phenotype: the strain-specific rate of acceleration of MM onset by neonatal UVR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). The median age-of-onset for UVR-induced MM per strain was subtracted from the median onset for spontaneous MM, to denote what we have termed the ‘effectiveness’ of UVR in inducing MM. In resistant CC strains, neonatal UVR does not accelerate MM onset at all (e.g. HOE, BAX2), or does so by a very small amount, whereas for susceptible strains MM onset was accelerated by more than 300 days (e.g. SEH, XAJ2) as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K and L</xref>. The phenotype is independent of pigmentation status (albino vs pigmented) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). The genome scan for this trait is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>. Unfortunately, we only have both spontaneous and UVR-induced onset data for 27 strains. While this does not provide enough power to detect genome-wide significant linkage to this phenotype, there was a peak of suggestive significance at chromosome 1 p, overlapping with the QTL detected for UVR-induced age of onset, containing the <italic>Rrp15</italic> gene, with the NOD allele showing a different coefficient from the other strains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Skin gene expression changes after neonatal UVR</title><p>The way by which neonatal UVR accelerates MM may provide insights into early events in the initiation of this neoplasm. To search for pathways deregulated in neonatal UVR-exposed skin, we performed global gene expression chip studies with Illumina Beadchips on UVR exposed and non-exposed epidermis of wild-type FVB mice at various time-points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The top 500 significantly up- and down- regulated genes after neonatal UVR were used to construct networks for UVR-induced gene expression changes at a confidence value of 0.9 using the STRING resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org">https://string-db.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). At 6 hr after UVR exposure, one can see strong significant evidence of ribosome biogenesis occurring, with downregulation of various metabolic pathways compared to control untreated skin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). At 10 hr, post-UVR metabolic activity is still suppressed, but DNA replication is either already occurring to some extent, or about to occur for repair and reconstruction of damaged cells. Upregulated p53 signaling was also observed. At 24 hr post UVR various pathways involved in cell proliferation (ribosomes and translation, metabolism) and reconstruction (extracellular matrix, metabolism) are significantly activated in the epidermis. One of the problems with using whole tissue is that one cannot discriminate in terms of cell type. As a way to put the skin gene expression into some perspective we wanted to look at skin gene expression changes at some days after UVR, since it is known that this period corresponds with an influx of immune cells into the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zaidi et al., 2011</xref>) and the influx of melanocytes into the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walker et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we separately studied gene expression in the neonatal epidermis and dermis harvested at 3d after UVR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). There was a striking loss of immune markers in the epidermis, mostly reflecting UVR-induced migration of epidermal Langerhans cells to the dermis as expected. We also saw a strong gene expression cluster for genes involved in melanogenesis, reflecting the presence of melanocytes in the UVR-exposed epidermis, but not in control skin at the time-point 3 d after UVR. In the dermis, we observed networks reflecting increased cellular activity, in particular upregulation of kinases and interferon-induced enzymes. But in contrast to the epidermis, in the dermis we also observed a signal for myeloid cells, presumably reflecting the influx of macrophages, which occurs maximally at around this time post UVR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handoko et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42424.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Gene expression networks induced by UVR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gene network analysis showing at various time-points after neonatal UVR the top 500 genes (all p&lt;0.05) deregulated in UVR-treated neonatal epidermis versus untreated (from the same mouse on the side blocked with electrical tape).

Hence in addition to the susceptible CC strains carrying a missense mutation in the putative <italic>Rrp15</italic> causal allele, the fact that it is the only candidate that responds to neonatal UVR adds weight to it being the best candidate in the linked genomic region. Our gene expression analysis was performed on whole skin, epidermis, or dermis, rather than individual cell types, allowing signals from a number of cells types, for example keratinocytes, immune cells, and melanocytes, to be taken into account. Since <italic>Rrp15</italic> is expressed virtually ubiquitously in the skin we do not know whether its mode of action in accelerating UVR-induced melanoma would be cell intrinsic or extrinsic. But we note that in a study of UVR-treated cultured melanocytes, ribosome metabolism was the most significantly altered pathway at 6, 12, and 24 hr after UVR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">López et al., 2015</xref>), as in our whole skin studies.

As expected changes in <italic>RRP15</italic> gene expression are correlated with ribosome biogenesis, but also many other aspects of cell behavior, including DNA damage recognition and repair, transcription, and splicing. Defects in any of these processes could in theory explain why MM is accelerated by UVR exposure not only in mouse strains which carry germline <italic>Rrp15</italic> variants, and putatively in humans also.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mechanism by which melanoma is accelerated by UVR</title><p>Since genetic background greatly influenced whether or not MM was accelerated by neonatal UVR, we studied various effects of UVR a few days after exposure on traits that may differ between susceptible and resistant strains. These included the rate of removal of UVR-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), influx of inflammatory neutrophils and macrophages, and the proliferation of melanocytes (increase in melanocyte number in the epidermis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We again used readily-available laboratory strains (AJ, B6, DBA, FVB, NOD, 129 s), four of which are CC founders. For all six, we determined the median age of onset of MM after neonatal UVR. We chose time-points 1, 4, and 7 days post UVR. In C57BL/6 mice, CPDs are generally removed by d4 after UVR, certainly by d7. Neutrophils generally infiltrate the skin by d1 after UVR and numbers decrease by d4. Macrophages are maximally present at 4d (39). At 4d, melanocytes have migrated to the epidermis in response to UVR, macrophages are at their maximum number, roughly concurrent with maximum epidermal melanocyte density. By the d7 post UVR time-point, the skin is ostensibly returned to normal, but in some mouse strains there may be a delay in some measures.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42424.008</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Immune and melanocyte proliferative responses post UVR in different mouse strains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Parameters measured post UVR in different mouse strains.

However, there was great variation between the various strains in the size and timing of the melanocyte and myeloid cell responses after UVR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To ascertain whether the level of any of these responses could be correlated with age of MM onset, we compared results for the lab strains stratified in terms of whether they carry the susceptible or resistant allele at chr.1 (e.g. around <italic>Rrp15</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). When compared in this way none of these commonly purported mechanisms by which UVR exacerbates MM were significantly associated with onset of UVR-induced MM, although we found a non-significant trend for the susceptible strains to show higher levels of neutrophil influx at d1 after UVR. As an additional assessment, we performed a correlation test between MM age of onset and the phenotypes measured and found no significant correlation, although d1 neutrophil infiltration was nearest to significance.</p><p>If one accepts that the low number of strains compared (3 vs 3) makes it difficult to attain statistical significance for a mechanism with a complex milleiu of events, one could argue that neutrophil influx may have an effect on exacerbating MM.

We injected blocking antibody at 1d before UVR, the day of UVR, and 2d after UVR. First we assessed neutrophil depletion after three injections by taking skin sections and staining with neutrophil-specific anti-myeloperoxidase antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Anti-Ly6g treatment significantly depleted neutrophil influx after neonatal UVR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We exposed two cohorts of <italic>Cdk4::NRAS</italic> mice to anti-Ly6g anti-neutrophil depleting Ab, or PBS control respectively, then performed a longitudinal study for MM age of onset, but saw no difference in the age of onset of MM between cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, inhibition of the neutrophil influx did not suppress UVR-induced genesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>There are likely to be multiple and interacting mechanisms which might explain how UVR exposure could initiate or accelerate different types of MM. We have used a mouse MM model to study the development of MM on many CC strain backgrounds. The <italic>Cdk4::NRAS</italic> model we used is a well-characterized model of UVR-induced MM, and in terms of an acceleration of MM onset after neonatal UVR it behaves similarly to other models which carry constitutive oncogenic mutations in melanocytes (e.g. the <italic>Mt-Hgf</italic> model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noonan et al., 2001</xref>). But, surprisingly, we found that MM was not accelerated in a model carrying an inducible <italic>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></italic> mutations in its melanocytes. It is known that modes of engineered oncogene expression in melanocytes can influence other phenotypes also. For example, Braf<sup>V600E</sup> induced in melanocytes <italic>in utero</italic> is incompatible with embryonic viability (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dankort et al., 2009</xref>), whereas in a non-inducible transgenic Braf<sup>V600E</sup> models it is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wurm et al., 2012</xref>). We do not know why MM was not accelerated in the inducible Braf<sup>V600E</sup> model, but one possibility is that there may be simply more activated melanocytes in the neonatal <italic>Tyr-NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup></italic> transgenics at the time of UVR exposure since NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup> is expressed <italic>in utero</italic>, whereas Braf<sup>V600E</sup> is induced only for a short period of 3 days before UVR (i.e. P1-P3). We favour such an explanation rather than a mechanistic difference between the respective oncogenes (<italic>Braf</italic> vs <italic>NRAS</italic>) per se, since in another similar inducible Braf<sup>V600E</sup> model repeated UVR exposures significantly accelerate MM when the oncogene is activated at 4 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goel et al., 2009</xref>). In a model using inducible <italic>Trp53</italic> deletion instead of constitutive <italic>Cdk4<sup>R24C</sup></italic> we found that UVR accelerated MM, but whether <italic>Trp53</italic> was deleted before or after UVR was inconsequential. This could be somewhat akin to the work of the Evans laboratory who showed that although TP53 is very important in helping modulate the acute DNA damage response to radiation, its function in this period does not contribute to protecting against transformation, in fact it is only within the long lag phase leading to cancer development that TP53 acts as a tumour suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Christophorou et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, mouse models appear to differ with respect to whether and by how much neonatal UVR accelerates MM. There is no perfect animal model for ‘generalized’ MM, but one would expect that the <italic>Cdk4::NRAS</italic> transgenic in combination with the CC should provide useful information as to how genetic background can influence UVR-induced murine MM.</p><p>Age of onset of spontaneous MM across the CC was underpinned by germline variation in the <italic>Prkdc</italic> gene on chr.16. This is overwhelmingly the best candidate in the mapped interval as the mutation carried on the 129S susceptibility allele has been functionally validated in other mouse models of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Degg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodwin et al., 2015</xref>). Although it is known to be involved in recognition and removal of DNA damage, it is unclear whether its function in MM would be cell intrinsic or extrinsic, since it is ubiquitously expressed in skin cell types. In addition, this is quantitative genetics, and although the QTL explains a large proportion of the phenotypic variation, other cooperating loci may also exist, for instance on chr.5, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which might become statistically significant (or disappear) if more CC strains were tested. In terms of possible human relevance, other genes (e.g. <italic>PARP1</italic>, <italic>APEX1</italic>) involved similarly in DNA repair, and whose expression is correlated with that of <italic>PRKDC</italic> in human skin, are associated with population-based MM risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duffy et al., 2018</xref>). Thus <italic>PRKDC</italic> may be an example of a modifier of MM in mice, but mediated by other genes of the same pathway in humans. But the mechanistic result of <italic>Prkdc</italic> deregulation might be similar to the effects of deregulating MM risk genes like <italic>PARP1</italic> and <italic>APEX1</italic>, that is, all ultimately influencing DNA repair. Hence our genetic screen appears to have revealed mechanistically relevant information, notwithstanding that the particular causal gene variants can be different between mouse and man. One can also consider <italic>Prkdc</italic> as a MM modifier gene, that is, our genetic screen detects MM modifiers in the context of a mouse model which carries a germline <italic>Cdk4</italic> variant. In keeping with this, <italic>PRKDC</italic> was also one of the few DNA repair genes associated that modified MM risk in MM-prone families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liang et al., 2012</xref>), many of which carry a <italic>CDKN2A</italic> mutation, and a few <italic>CDK4</italic> mutation. If we assume that <italic>Cdk4::NRAS</italic> mice may in some respects be ostensibly a model for familial MM, the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liang et al., 2012</xref> further support the possible relevance of our findings in human disease.</p><p>One of the most striking findings from our study was that the genetic polymorphisms modifying MM onset were very different between spontaneous and UV-induced disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This is particularly notable since in this model MM is accelerated by just a single UVR exposure. The age of onset of neonatal UVR-induced MM in the transgenic-CC progeny across the CC was linked to a chr.1 locus containing a strong candidate, <italic>Rrp15,</italic> with a missense mutation. Taken together with the fact that of the candidates within the linked region, only <italic>Rrp15</italic> was significantly differentially expressed between susceptible and resistant strains, only <italic>Rrp15</italic> was upregulated in the epidermis of neonatal skin after UVR exposure (at 24 hr), we deemed it the strongest candidate. In addition, gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis of UVR-induced gene expression changes in neonatal mouse skin revealed that ribosome biogenesis is one of the major gene networks upregulated at 6 and 24 hr after UVR. One caveat here is that for the UVR-induced gene expression studies we used whole epidermis (or dermis). Notwithstanding that there are differences in melanocyte and immune cell density over time between 1 and 3 d after neonatal UVR, most of the signal would have come from keratinocytes at all time- points since they are the most numerous cells in the epidermis. But our analysis of UVR-induced gene expression changes, based upon fold-change, are sensitive enough to pick up gene networks that reflect predictable changes in melanocyte and immune cell density (although not the type of immune cells). <italic>Rrp15</italic> is expressed in all cell types within the neonatal skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), but we do not know whether its mode of action in modifying melanocyte transformation is cell autonomous or non-cell autonomous. We assume that the upregulation of ribosomal metabolism we observe at 24 hr after UVR reflects mostly changes in keratinocytes, but very similar responses have also been found in UVR-treated cultured melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">López et al., 2015</xref>). Single cell sequencing of different skin cells may help resolve these problems, but even such methods also have their drawbacks including unwanted gene expression changes induced soon after removal of cells from their microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42424.009</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation showing candidate genes within QTLs regulating melanoma age of onset in mice.</title><p>Figure also shows putative mechanisms which accelerate melanoma in either the spontaneous or UVR-induced contexts. Germline gene variation influencing double strand break recognition and repair probably throughout the life of the animals controls spontaneous MM development. Germline gene variation influencing ribosome function and protein synthesis either during the acute damage repair period after neonatal UVR, or perhaps during the lag period leading to tumour initiation, explain acceleration of MM by UVR.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42424-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We have used inferences taken from a variety of sources, which are by themselves not confirmatory, to build a strong case for a role for variation in <italic>Rrp15</italic> function influencing the propensity for UVR to accelerate MM. There is some evidence that SNPs near <italic>RRP15</italic> are also associated with human MM in some contexts. The world melanoma genetics consortium found such evidence using a method for candidate genetic association to detect variants that may not reach genome-wide statistical significance after correction for multiple testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schoof et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wurm et al., 2012</xref>). There was no information on individual sun exposure in the tested cohorts. Of the 39 immune-related genes tested, SNPs near <italic>LGAL3</italic> and <italic>TGFB2</italic> were the most significantly associated with MM risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rendleman et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, the <italic>RRP15</italic> and <italic>TGFB2</italic> genes are located adjacent to one another and just 7 kb apart. Which of the two is the causal gene is difficult to elucidate in the human genetics study, but our systems analysis work using the CC has allowed us to build a very strong case for <italic>Rrp15</italic>.</p><p>We discovered that genetic background dramatically influences the propensity for melanocyte transformation after UVR. As well as discovering a gene likely to be associated with this, we also examined differences in skin responses between susceptible versus resistant mouse strains. We did not observe major differences in the propensity for removal of UVR-induced CPDs, nor in melanocyte proliferation, nor macrophage influx. We observed a weak correlation with the number of skin-infiltrating neutrophils at d1 after neonatal UVR and UVR-induced MM onset. However, depleting neutrophils before and after neonatal UVR did not reduce the time of onset of MM, somewhat in line with our previous finding that depletion of macrophage infiltration also did not abrogate the MM-accelerating effect of UVR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Handoko et al., 2015</xref>). It could be argued that by using immunohistochemical staining to assess removal of UVR-induced CPDs we could miss subtle differences between mouse strains in the repair process that may be consequential in terms of leaving a molecular memory of UVR damage in the transformed cells. But even our exome sequencing on the neonatal UVR-induced mouse melanomas does not suggest a major role for UVR-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Researchers tend to look for measurable skin responses to UVR exposure to try to understand how melanocytes may be destabilized and ultimately transformed by DNA damage. The ‘usual suspects’ include defective DNA repair, photo-immunosuppression, inflammation, and cell proliferation, which are observable in the days following exposure. These can all enhance carcinogenesis in specific contexts. But our results suggest that earlier events in the few hours post UVR such as aberrant ribosome activity that can cause inappropriate protein expression, may be more important. It is not clear whether this would be acting during the acute damage repair period after neonatal UVR, or during the lag period leading to tumour initiation. The notion of a particular constellation of gene networks that vary between CC strains and confer resistance to the MM-accelerating effects of UVR may not be dissimilar to what occurs in amphibians, where regenerating limbs, but not non-regenerating body parts, are resistant to carcinogen-induced cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sarig and Tzahor, 2017</xref>), despite the fact that both anatomical sites incur the requisite DNA damage. Particular molecular networks within skin cells in the MM-resistant strains appear to work against transformation, despite animals from all strains being exposed to high levels of UVR-induced damage. Hence in keeping with the fact that even non-cancerous human skin can carry UVR signature mutations in cancer genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martincorena et al., 2015</xref>), incorrectly repaired UVR-induced DNA damage leading to somatic mutation is in essence necessary but not sufficient to exacerbate MM, and the presence of germline variants for melanoma susceptibility and resistance is very important. Biological systems (e.g. skin and skin UVR responses) are very complex and varied across a population of different individuals. Our systems analysis strategy has attempted to harness such complexity and in doing so has resulted in the discovery of some potentially important findings with regards UVR-induced melanoma. We have performed a genetic screen for natural genes regulating MM age of onset and found surprisingly that different genes mediate spontaneous and UVR-induced MM susceptibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We have identified a strong candidate genes and potential mechanisms in both cases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Cdk4-R24C</td><td valign="bottom">PMID:11606789</td><td> </td><td>crossed onto FVB/N background</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>NRAS-Q61K</td><td valign="bottom">PMID:11606789</td><td> </td><td>crossed onto FVB/N background</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>p53F/F</td><td>PubMed: 10783170</td><td>008361 - B6;129S4-Trp53&lt;tm5Tyj&gt;/J - The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>crossed onto FVB/N background</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Braf-V600E</td><td>PMID: 17299132</td><td>017837 - B6.129P2(Cg)-Braf&lt;tm1Mmcm&gt;/J - The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>crossed onto FVB/N background</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Tyr-Cre ER</td><td>16676322</td><td>012328 - B6.Cg-Tg(Tyr-cre/ERT2)13Bos/J - The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>crossed onto FVB/N background</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Collaborative Cross resource</td><td>Geniad Pty Ltd, and the Animal Resource Centre (ARC), Western Australia</td><td> </td><td>Mice descended from eight founders generated as recombinant inbred stock</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Diversity Outbred mouse resource</td><td>Geniad Pty Ltd, and the Animal Resource Centre(ARC), Western Australia</td><td> </td><td>Mice descended from eight founders generated as outbred stock</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>skin samples from mouse subjects</td><td>Animal Resource Centre(ARC), Western Australia</td><td> </td><td>C57B6, NOD, A/J, 129s mouse strains</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti F4/80 from CD68 rat monoclonal antibody</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Abcam 6640, CI: A3-1 (Cambridge,UK)</td><td>for macrophages. 1:400 dilution</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti Sox10 goat polyclonal</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnologies</td><td>SC-17342 (N-20) Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas Tx, USA)</td><td>for melanocytes. 1:200 dilution</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Monoclonal anti-thymine dimer, Clone H3</td><td>Sigma Aldrich</td><td>Anti-Thymine dimer Clone H3 (T1192), Sigma Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA)</td><td>for Cyclobutane pyrmidine dimers. 1:400 dilution</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Ly6G Rat anti-neutrophil monoclonal antibody</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Anti-Ly6G rat monoclonal antibody Abcam ab2557:Clone NIMP-R14 (Cambridge, UK)</td><td>for Neutrophil staining (1:400 dilution) and <break/>depletion (undiluted)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-MPO</td><td>Abnova</td><td>Abnova rabbit anti-MPO Clone 14328 (Taipei, Taiwan)</td><td>for Neutrophils after neutrophil depletion 1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Vector NovaRed Peroxidase Substrate kit</td><td>Vector Laboratories</td><td>SK-4800, Vector Laboratories (CA, USA)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Mouse expression array</td><td>Illumina</td><td>Illumina TotalPrep RNA amplification, Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression Beadchips</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>RNA sequencing</td><td>Illumina</td><td>Illumina mRNA kit, Illumina HiSeq with 50bp single reads</td><td>RNA-seq samples mapped to mouse genome MM10 using TopHat2</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>RNA isolation kit</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>Rneasy Kit</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Geneminer platform</td><td>Geneminer</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://130.95.9.22/Geniad2/">http://130.95.9.22/Geniad2/</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">Ram R, Morahan G.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jeffrey Settleman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, this manuscript addresses an important point regarding the etiology of melanoma in terms of UV versus non-UV related mechanisms. It makes excellent use of mouse genetics to identify QTLs associated with spontaneous versus UV generated melanoma. This has very important implications for the field, as it would suggest that different methods would be needed to target these two types of melanoma. Overall, all the reviewers were enthusiastic about the work and feel it makes an important contribution to the field. We would like the authors to address a few concerns, as detailed below, prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1: have the tumors been tested to demonstrate that the expected mutations have been activated by Cre-mediated recombination? Since this is a somewhat unexpected result it would provide more confidence for the investigators to show that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> is expressed, and that p53 is knocked out as predicted.</p><p>2) One significant concern with the paper is the experiment on the skin gene expression changes after neonatal UVR. For this experiment, the gene expression was tested in skin, epidermis, and dermis whole tissues. Melanocytes only make up a very small fraction of skin (~1%); ~85% of skin is keratinocytes; and the immune infiltrate is expected to be highly heterogeneous. These factors make the gene expression analysis in the above whole tissues highly unreliable and indiscernible. It is not clear whether any useful conclusions can be made out of such gene expression analyses, especially in the absence of any validation studies. At a minimum, the authors should state the fraction of cells in the skin that are melanocytes versus other cells, or at least address this point in their Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42424.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1: have the tumors been tested to demonstrate that the expected mutations have been activated by Cre-mediated recombination? Since this is a somewhat unexpected result it would provide more confidence for the investigators to show that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> is expressed, and that p53 is knocked out as predicted.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has a good point. We have now included data and explanations in the manuscript which better show that the genes were included/deleted. However we did not test the tumours for expression of these genes, since they could be inadvertently switched off or lost by deletion in a tumour (this might particularly apply to p53). The proof that tamoxifen is deleting the respective genes instead comes from comparisons of the mice without tamox treatment, when the mice do not develop melanoma at all (in the case of Braf), or much slower, in the case of p53.</p><p>In terms of the Braf model, which carries the Cdk4 (constitutional) and Braf (melanocyte-specific) mutations, we have never seen a melanoma, with or without UVR, in <italic>Cdk4<sup>R24C</sup></italic> mice without an accompanying melanocyte-specific Ras pathway mutation (Hacker et al., 2006, we have added this reference to the manuscript). Hence none of the Cdk4-Braf mice develop melanoma at all unless tamox is applied, and so Braf<sup>V600E</sup> must be activated in the mouse melanocytes in our study. We have updated the text in the first paragraph of the Results section to explain this.</p><p>Likewise, with respect to the <italic>p53floxed::TyrCre::Tyr-NRAS</italic> mice, they develop melanoma much more rapidly after tamox treatment than without, showing that p53 must be knocked out. See Figure 1C, which now shows the age of onset of animals not treated with tamox (essentially NRAS only), compared to those treated with tamox (essentially <italic>p53-null::NRAS</italic>). This is shown for both spontaneous and UVR-induced melanoma, and the second paragraph of the Results section, along with Figure 1E, is now amended accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One significant concern with the paper is the experiment on the skin gene expression changes after neonatal UVR.

In essence we explain that we do not know the mode of action of potential causal gene(s) such as <italic>Rrp15</italic>, i.e. is its action cell or non-cell autonomous, and that we have taken data from a variety of sources and experiments to build our case for it. We also add that there is no perfect method of gene expression analysis, and that even methods based upon gene expression analyses using disaggregated single cells also have their drawbacks. Hence we have to glean information on skin gene expression from where we can. Skin cell type quantitation: we now state in the manuscript that keratinocytes are by far the most common cell type in skin, but we did not attempt a quantitation since the proportion of keratinocytes could be higher after UVR-induced epidermal thickening, and certainly the number of melanocytes and immune cells changes greatly between 1 and 3 days after UVR.</p></body></sub-article></article>
