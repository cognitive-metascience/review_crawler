A direct comparison of light-induced O<sub>2</sub> reduction (Mehler-like reaction) under high (3% CO<sub>2</sub>, HC) and low (air level CO<sub>2</sub>, LC) inorganic carbon conditions demonstrated that the Flv1/Flv3 heterodimer is solely responsible for an efficient steady-state O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction under HC, with <italic>flv2</italic> and <italic>flv4</italic> expression strongly down-regulated. Conversely, under LC conditions, Flv1/Flv3 acts only as a transient electron sink, due to the competing withdrawal of electrons by the highly induced NDH-1 complex. Further, in vivo evidence is provided indicating that Flv2/Flv4 contributes to the Mehler-like reaction when naturally expressed under LC conditions, or, when artificially overexpressed under HC.

All FDPs share two conserved structural domains: the N-terminal metallo-<italic>β</italic>-lactamase-like domain, harboring a non-heme diiron center, where O<sub>2</sub> and/or NO reduction takes place; and the C-terminal flavodoxin-like domain, containing a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) moiety. The structures of FDPs in anaerobic prokaryotes and eukaryotic protozoa have been resolved as homooligomers (dimer or tetramer comprised of two dimers) arranged in a ‘head-to-tail’ configuration, so that the diiron center of one monomer and the FMN of the other monomer are in close proximity to each other, which ensures rapid electron transfer between the two cofactors.</p><p>C-type FDPs, specific to oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, hold an additional flavin-reductase-like domain, coupled with extra cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Romão et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Folgosa et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter, <italic>Synechocystis</italic>) possesses four genes encoding FDPs: <italic>sll1521</italic> (Flv1), <italic>sll0219</italic> (Flv2), <italic>sll0550</italic> (Flv3) and <italic>sll0217</italic> (Flv4). Recently resolved crystal structure of truncated Flv1 from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> revealed a monomeric form with a ‘bent’ configuration, however the organization of the additional flavin-reductase-like domain and the oligomeric structure remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borges et al., 2019</xref>). Photosynthetic FDPs first gained attention in 2002, when recombinant <italic>Synechocystis</italic> Flv3 protein was shown to function in O<sub>2</sub> reduction to water without producing ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vicente et al., 2002</xref>). Later, it was demonstrated that <italic>Synechocystis</italic> Flv1 and Flv3 proteins function in vivo in the photoreduction of O<sub>2</sub> downstream of Photosystem (PS) I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helman et al., 2003</xref>). Since then, extensive research has been performed to reveal the crucial function of Flv1 and Flv3 (and their homologs, FLVA and FLVB in other photosynthetic organisms) as a powerful sink of excess photosynthetic electrons. This safeguards PSI and secures the survival of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms under fluctuating light intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allahverdiyeva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaux et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jokel et al., 2018</xref>) or under short repetitive saturating pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimakawa et al., 2017</xref>). The Flv1- and Flv3-mediated light-induced alternative electron transport to O<sub>2</sub> was named as the Mehler-like reaction, being a widespread pathway, operating in nearly all photosynthetic organisms from cyanobacteria up to gymnosperms, but lost in angiosperms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allahverdiyeva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ilík et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The Flv2 and Flv4 proteins are encoded by an operon, together with a small membrane protein, Sll0218. The <italic>flv4-sll0218-flv2</italic> (hereafter <italic>flv4-2</italic>) operon is strongly induced in low inorganic carbon, C<sub>i</sub>, (atmospheric 0.04% CO<sub>2</sub> in air, LC) and high light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). The operon structure is highly conserved in the genome of many <italic>β</italic>-cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bersanini et al., 2014</xref>). The <italic>flv4-2</italic> operon-encoded proteins have been reported to function in photoprotection of PSII by acting as an electron sink, presumably transporting electrons from PSII or the plastoquinone (PQ) pool to an unknown acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bersanini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chukhutsina et al., 2015</xref>). Since <italic>flv2</italic>, <italic>sll0218</italic> and <italic>flv4</italic> are co-transcribed, the contribution of each single protein of the operon to PSII photoprotection has been difficult to dissect. Recent data examining distinct and specific roles of the Flv2/Flv4 heterodimer and the Sll0218 protein (using a set of different mutants deficient only in Sll0218 or in Flv2 and Flv4) demonstrated that the majority of observed PSII phenotypes were actually due to the absence of Sll0218, thus leading to the conclusion that Sll0218 contributes to PSII repair and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bersanini et al., 2017</xref>). However, the exact donor and acceptor of the Flv2 and Flv4 proteins have not yet been identified in vivo and possible cross-talk between all four FDPs has yet to be revealed, thus limiting our understanding of the function of FDPs on a cellular level.</p><p>In this work, to shed light on the in vivo function of Flv2 and Flv4 and to clearly separate the function of the Flv1/Flv3 heterooligomer from that of Flv2/Flv4, we employed a specific set of FDP mutants. These were: (i) the ∆<italic>flv1</italic>/∆<italic>flv3</italic> mutant, deficient in both Flv1 and Flv3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allahverdiyeva et al., 2011</xref>); (ii) ∆<italic>flv2</italic> which does not express the Flv2 protein but retains a low amount of Flv4 and WT levels of Sll0218 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>); (iii) ∆<italic>flv4</italic> which is deficient in the accumulation of all three <italic>flv4-2</italic> operon proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>); (iv) ∆<italic>sll0218</italic> which lacks the small Sll0218 protein, but expresses the Flv2 and Flv4 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bersanini et al., 2017</xref>); (v) ∆<italic>flv3</italic>/∆<italic>flv4</italic> which is deficient in all four FDPs, whereby the absence of Flv3 results in a strong decrease in Flv1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mustila et al., 2016</xref>) and the inactivation of ∆<italic>flv4</italic> affects the expression of the whole <italic>flv4-2</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>); and, finally (vi) the <italic>flv4-2</italic> operon overexpression strain, <italic>flv4-2/</italic>OE, expressing high amounts of Flv2, Flv4 and Sll0218 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bersanini et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we provide in vivo evidence for Flv2/Flv4 mediated O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction in one of the most frequently studied cyanobacterial model organisms, <italic>Synechocystis</italic>.

The expression of <italic>flv4</italic> and <italic>flv2</italic> under LC was found to be regulated by the pH of the growth media, with significant downregulation observed under strongly alkaline pH conditions.

Nevertheless, a direct comparison of the efficiency and kinetics of the Mehler-like reaction in HC- and LC-acclimated cells has not been reported, thus the contribution of different FDPs to O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction has been difficult to assess. Our initial approach to evaluating the contributions of the different FDPs was based on determining the activity of the Mehler-like reaction in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cells grown under LC and HC (3% CO<sub>2</sub>) conditions, at pH 8.2.</p><p>After a shift from darkness, WT cells demonstrated a rapid light-induced O<sub>2</sub> uptake under both LC and HC conditions (59 ± 6.4 and 56 ± 6.4 <italic>µ</italic>mol O<sub>2</sub> mg Chl <italic>a</italic><sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>, respectively). This fast induction phase is designated as {I} in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>. Yet, the kinetics of O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction in LC-grown cells differed from those grown under HC. In the LC-grown WT cells, the fast induction phase {I} was followed by a clear biphasic quenching of O<sub>2</sub> reduction, namely by the strong decay phase {II}, which continued for about one minute, followed by a quasi-stable state, phase {III} (~33 ± 5.9 <italic>µ</italic>mol O<sub>2</sub> mg Chl <italic>a</italic><sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) during illumination. Contrasting this, in HC-grown WT cell, the light-induced O<sub>2</sub> reduction rate achieved in phase {I} declined only slightly during the first 2–3 min (from ~56 ± 7.7 to~48 ± 6.3 <italic>µ</italic>mol O<sub>2</sub> mg Chl <italic>a</italic><sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>).

The M55 mutant cells (grown under LC, pH 8.2 conditions) demonstrated a fast induction of O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction (phase I) similar to the WT, which continued at steady-state, lacking the second phase of O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction after the dark-to-light transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

However, the reported reaction rate was extremely low (almost residual) compared to the activity of FDP for example from anaerobic protozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Matteo et al., 2008</xref>) and the enzyme showed no affinity to NADPH. A similar scenario was previously presented for the Flv3 protein, where in vitro studies performed on recombinant <italic>Synechocystis</italic> protein led to a claim that Flv3 functions as a homodimer in NADH-dependent O<sub>2</sub> reduction (very low affinity to NADPH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vicente et al., 2002</xref>), whilst subsequent study with ∆<italic>flv1-</italic>OE<italic>flv3</italic> (or ∆<italic>flv3-</italic>OE<italic>flv1</italic>) mutants clearly demonstrated that homooligomers of Flv3 (or Flv1) do not function in O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mustila et al., 2016</xref>). Such discrepancies between the in vitro and in vivo results suggest that the in vitro assays conducted thus far have apparently failed to take into full consideration all the complex intracellular interactions, for example the involvement of Fed or FNR as an electron donor for FDPs, or the in vitro experiments do not necessarily demonstrate the processes occurring in vivo.</p><p>In this study, we provide compelling evidence for the in vivo contribution of Flv2/Flv4 to O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction by applying <sup>18</sup>O-labeled-oxygen and real-time gas-exchange measurements to distinct FDP deletion mutants.

In addition, the possibility that the small protein Sll0218 contributes to the Mehler-like reaction is excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that both the ∆<italic>flv2</italic> (deficient in Flv2 but retaining a low amount of Flv4) and ∆<italic>flv4</italic> (deficient in both Flv2 and Flv4) mutants showed similar inhibition of O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction rates, thus supporting the function of Flv2/Flv4 as a heterodimer in the Mehler-like reaction.

Despite detection of homotetrameric organization of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> Flv3 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mustila et al., 2016</xref>), the direct biochemical demonstration of homo- or heterotetramer structures and function in vivo is still missing.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45766.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A schematic drawing of photosynthetic light reactions and alternative electron transport routes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A steady-state Mehler-like reaction in HC is carried out by the low-abundant, yet catalytically efficient Flv1/Flv3 heterodimer. The Flv3/Flv3 homooligomer is involved in photoprotection as an electron valve with unknown acceptor or as a component of a signaling/regulating network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mustila et al., 2016</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) In LC-grown cells the two pairs of FDP heterodimers are involved in the Mehler-like reaction: Flv1/Flv3 mainly drives rapid and transient O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction and Flv2/Flv4 operates relatively slowly and provides a steady-state background O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction. The soluble Flv1/Flv3 heterodimers function as an immediate acceptor of electrons presumable from reduced Fed, whereas association of Flv2/Flv4 with the thylakoid membrane (and/or Flv1/Flv3) is controlled by <italic>pmf</italic> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Several oligomeric forms of FDPs are hypothesized to exist, including a heterotetramer comprising different FDP protein compositions. The higher abundance of total NDH-1 complexes and FDPs oligomers in LC conditions, compared to HC conditions, is represented by larger size of the protein complexes.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45766-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The growth inhibition of ∆<italic>flv1/</italic>∆<italic>flv3</italic> cells under severe fluctuating light conditions (FL 20/500) at pH 8.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allahverdiyeva et al., 2013</xref>), pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mustila et al., 2016</xref>), pH 6 and pH 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) demonstrate the essential role of Flv1 and/or Flv3 during drastic changes of light intensity, whereas Flv2 and Flv4 are dispensable under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the crucial importance of Flv1/Flv3 heterodimers is based on their high capacity to rapidly and effectively respond to increasing light intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). By adjusting their O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction activity, the Flv1/Flv3 heterodimer works as an efficient and fast sink of electrons, whereas the responsiveness of Flv2/Flv4 is relatively limited and the heterodimer mostly functions on a slow time-scale in steady-state O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction.</p><p>The intracellular location of these enzymes may partially contribute to the difference in O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction: Flv1 and Flv3 are soluble cytosolic proteins able to quickly associate with soluble Fed and direct electrons towards O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction. In line with this, the possible interaction between <italic>Synechocystis</italic> Flv1, Flv3 and Fed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanke et al., 2011</xref>), Flv3 and Fed9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cassier-Chauvat and Chauvat, 2014</xref>), <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> FLVB and FED1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peden et al., 2013</xref>) have been reported. The Flv2/Flv4 heterodimer, specific for cyanobacteria, was suggested to bind to the thylakoid membrane upon increases in Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration on the cytoplasmic surface of the thylakoid membrane when lights are turned on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). It is likely that the association of Flv2/Flv4 with the membrane enhances electron transfer from Fed (or FNR) to Flv2/Flv4 and would probably result in a delayed and limited O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction activity by Flv2/Flv4. However, the possibility that FDPs accept electrons from different and specific Fed paralogs cannot be excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Traffic downstream of PSI affects the FDP-mediated Mehler-like reaction</title><p>Unlike WT cells demonstrating biphasic decay kinetics of O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction under LC conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the M55 mutant (deficient in NDH-1 mediated CET, CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and respiration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohkawa et al., 2000</xref>) shows steady-state O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction, similar to the HC-grown WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). This suggests that the strongly upregulated NDH-1 complex under LC in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>) contributes to a rapid quenching of O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, phase {II}) by efficient withdrawal of electrons from reduced Fed. Under such circumstances, the low but steady-state activity of the Flv2/Flv4 heterodimer is likely to be important for keeping linear electron transport in an oxidized state. This would explain why the PQ-pool is more oxidized in the presence of Flv2/Flv4 and more reduced in its absence, indirectly affecting PSII activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bersanini et al., 2014</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chukhutsina et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, by allocating different roles for FDPs between the two pairs of heterodimers (Flv1/Flv3 and Flv2/Flv4), the cells are well positioned to respond appropriately to changing C<sub>i</sub> levels as well as to abrupt changes in light intensity, in a coordinated and energetically efficient manner.</p><p>Unlike prokaryotic cyanobacteria, chlorophytic algae (<italic>e.g. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>) and mosses rely not only on the FDP-driven pathway, but also harbor the PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5 (PGR5)/PGR5‐LIKE PHOTOSYNTHETIC PHENOTYPE 1 (PGRL1) pathway which operates concomitantly to protect the cells under fluctuating light. It is noteworthy, however, that the PGR5/PGRL1 machinery in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> is neither fast nor strong enough to mitigate acceptor-side pressure under highly fluctuating light intensities. To complement this deficiency, the FDP-mediated pathway is indispensable for coping with sudden increases in light intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jokel et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the introduction of <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> FDPs rescues a fluctuating light phenotype of the PGR5 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamamoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamamoto and Shikanai, 2019</xref>), and alleviates PSI photodamage in the PGR5-RNAi, <italic>crr6</italic> (defective in NDH-dependent CET) and the PGR5-RNAi <italic>crr6</italic> double mutants of <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> by acting as a safety valve under fluctuating light and substituting for CET without competing with CO<sub>2</sub> fixation under constant light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wada et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the expression of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> Flv1 and Flv3 in tobacco plants enhances photosynthetic efficiency during dark-light transitions by providing an additional electron sink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gómez et al., 2018</xref>). Although data on Flv2/Flv4 proteins expressed in angiosperms is not yet available, our results collectively suggest that the FDP pathway(s) is important to consider in future high-yield crop development and microbial cell factories.</p><p>The question of how FDPs avoid competition with CO<sub>2</sub> fixation is an interesting one.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers carefully evaluated your interesting work and concluded that the manuscript is currently too preliminary for publication. They particularly pointed out that data on O<sub>2</sub> evolution would be necessary to validate your conclusions on O<sub>2</sub> uptake. It is the policy of <italic>eLife</italic> to avoid lengthy re-review processes with uncertain outcomes. Therefore, we decided to reject the paper at this stage. Please find the specific reviewer comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors analyze the functions of FLVs to catalyze Mehler reaction in S.6803 using MIMS. The reviewer cannot find any novel thing of FLVs in their physiological functions. Helman et al. (2003) already reported that FLVs catalyze O<sub>2</sub>-dependent electron flow in vivo using MIMS. Furthermore, the authors in the present manuscript already reported the functions of FLV2/4 to catalyze Mehler reaction. As an important, serious issue, the authors did not show any data for 16 O<sub>2</sub> evolution in PSII, which reflects the electron flux in photosynthetic linear electron flow in vivo. The reviewer cannot understand why the authors did not show these data. The 162-evolution rate greatly affects photosynthetic electron transport rate. Miyake'group already showed the deficiency of FLV suppresses photosynthetic linear electron transport rate, and also suppresses CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent photosynthesis rate (Shaku et al., 2016). The deficiency of FLV induces the reduction of plastoquinone pool, which suppresses Q-cycle. This fact is known as RISE (Shimakawa et al., 2018). The authors did not test the possibility of RISE to regulate the activity of Mehler reaction. That is, the 16O<sub>2</sub> evolution rate regulates 18O<sub>2</sub>-uptake rate in PSI.

But when I started reading the new version I came across, in the fifth paragraph of the Results, that mutant M55 was grown under low level of CO<sub>2</sub>. This isn't a typo error – in their reply to the reviewers we read:</p><p>Q: You are most probably correct but unlike mutant M55 the HC grown WT cells possess some NDH1, isn't it?

We have modified the sentence.</p><p>This mutant, originally raised by Teruo Ogawa many years ago, was characterized by its high CO<sub>2</sub> requiring phenotype. It can only grow under very high CO<sub>2</sub> level. One may grow it under high CO<sub>2</sub> and then exposed to a lower one, this is fine. This could be the case in the earlier version though not define, but this is clearly not the case here. Possibly, under the stressing conditions it went through suppression mutations and is now able to grow under low CO<sub>2</sub> level. You may ask the authors whether it is also able to grow on glucose (the original M55 mutant can't). The authors must re-sequence the mutant and find the suppression mutation. We can't proceed evaluating the manuscript unless we know what the nature of the mutation was and unless they compare the data shown here with those obtained in a high-CO<sub>2</sub> requiring M55 mutant, they may have to construct it again.</p><p>Further, unlike earlier studies it is proposed that FLV2 and 4 take part in light-dependent O<sub>2</sub> uptake. In view of the possibility that their growth conditions promoted accumulation of secondary mutations I examined the sequences of flv2 and 4 in cyanobase to find that it is unlikely that NADPH could bind there, questioning their conclusion. I am not clear whether they actually tested NADPH-dependent O<sub>2</sub> uptake in vitro, shown to be very low in a study from another group. Given the in vitro results in the literature it is unlikely that FLV2 and 4 really take part. If they do I would test the sequence here too.</p><p>Altogether, while I can't recommend further assessment of the present version I strongly recommend resequencing of M55 mutant and their WT, it may end up with exciting results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Some aspects regarding the revised manuscript need to be addressed.</p><p>In Figure 1—source data 2, column G, the gross O<sub>2</sub> uptake rate (µmol O2.mg Chla -1.hr-1) is shown.

Thus indicating that the absence of ∆flv1/∆flv3 as well as of ∆flv4 impacts O<sub>2</sub> evolution. This should be considered in the respect of differences in O<sub>2</sub> uptake and in regard to protection of the photosynthetic machinery. In this line, also data for PSII and PSI functionality at the different light intensities should be presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45766.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>The editorial decision letter and the comments of reviewer #1 and reviewer #3 clearly show that the main reason for a rejection of the manuscript is the absence of gross O<sub>2</sub> production data.

There is no in vivo evidence on Flv2/Flv4 contribution to O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction (Mehler-like reaction) in Helman et al., 2003. Moreover, we have not published nor hypothesized that Flv2/4 could be involved in the Mehler-like reaction (if this is what the reviewer criticizes with his confusing comment above “…the authors in the present manuscript already reported the functions of FLV2/4 to catalyze Mehler reaction”, and what we indeed are reporting now in the present manuscript). As to the Helman et al. paper, it describes O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction in experimental cultures grown under high CO<sub>2</sub> level (HC, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> bubbled in air), where the expression of the <italic>flv4-flv2</italic> operon is strongly downregulated (Zhang et al., 2009; Hackenberg et al., 2012, and Figure 1C in the present paper).

The reviewer cannot understand why the authors did not show these data. The 162-evolution rate greatly affects photosynthetic electron transport rate. Miyake'group already showed the deficiency of FLV suppresses photosynthetic linear electron transport rate, and also suppresses CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent photosynthesis rate (Shaku et al., 2016). The deficiency of FLV induces the reduction of plastoquinone pool, which suppresses Q-cycle. This fact is known as RISE (Shimakawa et al., 2018). The authors did not test the possibility of RISE to regulate the activity of Mehler reaction. That is, the 16O<sub>2</sub> evolution rate regulates 18O<sub>2</sub>-uptake rate in PSI. Therefore, the authors should show 16O<sub>2</sub> evolution rate in the mutants used in the present manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with both reviewers (reviewer #1 and #3) that the presentation of the gross O<sub>2</sub> production would be necessary to show for validation of the O<sub>2</sub> reduction results. In fact, we always monitor simultaneously the O<sub>2</sub> production and O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates during all the MIMS experiments. Since no drastic differences in the O<sub>2</sub> evolution rates were observed between the wild-type and the Flv mutants, we did not present the O<sub>2</sub> production data, and instead, tried to focus primarily on the Mehler-like reaction. However, we completely agree with the reviewers that, even though the O<sub>2</sub> production rates were found not to change, this data should be added to the manuscript in order to facilitate the interpretation of obtained O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction data and the conclusions made in the manuscript. We have now added this data and discuss the gross O<sub>2</sub> values in the WT and the Flv mutant strains (Results section and the Figure 1—source data 2).</p><p><italic>About RISE</italic>. We have used, as reviewer # 2 stated, “the best available technique” to study the Mehler-like reaction. The in-direct methods (<italic>e.g</italic>.

Do you see a conservative NADPH binding motif in FLV2 or 4 or does it rely on NADH under LC?</p></disp-quote><p>Two in vitro studies have been performed on recombinant <italic>Synechocystis</italic> Flv3 or Flv4 proteins purified after expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Vicente et al., 2002, Shimakawa et al., 2015). Both studies claim that Flv3 (Vicente et al., 2002) or Flv4 (Shimakawa et al., 2015) function as a homo-dimer in O<sub>2</sub> reduction. However, in both cases the enzyme activity is only residual (0.38 min<sup>-1</sup> for Flv3, 20 min<sup>-1</sup> for Flv4 compared to 40 s-1 of the Flv activity in <italic>Giardia</italic>). Moreover, studies have shown either little (Vicente et al., 2002) or no affinity (Shimakawa et al., 2015) to NADPH, a reducing equivalent produced by photosynthetic linear electron transport. Many years of work in our laboratory and in several other laboratories have shown that the isolation of functional Flvs from photosynthetic organisms is an extremely difficult task and so far none of the laboratories has managed to isolate highly active Flvs from photosynthetic organisms. Therefore, we believe that in vitro experiments were not reflecting a real situation. in vivo experiments clearly demonstrate that homooligomers cannot function in O<sub>2</sub> uptake (Mustila et al., 2016).</p><p>Since, no crystal structures of the Flvs from oxygen evolving photosynthetic organisms are available (except recent structure of the truncated Flv1 lacking a flavodoxin-like domain, Borges et al., 2019), it is not possible to confidently conclude about the NADH or NAPDH preference just based on the amino acid sequence and homology searches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What sets the kinetic limitation on the FLVs to avoid NADPH dissipation and hence inhibition of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation?

PCC 6803. This organism possesses four FDPs (Flv1-4) essential for photoprotection of photosynthesis. The authors conclude that Flv2/Flv4 contribute to the Mehler-like reaction under defined conditions. Moreover, it is suggested that O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction via Flv2/Flv4 occurs down-stream of PSI in a coordinated manner with Flv1/Flv3. The data as provided by the authors appear to support their conclusions.</p><p>However, a fundamental problem with this manuscript is that only O<sub>2</sub> uptake rates are provided. As rate and extent of O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction/uptake is also dependent on the capacity of light-driven photosynthetic electron transfer leading to O<sub>2</sub> evolution, also O<sub>2</sub> evolution rates need to be specified for the different conditions and mutants by using MIMS. For the moment it is not possible to exclude that differences observed in O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction rates are simply due to difference in capacity of photosynthetic electron transfer, which in turn affects O<sub>2</sub> uptake.</p><p>It would be important to determine the ratio of O<sub>2</sub> evolution versus O<sub>2</sub> uptake for the different conditions and mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the presentation of the gross O<sub>2</sub> production would be necessary for validation of the O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction results. We have simultaneously monitored both the O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction and O<sub>2</sub> production during all the MIMS experiments and the data have been added to the revised manuscript. Importantly, no significant difference in the gross O<sub>2</sub> evolution rates was observed between the wild-type and the FDP mutants.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers are still very reserved and asked for further clarifications. They are particularly worried about the low O<sub>2</sub> evolution rate of M55 and propose O<sub>2</sub> evolution measurement in phase1 to substantiate the drawn conclusions. They are also generally concerned about the M55 mutant background, because the original mutant cannot grow under low CO<sub>2</sub> levels, but does so under your condition.</p><p>Please, have also a look at the specific reviewer comments below, which may guide you to revise your manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>You may remember/note that my criticism of the earlier version was the modest among the three reviewers and that I recommended to accept their appeal. But when I started reading the new version I came across, in the fifth paragraph of the Results, that mutant M55 was grown under low level of CO<sub>2</sub>. This isn't a typo error – in their reply to the reviewers we read:</p><p>Q: You are most probably correct but unlike mutant M55 the HC grown WT cells possess some NDH1, isn't it? It is able to utilize glucose, unlike M55.</p><p>A: Yes, that is right, we are sorry for non-clarity. We have modified the sentence.</p><p>This mutant, originally raised by Teruo Ogawa many years ago, was characterized by its high CO<sub>2</sub> requiring phenotype. It can only grow under very high CO<sub>2</sub> level. One may grow it under high CO<sub>2</sub> and then exposed to a lower one, this is fine. This could be the case in the earlier version though not define, but this is clearly not the case here. Possibly, under the stressing conditions it went through suppression mutations and is now able to grow under low CO<sub>2</sub> level. You may ask the authors whether it is also able to grow on glucose (the original M55 mutant can't). The authors must re-sequence the mutant and find the suppression mutation. We can't proceed evaluating the manuscript unless we know what the nature of the mutation was and unless they compare the data shown here with those obtained in a high-CO<sub>2</sub> requiring M55 mutant, they may have to construct it again.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern of the reviewer 2 related to the background of the strains. Indeed, in the original paper it was shown that M55 cannot grow under air level CO<sub>2</sub> (Ogawa T. 1991 “A gene homologous to the subunit-2 gene of NADH dehydrogenase is essential to inorganic carbon of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PCC 6803”, PNAS 88:4275–427). However, in this paper the growth experiment was performed with very diluted cell culture (OD<sub>730</sub>=0.03) and at relatively high light intensity (120 umol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). It is not surprising that M55, the mutant strain deficient in important bioenergetic processes such as C<sub>i</sub> assimilation, respiration and cyclic electron transfer, shows strong growth retardation under such stressful condition.</p><p>Most importantly, the same author later published 2 papers where he precisely described the growth characteristics of the M55mutant. In both papers it is clearly shown that the M55 mutant is able to grow (at a slower rate compared to WT) under air level CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (pH 8.0) in liquid medium and on BG-11 agar plates under moderate light intensity of 60 umol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (see Ohkawa, Price, Badger, Ogawa “Mutation of <italic>ndh</italic> genes leads to inhibition of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake rather than HCO3−uptake in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. strain PCC6803”, 2000, Journal of Bacteriology p. 2591–2596, in Figure 3 and Figure 4; Ohkawa, Pakrasi, Ogawa ‘Two types of functionally distinct NAD(P)H Dehydrogenases in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. strain PCC6803’ 2000 JBC 275, p. 31630-4; in Figure 1).</p><p>There are a bunch of papers where M55 was grown under air level CO<sub>2</sub>, high pH conditions. In our lab, we routinely cultivate M55 at pH 8.2 at air level CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g. Zhang et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2012).</p><p>Following the suggestion of the reviewer 2, we performed a growth trial with M55 in the presence of 5mM glucose + 10uM DCMU. As expected, <italic>M55 was unable to grow under photoheterotrophic conditions</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), which is in line with the previous observations of photoheterotrophic growth deficiency of M55 (Ohkawa et al., 2000b in Figure 1, Zhao et al., 2015 in Figure 5). Moreover, we have cultivated the M55 strain at air-level CO<sub>2</sub> at pH 8.2 and we were able to reproduce the results published in Ohkawa et al., 2000<italic>a</italic>, where M55 demonstrates slower growth compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Photoheterotrophic growth of wild-type (WT) and M55 cells on BG-11 agar plates.</title><p>The WT and M55 mutant cells of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> were resuspended in BG-11 median at pH8.2.

Five millimolars of Glucose and 10 μm DCMU were added to the plates for photoheterotrophic growth (right side) or were not added for photoautotrophic growth (left side).

Considering the fact that M55 was generated decades ago, there is no doubt that many other mutations have likely occurred during the cultivation but in respect of Ci assimilation and respiration, which is the focus of this manuscript, we still observe the original phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, unlike earlier studies it is proposed that FLV2 and 4 take part in light-dependent O<sub>2</sub> uptake. In view of the possibility that their growth conditions promoted accumulation of secondary mutations I examined the sequences of flv2 and 4 in cyanobase to find that it is unlikely that NADPH could bind there, questioning their conclusion. I am not clear whether they actually tested NADPH-dependent O<sub>2</sub> uptake in vitro, shown to be very low in a study from another group. Given the in vitro results in the literature it is unlikely that FLV2 and 4 really take part. If they do I would test the sequence here too.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason why earlier studies did not link the Flv2 and Flv4 proteins to the light-induced O<sub>2</sub> uptake is simple: the Flv2 and Flv4 deletion mutants were not probed by MIMS (previous works from our lab) or high CO<sub>2</sub> grown mutant cells were used in the experiments (Helman et al., 2003). Since, under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions the <italic>flv4-sll0218-flv2</italic> operon is strongly downregulated, the similar phenotype between WT and the Flv2 and Flv4 deletion mutants is logical (Helman et al., 2003 and in this manuscript in Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We believe that re-sequencing here is unnecessary. Involvement of Flv2 and Flv4 in the light induced O<sub>2</sub> uptake is solid: the ΔFlv2/4 lacks light-induced O<sub>2</sub> uptake, whereas the Flv2/4 overexpression strain demonstrates significantly increased O<sub>2</sub> uptake (see Figure 1 in this manuscript). In our lab we are well aware that secondary mutations frequently occur in cyanobacteria. In order to keep the original genome pool, we maintain our strains in cryogenic freezers, carefully avoid long-term handling and frequently start new cultures from the original cryo-stored stocks.</p><p>As reviewer pointed out “…it is proposed that FLV2 and 4 take part in light-dependent O<sub>2</sub> uptake”. Indeed, this is one of the main messages of this paper and how we revealed the involvement of Flv2 and Flv4 in light-induced O<sub>2</sub> uptake in vivo, is thoroughly discussed and explained. Therefore, we firmly believe that our observations do not require further supporting experiments.</p><p>Confidentconclusions about the absence or presence of NAD(P)H-binding sites, based solely on the amino acid sequence, are dubious. Well defined tertiary structural elements (see https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/IPR016040) form the NAD(P)H-binding motif and in the coordinative binding of NADPH, several amino acid residues take part all along the polypeptide. However, based on secondary structural element prediction and sequence conservation of NAD(P)H-binding proteins, attempts were made to predict NAD(P)H-binding (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/nadbinder/)and based on that, Flv4 might be able to bind NAD.</p><p>Importantly, both Flv4 and Flv2 conserve a Flavin reductase domain (IPR002563) at the C-termini, a domain found in NAD(P)H-flavin oxidoreductases. Moreover, the sequence similarity of Flv4 to Flv3 and of Flv2 to Flv1 (62% and 71% similarity, respectively) implies that Flv2/4 carries out similar reactions to Flv1/3. Besides, Flv3 and Flv1 conserve the same Flavin reductase domain as Flv2, and Flv4 (IPR002563) at the C-termini.</p><p>However, in the manuscript we do not make conclusion that Flv2/4 accepts electrons from NADPH. We hypothesize that Flv2/4 takes electrons from Fed or FNR (see Figure 7 in this manuscript) but for making such a strong conclusion, the in vitro assay with the recombinant proteins would be necessary. Unfortunately, we do not have functional recombinant protein (see our previous answer to the reviewers and the manuscript) therefore we cannot perform in vitro assays. Anyhow, the exact electron donor of Flv2/4 would only refine and not contradict our conclusions.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some aspects regarding the revised manuscript need to be addressed.</p><p>In Figure 1—source data 2, column G, the gross O<sub>2</sub> uptake rate (µmol O2.mg Chla -1.hr-1) is shown.

Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have added gross O<sub>2</sub> evolution data to Figure 1—source data 2. During the dark-to-light transition (Phase I), M55 demonstrates a slow induction of O<sub>2</sub> evolution. Indeed, in M55, the light-induced O<sub>2</sub> uptake is higher, whereas gross O<sub>2</sub> evolution is notably lower, compared to WT grown under the same condition.

Thus indicating that the absence of ∆flv1/∆flv3 as well as of ∆flv4 impacts O<sub>2</sub> evolution. This should be considered in the respect of differences in O<sub>2</sub> uptake and in regard to protection of the photosynthetic machinery. In this line, also data for PSII and PSI functionality at the different light intensities should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Involvement of Flv2 and Flv4 in photoprotection of PSII complex has been previously reported (Zhang et al., 2009, Hakkila et al., 2013, Bersanini et al., 2014, Chukhutsina et al., 2015, Bersanini et al., 2017), whereas the Flv1 and Flv3 proteins are linked mainly to photoprotection of PSI under fluctuating-light intensities (Allahverdiyeva et al., 2013). Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have performed new experiment, where the mutant strains grown at moderate light (50 µmol photons m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, same condition used in this work) were exposed to high-light (1500 µmol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) for 2 hours. PSII activity was probed as O<sub>2</sub> evolution in the presence of artificial electron acceptor, DMBQ and PSI was evaluated as maximum oxidazable P700, Pm (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). In the revised manuscript we shortly mention about the photoprotective role of FLVs under high light intensities.</p></body></sub-article></article>
