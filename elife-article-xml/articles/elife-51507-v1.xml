of the same chronological age (CA). Multiple BAs have been proposed and are well studied individually but not jointly. We included 845 individuals and 3973 repeated measurements from a Swedish population-based cohort and examined longitudinal trajectories, correlations, and mortality associations of nine BAs across 20 years follow-up. We found the longitudinal growth of functional BAs accelerated around age 70; average levels of BA curves differed by sex across the age span (50–90 years). All BAs were correlated to varying degrees; correlations were mostly explained by CA. Individually, all BAs except for telomere length were associated with mortality risk independently of CA. The largest effects were seen for methylation age estimators (GrimAge) and the frailty index (FI). In joint models, two methylation age estimators (Horvath and GrimAge) and FI remained predictive, suggesting they are complementary in predicting mortality.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Everyone ages, but how aging affects health varies from person to person. This means that how old someone seems or feels does not always match the number of years they have been alive; in other words, someone’s “biological age” can often differ from their “chronological age”.</p><p>Scientists are now looking at the physiological changes related to aging to better predict who is at the greatest risk of age-related health problems. Several measurements of biological age have been put forward to capture information about various age-related changes. For example, some measurements look at changes to DNA molecules, while others measure signs of frailty, or deterioration in cognitive or physical abilities. However, to date, most studies into measures of biological age have looked at them individually and less is known about how these physiological changes interact, which is likely to be important.</p><p>Now, Li et al. have looked at data on nine different measures of biological age in a group of 845 Swedish adults, aged between 50 and 90, that was collected several times over a follow-up period of about 20 years. The dataset also gave details of the individuals’ birth year, sex, height, weight, smoking status, and education. The year of death was also collected from national registers for all individual in the group who had since died.</p><p>Li et al. found that all nine biological age measures could be used to explain the risk of individuals in the group dying during the follow-up period. In other words, when comparing individuals with the same chronological age in the group under study, the person with a higher biological age measure was more likely to die earlier. The analysis also revealed that biological aging appears to accelerate as individuals approach 70 years old, and that there are noticeable differences in the aging process between men and women.</p><p>Lastly, when combining all nine biological age measures, some of them worked better than others. Measurements of methylation groups added to DNA (known as DNA methylation age) and frailty (the frailty index) led to improved predictions for an individual’s risk of death. Ultimately, if future studies confirm these results for measures from single individuals, DNA methylation and the frailty index may be used to help identify people who may benefit the most from interventions to prevent age-related health conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biological age</kwd><kwd>longitudinal

deteriorations occurring simultaneously at multiple levels, that is molecular, cellular, tissue- and organ-specific, in an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hayflick, 2002</xref>). Due to its complex nature, quantifying this process has long been a challenge. Chronological age (CA) records the passage of time and serves as a convenient metric of aging; however, people of the same CA manifest diverse aging-related phenotypes. Hence, biological age measurements (BAs), attempt to capture physiological changes along the aging course. Therefore, they can be used to assess health risks in individuals of the same age. Multiple BAs have been proposed, including omics-based clocks, clinical biomarkers, and assessments of functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jylhävä et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xia et al., 2017</xref>). One of the potential BAs, telomere length, is the length of a nucleotide sequence at the chromosomal ends, and represents the capacity for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mather et al., 2011</xref>). Epigenetic clocks comprise aging-related DNA methylation information from various genomic loci (i.e., CpG dinucleotides) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Horvath, 2013</xref>). Another composite score derived from clinical measurements and blood biomarkers can be viewed as a physiological age measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levine, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, organismal functioning status could reflect the biological aging process from various aspects, such as cognitive performance, physical functioning, and overall frailty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reynolds et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Finkel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Searle et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies found low to moderate correlations among different types of BAs, for example telomeres, epigenetic clocks, clinical biomarkers, and frailty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vetter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). However, few studies comparing BAs have taken mortality risk into consideration, and none of them have included more than three types of BAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murabito et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, to grasp more of the complex aging process, different types of BAs should be studied jointly in the same cohort. In addition, to capture changes over time, as in aging, it is imperative to study the same individuals longitudinally, yet there is a lack of studies comparing longitudinal profiles of multiple BAs in the same population.</p><p>Therefore, the present study aims to add to this knowledge gap in the field by examining longitudinal trajectories, correlations and associations to all-cause mortality using nine BAs in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Finkel and Pedersen, 2004</xref>). Here, telomere length, four types of DNA methylation age estimators (DNAmAges), physiological age, cognitive function, functional aging index (FAI), and frailty index (FI) have been measured repeatedly across 20 years follow up.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the present study, 845 individuals in SATSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Finkel and Pedersen, 2004</xref>), with at least one BA assessment at one In-Person Testing (IPT) occasion, were included. In total, there were nine IPTs conducted between 1986 and 2014, that is IPT1-3 and IPT5-10 (IPT4 was a telephone interview). At each IPT, a maximum of nine BAs were collected, resulting in 3973 BA measurements overall. A number of 288 persons had at least one IPT with complete BA information on all nine measurements (referred to as ‘complete measurement’ hereafter); in total, 612 complete measurements were included.

We observed longitudinal growth of functional BAs accelerated around age 70 and sex differences in the average levels of BAs across the age spectrum. All BAs were correlated to varying degrees and the correlation coefficients were attenuated after adjusting for CA. Of nine BAs, four DNAmAges, physiological age, and three functional BAs were associated with the risk of mortality individually, with the strongest effect size observed for DNAmGrimAge and FI. In particular, Horvath DNAmAge, DNAmGrimAge, and FI remained predictive of mortality in a multivariable model including all BAs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Longitudinal trajectories of BAs</title><p>As biological aging does not proceed at a constant pace across time, monitoring longitudinal trajectories of BAs using repeated assessments to depict the characteristics of the aging course is of great importance. We observed an accelerated change in the aging pace in functional BAs, which are in parallel with previous studies focused on trajectories of cognition, physical function, and frailty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Harris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zaninotto et al., 2018</xref>). This result indicates that an aged population may expect deteriorations of their functional performance to speed up as their age approach 70 years. In particular, we observed that the aging acceleration of cognition (cognitive function) and physical function (FAI) seemed to take place before age 70, while frailty (FI) went up at an increased rate after age 75. This evidence suggests that accelerated cognitive and physical dysfunctions are likely to arise prior to frailty’s, and corresponding interventions and screenings could aim at people of different ages accordingly.</p><p>In contrast to functional BAs, DNAmAges and physiological age accrued at a relatively constant rate. Due to their mode of construction, DNAmAges and physiological age were transformed into an age-calibrated scale in the unit of year. Thus, these BAs allow individuals to perceive an intuitive impression on their biological aging status by comparing BA with CA and have the potential to serve as a straightforward-to-use metric in the geriatric practice. However, in order to be clinically meaningful, they need to be validated on the individual level data as well. In addition, a drawback of this mode of construction is that it largely explains the linear shapes of the BA trajectories, making longitudinal BA characteristics less informative as the changes are constant. Another feature of physiological age is the strong correlation with CA; hence, it allows limited biology perception in prediction models on top of CA. This is again due to its mode of construction using a composite score of several biomarkers where each one, by definition, strongly correlates with CA. To improve construction models for BA, composite scores should balance the reliance on biological aspects and weight on CA.</p><p>Sex differences in aging are observed at multiple biological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oksuzyan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ostan et al., 2016</xref>). Most notably, women tend to present lower mortality but higher morbidity rates, especially at advanced ages, compared to men of the same age. We found that, compared to men, women presented lower molecular ages (telomere length and methylation age estimators) but higher functional ages (FAI and FI) across the age spectrum, indicating different medical needs are likely to be encountered for men and women. Meanwhile, we observed no evidence for shape differences in the BA trajectories (except for physiological age) by sex. This suggests that aging proceeded at a similar rate in men and women since midlife onwards. For physiological age, the shape difference was mainly observed at the end of the age spectrum and could be influenced by methodological issues as the construction of physiological age was done differently in men and women. Putting our results in the perspective of previous studies, we confirm earlier findings in women, such as better telomere status and worse frailty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartley et al., 2016</xref>). One possible explanation for the sex difference in FI is that men and women tend to present different self-perception on aging-related performances due to social and cultural considerations when self-reported data are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ostan et al., 2016</xref>). However, cognitive function and FAI incorporate objective measurements tested by trained nurses and both of them exhibited sex differences in the same direction. Hence, sex differences in the functional BA spectrum are not, or at least not exclusively, driven by social and cultural factors. Therefore, we suggest that sex differences should always be accounted for in studies of aging and, if possible, presenting stratified analyses should be encouraged.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Correlations of BAs</title><p>Aging is a complex process proceeding through interconnected biological mechanisms. BAs, in essence, are underlain by different sets of these mechanisms. Correlations of BAs could provide an idea of how one BA changes in accordance with another. We observed moderate to strong correlations between CA and all BAs, with the exception of telomere length, which was only weakly correlated with CA and the other BAs. These results are in line with previous research observing similar correlation pattern for 11 BAs, as well as low correlations between telomere length and other types of BA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belsky et al., 2018</xref>). As some degree of correlation between BAs is expected simply due to their relation with CA, we also investigated correlations between BA residuals, which by construction minimize correlation with CA. We found clear attenuation of the correlations between different types of BA residuals, that is methylation BAs and functional BAs as well as physiological age and telomere length. In other words, among individuals with the same CA, molecular BAs and functional BAs are only weakly associated. We interpret this as an indication that these categories largely reflect different aspects of the aging process.</p><p>After regressing out the effect of CA, we still observed weak to moderate correlations between DNAmAges. These DNAmAges were initially trained to capture methylome differences associated with various aging-related phenotypes, namely CA for Horvath and Hannum, Phenotypic Age for PhenoAge, and mortality risk for GrimAge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). Employing correlated surrogates and measuring the same aging hallmark of epigenetic alteration in the development of these DNAmAges could partly explain the correlations observed among these residuals. Hierarchical clustering suggested GrimAge and PhenoAge were somewhat separated from the other two DNAmAges, which is expected as GrimAge and PhenoAge incorporate additional information on top of CA in the development of their BA algorithms. In addition, Horvath and GrimAge were the least correlated DNAmAge residuals, indicating that these two BAs captured uncorrelated methylome information to a larger degree than other DNAmAges did and might have the potential to inform aging-related outcomes independently (as illustrated in the results of nine-BA survival analyses).</p><p>Functional BA indicators included cognitive function, FAI, and FI, which quantify cognitive, physical, and frailty-related functioning. Intriguingly, the present analysis found comparable levels of correlation for these BAs as well as for their residuals, suggesting that most of these correlations were not simply driven by CA. Previous studies have also reported correlations between physical function, cognitive function, and health-related quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim, 2016</xref>). As functional BAs measure complex phenotypes resulting from intricate biological mechanisms, further investigations are needed to disentangle the mechanisms underlying both the age-dependent and, in particular, the age-independent correlations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>BA-mortality associations</title><p>A majority of the included BAs are well-established aging indicators and were found to be associated with mortality in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shamliyan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>). Our results were comparable to the current evidence. We first examined the baseline value of individual BAs in relation to the risk of death and found associations for all BAs except for telomere length, with DNAmGrimAge and FI demonstrating the strongest relationship. We next examined BA-mortality associations with all BAs included in the same model and observed significant evidence for Horvath DNAmAge, DNAmGrimAge, and FI, suggesting they were complementary in the prediction of mortality. In other words, Horvath DNAmAge, GrimAge and FI were likely to capture aging-related information that was both informative in the prediction of mortality risk and independent of other BAs. DNAmAges (Hannum and PhenoAge) and functional BAs (cognitive function and FAI) were likely to reflect some mortality-associated aging aspects that were shared and/or correlated with other BAs, as the corresponding HRs were attenuated to almost one when all BAs were included in the model.</p><p>Few studies have focused on the comparison of the predictive aspect of BAs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al. (2017)</xref> found FI to outperform methylation age estimators in survival models by comparing only two types of BAs, frailty, and DNAmAge (Horvath). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al. (2017)</xref> developed a methylation-based mortality score and observed a stronger mortality association than the FI-mortality relationship. Furthermore, Murabito and colleagues compared clinical age, inflammatory age, and DNAmAge (Horvath and Hannum) and concluded that they were complementary in predicting risk for mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murabito et al., 2018</xref>). Our study thus supports these findings, both in the way that mortality-oriented DNAmAges and FI were strongly associated with mortality, and in that certain types of BAs could reflect mortality risk independently. In particular, we add information by including other BAs, especially physiological age, a newly trained DNAmAge (GrimAge) and functional BAs.</p><p>Physiological age is a composite biomarker of aging, developed from 10 blood and clinical markers. Levine et al. applied a similar method to develop a BA indicator and found it associated with mortality beyond CA in a large US population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Klemera and Doubal, 2006</xref>). We also observed that physiological age predicted mortality risk independently of age, albeit weaker and at a moderate significance level. Despite its weak mortality association, physiological age presents some benefits with respect to the physiological interpretation and the search for biological mechanism in future explorations, as the component biomarkers contributed to the development of physiological age were explicitly specified.</p><p>DNAmGrimAge is derived via a two-step development method, in which methylation data were first used to predict a set of biomarkers (plasma proteins and smoking pack-year), and the methylation-based biomarkers were then used in the prediction of mortality risk. As a result, the DNAmGrimAge is explicitly trained to be a mortality predictor; it also includes the largest number of genomic sites compared with the other three DNAmAges, and allows the methylation level of a single CpG site to contribute to mortality risk via different intermediate biomarkers, as the methylation-based biomarkers used somewhat overlapping CpG sites in the two-step training phase. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al. (2019)</xref> reported the advantage of predicting mortality over other existing DNAmAges in a US population. These results point to the potential of utilizing methylation information to reflect complex aging phenotypes.</p><p>The FI is developed using clinical information and is likely to capture an organismal perspective on aging that is closer to the clinical end-point of death compared to molecular-based BAs. In addition, the FI incorporates information in multiple health domains, in contrast to the other two functional BAs, cognitive function, and FAI, which exclusively measure cognitive or physical performance. The comprehensive nature of the FI could partly explain the strong and robust mortality association observed here and in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kojima et al., 2018</xref>). Functional BAs, especially FI, measure not only the biological aging process, but also social and psychological wellbeing. Consequently, disentangling the underlying biological mechanisms from the functional measures would be challenging, which impairs the ability of functional BAs to explain the innate biological aging process. Specifically, it is difficult to implement functional BA measurements in animal models, whereas molecular BAs can be easily investigated in animal studies. Additionally, functional BAs in humans tend to show less heterogeneity among the young, making them less ideal instruments to assess the aging process among young adults, compared to using molecular BAs. This is especially true when it comes to FAI as it only takes four functioning indicators into account. However, FI considers a wide range of health deficits (42 in our case) and provides relatively precise scales to differentiate individuals with lower functioning scores. Furthermore, since biological, psychological, and social factors all contribute to the health status of human beings, the comprehensive nature of functional BAs also comes with important advantages for predicting aging-related outcomes, underlining the complementary nature of molecular and functional BAs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>In the subgroup analysis, we found moderate effect modification from age and smoking status. A previous study in a large Swedish cohort from our research group also observed that the effect size of FI with mortality was attenuated with increasing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>). DNAmGrimAge includes smoking (pack-year) associated CpG sites in its establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2019</xref>), which could partly explain a stronger association observed in smokers than non-smokers as it may capture smoking-based deterioration at the molecular level. In addition, the present results found a majority of the BA-mortality associations to be stronger in women compared to men, suggesting sex differences should be acknowledged in making use of BAs to inform clinically relevant decisions.</p><p>It is noteworthy that in comparing the strength of relative risk of mortality related to each BA, we were not aiming to propose any superior BA, as mortality association alone is by no means the gold standard for a qualified BA in aging research. Evidence exists that some BAs have advantages in predicting other aging-related outcomes such as entry into care (e.g., FAI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Finkel et al., 2019</xref>), which may be more relevant for developing policies and interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The present study has several strengths. First, we measured nine BAs in the same population from the molecular to the organismal level, which provided us an opportunity to examine BA characteristics from several molecular and functional aspects. Second, the BAs were assessed in a longitudinal manner to allow for descriptive and correlational analyses considering changes over time. Third, through the linkage to the Swedish national registers, we were able to keep track of study participants’ vital status for nearly 20 years, thus being able to predict the risk of death in relation to BA status prior to the occurrence of most aging-related outcomes.</p><p>Several limitations should be taken into consideration when interpreting the present findings. First, only individuals with complete measurements were included in the nine-BA survival models. Complete observations may not be a representative subgroup of the entire study population and lead to selection bias. However, IPT occasions with incomplete BAs were mostly due to administrative reasons, such as methylation data were only assessed in five waves since IPT3, and these factors are likely not related to subject-specific features. In addition, we replicated the one-BA survival models in individuals with complete measurements, and the results did not show major discrepancies. Second, the birth year of SATSA participants spanned a long period of time, from the year 1900 to 1948, thus raising concerns for cohort effects. During this time, improved medical conditions or emergent public health events could affect both BA and mortality risk and cannot be controlled merely through the age scale in the present analysis. All survival models were stratified by participants’ birth year in 10 year intervals to in part alleviate bias due to the cohort effect.</p><p>In summary, biological age is a construct built on molecular, cellular, and functional aspects of an individual´s health status and has the potential to change the way risk prediction is performed in the clinic. In the era of personalized medicine, individual health assessments are warranted and should rely on better methods than simply using the CA. In this study, we present the most comprehensive analysis of biological age in humans to date. We explain their correlations and longitudinal patterns. We highlight the sex-specific effects and point to the importance of providing sex-specific estimates in aging investigations and acknowledging sex-specific care in geriatric practices. Furthermore, we found BAs had the potential to provide mortality-relevant information independently of CA and independently of other types of BAs. Further studies are needed to investigate if the present findings could be extrapolated to a younger population, what the specific mechanisms underlying the BA correlations are, and possible modification effects on and between BAs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study population</title><p>The Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) was a population-based study consisting of reared apart and reared together twin pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Finkel and Pedersen, 2004</xref>).

BMI was assessed through physical examination and other covariates were acquired through self-reported questionnaire data. Educational attainment was classified as primary education, lower secondary or vocational, upper secondary education, and tertiary education. BMI was derived as the body mass divided by the square of body height, expressed in units of kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Smoking status was categorized as non-smokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers. Among the included individuals and measurements, 28 out of 846 individuals without education information were assigned into an unknown group, and another one and two individuals who missed the BMI and smoking status were imputed with the corresponding information collected from their nearest available IPTs.</p><p>Since the participants in the present analysis were born over a long period of time (1900 to 1948), we estimated the mortality associations with stratification on the calendar year of the participants’ birthday to avoid confounding from cohort effects. Individuals’ birth year was treated as a categorical variable with five groups in an interval of 10 years.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Assessment of mortality</title><p>All-cause mortality data, including vital status and dates of deaths, were obtained from linkages between the STR and Swedish Population Register through the personal identification number assigned to all residents. All-cause mortality data were updated on August 16, 2018.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Characteristics of baseline measurements were presented as means (standard deviations, SDs) and proportions. Longitudinal changes of BAs were presented in plots with individual level measurements illustrated by dots, lines, and broken lines. Average trajectories of BAs were estimated through mixed linear regression models as described above, each of which included fixed effects of the intercept, CA, and sex, and a random effect of intercept at the individual and twin-pair level. P-values for sex effects were obtained from fixed effects within the mixed linear model. In addition, an interaction term between each BA and CA in natural spline was introduced to the model, and P-values for sex interaction were determined by the likelihood ratio test comparing the models with and without the interaction term.</p><p>We estimated the repeated measures correlation coefficients between age and nine BAs using all complete measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakdash and Marusich, 2017</xref>). The correlation analyses were then replicated for CA and nine BA residuals to examine the correlations between the parts of BA residuals. We then transformed correlation coefficients to scaled squared Euclidean distances and performed hierarchical cluster analysis on BAs and BA residuals via Ward’s method.</p><p>We used the Cox regression model to estimate the association between baseline BAs and the risk of all-cause mortality. When repeated measurements were available, only the first BA assessment was included and referred to as the baseline BA. In all models, we used attained age as the underlying time scale and the five groups of birth year as strata. Left truncation and right censoring were accounted for in the estimations; that is individuals entering into the cohort is conditional on their survival at baseline ages, and follow-up time may stop before death occurs. Follow-up time started from the first available measurement (baseline measurement) and ended at the date when they died or were censored on August 16, 2018. In addition, robust standard errors were introduced to adjust for relatedness within twin pairs and subjects. To achieve a direct comparison of BA effects in relation to mortality risk, we standardized all nine BAs to the mean of zero and SD of one across all available measurements and replicated the transformation in the BA residuals, such that the estimated hazard ratios (HRs) could be interpreted as the relative risk of death associated with a one-SD increase in the level of BA or BA residual. In the first part of the survival analyses, all models accounted for only one BA (one-BA models). For those who had their BAs assessed for multiple times, the first available measurement was treated as the baseline measurement. For each BA, we estimated the association of BAs and BA residuals with mortality risk using two models, a univariate model and a multivariate model with sex, education, BMI, and smoking status as additional covariates. In the second part of the survival analyses, all nine BAs were accounted for altogether in the same survival model (multi-BA models). Similarly, two models with or without adjustment for common risk factors were estimated. Only BA residuals were taken into consideration in the second part of survival analyses to avoid biased results caused by collinearity within BAs.</p><p>P values were two-sided, and statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05. All analyses were conducted using Stata 15.1 and R 3.6.0.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All participants provided informed consent.

The study addresses the important question about validating promising human biomarkers of aging. The study stands out in terms of its scope (profiling many different biomarkers ranging from DNA methylation to frailty index), its large sample size: longitudinal assessments from n=845 individuals, long follow up times, and its rigorous statistical approach (linear mixed modeling for adjusting for dependencies). It carefully evaluates the latest molecular biomarkers (e.g. recent methylation based biomarkers) relates them to a hard outcome: time to death. The sensitivity analysis illustrates robustness. The discussion seems to be fair and is grounded on the results. The statistical analysis appears to be sound.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The advantages of this work are longitudinal (20-year) studies of several approaches to biological age estimation (nine measurements) at once, including data on mortality, in the same population.</p><p>Not sufficiently discussed is why a combination of these 9 marker groups was chosen?

What are their mean absolute errors?</p></disp-quote><p>a) The main objective of the present study is to investigate different types of biological ages (BAs) jointly. Therefore, we intended to include as many BAs as possible so that a range of BA types could be compared. As such, the nine BAs are selected mainly based on data availability and we have added the following sentence to the manuscript:</p><p>“Nine BAs were included in the present study based on data availability in SATSA.”</p><p>b) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we have scaled BAs to standard deviation (SD) units one by one and calculated the mean absolute error (MAE) pair by pair as mean absolute error (MAE) pair by paΣi=1n|BA1i-BA2i|, where BA1<sub>i</sub> and BA2<sub>i</sub> denote the levels of a pair of BAs in individual <italic>i</italic>, and <italic>n</italic> is the total number of individuals.</p><p>The pairwise MAEs are presented graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. The average differences between two BAs range from 0.64 to 7.34 (SD). The highest MAE was observed between FI and DNAmGrimAge.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title><bold/>Mean absolute errors of BA pairs.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51507-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As MAE quantifies the absolute difference between two continuous variables, it would be an efficient indicator if all the BAs were assumed to measure the same underlying process, i.e., if the expected relationship between each pair of BAs is the identity line y=x. However, both prior biological knowledge and our results suggest that telomere length, DNA methylation age estimators, physiological age, and functional BAs are likely to measure different aspects of the aging process. Thus, assuming all the BAs are growing in the same manner would be a rather unrealistic assumption and makes MAE a less informative measure to indicate the difference between the two BA measures of the different types</p><p>Considering that we have already reported correlation coefficients to provide the information of how different BAs agree with each other, we will not include the MAE results in the manuscript and only present the figure in the response letter for the reviewer’s reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How many persons have different longitudinal time points with all the nine?

We have expanded the methods description of the repeated measurement correlation in the manuscript to clarify this point:</p><p>“Using all complete measurements, we estimated repeated measures correlation (rmcorr, 22) between age and all nine BAs, which accounts for non-independence among observations and captures the common intra-individual association between age and each of the BAs in turn.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it possible to conclude that longer telomeres or shorter DNAmAge are practically not associated with physiological indicators of functioning (clinical end-points)? Could the authors emphasise this aspect of the results in the Discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed true that our results suggest molecular BAs are practically not associated with indicators of functioning (i.e., cognition, FAI, and FI) when we controlled for the age effect (Figure 2C). It can be interpreted that among the individuals with the same CA, molecular BAs and functional BAs are only weakly associated, and largely reflect different aspects of the aging process.</p><p>We have added the following sentences to emphasize this point in the Discussion section. Further interpretation regarding the characteristics of functional BAs in contrast to molecular BAs is detailed in the Discussion section (subsection “BA-mortality associations”, last paragraph).</p><p>“In other words, among individuals with the same CA, molecular BAs and functional BAs are only weakly associated. We interpret this as an indication that these categories largely reflect different aspects of the aging process.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this paper the authors assessed longitudinal measurements of multiple biological age in a population-based cohort from Sweden with long term follow-up.

However, the current data is underpowered to test such effects as the number of individual with at least two measurements are quite limited, especially when it comes to telomere length and DNAmAge estimators (Table 2). Investigating the longitudinal change of functional BAs (cognitive function, FAI, and FI) in relation to health-related outcomes could be less affected by the power issue and there are, in fact, some on-going works from our research group devoted to this topic. Therefore, we have decided to not touch upon the topic in the present analysis.</p><p>Author response table 2: Number of individuals by number of BA measurements</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable4" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" valign="top">Individuals with different number of measurement</td><td/><td colspan="4">DNAmAges</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Telomere length</td><td>Horvath</td><td>Hannum</td><td>Pheno <break/>Age</td><td>Grim <break/>Age</td><td>Physiological age</td><td>Cognitive function</td><td>FAI</td><td>FI</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">196</td><td valign="top">94</td><td valign="top">94</td><td valign="top">94</td><td valign="top">94</td><td valign="top">124</td><td valign="top">157</td><td valign="top">127</td><td valign="top">118</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">137</td><td valign="top">89</td><td valign="top">89</td><td valign="top">89</td><td valign="top">89</td><td valign="top">126</td><td valign="top">122</td><td valign="top">159</td><td valign="top">154</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">140</td><td valign="top">92</td><td valign="top">92</td><td valign="top">92</td><td valign="top">92</td><td valign="top">142</td><td valign="top">167</td><td valign="top">88</td><td valign="top">95</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4</td><td valign="top">106</td><td valign="top">80</td><td valign="top">80</td><td valign="top">80</td><td valign="top">80</td><td valign="top">114</td><td valign="top">91</td><td valign="top">76</td><td valign="top">63</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5</td><td valign="top">57</td><td valign="top">32</td><td valign="top">32</td><td valign="top">32</td><td valign="top">32</td><td valign="top">81</td><td valign="top">115</td><td valign="top">60</td><td valign="top">54</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">74</td><td valign="top">74</td><td valign="top">77</td><td valign="top">91</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">74</td><td valign="top">64</td><td valign="top">69</td><td valign="top">65</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">8</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">53</td><td valign="top">39</td><td valign="top">83</td><td valign="top">116</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">14</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Follow-up time for cognitive function and physiological age (and even FAI and FI) were obviously longer than follow-up time of other BAs, it therefore may not be appropriate to compare the strength of different BAs with mortality given that only the first BA assessment was included in the survival analysis.

Epigenetic clocks comprise aging-related DNA methylation information from various genomic loci (i.e., CpG dinucleotides) (Hannum et al., 2013; Horvath, 2013). Another composite score derived from clinical measurements and blood biomarkers can be viewed as a physiological age measure (Finkel et al., 2019; Levine, 2013; Reynolds et al., 2005; Searle et al., 2008). Furthermore, organismal functioning status could reflect the biological aging process from various aspects, such as cognitive performance, physical functioning, and overall frailty (Finkel et al., 2019; Levine, 2013; Reynolds et al., 2005; Searle et al., 2008).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
