They consist of tandem repeats of simple G- and T-rich sequences at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomeres shorten with repeated rounds of DNA replication, and this shortening is counterbalanced by the enzyme telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greider and Blackburn, 1985</xref>). Telomere lengths differ between species, but, in all healthy cells, length is maintained within a defined length distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greider, 1996</xref>). How this distribution of telomere lengths is established and maintained is not well understood. Yet the maintenance of the length distribution is crucial, as short telomeres signal a DNA damage response that limits cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">d'Adda di Fagagna et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enomoto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hemann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">IJpma and Greider, 2003</xref>). In human patients with defective telomere maintenance, short telomere syndromes manifest as degenerative diseases, including bone marrow failure and pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</xref>). Conversely, inappropriate telomere lengthening can contribute to immortalization of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Autexier and Greider, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greider, 1990</xref>) and to a predisposition to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McNally et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding the molecular basis of telomere length maintenance thus has important implications for human disease.</p><p>Evidence from a number of sources suggests that establishment of telomere length equilibrium is linked to DNA replication. Telomere elongation in yeast only occurs after passage of a replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dionne and Wellinger, 1998</xref>). Mutations in components of the replication fork alter telomere length in yeast; for example, components of lagging strand synthesis such as DNA polymerase α, RFC, Dna2, and Fen1, cause telomere elongation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greider, 2016</xref>). Further, DNA polymerases α and δ and DNA primase are all essential for de novo telomere addition by telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diede and Gottschling, 1999</xref>). The canonical yeast single-strand telomere end-binding complex, Cdc13/Stn1/Ten1, is considered a telomere-specific Replication Protein A (t-RPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2007</xref>). t-RPA interacts directly with DNA polymerase α and has been proposed to assist DNA replication through telomere repeats, which further links telomere length and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2010</xref>). Recent evidence indicating that the telomere binding protein Rif1 regulates telomeric origin firing suggested origin firing may regulate telomere elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greider, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Rif1 was first identified for its role in regulating telomere length. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> deletion of <italic>RIF1</italic> leads to extensive telomere elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hardy et al., 1992</xref>). This role of Rif1 in regulating telomere length is conserved in distantly related yeast such as <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kanoh and Ishikawa, 2001</xref>) and <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castaño et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Rif1 binds to telomeres through its interaction with the telomere-specific double-stranded DNA binding protein Rap1. Evidence that Rif1 regulates telomeric origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cornacchia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peace et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref>) helped explain the longstanding observation that telomeric origins fire late in S phase. Transplanting an origin sequence, which is known to fire early at its endogenous locus, to a telomere, caused that origin to instead fire late (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferguson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferguson and Fangman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wellinger et al., 1993</xref>). Further, cell synchronization showed that telomeres incorporate BrdU late in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raghuraman et al., 2001</xref>). These studies proposed that telomeric origins are ‘late origins’ or ‘dormant origins’, terms used to characterize telomeric origins that don’t fire at all in a given cell cycle. Rif1 binding to telomeres and repressing nearby origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peace et al., 2014</xref>) presented a nice explanation for the late replication of telomeric origins.</p><p>Several groups showed that the mechanism of Rif1 repression of origin firing works through its interaction with Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1, <italic>GLC7</italic> in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>). PP1 can dephosphorylate key substrates in the pre-replication complex (Pre-RC) including Mcm4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>) and thus block origin activation. DDK phosphorylation of Mcm4 is required for origin activation at the initiation of S phase, so PP1 antagonizes DDK phosphorylation to block origin firing. Rif1 recruitment of PP1 to repress origin firing is highly conserved across species including <italic>S. pombe</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mammalian cells, although the PP1 interaction motifs, RVxF and SILK, are located in a different region of the protein in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sreesankar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). This conservation of function indicates repressing origin firing is a core function of Rif1.</p><p>The conserved functions of Rif1 in both telomere length regulation and in repression of telomeric origin firing suggested the attractive hypothesis that origin firing may be directly linked to telomere length regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greider, 2016</xref>). To critically test this idea, we genetically manipulated origin firing and measured the effects on telomere length. We looked at several mutants known to affect origin firing: first, a <italic>RIF1</italic> mutant, <italic>rif1-pp1bs,</italic> which cannot recruit PP1, and therefore cannot repress origin firing; second, ∆N-dbf4 Cdc7 overexpression, a cell cycle stabilized DDK that increases DDK activity; finally, <italic>sld3-A mcm5-bob1</italic>, a double mutant that can bypass both the Rad53 inactivation of Sld3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zegerman and Diffley, 2007</xref>) and the DDK phosphorylation of Mcm5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hardy et al., 1997</xref>) to activate origins. In all three cases, telomeric origin firing was increased, and telomere length did not change. Finally, we looked at two <italic>RIF1</italic> mutants, <italic>rif1-∆1322</italic> and <italic>rif1<sub>HOOK</sub></italic>, which have long telomeres, and found that they did not change origin firing. Therefore, we conclude that the Rif1 function in telomere length regulation is separate from its function in PP1 recruitment and regulation of origin firing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Deletion of <italic>RIF1</italic> activates telomeric origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hafner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peace et al., 2014</xref>).

We determined origins had fired when the ratio of sequence reads S/G1 was increased in a 1 kb window around the midpoint of the confirmed origins in OriDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siow et al., 2012</xref>). As a control, we compared three independent <italic>WT</italic> sequencing runs and determined a similar extent of origin firing occurred in each pairwise comparison of all OriDB origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Since PP1 dephosphorylates Mcm4, we wanted to increase the level of Mcm4 phosphorylation by kinase overexpression. This phosphorylation is carried out by the Dbf4-dependent regulatory kinase (DDK), which requires both a catalytic subunit, Cdc7, and a regulatory subunit, Dbf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheu and Stillman, 2006</xref>). To further increase DDK activity, we used ∆N-dbf4, a cell cycle stabilized form of Dbf4 with an N-terminal 65 amino acid truncation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferreira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sullivan et al., 2008</xref>).

We have shown, using three unique genetic pathways: Rif1 mutations, DDK overexpression, and bypass mutants in the pre-RC, that activating telomeric origins is not sufficient to increase telomere length. While a very subtle effect on telomere length due to origin activation might not easily be resolved by a Southern blot, we predict that, if origin firing were linked to telomere length, then greater telomeric origin activation would lead to greater telomere elongation. To compare the increase in origin firing among the mutants, we computed a relative activation score for ARS608. The ratio of S phase activation of ARS608 relative to ARS607 in the mutants were normalized to that of the WT control to generate the relative ARS608 activation score (see Materials and methods). We found that <italic>sld3-A bob1</italic> and ∆N-dbf4 Cdc7 overexpression showed the highest relative activation scores, 24.36 and 25.83, respectively. ∆N-dbf4 overexpression alone had a score of 14.09, while <italic>rif1-pp1bs</italic> was 10.15 and <italic>rif1∆</italic> was 6.54.

Since telomere elongation is significant in <italic>rif1∆</italic> and this mutant has the lowest relative activation score of those that increase telomeric origin firing, we expect that the mutants with higher scores would show significantly long telomeres if origin firing is linked to telomere elongation.

The Diffley lab showed that, while <italic>sld3-A</italic> mutants activate some origins, there is an additive effect of mutating both <italic>sld3-A</italic> and <italic>bob1</italic>, indicating that independent mechanisms of activation can have an additive effect on origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In our analysis, the height of the peak at the origin is linked to the number of cells that fired the origin, while the width of the peak indicates how far the fork is able to travel in HU. This is emphasized in the origin firing graphs of <italic>sld3-A bob1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which have narrower peaks than seen in <italic>WT</italic> cells, since most origins fire but fork movement is limited by low nucleotide availability in HU. The fact that almost all origins fire demonstrates that, in <italic>sld3-A bob1</italic> mutants, origin firing is not limited by availability of replication complex factors.</p><p>PP1 interacts with Rif1 to regulate origin firing through dephosphorylation of Mcm4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>) and possibly other substrates. While all three methods that we used to activate origins: <italic>rif1-pp1bs</italic>, ∆N-Dbf4 overexpression, and <italic>sld3-A bob1</italic> mutations, resulted in increased Mcm4 phosphorylation, the level of Mcm4 phosphorylation did not correlate with the degree of origin activation. For example, <italic>rif1∆</italic> caused a higher increase in Mcm4 phosphorylation compared to both ∆N-dbf4 Cdc7 overexpression and <italic>sld3-A bob1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>); however, the activation of telomeric origins was much greater in both ∆N-dbf4 Cdc7 overexpression and the <italic>sld3-A bob1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This suggests that additional mechanisms, other than Mcm4 phosphorylation, likely also regulate dormant/telomeric origin firing. Our data supports the conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>) that there are independent pathways that activate origins, and activation of multiple pathways can result in a higher fraction of cells firing dormant origins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Rif1 regulates telomeric origin firing when not bound to the telomere</title><p>Rif1 was first identified as a protein that bound to yeast telomeres through its interaction with Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hardy et al., 1992</xref>). Yeast telomeres were known to replicate late in S phase, and when an early firing origin was relocated to a telomere, that origin then fired late (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferguson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferguson and Fangman, 1992</xref>). This suggested that the telomere location or telomeric chromatin causes inefficient origin firing. When Rif1 was discovered to regulate origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peace et al., 2014</xref>), the solution to the late replication of telomeres appeared simple: the high local concentration of Rif1 at the telomere could dephosphorylate Mcm4 (and likely other Pre-RC components) and block local telomeric origin firing. Our data, however, suggests this model is incomplete. We did not find activation of telomeric origins in <italic>rif1-∆1322,</italic> which lacks the Rap1 binding domain of Rif1. This <italic>rif1-∆1322</italic> C-terminal truncation has been shown to block interaction of Rif1 with Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2013</xref>) and cause loss of Rif1 telomeric localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hafner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hiraga et al., 2018</xref>). The lack of telomeric origin activation in the <italic>rif1-∆1322</italic> mutant was surprising, as we expected that release of Rif1 from telomeres would release PP1 repression near telomeres. However, in support of our conclusions, the same C-terminal truncation, in their work termed <italic>rif1-∆C594</italic>, also showed no effect on origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hiraga et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, a two amino acid substitution in Rif1 that disrupts the Rif1-Rap1 binding, <italic>rif1<sub>RBM</sub></italic>, showed some telomeric origin activation but not as significant as <italic>rif1∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hafner et al., 2018</xref>). Perhaps there are other functional domains that are deleted in <italic>rif1-∆1322</italic> that affect origin firing. Mutations in the HOOK region of Rif1 are proposed to disrupt a mechanism for binding of Rif1 to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mattarocci et al., 2017</xref>). We found that, while these mutations caused significant telomere elongation, there was no effect on telomeric origin firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Together, the observations that <italic>rif1<sub>HOOK</sub></italic> and <italic>rif1-∆1322</italic> showed no increase in Mcm4 phosphorylation or dormant/telomeric origin activation suggest that mechanisms other than telomere localization of Rif1 may be responsible for repression of dormant/telomeric origins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Rif1 regulation of origin firing is conserved while its role in telomere length regulation is not</title><p>Rif1 protein is conserved across a wide range of phyla and the role of Rif1 in replication timing is conserved from yeasts to <italic>Drosophila</italic> to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cornacchia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref>). In mammals, while the PP1 binding domain is located in the C terminal region of Rif1 rather than the N terminal region, the interaction with PP1 still regulates late replicating regions. New roles for Rif1 have also been identified in the stabilization and processing of double strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buonomo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Callen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Rif1 interacts with 53BP1 and the Shieldin complex to process double strand DNA breaks, which affects the choice between homologous recombination and NHEJ. This choice plays a major role in immunoglobulin class switch recombination, and thus loss of Rif1 has dramatic consequences for immunoglobulin rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Virgilio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silverman et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Notably, while many of these Rif1 functions in homologous recombination and NHEJ are conserved across phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fontana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mattarocci et al., 2017</xref>) and (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mattarocci et al., 2016</xref>), the role of Rif1 in telomere length regulation is not conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buonomo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silverman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu and Blackburn, 2004</xref>). Rif1 regulates telomere length in a subset of species including <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kanoh and Ishikawa, 2001</xref>), where it can interact with the telomere binding protein Taz1, and in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castaño et al., 2005</xref>), where it interacts with Rap1. This ability to interact with telomere binding proteins may have been acquired in yeasts, which imparted a new role in telomere length regulation in these species (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mattarocci et al., 2016</xref>). Remarkably, in yeast engineered to have a chromosome with TTAGGG telomere repeat sequence, to which Rap1 does not bind, telomere equilibrium is maintained, and Rif1 deletion has no effect on the length of this telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brevet et al., 2003</xref>). These data suggest that Rif1 regulation of telomere length is specific to settings where Rif1 interacts with the telomere binding proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>DNA replication and telomere length</title><p>We have shown that the function of Rif1 in regulating origin firing is separable from its function in regulating telomere length. Further, PP1 recruitment is not necessary for telomere length regulation. However, while origin firing is not linked to telomere length, there is still significant evidence linking components of the replication machinery to telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dionne and Wellinger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greider, 2016</xref>). Several studies have suggested a specific role of Rif1 in telomere length regulation. Rif1 has been shown to block telomere elongation at clustered telomeres in late S phase, which may be a clue as to how it negatively regulates telomere addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallardo et al., 2011</xref>). Shi et al. suggest that interactions of Rif1 and Rif2 together with Rap1 form a ‘molecular Velcro’ that blocks telomerase access to the telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). Hirano et al. suggest that both Rif1 and Rif2 block Tel1 recruitment to the telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hirano et al., 2009</xref>). Recent evidence indicates that Rif2 regulates Tel1 through catalytic modulation of the MRX complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hailemariam et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests a possibility that Rif1, like Rif2, might also have roles in telomere length regulation other than blocking Tel1 telomere localization.</p><p>The remarkable ability of distantly related species to maintain telomere length equilibrium argues for conserved core components of the regulatory process. Since yeast utilize defined sequence-specific origins while mammalian cells use a more stochastic mechanism to activate origins, perhaps it is not surprising that origin firing is not a major component of telomere length regulation. It would be hard to imagine how these two different methods of origin activation would both lead to well-regulated telomere length distributions. The identification of a telomerase-specific RPA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2007</xref>), which binds single-stranded telomeric DNA at the replication fork and interacts with telomerase, offers one alternative mechanism linking replication to telomere elongation. It is intriguing that Rif1, in addition to its role in regulating origin firing, stabilizes stalled forks and regulates fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Munden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). We currently do not know how Rif1 regulates telomere elongation; however, establishing that there are clear separable functions of Rif1 will allow dissection of the molecular mechanism of its telomere length regulation function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Lysates were spun for 10 min at 14k rpm, and 8 µl of the supernatant was resolved by gel electrophoresis along with 4 µl of Trident Pre-stained protein ladder (GeneTex GTX50875). Mcm4-2XFLAG phosphorylation, Dbf4-V5, and Cdc7-HA were resolved on 3–8% Tris-Acetate gels (Invitrogen EA0375) at 150V for 1 hr. Rif1-13XMyc was resolved on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen NP0322) at 200V for 1 hr. Mcm4-FLAG, Dbf4-V5, and Cdc7-V5 were transferred onto PVDF membranes using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad) using the pre-set 10 min high MW program. Rif1-myc gels were transferred onto PVDF membranes by NuPAGE XCell II Blot Module (EI9051) for 90 min at 30V. The membrane was blocked in Odyssey buffer (Li-Cor 927–40000) except when blotting for FLAG, in which case it was blocked in 1XTBS-T with 5% milk (Bio-Rad 170–6404). The αMyc antibody was used at 1:3000 (Santa Cruz 9E10 c-myc). αFLAG was used at 1:1000 (Sigma Aldrich M2 Flag F1804). αV5 was used at 1:2000 (Invitrogen R96025). αHA was used at 1:3000 (MilliporeSigma 12CA5 11583816001). αPgk1 was used at 1:10,000 (Invitrogen 22C5D8). Secondary HRP-conjugated αMouse antibody (Bio-Rad 1706516) was used at 1:10,000 in 5% milk 1XTBST. For Pgk1 we used SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo 34580), and for all other primary antibodies we used Forte HRP substrate (Millipore WBLUF0100).

Bioinformatics pipeline is detailed below.</p><p>For flow cytometry analysis, 500 µl of cells were collected in 750 µl of ice-cold water at the indicated time-points. Cells were collected and fixed in 1 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight at 4°C. The following day, cells were collected, washed in 500 µl of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH7.5 (NaCitrate), and resuspended in 500 µl of 100 µg/ml RNAseA in 50 mM NaCitrate pH7.5 and incubated at 50°C for several hours. Sytox Green (Thermo S7020) was added to a final concentration of 2.5 µM. Cells were stained in the dark at 4°C for at least 30 min to overnight. Cells were sonicated and strained through the filter cap into the FLOW tube (Thermo 877123). Flow cytometry data was collected on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).

Duplicates were marked and removed using Picard MarkDuplicates. Counts of sequence read coverage in 250 bp bins were computed using Bedtools Multicov and normalized to the total number of reads in each sample. The normalized S phase read count was divided by the normalized G1 phase read count to compute a BedGraph of the ratio of S to G1 phase read counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Relative copy number scores of each origin were computed by averaging the ratio of S to G1 phase read counts for 1 kb centered at each OriDB confirmed origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). <italic>WT</italic> value was subtracted from mutant value, and the resulting score was multiplied by 100.

between replication of the genome and the maintenance of telomere length has been of interest ever since telomerase was discovered. It is known that Rif1 plays a role in both the control of initiation of DNA replication and telomere length control. How telomere length regulation is linked to DNA replication is not known, but the current paper provides data from multiple approaches suggesting that telomere length regulation by Rif1 does not involve a process of activation of telomere proximal origins of DNA replication.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Role of Rif1 in telomere length regulation is separable from its role in origin firing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Bruce Stillman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission that does not require any new experiments.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work provides valuable evidence against the idea that subtelomeric origin activation can substantially increase telomere length, as stipulated by one specific model of telomere length regulation, i.e., telomerase travels with replication forks and telomerase delivery to telomere ends is negatively correlated with the distance between the ends and replication origins. The paper does not address how telomere length is controlled by telomerase association with the DNA replication fork, but does address one aspect of the coupling to DNA replication that is present in the literature. Thus, a revised paper is requested, taking into account the comments below.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>1) The effect of <italic>rif1-pp1bs</italic> on subtelomeric origin firing is rather modest. The effects of ∆N-dbf4/Cdc7 overexpression and <italic>sld3-A mcm5-bob1</italic> are stronger, but still weaker than the more internal origin used in normal cells. On the other hand, the effects of the <italic>sld3-A mcm5-bob1</italic> mutations is stronger. It is unclear what fraction of the subtelomeric Ori608 was utilized in the cell population with a particular genetic manipulation and this should be discussed. It is also worth noting that Ori608 is only about 20% closer to chromosome ends than the strong and more internal Ori607, hence not necessarily expected to deliver significantly more telomerase even if it is efficiently activated.</p><p>2) Further compounding the analysis is the challenge posed by telomere length heterogeneity; if the changes in telomere lengths are mild, the standard telomere Southern may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect them. For example, Figure 2E suggests that ∆N-dbf4/Cdc7 overexpression strain may have slightly longer telomeres, but rigorously testing this will require higher resolution and more quantitative assays. This might be suggested, but it is clear that the dramatic telomere elongation is not observed.</p><p>3) Figures 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E. The extent of late origin firing in the rif1 mutants is relatively low compared to the known early origins. There are two possibilities, one is that only in a very limited number of cells are the late origins activated or because of limited nucleotide (due to HU) or limiting origin firing factors, late origins are activated in all cells but DNA replication is limited. These possibilities should be discussed.</p><p>4) The authors cite Nourarede et al. as showing that Mcm4 is phosphorylated by Dbf4-Cdc7. This is not correct and indeed this reference does not even mention Mcm4. Nourarede et al. analyzed Mcm2 phosphorylation, which was known before this paper. The correct reference for Dbf4-Cdc7 phospho-regulation of Mcm4 should be Sheu at al., 2006.</p><p>5) There actually is some very good evidence in the literature showing that Rif1 blocks telomerase access to clustered telomeres and only short telomeres are able to break through in S-phase (see Gallardo et al., 2011). Perhaps this mechanism could be suggested as an origin independent mechanism for Rif1 regulating telomere length.</p><p>6) A report on how Rif1 and Rif2 might suppress the binding of Tel1, a positive telomerase regulator that is not linked to replication could be mentioned (see Hirano et al., 2009).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58066.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>1) The effect of rif1-pp1bs on subtelomeric origin firing is rather modest.

To address this, we have now computed a relative activation score for ARS608. The ratio of S phase activation of ARS608 relative to ARS607 in the mutants were normalized to that of the WT control to generate the relative ARS608 activation score (see Materials and methods). By normalizing to ARS607, a higher score indicates that a greater fraction of cells utilized ARS608. We found that <italic>sld3-A bob1</italic> and ∆N-dbf4 Cdc7 overexpression showed the highest relative activation scores, 24.36 and 25.83 respectively. ∆N-dbf4 overexpression alone had a score of 14.09, while <italic>rif1-pp1bs</italic> was 10.15 and <italic>rif1∆</italic> was 6.54. In contrast, <italic>rif1-∆1322</italic> and <italic>rif1<sub>HOOK</sub></italic> had low ARS608 scores of 1.50 and 2.33 respectively, but have long telomeres. Since telomere elongation is significant in <italic>rif1∆</italic> and this mutant has the lowest relative activation score of those that increase telomeric origin firing, we expect that the mutants with higher scores would show significantly long telomeres if origin firing is linked to telomere elongation. We have added this information to the Discussion.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that ARS607 and 608 are 17 kb apart; given that telomeres range from around 250-350 bp, a difference of 17 kb is substantial. In most cells, ARS607 fires, while ARS608 does not fire and is passively replicated. If <italic>rif1∆</italic> telomeres are long due to activation of ARS608, we would expect to detect this change in telomere length in the mutants that activate ARS608 even more than <italic>rif1∆</italic>, even though ARS607 is 17 kb away.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Further compounding the analysis is the challenge posed by telomere length heterogeneity; if the changes in telomere lengths are mild, the standard telomere Southern may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect them.

This might be suggested, but it is clear that the dramatic telomere elongation is not observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comment that, while detecting the difference between the long <italic>rif1∆</italic> and <italic>WT</italic> telomeres is reproducibly clear, the resolution of a telomere Southern might not detect very subtle telomere length changes. To be sure that our results were reproducible, we examined at least two independent biological replicates, and at least two, and in many cases more, technical replicates for each mutant background. We acknowledge that, if there were a very subtle change, we might not see a change in the equilibrium distribution by Southern blot. Since we are testing whether the long telomeres in <italic>rif1∆</italic> are caused by origin activation, we would expect a visible change in telomere length, as the <italic>rif1∆</italic> telomeres are quite long. The other mutants we tested activate origins even more strongly than <italic>rif1∆.</italic> Thus, if origin activation was a major player in telomere length regulation, these mutants should have at least as large an effect as <italic>rif1∆.</italic> We have added a sentence in the Discussion addressing this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figures 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E.

These possibilities should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ insight into the interpretation of HU in the origin firing experiments. We acknowledge that HU depletes nucleotide pools. We see in our data that this depletion affects the distance that a replication fork is able to travel, as seen in other studies (Mantiero et al., 2011), which we noted in subsection “Increasing origin activation using mutations in the pre-RC does not increase telomere length”. This effect is most evident in the <italic>sld3-A bob1</italic> mutant, which has peaks at almost every origin, indicating almost all origins have fired, but the peaks are narrow, indicating that the replication forks were not able to travel as far in the presence of HU compared to <italic>WT</italic>. The <italic>sld3-A bob1</italic> mutant also demonstrates that, even when most origins fire, the origins are able to recruit the essential limiting origin firing factors and travel far enough to be resolved as peaks in our assay. The fact that most origins fire in <italic>sld3-A bob1</italic> demonstrates that origin firing is not limited by limiting origin firing factors in this mutant. We have addressed these points in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors cite Nourarede et al. as showing that Mcm4 is phosphorylated by Dbf4-Cdc7.

Cell 33, 312).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the interaction of Rif1 and Rif2 with Tel1 in telomere length regulation may provide insight into the role of Rif1 in telomere regulation. The Hirano et al. paper discusses a potential role for both Rif1 and Rif2 in Tel1 localization to the telomere. Recent evidence indicates that Rif2 regulates Tel1 through catalytic modulation of the MRX complex (Hailemariam et al., 2019). We now discuss the possible role of Tel1 recruitment and note that Rif1, like Rif2, might also have roles other than Tel1 recruitment (subsection “DNA replication and telomere length”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
