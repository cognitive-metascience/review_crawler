Rod-shaped fission yeast cells divide at a threshold size partly due to Cdr2 kinase, which forms nodes at the medial cell cortex where it inhibits the Cdk1-inhibitor Wee1. Pom1 kinase phosphorylates and inhibits Cdr2, and forms cortical concentration gradients from cell poles. Pom1 inhibits Cdr2 signaling to Wee1 specifically in small cells, but the time and place of their regulatory interactions were unclear. We show that Pom1 forms stable oligomeric clusters that dynamically sample the cell cortex. Binding frequency is patterned into a concentration gradient by the polarity landmarks Tea1 and Tea4. Pom1 clusters colocalize with Cdr2 nodes, forming a glucose-modulated inhibitory threshold against node activation. Our work reveals how Pom1-Cdr2-Wee1 operates in multiprotein clusters at the cortex to promote mitotic entry at a cell size that can be modified by nutrient availability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>pombe</kwd><kwd>kinase</kwd><kwd>size</kwd><kwd>cdr2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM099774</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moseley</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-15-140-01-CCG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moseley</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allard</surname><given-names>Corey A H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dynamic signaling protein clusters sample and map the cell surface to ensure that cells divide at the proper size.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many cell types display a remarkable ability to maintain a constant size during rapid cycles of growth and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fantes and Nurse, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ginzberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fantes, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dolznig et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lloyd, 2013</xref>). Such cell size control is a system-level property that emerges from the integration of multiple size-dependent signal transduction pathways. Each signaling pathway is comprised of tunable biochemical parameters, including gene-expression and post-translational modifications such as protein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberghina et al., 2009</xref>). One major challenge in cell size research is to understand the biochemical mechanisms of signal transduction in each pathway, and what makes them size-dependent. These control systems can generate size homogeneity for a given cell type, but cell size is also an adaptable property. For example, nutritional cues and other environmental factors can alter cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fantes and Nurse, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelkar and Martin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shiozaki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yanagida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Young and Fantes, 1987</xref>). Thus, a second major challenge in cell size research is to understand how size-dependent signaling pathways respond to changes in cell metabolism and stress.</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, these signaling pathways lead to regulated activation of the conserved cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harashima et al., 2013</xref>). Activated Cdk1 triggers mitotic entry and the cascade of events that lead to cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gould and Nurse, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Simanis and Nurse, 1986</xref>). The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is an excellent model system to study size-dependent signaling pathways that regulate Cdk1. Genetic screens performed in past decades have identified many conserved factors that regulate Cdk1, but how these factors form size-dependent signaling pathways remains less clear. Fission yeast cells have a simple geometry that facilitates cell size studies. These cylindrical cells maintain a constant cell width, and grow by linear extension during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fantes and Nurse, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moreno et al., 1989</xref>). A network of cell polarity proteins positioned at cell tips restricts growth to these sites and maintains proper cell morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Martin, 2009</xref>). As a result, cell length doubles in one cell cycle, and many aspects of cell geometry scale with this increase in cell length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gu and Oliferenko, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neumann and Nurse, 2007</xref>). Recent studies used cell shape mutants to show that fission yeast cells primarily measure surface area, not length or volume, for cell size control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Facchetti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan et al., 2014</xref>). A critical next step is to understand how signaling pathways that regulate Cdk1 might operate at the cell surface in a size-dependent manner.</p><p>Cdk1 activity is established by the opposing activities of the inhibitory protein kinase Wee1, and the counteracting phosphatase Cdc25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gautier et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gould and Nurse, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumagai and Dunphy, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Russell and Nurse, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Russell and Nurse, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Strausfeld et al., 1991</xref>). In fission yeast, mutations in Wee1, Cdc25, and their upstream regulators lead to changes in cell size. Separate mechanisms link cell size with regulation of Wee1 versus Cdc25. The cellular concentration of Cdc25 increases as cells grow during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keifenheim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moreno et al., 1990</xref>). In contrast, the concentration of Wee1 remains constant during interphase, but it is progressively phosphorylated by the conserved inhibitory kinases Cdr1 and Cdr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aligue et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breeding et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kanoh and Russell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keifenheim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lucena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Opalko and Moseley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Russell and Nurse, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu and Russell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parker et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Young and Fantes, 1987</xref>). <italic>cdr2</italic> mutants fail to divide at a constant surface area, and instead divide according to cell volume or length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Facchetti et al., 2019</xref>). This change suggests that Cdr2-Cdr1-Wee1 signaling underlies the primary size-sensing pathway that measures cell surface area, while additional pathways related to volume and length are engaged in its absence. The localization of Cdr2, Cdr1, and Wee1 support this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): Cdr2 forms punctate oligomeric structures called nodes that stably bind to the medial cell cortex, and recruits Cdr1 to these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akamatsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akamatsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guzmán-Vendrell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morrell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). Wee1 localizes primarily in the nucleus and spindle-pole body, where it encounters Cdk1 to prevent mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Masuda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, Wee1 transiently visits cortical Cdr1/2 nodes in bursts that lead to inhibition of Wee1 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allard et al., 2018</xref>). The frequency and duration of these Wee1 bursts at Cdr1/2 nodes increase approximately twenty-fold as cells double in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allard et al., 2018</xref>), leading to size-dependent inhibition of Wee1 at the cell surface.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46003.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Pom1 gradient is formed by time-averaging of clusters that transiently bind the cortex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the Cdr2-Pom1-Wee1 signal transduction pathway and its coarse cellular localization.

First, increased Wee1 bursting depends upon the doubling in number of Cdr1/2 nodes during one cell cycle, but this 2-fold increase is smaller than the 20-fold increase in Wee1 bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng and Moseley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan et al., 2014</xref>). Second, activation of Cdr2 increases as cells increase in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2014</xref>). Cdr2 kinase activity is required for Wee1 localization to nodes, and is controlled by the upstream kinase Pom1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). Pom1 directly phosphorylates and inhibits the activation of Cdr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kettenbach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). Pom1 also phosphorylates a separate set of sites on Cdr2 to disrupt oligomerization and membrane binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rincon et al., 2014</xref>). Pom1 regulation of Cdr2 increases the frequency and duration of Wee1 bursts at Cdr1/2 nodes, but only in small cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allard et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this defect, <italic>pom1∆</italic> cells divide at a small size due to dysregulation of the Cdr2-Cdr1-Wee1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bähler and Pringle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wood and Nurse, 2013</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest a size-dependent interaction between Pom1 and its substrate Cdr2. However, the location and timing of Pom1 interactions with Cdr2 have remained poorly defined.</p><p>Pom1 localizes in a cortical spatial gradient that is enriched at cell tips, with a lower concentration at the medial cell cortex, where its substrate Cdr2 forms nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bähler and Pringle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bähler and Nurse, 2001</xref>). Thus, the majority of Pom1 and Cdr2 molecules in a cell are spatially separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), raising the question of when and where they interact. Several lines of evidence suggest that the spatial distributions of Pom1 and Cdr2 are critical for the size-dependent signaling properties of this pathway, and suggest the lateral cell cortex as the key interface. For example, ectopic targeting of Pom1 to the medial cell cortex inhibits Cdr2 node formation and Cdr2-dependent cell size signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>). Additionally, the Pom1 gradient is disrupted as part of a cellular response to glucose deprivation, which leads to increased Pom1 concentration at the lateral cortex where it delays mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelkar and Martin, 2015</xref>). This result also demonstrates that Pom1-Cdr2 signaling responds to environmental input to coordinate cell size with nutrient availability. In this system, Pom1 functions analogously to an intracellular morphogen, acting as a concentration-dependent and localization-controlled inhibitor of Cdr2 nodes. However, levels of Pom1 at the medial cell cortex in wild-type cells growing under steady state conditions are low, constant, and do not vary with cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan et al., 2014</xref>). How Pom1 provides size-dependent input to Cdr2 is unclear and requires analysis of their molecular dynamics at the lateral cell cortex.</p><p>Past studies have led to a model for Pom1 gradient formation driven by the binding and diffusion of individual Pom1 molecules in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hersch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, dynamic clusters of Pom1 have also been observed and are proposed to form by unstable oligomerization of molecules diffusing on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). These clusters are thought to form and decay rapidly, temporarily slowing Pom1 diffusion rates and reducing noise in the gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). These clusters represent nano-scale pockets of increased Pom1 concentration, but whether these clusters contribute to regulation of Cdr2 nodes is unknown. Here, we combine biochemical and microscopy approaches to show that the Pom1 gradient is comprised of these punctate clusters. Pom1 clusters are stable oligomers that bind and release the membrane with minimal lateral diffusion. These clusters bind more frequently at cell tips than at cell sides, resulting in a concentration gradient. A portion of Pom1 clusters in the medial cell cortex colocalize with Cdr2 nodes, and the ratio of Pom1 to Cdr2 at the medial cell cortex changes as a function of cell size. When glucose is restricted, Pom1 clusters redistribute to the medial cell cortex to prevent dramatic dysregulation of Wee1. Our work reveals that the Pom1-Cdr2-Wee1 signaling pathway is organized as a series of cortical clusters. The relative distribution of these clusters at the plasma membrane changes with cell size and glucose availability, thus relaying cell surface area to the core cell cycle machinery in a nutrient-controlled manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Pom1 gradient is formed by transient cortical clusters</title><p>We sought to examine the molecular dynamics of Pom1-Cdr2 signaling at the cell cortex.

Surprisingly, along the lateral cortex of interphase cells, Pom1-mNG was localized almost exclusively in discreet clusters, with no apparent diffuse signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Time-averaging produced a smoother gradient dotted by occasional clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>), similar to the gradient observed by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Pom1 clusters were highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). They appeared on the cell sides with a frequency of ~2 µm<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, and remained bound for less than 2 s on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). During this brief cortical attachment, Pom1 clusters exhibited minimal diffusion which lacked directionality, and instead appeared to diffuse randomly in submicron patches of cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B,E</xref>). Mean squared displacement (MSD) measurements were consistent with free diffusion of Pom1 clusters within submicron corrals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B,C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qian et al., 1991</xref>).

Similar to cell sides, Pom1-mNG localized at cell tips almost entirely in clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also used ‘head-on’ confocal imaging to confirm that Pom1 localization in clusters at tips was not an artifact of the TIRF approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>); a conclusion further supported by work using high resolution wide-field microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dodgson et al., 2013</xref>). Compared to cell sides, Pom1 clusters appeared twice as frequently at cell tips but with a similar cortical duration, again exhibiting minimal and non-directional diffusion away from their binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Fluorescence intensity of individual clusters at cell tips and cell sides were similar, although we detected a low number of brighter clusters at cell tips, likely representing multiple diffraction-limited clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D,E</xref>). From these data, we conclude that the Pom1 gradient is formed by patterning the membrane binding frequency of cortical clusters along the long axis of the cell, rather than by diffusion of Pom1 molecules from the cell tips to the cell side.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In vitro analysis shows Pom1 exists in large, stable clusters</title><p>Past work suggested that Pom1 structures assemble and disassemble at the cortex through oligomerization of individual molecules diffusing in the plane of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>).

Intriguingly, the total number of both Cdr2 nodes and Pom1 clusters detected along entire cell sides in TIRF images were equivalent for cells of a given size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>), and both structures show a similar size-dependent doubling.

The increased colocalization, combined with the constant density of Pom1 clusters, means that there are less ‘free’ Pom1 clusters as cells increase in size. Perhaps more importantly, the number of ‘free’ Cdr2 nodes increased as a function of cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3F</xref>). These free Cdr2 nodes are not occupied by an inhibitory Pom1 cluster, and thus have increased potential to promote mitotic entry by inhibiting Wee1. In this manner, Pom1 sets an inhibitory threshold that must be overcome by an increase in Cdr2 node density. The inhibitory threshold decreases slightly as cells grow, and functions most effectively in small cells, where Pom1 was previously shown to inhibit downstream signaling to Wee1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allard et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Control of Pom1 cluster levels in the medial cell cortex</title><p>Our results suggest that Pom1 sets an inhibitory threshold that opposes Cdr2 activation until cells reach an appropriate size for division.

These clusters bind more frequently at cell tips versus cell sides in high glucose media, while their binding rate is increased at cell sides in low glucose media. At the medial cell cortex, these clusters overlap with their inhibitory target Cdr2, which localizes in static oligomeric nodes. More Cdr2 nodes are free from Pom1 inhibition as cells grow larger due to different density scaling of these two structures at the medial cell cortex. Our TIRF-based colocalization experiments on these structures were limited to short periods of time to avoid photobleaching, partly caused by the imaging conditions needed to observe these highly dynamic Pom1 clusters. Nevertheless, Pom1 clusters colocalized with Cdr2 nodes even over these short timescales. Given the high frequency of Pom1 cluster binding, we expect that many more colocalization events occur between Cdr2 nodes and Pom1 clusters during the course of a full cell cycle, with the potential for Pom1 clusters to visit each Cdr2 node multiple times. Thus, these rapid dynamics of Pom1 clusters interacting with Cdr2 nodes may be integrated in time throughout the cell cycle. It appears likely that the most critical temporal window for Pom1-Cdr2 interactions occurs during early G2, as <italic>pom1∆</italic> show defects in Cdr2-Wee1 signaling specifically in small cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allard et al., 2018</xref>).

These T cell receptor clusters enrich downstream kinases while excluding phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Su et al., 2016</xref>), a mechanism that could relate to concentrated clusters of the kinases Pom1 and Cdr2.

Insight into the functional role of clustering for Pom1-Cdr2-Wee1 will require additional in vivo analysis combined with in vitro reconstitution.

Past work suggested single Pom1 molecules (or small oligomers) bind to the membrane at tips, and then diffuse away from the tip before dissociating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). Clusters were proposed to dynamically assemble and disassemble at the cortex from this diffusing population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings suggest a new model for gradient formation, which is distinct from this previous model in four ways. First, we found that clusters themselves form a concentration gradient that emanates from the cell tips. Second, our combined imaging and biochemical approaches demonstrated that clusters are stable complexes that bind and rapidly release from the membrane. Third, we did not observe extensive diffusion by complexes bound to the membrane. It remains possible that smaller, diffusing Pom1 complexes or single molecules were not detected by our imaging approach, but we favor a model where diffusion is limited to short, non-directional movements that do not contribute to gradient formation. Fourth, the key step in gradient formation is a positional system that increases the on-rate for Pom1 clusters at cell tips versus the cell middle. Concentration gradients are found across vast size scales in biology, so the mechanism of gradient formation by Pom1 clusters may have broad implications. It is also important to note that the spatial gradient of on-rates for Pom1 clusters binding to the cortex may depend on a concentration gradient of specific lipids in the plasma membrane. In support of this hypothesis, Pom1 binds to phosphatidylserine in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>), and this lipid is enriched at the tips of growing fission yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haupt and Minc, 2017</xref>). Thus, further investigation of these lipids and their localization dynamics could reveal additional layers of this morphogen-like gradient.</p><p>We found that the polarity landmarks Tea1 and Tea4 provide the positional information for Pom1 clusters to form a concentration gradient. Past work has shown that Pom1 localizes homogenously throughout the cortex in <italic>tea1∆</italic> cells, and does not localize to the cortex in <italic>tea4∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bähler and Pringle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>). Based on these and other results, Tea1 was proposed to recruit Tea4 to cell tips, where it promotes cortical loading of Pom1 molecules. Several results suggest that additional mechanisms may contribute to gradient formation. For example, we found that Pom1 clusters still bind to the cortex in <italic>tea4∆</italic> cells but for very short durations. Past work has also shown that Tea1 and Tea4 form cortical clusters that co-localize at cell tips, but these Tea1-Tea4 clusters do not co-localize with Pom1 clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dodgson et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, Tea1-Tea4 may pattern binding of Pom1 clusters to the cortex through an additional mechanism. For example, Tea1 and Tea4 have been shown to assemble sterol-enriched lipid domains at cell tips when cells initiate polarization following exit from starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Makushok et al., 2016</xref>). Sterols and phosphatidylserine are thought to form a common membrane domain in fission yeast, suggesting that these proteins could act through the recruitment and organization of lipids to generate cortical domains permissive for Pom1 cluster binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haupt and Minc, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Makushok et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Adjustable Pom1 gradients regulate mitotic entry</title><p>We propose an integrated mechanism for fission yeast cell size sensing in which Cdr2 acts as an important sensor of cell size that is dynamically antagonized by cortical Pom1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Pom1 clusters bind to the medial cell cortex in a manner that can overlap with Cdr2 nodes. These dynamic Pom1 clusters and static Cdr2 cortical nodes suggest a system that monitors surface expansion, consistent with the notion that fission yeast cells monitor surface area as the primary determinant of size at division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Facchetti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan et al., 2014</xref>). As cells grow, the density of Pom1 clusters in the cell middle decreases slightly due to their binding preference at cell tips. In contrast, the density of Cdr2 nodes doubles to overcome this inhibitory Pom1 threshold. The density of Pom1 clusters and the resulting inhibitory threshold can be modulated by glucose availability, consistent with past work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelkar and Martin, 2015</xref>). As fission yeast cells begin to starve due to depletion of nutrients such as glucose, their length at division progressively decreases and the length of the cell cycle increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pluskal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yanagida et al., 2011</xref>). The Pom-Cdr2 network has a prominent role in this nutrient modulation, suggesting that it may represent a key physiological role for the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelkar and Martin, 2015</xref>). We found that the size dependence of Wee1 localization bursts to Cdr2 nodes, which facilitate Wee1 inhibition, was dampened in low glucose conditions. Re-localization of Pom1 clusters to the medial cortex mediates this response. However, for <italic>pom1∆</italic> mutants in low glucose, Wee1 localization to nodes exceeds even wild type cells in high glucose. This result indicates that additional mechanisms contribute to Wee1 regulation in low glucose, for example Wee1 nuclear transport could be altered under these conditions. Thus, Pom1-Cdr2 signal transduction serves two functions: (1) Under steady-state growth conditions, Pom1 and Cdr2 cooperate to measure cell size and ensure that cells divide only when they have grown large enough. In this context, the Pom1 threshold is only strong enough to inhibit Cdr2 signaling in small cells, where node density is low. In this manner, Pom1 prevents precocious entry into mitosis. (2) Under glucose restriction, Pom1 and Cdr2 cooperate to integrate information about both cell size and glucose availability, and signal that information to the core cell cycle machinery.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46003.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model for the glucose-modulated control of Wee1 bursting by Pom1 and Cdr2.</title><p>See text for discussion.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46003-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The Pom1 gradient as a read-out for cell polarity</title><p>More broadly, our study reveals the adjustable nature of the concentration gradient formed by Pom1 clusters. Concentration of Pom1 clusters at cell tips reads out the polarity state of the cell for downstream signaling by Cdr2 and Wee1. Conditions that alter the polarized growth state of the cell would lead to changes in the gradient of Pom1 clusters, resulting in altered cell size at division. This dynamic system appears to operate in a manner that depends on both cell size and nutrient availability. Identification of additional growth and environmental conditions that alter the relative distributions of Pom1 clusters and Cdr2 nodes, and determination of how they connect with other cell cycle signaling pathways, may reveal new mechanisms for nutrient modulation of cell size control.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Integration of the Pom1-Cdr2-Wee1 pathway with other sizing mechanisms</title><p>Pom1-Cdr2-Wee1 signaling is cell size dependent but is not the only pathway that contributes to the overall cell size control network. Intriguingly, a recent study reported that <italic>cdr2∆</italic> cells no longer divide based on accumulation of a threshold surface area and instead revert to a secondary mechanism of cell size control based on volume sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Facchetti et al., 2019</xref>). These results demonstrate that cells use different signal transduction networks to measure different aspects of their size. Whereas the Pom1-Cdr2 network is well suited to measure cortical surface area, size-control systems that measure other aspects of size would require different signaling logic. Theoretically, mechanisms for cell volume sensing could depend on proteins whose concentrations do not scale linearly with cell size. Such mechanisms are thought to underlie cell size control in other organisms, such as the budding yeast, where growth-dependent dilution of the transcriptional repressor Whi5 is thought to underlie G<sub>1</sub>/S size control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>). One possible candidate for cellular volume sensing in fission yeast is Cdc25, which increases in concentration with cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keifenheim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moreno et al., 1990</xref>). These mechanisms are attractive candidates for volume sensors because cytoplasmic concentration is independent of cell geometry. The existence of sizing mechanisms that measure other aspects of cell size, and function independently of the Pom1-Cdr2 surface area sensing network, underscores that cell size is a system level property controlled by multiple signaling pathways. Thus, it remains important to discover size-dependent signaling mechanisms within each individual pathway, as a step towards understanding the integration of multiple pathways into a larger size control system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor as the Mohan Balasubramanian and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers and the reviewing editor appreciated the area under investigation and were enthusiastic about your work on defining the mechanism of regulation of mitotic entry and cell size through the Pom1, Cdr2, and Wee1 network. In particular, your efforts towards biochemical reconstitution were seen as a strength of the manuscript.</p><p>However, a number of major issues have been raised which need to be addressed before this paper can be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. I hope you will be able to revise them to the satisfaction of the reviewers (although I hope I will be able to decide on my own in order to save time).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In agreement with previous reports, the presence of clusters at the cell tips and sides is dependent on Tea1 and Tea4. Interestingly Tea1 and Tea4 appear to regulate Pom1 clusters in slightly different ways. However, the individual contribution of <italic>tea1</italic> and <italic>tea4</italic> in regulating Pom1 clusters is not explored in this paper. A previous report has shown that upon glucose starvation Pom1 localization to the cell sides increases due to disruption of the microtubules and mislocalization of Tea4. In agreement with these previous reports, here the authors demonstrate that the frequency of Pom1 clusters at the cell sides increases in low glucose. The authors show that at the cell middle Pom1-Cdr2 nodes overlap suggesting that existence of such overlapping modes would lead to inhibition of cell division. Interestingly, in low glucose media Pom1 clusters at the cell middle increases while Cdr2 nodes here decrease. It is not clear how glucose regulates the number of <italic>cdr2</italic> nodes at the cell middle and how this contributes to cell size regulation in addition to the Pom1 gradient itself.</p><p>2) The model predicts that Pom1 clusters transiently visit cortical nodes on the plasma membrane to phosphorylate and inhibit Cdr2. One assumption of the model is that most of Pom1 and Cdr2 are on the plasma membrane, which were not mentioned or tested. If these data are available in the literature, they should be cited. If not, the authors can easily measure the fractions of proteins on the plasma membrane and cytoplasm using fluorescence intensity. Does cytoplasmic concentrations of Pom1 and Cdr2 change with cell size? If most of Pom1 and Cdr2 are in the cytoplasm, there is a possibility that Pom1 inhibits Cdr2 in the cytoplasm to regulate mitotic entry.</p><p>3) Pom1 is still in the stable cluster in the bleeding cells. Does Cdr2 form cluster in the cytoplasm? If yes, do Cdr2 and Pom1 colocalize in cytoplasmic clusters?</p><p>4) In several figures, TIRF images of cell cortex are compared to the middle focal plane of confocal images. The confocal images of cell cortex (near the plasma membrane) should be used for better comparison.</p><p>5) The diffusion of Pom1 puncta in Figure 1C and G can be plotted as mean square displacement (MSD) over time. If the MSD increases over time, it is consistent with 2D diffusion. The diffusion constant can be calculated to see if it is consistent with the 60S complex revealed by the sucrose gradient.</p><p>6) The paper definitely needs streamlining and improvements in writing. I think a good way of summarising this is to look at the figures. There are 9 main figures, all of which (bar the last one) contain significant quantities of data. This level of information, rather than helping, is actually hindering the paper. The authors have not focused clearly enough on what is the important data to show and how can it be shown in a concise and clear manner. This then feeds back into the text, where each of these figure panels then needs to be discussed.

I have issues with the conclusion that Pom1 is regulating division at a precise length. The data strongly supports a role for <italic>pom1</italic> in stopping cells dividing before 11μm. However, I do not see clear evidence it is playing a role in promoting mitotic entry at a specific size (i.e. 14μm), despite what is written in the last line of Abstract.</p><p>8) Statistical analysis is weak at times. For example Figure 3—figure supplement 1 has error bars going into negative dwell times. This does not give confidence that the analysis was done rigorously or using the correct tools.

Ideally I would like to see the authors expand on this technique to determine how Pom1 clusters are formed. At the very least they can purify the clusters and use mass-spec to determine if post-translational modifications or interactions with other proteins leads to cluster formation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46003.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In agreement with previous reports, the presence of clusters at the cell tips and sides is dependent on Tea1 and Tea4.

From our data, we can conclude that these polarity proteins provide the geometric patterning of Pom1 cluster binding to the cortex, resulting in a concentration gradient. We agree that additional exploration of their mechanistic contributions will provide more insight in the future.</p><p>We have rewritten the text to clarify how glucose regulates Pom1 and Cdr2. In low glucose, Pom1 clusters are no longer concentrated at cell tips, leading to higher levels in the cell middle. This redistribution does not impact the number of Cdr2 nodes, but reduces the number of Cdr2 molecules per node. We have revised the text to make this point more clearly: “Pom1 redistribution to the lateral cortex under low glucose is required to induce partial disassembly of each Cdr2 node…We conclude that the increasing frequency of Pom1 cluster binding at the lateral cell cortex leads to a reduced number of Cdr2 molecules per node.” These nodes are less active to regulate Wee1 compared to high glucose conditions, as seen by our measurements of Wee1 localization in Figure 7. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed role of Pom1-Cdr2 in controlling cell size under low glucose conditions (Kelkar and Martin, 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The model predicts that Pom1 clusters transiently visit cortical nodes on the plasma membrane to phosphorylate and inhibit Cdr2.

For both Pom1 and Cdr2, we measured the total cortical and cytoplasmic levels, and also examined the cortical levels at cell tips versus medial cortex. For Cdr2, our results are consistent with past work published in Pan et al., 2014. In short, both Pom1 and Cdr2 are strongly enriched at the cortex versus cytoplasm, and the cytoplasmic concentration of each protein is unaffected by cell size. In addition, we did not detect colocalization of Cdr2 nodes and Pom1 clusters in cell extracts lacking membrane bilayers (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). These combined data strongly implicate the cortex as the site of signal transduction between Pom1 and Cdr2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Pom1 is still in the stable cluster in the bleeding cells. Does Cdr2 form cluster in the cytoplasm? If yes, do Cdr2 and Pom1 colocalize in cytoplasmic clusters?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the suggested experiment, and the results are shown in new Figure 2—figure supplement 1D. We have previously shown that Cdr2 nodes are stable in cell extracts (Allard et al., 2018). Based on our model, we would expect that Pom1 puncta and Cdr2 nodes would not stably associate in extruded cytoplasm. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we made extracts from cells co-expressing Pom1-mNeonGreen and Cdr2-tagRFP-t. In TIRF microscopy experiments, we found that Cdr2 nodes and Pom1 clusters do not colocalize in these cytoplasmic extracts, supporting our conclusion that this interaction occurs at the cell cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In several figures, TIRF images of cell cortex are compared to the middle focal plane of confocal images. The confocal images of cell cortex (near the plasma membrane) should be used for better comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included confocal images at the cell cortex for comparison to TIRF, as suggested. The key figure with this comparison is Figure 1—figure supplement 1, which shows Pom1 clusters by confocal imaging. Several other confocal microscopy images are included in the manuscript, but are not used for direct comparison to the TIRF images. In these cases (e.g. Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and Figure 5—figure supplement 1), we have included middle focal planes because they show the most relevant view for the given experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The diffusion of Pom1 puncta in Figure 1C and G can be plotted as mean square displacement (MSD) over time. If the MSD increases over time, it is consistent with 2D diffusion. The diffusion constant can be calculated to see if it is consistent with the 60S complex revealed by the sucrose gradient.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this helpful insight, which has been added into the revised manuscript. We used the TIRFM particle traces from figure 1 to calculate MSD (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Whereas a linear relationship between mean MSD and time would indicate free diffusion, we obtained a correlation that was initially linear but saturated at time &gt;2 seconds, indicated constrained diffusion. Thus, Pom1 clusters appear to be restricted to diffusion within sub-micron “corrals”.</p><p>We extended this approach to purified Pom1-mNG clusters diffusing on artificial supported lipid bilayers. MSD measurements revealed that Pom1 clusters exhibit the same diffusion coefficient in vitro and in cells. However, in vitro diffusion on SLBs is no longer restricted within corrals, suggesting that some cellular feature restricts diffusion of Pom1 clusters. We have included two new figures containing these data: Figure 1—figure supplement 2 (in vivo) and Figure 2—figure supplement 3 (in vitro).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The paper definitely needs streamlining and improvements in writing.

Based on this comment, we have removed the data and discussion for Pom1 clusters and activity in <italic>tea1∆</italic> cells (Figure 5 and supporting supplementary data in the previous submission), which we realize were tangential to the main conclusions of the paper. We have also removed some data and discussion that were replications of past work (e.g. Figure 1—figure supplement 1 from the past submission). We have also tried to streamline the text to maintain a constant narrative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) As with Gerganova et al., 2019 I have issues with the conclusion that Pom1 is regulating division at a precise length.

In our initial submission, the Abstract stated that the Pom1-Cdr2-Wee1 pathway promotes mitotic entry at a specific size. We did not intend to imply that Pom1 performs a function specifically when cells reach that size. Rather, we would like to state that the entire pathway helps to specify the size at which cells divide, as cell size is altered in mutants of this pathway. In an attempt to clarify this point, we have revised the Abstract to read that “Pom1-Cdr2-Wee1 operates in multiprotein clusters at the cortex to promote mitotic entry at a cell size that can be modified by nutrient availability.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Statistical analysis is weak at times. For example Figure 3—figure supplement 1 has error bars going into negative dwell times. This does not give confidence that the analysis was done rigorously or using the correct tools. Further, details of line fitting are vague and goodness of fit analysis is generally poor (e.g. fitting of sinusoidal curve to Supplementary Figure 6C and Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made an effort to explain and to justify our statistical analyses with additional detail and text in the Materials and methods section. This added text also explains methods and rationale for curve fitting. We have also added the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, which reports all of the statistical data for Pom1 cluster dynamics in <italic>tea1</italic>∆ and <italic>tea4</italic>∆ mutants, and Supplementary files 1 and 2, which report the parameters of the linear regressions in Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1, and a summary of the statistical comparisons in those figures. Many of the parameters that we have measured exhibit clear variability and biological noise, which we would argue should not be misconstrued as lack of experimental rigor. For example, in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, most puncta bind briefly (200-400msec) but a subset bind for multiple seconds (i.e. orders of magnitude above the statistical mode). We did not wish to ignore the rare, longer binding events as “outliers,” and therefore have included all the data in our analyses. With these longer binding events included, the error bars should extend into negative dwell times. We did not mean to imply that negative dwell times should be considered as part of the underlying biological system, and therefore have edited this figure to show error bars extending in only one direction. We also understand that the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) is low in many cases. However, these values do not reflect poor analysis, but rather we are specifically trying to highlight the <italic>absence</italic> of measurable size-dependence in a trend (slope not significantly different from 0, e.g. Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, E). By definition, this means that a linear model does not significantly improve on simply reporting an average, and thus yields a low R<sup>2</sup>. In these cases, a low R<sup>2</sup> does not indicate low data quality, but rather represents the underlying biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Optional revision point:</p><p>1) A major strength of this paper is the authors ability to reconstitute Pom1 clusters in vitro.

However, we feel that additional characterization of Pom1 clusters (e.g. mass spec to identify new components and post-translational modifications) represents a key goal for the future, and would detract from the message of this paper. In this revision, we have attempted to streamline the paper by removing text and data that seem tangential to the central message, in response to essential revision #6. We hope to learn more about the composition, lipid binding preference, and biophysical properties of Pom1 clusters going forward. However, we believe that experiments to test each of these topics would open new avenues that would only make the paper more complicated at this stage. We share the enthusiasm of the reviewers and editors for this topic, and look forward to opening new lines of research with these analyses in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
