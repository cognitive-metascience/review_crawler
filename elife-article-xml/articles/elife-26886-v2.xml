How synaptic growth is terminated after reaching proper size remains unclear. Here, we show that Leon, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> USP5 deubiquitinase, controls postsynaptic growth. In <italic>leon</italic> mutants, postsynaptic specializations of neuromuscular junctions are dramatically expanded, including the subsynaptic reticulum, the postsynaptic density, and the glutamate receptor cluster. Expansion of these postsynaptic features is caused by a disruption of ubiquitin homeostasis with accumulation of free ubiquitin chains and ubiquitinated substrates in the <italic>leon</italic> mutant. Accumulation of Ubiquilin (Ubqn), the ubiquitin receptor whose human homolog ubiquilin 2 is associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also contributes to defects in postsynaptic growth and ubiquitin homeostasis. Importantly, accumulations of postsynaptic proteins cause different aspects of postsynaptic overgrowth in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. Thus, the deubiquitinase Leon maintains ubiquitin homeostasis and proper Ubqn levels, preventing postsynaptic proteins from accumulation to confine postsynaptic growth.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26886.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26886.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>USP5/Leon</kwd><kwd>postsynaptic growth</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin homeostasis</kwd><kwd>Ubiquilin/Ubqn</kwd><kwd>free ubiquitin chains</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001869</institution-id><institution>Academia Sinica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chien-Hsiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Yi-Chun</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Pei-Yi</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Ying-Ju</given-names></name><name><surname>Chien</surname><given-names>Cheng-Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chien-Hsiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Yi-Chun</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Pei-Yi</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Ying-Ju</given-names></name><name><surname>Pi</surname><given-names>Haiwei</given-names></name><name><surname>Chien</surname><given-names>Cheng-Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Maintenance of ubiquitin homeostasis is essential for proper control of the size of postsynaptic density and the growth of specialized membrane structure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A synapse is a specialized structure where signals are transmitted from a neuron to another neuron or other target cells such as muscles. Proper synapse formation is prerequisite to building functional synapses and constructing neuronal circuits. Synapse abnormalities are suggested to induce neurological and psychological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Spronsen and Hoogenraad, 2010</xref>). Formation of postsynapses requires coordinated formation of several specialized structures. One prominent postsynaptic feature at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) is the extensively folded muscular membranes. Specialized folding of postjunctional membranes is thought to increase the area exposed to the synaptic cleft and ensure the effectiveness of neuromuscular transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to membrane specializations, the postsynaptic density (PSD) is also a common element whose size requires proper control. The PSD contains scaffolding proteins that recruit signaling protein complexes and neurotransmitter receptors, matching precisely the presynaptic active zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng and Zhang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sheng and Hoogenraad, 2007</xref>). Formations of postsynaptic membrane and PSD are tightly controlled and coordinated yet these processes remain elusive.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ is a model to study synapse formation and activity-dependent synapse remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collins and DiAntonio, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ruiz-CaÃ±ada and Budnik, 2006</xref>). Synaptic boutons are swollen structures of axonal terminals embedded in highly folded muscular membranes called the subsynaptic reticulum (SSR) and each bouton contains tens of neurotransmitter release sites paired with PSDs. During larval development, the SSR and the PSD concomitantly form and gradually increase their sizes. Two crucial factors, postsynaptic density protein-95/Discs large (Dlg) localized at the SSR and <italic>Drosophila</italic> p21-activating kinase (dPak) localized at the PSD, regulate SSR formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin and Davis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Budnik et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lahey et al., 1994</xref>). At the PSD, two types of localized glutamate receptors (GluRs), IIA and IIB, appear in distinct GluR clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marrus et al., 2004</xref>). The abundance of GluRIIA at the PSD is regulated by PSD-localized dPak and the SSR-localized NF-ÎºB complex, NF-ÎºB/Dorsal (Dl), IÎºB/Cactus (Cact) and IRAK/Pelle (Pll) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin and Davis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heckscher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parnas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the postsynaptic protein could localize at either SSR or PSD, and confer growth regulation on SSR, PSD or both.</p><p>Ubiquitination plays essential roles in various cellular processes including synaptic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiAntonio et al., 2001</xref>). Ubiquitin species are dynamically balanced among free and substrate-conjugated forms of mono-ubiquitin and ubiquitin chains. Ubiquitin homeostasis, i.e. the maintenance of diverse ubiquitin species in proper proportions and levels, is regulated in cellular growth and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hallengren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kimura and Tanaka, 2010</xref>). Deubiquitinases (DUBs), a large superfamily of ubiquitin regulators, participate in the dynamic equilibrium of ubiquitin species. While some DUBs process newly synthesized ubiquitin precursors for ubiquitin supply, others recycle ubiquitin by cleaving ubiquitin chains from protein substrates prior to proteasomal degradation. USP5, the focus of this study, is dedicated to disassembly of free ubiquitin chains for recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hochstrasser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komander et al., 2009</xref>). Physiologically, heat shock stress in yeast causes a reduction of the mono-ubiquitin level. To compensate for ubiquitin depletion, the level of the DUB Doa4 is elevated, leading to an increase in the mono-ubiquitin level by cleaving free ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimura et al., 2009</xref>). The ataxia mice <italic>ax<sup>J</sup></italic>, carrying mutations in the DUB USP14, displayed nerve swelling and abnormal neurotransmission at NMJs. The defects are caused by a reduction in the ubiquitin level as lower ubiquitin levels were detected in the mutant mice and introducing an ubiquitin transgene suppressed the <italic>ax<sup>J</sup></italic> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2009</xref>). Thus, regulation of the ubiquitin level is a critical step in synapse development and for preventing neurological disorders.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> USP5/Leon is essential to maintain ubiquitin homeostasis during tissue formation and controls activation of apoptosis and the JNK pathway during eye development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we characterized the role of Leon in postsynaptic growth after synapse formation. In <italic>leon</italic> mutants, while the presynapse maintains normal morphology, the postsynapse overelaborates, displaying expanded SSR, enlarged PSD and excess PSD-localized GluR clusters. Free ubiquitin chains and ubiquitinated substrates accumulate in <italic>leon</italic> postsynapses, revealing defects in ubiquitin homeostasis. Genetic analysis shows that accumulations of several postsynaptic proteins accounts for overelaborated postsynaptic structures. The ubiquitin receptor Ubqn recognizes and transfers ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lipinszki et al., 2011</xref>). The Ubqn level is elevated in <italic>leon</italic> postsynapses and reducing the Ubqn level suppresses <italic>leon</italic> mutant phenotypes. Importantly, co-overexpression of free ubiquitin chains and Ubqn promotes expansion of these postsynaptic features. Thus, ubiquitin homeostasis such as disassembly of free ubiquitin chains, timely degradation of proteins, and normal function of the ubiquitin receptor Ubqn are compromised in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, leading to postsynaptic overgrowth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Abnormal NMJ morphology in <italic>leon</italic> mutants</title><p>We examined NMJs in third-instar larvae of <italic>leon<sup>2</sup>/19-2</italic> mutants that died at mid-pupal stages and <italic>leon<sup>1</sup>/19-2</italic> mutants that died at the late-third larval stages. Based on the viability and Western blot analysis, <italic>leon<sup>2</sup>/19-2</italic> is considered a hypomorphic mutant and <italic>leon<sup>1</sup>/19-2</italic> is a close-to-null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Both NMJ phenotypes were compared to the control <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> that had been used to backcross all <italic>leon</italic> alleles. At control NMJs, axonal terminals immunostained for presynaptic horseradish peroxidase (HRP) branched out extensively from initial targeting sites; synaptic boutons revealed by postsynaptic Dlg staining spread evenly along axonal tracks, displaying the beads-on-a-string pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In <italic>leon</italic> mutants, axonal terminals failed to extend and synaptic boutons aggregated, making them larger in appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To quantify the morphological defects, we scored the number of boutons and branch lengths of NMJs at muscles 6/7. In both <italic>leon<sup>1</sup>/19-2</italic> and <italic>leon<sup>2</sup>/19-2</italic> mutants, the bouton numbers were significantly decreased by about 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

In contrast, expression by <italic>D42-GAL4</italic> in motor neurons failed to rescue <italic>leon</italic> mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). The postsynaptic requirement of <italic>leon</italic> was further confirmed by driving the <italic>leonRNAi</italic> transgene in individual compartments.

In <italic>leon</italic> mutants, overall FK2 signals were enhanced, and the enhancement was very prominent at the postsynaptic sites surrounding presynaptic boutons (indicated by arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

It is possible that the enzymatic activity-deficient ED-Leon can associate with ubiquitin chains but cannot deubiquitinate them, and binding to ED-Leon sequesters ubiquitinated substrates from degradation. Taken together, these results indicate that Leon deubiquitinating activity is required for maintaining ubiquitin homeostasis in postsynapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Increases of postsynaptic proteins in <italic>leon</italic> mutants</title><p>Aberrant NMJ morphology and postsynaptic ubiquitin homeostasis defects in <italic>leon</italic> mutants prompted us to examine constituents of synaptic organization.

Quantification showed that the dPak levels were increased in <italic>leon</italic> postsynapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The normal one-to-one pairing between Brp and dPak could not be resolved in <italic>leon</italic> mutants because expanded and fused dPak patches could accommodate a few Brp puncta.</p><p>We further examined PSD-localized GluRs. GluRs are composed of four subunits, including essential subunits GluRIIC/GluRIII, GluRIID and GluRIIE and one of the two interchangeable subunits GluRIIA and GluRIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DiAntonio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marrus et al., 2004</xref>).

The wild-type GluRIIA cluster pattern, shown in the magnified image, was no longer present in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. Instead, GluRIIA clusters also appeared much like the dPak fusion pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panels).

The increases of SSR- and PSD-localized proteins in <italic>leon</italic> mutants could be a cumulative process from early larval stages. We compared expressions of SSR-localized Cact and PSD-localized GluRIIA in controls and <italic>leon</italic> mutants in the same stages. At <italic>leon</italic> NMJs, the thickness of Cact-positive zones and the intensity and size of GluRIIA clusters were larger than wild-type controls during 72 hr, 96 hr, and 120 hr AEL, with more severe defects in <italic>leon<sup>1</sup>/19-2</italic> than in <italic>leon<sup>2</sup>/19-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>).

Expression of <italic>UAS-leon</italic> in muscles suppressed the expanded Dlg rings and the enlarged dPak and GluRIIA clusters in <italic>leon<sup>1</sup>/19-2</italic>. In contrast, enzyme-dead <italic>UAS-ED-leon</italic> failed to suppress these phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3DâE</xref>).

To further confirm the requirement of postsynaptic <italic>leon</italic> for proper control of SSR- and PSD-localized protein levels, <italic>leonRNAi</italic> knockdown was performed in pre- or post-synaptic sites. When the <italic>leonRNAi</italic> transgene was driven by postsynaptic <italic>24B-GAL4,</italic> the Dlg-positive zone, the dPak patch, and the GluRIIA cluster were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4A,C</xref>).

To increase the level of free ubiquitin chains in vivo, the conserved C-terminal residues Gly75 and Gly76 that are essential for substrate conjugation were mutated to Ala. UbAA can be conjugated by the endogenous ubiquitin C-terminus onto the Lys48 residue, forming free ubiquitin chains, but is unable to conjugate onto substrates including endogenous ubiquitin due to the C-terminal mutations. Also, UbAA-induced free ubiquitin chains are resistant to Leon enzymatic activity as the C-terminal AA motif would prevent recognition by USP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dayal et al., 2009</xref>).

Each bouton contains multiple release sites where neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles and received by receptors localized at the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Broadie and Richmond, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collins and DiAntonio, 2007</xref>). Leon negatively regulates these unique postsynaptic specializations through control of postsynaptic protein levels. The Leon function in postsynapses is specific as presynaptic defects were not obvious, and <italic>leon</italic> mutant defects could be rescued mostly by postsynaptic Leon expression. Leon tightly controls postsynaptic specializations throughout larval development. As such dramatic and concomitant expansion of SSRs and PSDs is rarely detected in other reported mutants, our study suggests that Leon likely executes a coordinated program in confining postsynaptic specializations.</p><p>The requirement of Leon deubiquitinating activity indicates that Leon functions as a conserved member of the USP5 family to disassemble free ubiquitin chains, thereby maintaining ubiquitin homeostasis in vivo. In <italic>leon</italic> mutants, accumulations of free ubiquitin chains and ubiquitinated substrates were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The immunostaining signals by FK2 antibodies were also highly intensified, in particular, at the postsynaptic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, free ubiquitin chains and ubiquitinated substrates are two major targets that are suppressed by USP5/Leon activity in postsynapses. Postsynaptic expression of UbAA that forms free ubiquitin chains mildly enhanced FK2 intensity and induced higher-levels of SSR- and PSD-localized proteins, similar to but not as dramatic as what was observed in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. In addition to free ubiquitin chains, ubiquitinated substrates also contribute to SSR and PSD expansion. In <italic>leon</italic> mutants, accumulation of ubiquitinated substrates could be attributed to disruption of proteasomal degradation, although the enzymatic activity of the proteasome remains active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the delivery of ubiquitinated substrates to proteasomal degradation is hindered, leading to their accumulation. In supporting of this idea, we showed that reducing the level of the UBA-UBL ubiquitin shuttling protein Ubqn could suppress SSR- and PSD-localized protein levels in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. Overexpression of Ubqn also caused accumulations of ubiquitinated substrates in postsynapses. The Ubqn protein itself also accumulated at the SSR region, and bound ubiquitinated substrates. Thus, in <italic>leon</italic> mutant postsynapses, higher levels of Ubqn could stall proteasomal degradation and cause accumulation of ubiquitinated substrates in postsynapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Taken together, we propose that accumulated free ubiquitin chains and Ubqn-bound ubiquitinated substrates are two primary causes of <italic>leon</italic> mutant defects.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26886.020</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Model for Leon in maintaining postsynaptic ubiquitin homeostasis and protein degradation.</title><p>Schematics show postsynaptic distributions of free and substrate-conjugated ubiquitin chains in wild-type (upper left) and <italic>leon</italic> mutant (upper right) postsynaptic sites.

Accumulation of free ubiquitin chains promotes Ubqn elevation, and Leon may suppress Ubqn levels through alternative pathways (dotted lines). Accumulated Ubqn could bind and stabilize ubiquitinated substrates. However, free ubiquitin chains and Ubqn when both are increased, collaborate to induce more accumulations of ubiquitinated substrates. Finally, accumulated substrates contribute to postsynaptic protein accumulation and SSR and PSD expansions (Solid lines: supported by experiments in this study; dash lines: proposed links).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26886.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26886.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-26886-fig11-v2"/></fig></p><p>Interestingly, Ubqn level was also upregulated in UbAA overexpression. Conversely, free ubiquitin chains maintained constant levels when Ubqn was overexpressed. These experiments would suggest that accumulation of free ubiquitin chains directly induces higher levels of Ubqn in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, which could be mediated through stabilization of Ubqn or other pathways. The effect of postsynaptic overexpression of UbAA or Ubqn only induced partial <italic>leon</italic> mutant phenotypes, such as in the levels of FK2 and postsynaptic proteins, implying tight control on ubiquitin homeostasis and protein substrate levels. Co-overexpression of UbAA and Ubqn together induced much higher FK2 intensity, and higher postsynaptic protein levels than overexpression of either one alone. Thus, Ubqn and UbAA are unlikely to function in a simple linear pathway, as the overexpression of UbAA would have suggested. Other factors such as ubiquitinated substrates have to be taken into account for the full expressivity of <italic>leon</italic> mutant phenotypes.</p><p>With the dramatic expansions of SSR and PSD in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, we assumed many postsynaptic proteins would be elevated in <italic>leon</italic> postsynapses. By examining some representative proteins, we showed that those proteins contribute to <italic>leon</italic> postsynaptic expansions. The SSR-localized Dlg was elevated and its reduction specifically alleviated SSR expansion. PSD-localized dPak was highly elevated near postsynaptic membranes, and dPak accumulation contributes SSR and PSD expansion in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. Two of SSR-localized NF-ÎºB complex, Cact and Dl, were found to accumulate in <italic>leon</italic> mutant SSR. Eliminating one wild-type allele or RNAi knockdown of <italic>cact</italic>, <italic>dl,</italic> or <italic>pll</italic> in <italic>leon</italic> mutants also suppressed the enlargement of GluRIIA clusters, consistent with their roles in regulating GluRIIA cluster abundance. As dramatic increases of protein levels were not detected in Western blots for <italic>leon</italic> mutants, as would be expected from immunostaining of postsynaptic proteins, other mechanisms like subcellular recruitment to postsynapses could be also involved.</p><p>How these postsynaptic proteins accumulated at <italic>leon</italic> mutant postsynapses? Ubqn could be the key factor in this process. Ubqn associated with ubiquitinated substrates in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, and could stabilize ubiquitinated dPak, Dlg and Cact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). These results suggest that Ubqn could associate with and stabilize ubiquitinated postsynaptic proteins, which contribute to <italic>leon</italic> mutant phenotypes. In particular, Ubqn localized at postsynaptic sites and was enriched locally when <italic>leon</italic> was inactivated, providing the specificity of Leon regulation to postsynaptic specializations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Interestingly, while reduction of Ubqn suppressed SSR- and PSD-localized protein levels in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, it enhanced <italic>leon</italic> mutant lethality, indicating the distinct role of Ubqn in postsynapses. Our current model suggests sequential events in <italic>leon</italic> mutant postsynapses, in which elevated free ubiquitin chains induced Ubqn upregulation, Ubqn further stabilized postsynaptic proteins, and accumulated postsynaptic proteins promote SSR and PSD expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). The inability to fully recapitulate <italic>leon</italic> mutant phenotypes could be due to limitation in overexpression or involvement of other factors. Thus, Leon maintains ubiquitin homeostasis through regulation of free ubiquitin chains, Ubqn levels and ubiquitinated substrates for proper development of postsynaptic specializations.</p><p>Our model that hinges on postsynaptic Ubqn has resemblances to the pathogenesis of ubiquilin 2-associated ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferraiuolo et al., 2011</xref>). Ubiquitin and ubiquilin 2 accumulations are common features in ALS patients, reminiscent of Ubqn and free ubiquitin chain accumulations in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. In addition to ubiquitin homeostatic imbalance and postsynaptic differentiation in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, overexpression of Ubqn causes pupal lethality and modifies TDP-43 toxicity in an ALS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lipinszki et al., 2011</xref>). Whether ubiquilin 2 accumulation could recruit free ubiquitin chains or ubiquitinated substrates to ubiquitin inclusions and enhance disease progression will be pivotal to understand the pathological mechanisms. Thus, Leon/USP5 holds Ubqn in check and prevents ubiquitin homeostatic imbalance, making <italic>USP5</italic> as a potential candidate disease gene in ubiquitin homeostasis-related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p><italic>leon<sup>1</sup></italic>, <italic>leon<sup>2</sup></italic>, <italic>19â2</italic> mutant alleles, <italic>UAS-Flag-leon</italic> and <italic>UAS-Flag-ED-leon</italic> are described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).

For immunoprecipitation, larvae were lysed in lysis buffer or lysis buffer with 0.5% SDS. Lysates with 0.5% SDS buffer were further diluted to final 0.2% SDS for immunoprecipitation. Lysates after incubation with Flag M2 beads (AB_2637089; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight were washed by lysis buffer three times and separated in Nupage 4%Â ~Â 12% Bis-Tris gel for Western blots. <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell line was purchased from Invitrogen (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_Z232">CVCL_Z232</ext-link>; Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells were cultured at 25Â°C in Schneiderâs <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Larval fillets were dissected in cold calcium-free HL3 saline and fixed in modified Trumpâs fixative (4% paraformaldehyde/1% glutaraldehyde/0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2) and postfixed with 1% aqueous osmium tetroxide/0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH7.2). The dissected muscles 6/7 of A3 segments were stained with 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and infiltrated with graded Spurrâs series in a microwave (PELCO BioWave Laboratory Microwave System,Â Ted Pella,Â Redding, CA). Thin sections (100 nm) were sectioned by ultramicrotome (Leica,Â Germany.) and further stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were acquired by Tecnai G2 Spirit TWIN (FEI Co,Â Hillsboro,Â OR.) and a Gatan CCD Camera (794.10 .BP2 MultiScan). TEM data were quantified by MetaMorph V6.3r7 (Molecular Devices,Â Sunnyvale,Â CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantifications</title><p>The thickness of Dlg-, Cact-, or mCD8GFP-positive zone was analyzed in the original confocal Z-stack images and averaged for lengths across the zone defined by eight straight lines radiating from the bouton center. GluRIIA cluster diameters were analyzed in the original confocal Z-stack images, which were scanned with 0.5 Î¼m intervals and covered overall boutons. Isolated GluRIIA cluster with circular shapes in different Z sections were selected to avoid choosing super-imposed ones for scoring their diameters. When elliptic cluster were chosen, the long and short diameters were averaged to reach the average diameters. Brp number and HRP-labeled NMJ areas were analyzed in the original confocal Z-stack images and Brp density was the ratio of Brp number to HRP-labeled NMJ area. Branch length was calculated from HRP labeling. GluRIIA/IIB/IIC and dPak intensities were the summation from all pixels of NMJs, which was normalized to the total HRP intensity at NMJs by Image J. Synaptic FK2 and Ubqn intensities were calculated by mean pixels in the synaptic area normalized to mean HRP pixels in the synaptic area by Image J. Muscular FK2 and Ubqn intensities were averaged from mean pixels of four muscle areas and normalized to mean HRP pixels in the postsynaptic sites by Image J. The intensities were normalized again to the control genotype for presentation in bar graphs.</p><p>To estimate expression levels from Western blots, each set of experiments was performed three times independently, and intensities for bands or areas of interest were processed by Image J with normalization to the internal control Î±-Tub.

Preparations were then incubated in modified HL3.1 saline containing 0.6 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for stimulation, and recordings were taken at room temperature. The two-electrode voltage-clamp was filled with 3 M KCl and impaled in muscle 6 of the A3 segment. One microelectrode (15Â ~Â 20 MÎ©) monitored the muscle membrane potential while the other (5Â ~Â 8 MÎ©) passed electric currents. The muscle membrane potential was clamped at a command value of â60 mV. mEJCs occurring in the background within 100 s were obtained without any stimulation on the segmental nerve. To record an EJC, the segmental nerve was stimulated every 10 s from the cut end that was connected by a suction electrode with 0.1 msec of pulse duration at the voltage two times that of the threshold. Signals were digitized at 50 kHz by a DigiData 1440 interface (Molecular Devices), low-pass filtered at 10 kHz, and saved on an IBM-compatible PC for analysis. For failure analysis, EJC was evoked in 0.2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], and the failure rate was calculated by ln(n/N), with n the number of failure events, and N the total number of stimuli.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank JT Wu, Aaron DiAntonio, Steven A Wasserman, Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center, DGRC, Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center, and DSHB for providing reagents, and SP Lee and SP Tsai for technical support.

Your article has been reviewed by K VijayRaghavan as Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Hugo Bellen, is a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we are willing to entertain a resubmission that addresses the reviewersâ comments.</p><p>We think that the mechanistic angle including the interpretation of the electrophysiological phenotype will be hard to fix within two months. However, we believe that you should be able to revise the manuscript in a satisfying manner and it should then hopefully be a candidate for <italic>eLife</italic>. We would be happy to re-review such a thoroughly revised version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the current manuscript, Wang et al. assess the function of the deubiquitinase Leon during <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development and document that it controls proper postsynaptic differentiation. Leon is the homolog of USP5, a deubiquitinase that functions specifically to disassemble free, substrate-unconjugated polyubiquitin chains to replenish the pool of mono-ubiquitin. Previously, the same group described that loss of <italic>Drosophila</italic> leon is lethal and leads to the accumulation of both free poly-ubiquitin chains, as well as polyubiquitinated proteins. In the current study, the authors describe a role for leon in regulating ubiquitin homeostasis and restricting the growth and development of the postsynaptic density (PSD) and subsynaptic reticulum (SSR): whereas presynaptic components are unaffected, the levels of numerous postsynaptic components (Dlg, GluRIIA/B, dPak, Cact and Dl) are strongly increased. Surprisingly, the observed phenotypes can be significantly rescued by reducing the levels of Ubiquilin, a protein that transports ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome. In addition, <italic>leon</italic> mutants display increased Ubiquilin levels in <italic>leon</italic> mutants and overexpressing ubiquilin in a wildtype background mimics the phenotypes found in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, albeit to a lesser extent. These data argue for a role of Ubiquilin in mediating PSD and SSR growth. However, free polyubiquitin chains seem to also play a role as overexpressing these chains also shows a milder version of the phenotypes observed in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. Finally, combined overexpression of Ubiquilin and free ubiquitin chains in a wildtype background completely mimics <italic>leon</italic> mutants. Hence, based on the presented data, Leon appears to restrict postsynaptic development by regulating the levels of both Ubiquilin and free polyubiquitin chains.</p><p>This is a carefully executed, well-controlled study that consists of an extensive and detailed phenotypic characterization of <italic>leon</italic> mutants. The figures are nicely organized and in most cases very convincingly bring the message across. It is counterintuitive that reducing the levels of a protein that removes polyubiquitinated proteins in a background in which the levels of polyubiquitinated substrates are elevated. However, the genetic experiments that were performed are clean and clearly show that free polyubiquitin chains, in combination with elevated Ubiquilin levels can affect postsynaptic development. How this occurs remains elusive and is not well discussed by the authors. The experiments to tease out the details of the actual mechanism underlying NMJ overgrowth in <italic>leon</italic> mutants are not trivial and may represent a continuation / expansion on this paper. I enjoyed reading this paper and would like to recommend it for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, if the authors can expand / hypothesize on the consequences of free ubiquitin chains / elevated Ubiquilin levels in the muscle.</p><p>Major comment:</p><p>â My major comment is a lack of interpretation of the results in the Discussion. At the moment, the Discussion mostly recapitulates the data. How do the authors think Ubiquilin and free ubiquitin chains affect NMJ development?</p><p>As the levels of Dlg, Cac, etc are elevated at the earliest stages of NMJ development, it appears that either (a) the activity and/or levels of the master regulator of postsynaptic density formation, which remains unknown, are increased in <italic>leon</italic> mutants or (b) that the individual proteins that are found at the PSD and SSR are directly regulated by Ubiquilin and/or free ubiquitin chains. This is not discussed at the moment, but is essential for the reader to help interpret the consequences of these findings.</p><p>How could free ubiquitin chains alter protein levels / activity? Does overexpressing free ubiquitin chains lead to a similar increase in Ubiquilin levels or are these two events independent?</p><p>In addition, is the increase in Ubiquilin due to a lack of free ubiquitin monomers? For instance, if the authors overexpress ubiquitin in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, can this rescue the increase in Ubiquilin levels? Does this affect NMJ development?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript reports a very pronounced synaptic phenotype for mutations in Leon, the fly homolog of USP5. Studying the neuromuscular junction, they provide strong evidence that there is an extreme expansion of the folds of the subsynaptic reticulum and a concomittent increase in the postsynaptic presence of proteins associated with that structure. In addition, they show that some proteins found in the postsynaptic density of the NMJ, most notably the receptor subunit GluRIIA, the scaffold protein dlg, and the signaling molecule dPAK are also expanded as is the density by EM. These postsynaptic changes are accompanied by a large change in the gross morpology of the synapse, including a reduction in bouton number. The changes in the nerve structure, however, seem to be an indirect consequence of the role of Leon in the muscle.</p><p>The strength of the paper is in the basic description of these phenotypes. The weaknesses of the paper are in the characterization of the electrophysiology and, above all, in the attempt to formulate a mechanistic explanation of the phenotype. There are small technical issues throughout, such as the failure to quantify Western blots and imprecisions in the description (such as equating Cactus or dlg staining with SSR), but where the manuscript really falls apart is from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> on.</p><p>Major Criticisms:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: it is not clear to me why they use the heterozygote as the control in panel A. The values for EJC amplitude and quantal content are much lower than the control values in panels B and C. Also, the values for miniEJC amplitude vary greatly from one genetic background to another, hovering around 700 in the D42 and 24B Gal4 lines and more like 900 in the +/19-2 &quot;control&quot;. Because this value is the denominator by which they judge quantal content it is possible that the apparent decrease in quantal content is largely due to an increase in mini amplitude that they missed because the +/19-2 value is abnormally high. I would strongly recommend they include <italic>w1118</italic> controls, recorded on the same days, alongside all the measurements for genotypes presented so that one can distinguish effects of the genetic background from those of the mutations. They should use the method of failures to determine quantal content independently since there is good reason to suspect they are misled at present. The increase in quantal size cannot alone explain the decrease in EJC amplitude but might explain a homeostatic decrease in probability of release. In any case, in its current state, the electrophysiology is not interpretable and the final line of that section, which says something vague about correlating with the expansion phenotype, is not really an interpretation and it isn't clear what &quot;correlating&quot; refers to.</p><p>Nevertheless, the obvious explanation for the decreased EJC amplitude is that there are far fewer boutons present and therefore fewer release sites and less release. I don't understand why they do not make this point. That miniEJC frequency is normal may reflect a homeostatic compensation, but it seems inadequate to compensate for the sharp drop in bouton #.</p><p>Subsection âImpaired electrophysiological properties at <italic>leon</italic> mutant NMJsâ paragraph two: do the authors intend mEJC amplitude or EJC amplitude. Did they mean the driver by itself or the driver driving the transgene? This sentence was unclear.</p><p>The same paragraph overstates the result. EJC amplitude are not restored to wt levels (and the significance of the change is not tested statistically). What they mean to say is &quot;partially restores&quot; of &quot;improves relative to the mutant&quot; or something like that.</p><p>Mechanism: the manuscript does not describe the ubiquitination or a change in ubiquitination for any of the proteins that they claim are misregulated as a result of the leon mutations. They have only overexposed Western blots that are likely to be saturated and no accurate quantification of the levels of the postsynaptic proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>Re: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, one cannot equate Cactus staining with the SSR (see point re <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> also). It might label the entire SSR or it might not, but it would be best just to refer to the width of the cactus immunoreactive zone unless one also is going to do EM to look at the SSR or syndapin staining which might be OK as a surrogate for SSR.</p><p>The authors say that knockdown of syndapin has no effect on cactus or GluRIIA expansion but offer no evidence that their RNAi altered syndapin expression. Similarly, they base all the arguments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> on the effects of heterozygotes but do not indicate if those heterozygotes changed levels of the encoded protein and over-interpret a failure to alter a parameter as a lack of involvement of that protein in the expansions they observed. Since they do not know quantitatively if leon mutations have altered the levels of that protein, they cannot know if the heterozygous allele they use (a seemingly arbitrary decision) has had any impact on the level of the protein, decreased it back to control levels or not, or rendered it lower than controls. These experiments are not interpretable.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> comes the closest to a mechanistic understanding by implicating Ubqn in the pathway. The data are imperfect however since there is no quantification of the claimed increase in Ubqn in the <italic>leon</italic> mutants and the ability of Ubqn loss of function to prevent the expansion of the postsynaptic markers does not really prove that it was directly in the path of the changes. Presumably any protein that was required for the SSR or the PSD would be necessary regardless of whether it was regulated by Leon. Other specific issues for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> include: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, FK2 intensity is measured; is this with background subtraction? Given the big change in overall levels this seems to be necessary, especially since the authors are emphasizing a synaptic decrease, but it is not mentioned in the text/methods. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> the authors claim that Ubqn levels are upregulated in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. The change in band size is too subtle to tell, especially with the saturation of both the Ubqn and loading control bands. Either a quantification with several replicates or a shorter exposure blot would be necessary. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> the authors claim that Ubqn immunostaining is increased in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, &quot;highly elevated at SSR rather than other regions&quot;; the magnification is too low to tell, and a quantification is necessary to demonstrate the robustness of the phenotype. If quantification cannot be done, please at least show multiple examples. Figure 7âfigure supplement 2C: no loading control shown on the blots.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is a complex pathway of protein metabolism implicated in such diverse cellular functions. A late step of the process involves disassembly of the polyubiquitin chains on degraded proteins into ubiquitin monomers. USP5 disassembles branched polyubiquitin chains by a sequential exo mechanism, starting at the proximal end of the chain. Particularly, the enzyme is meant to disassemble free, substrate-unconjugated polyubiquitin chains to replenish the pool of mono-ubiquitin, and thus maintain cellular ubiquitin homeostasis.</p><p>The Chien lab recently published a first genetic analysis for USP5 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, showing that Leon is essential for viability, and that <italic>leon</italic> mutants accumulate both free and substrate-conjugated polyubiquitin chains Proteasomal enzymatic activities were elevated in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, while proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated substrates was impaired.</p><p>Here, the Chien lab executed an analysis of Leon function at the larval NMJ system. Core findings/experiments they present are 1) an expansion of the SSR muscle membrane infoldings and the size of postsynaptic glutamate receptor fields/PSD area due to a lack of muscle Leon function; 2) Western blots and immunostainings of dissected body wall muscles pointing towards increased levels of free and substrate-conjugated polyubiquitin chains; 3) based on TEVC recordings, an impairment of evoked release EJC amplitude and quantal content due to lack of postsynaptic muscle Leon; 4) heterozygous suppression of SSR outgrowth/GluRIIA receptor field outgrowth via dlg /dpak, creating arguments for accumulation of postsynaptic proteins to promote SSR expansion; 5) muscle knockdown of UBA-UBL ubiquitin receptor Ubqn suppressed expansions of Dlg rings and GluRIIA.</p><p>Per se, I am impressed by the severity of the phenotypes (SSR expansion, GluR fields) they report, and I think if appropriately revised this manuscript might become a strong candidate for <italic>eLife</italic>. My major concerns are the following:</p><p>1) Can they exclude that they are looking at a &quot;heterochronic&quot; phenotype? In the case of dlg mutants, SSR formation is impaired throughout larval development when comparing precisely timed animals. However, as pupa formation is impaired or completely suppressed in dlg mutants, SSR ultimately growths to over a value found in wild type controls. Are their <italic>leon</italic> mutants undergoing pupa formation timely? They should compare precisely timed cohorts to make sure that really the pace of SSR expansion is increased here.</p><p>2) Ubqn knockdown they apparently only tested within <italic>leon</italic> mutant background. How does the phenotype look like in wt background? Are they maybe just seeing the addition of two phenotypes here without any specific functional interaction? Anyway, I must confess that I cannot fully follow the mechanistic connection in between Leon and Ubqn.</p><p>3) They should try to directly monitor a poly-U species of some relevant postsynaptic protein. This would make their case more convincing.</p><p>4) Concerning the diameter of the GluRIIA fields they report: values appear very high. Can they exclude that they are imaging two or more super-imposed receptor fields as one?</p><p>5) Somewhat surprisingly but not without example, they find mini amplitudes to be unchanged despite a severe increase of particularly GluRIIA. However, I was surprised to see a down-regulation of evoked release, means that quantal content is severely down here. Concerning the mechanistic basis of their electrophysiological phenotypes, they say: &quot;which correlates with its requirement in postsynaptic differentiation&quot; I am afraid this is insufficient.</p><p>6) They state that both free polyubiquitin chains and ubiquitinated substrate proteins were changed in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. Is the availability of monomeric Ubiquitin determining their phenotype? Could they test for this?</p><p>7) Why in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> much more poly-U signal when overexpressing the kinase dead ED Leon?</p><p>General comment: the manuscript clearly needs language editing. Moreover, the format of the figures is very diverse, and could be improved by e.g. showing blow ups of the respective GluRIIA phenotypes.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;USP5/Leon deubiquitinase confines postsynaptic growth by maintaining ubiquitin homeostasis through Ubiquilin&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Please make the textual changes suggested by his reviewer..</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript is stronger, the electrophysiology more rigorous, and I also think it should be published. The phenotype is big, clear, and the genetics of rescue and RNAi are all very robust. The supplemental table with full statistics is very valuable, as is the inclusion of data from the cd8GFP reporter of the ssr. Some issues can (and should) be improved in the text. My chief concern is that the mechanism behind the phenotypes is not nearly as clear as the authors state. It is fine with me that some things remain poorly explained; but the authors need not try to make it appear as if the very modest changes in certain protein levels are sufficient to explain the phenoptyes or that the changes in bouton number can adequately explain what is happening to quantal content. Ubiquitin homeostasis and protein turn over are very complicated and broadly acting processes and not easily pinned down to the few proteins one looks at. By the end of the Results, a very strong case has been made for the importance of ubiquitination and Ubqn in regulating the development of the postsynapse. The remarks below are to help the authors avoid certain overstatements and premature conclusions in what is otherwise a very interesting and complete manuscript.</p><p>1. In the subsection âIncreases of postsynaptic proteins in <italic>leon</italic> mutantsâ and in the Discussion, it is a little awkward to say that each bouton houses tens of synapses (and it isn't always that many) because the term synapse is used sometimes to refer to the whole junction, sometimes to a bouton, and sometimes to each release site. If they say each bouton contains multiple release sites that face discrete receptor clusters the sentence will be less awkward.</p><p>2. At the end of the subsection âImpaired electrophysiological properties at <italic>leon</italic> mutant NMJsâ: the change in bouton number (which this reviewer suggested as an explanation) doesn't really completely account for the change in the ejc amplitude and quantal content. It may account for some of it, but the ephys parameters are decreased by 50% or more (perhaps 65% for quantal content) and bouton # is only decreased by 20-25%. If the density of release sites per bouton and size of boutons is really unchanged, there remains a mismatch that should still be acknowledged. It is tedious, but it would also help if the authors counted brp puncta in an entire NMJ to get a real value for release sites per NMJ. There may be changes in density, for example, that don't reach statistical significance on their own but, coupled with changes in bouton diameter and number might add up to a larger difference in release sites per NMJ. The bottom line is that it is ok if some of the ephys remains mysterious to explain - but this reviewer did not mean to imply that bouton number alone can actually explain the whole phenotype.</p><p>3. There is obviously a disconnect between the very large changes in the SSR and dlg and gluR distributions, and the very small (and in the case of the weaker allele, insignificant) changes in the levels of Pak, dlg, and cact. I think it is fair to guess that many other proteins are increased in order to produce the large changes in the structure of the synapse. In addition, the fact that mutations in those proteins and others can prevent to increase in SSR or GluR markers does not in any way indicate that those proteins are part of the pathway through which leon is acting â it only confirms those proteins are important for normal SSR and GluR development, i.e. they could as easily be part of parallel pathways regulating development as part of a linear pathway.</p><p>4. At the end of the subsection âSuppression of <italic>leon</italic> mutant phenotypes by reducing Ubqn levelsâ: the conclusion regarding the Ubqn increases seen in <italic>leon</italic> mutants is also overstated at this point in the paper. It is certainly likely that this contributes to the other phenotypes and the finding of a large increase in Ubqn in <italic>leon</italic> mutants and the finding that reducing Ubqn can prevent some or all of the phenotypes is important. But to really prove that the change in Ubqn is causative and not merely part of the phenotype, it needs the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> that shows that overexpression of Ubqn in the muscle has the same phenotype as <italic>leon</italic> loss of function. (Ideally, they would also show that simply reducing Ubqn back to wildtype levels with RNAi or a heterozygote would be sufficient to reverse the leon phenotype. Instead they have used RNAi that nearly entirely remove the Ubqn.) The text for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> should therefore be more circumspect or the big summary of the data for Ubqn in the pathway should wait till after the overexpression of Ubqn is presented in 8A,B.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26886.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[â¦] Major comment:</italic> </p><p><italic>â My major comment is a lack of interpretation of the results in the Discussion.

This is not discussed at the moment, but is essential for the reader to help interpret the consequences of these findings.</italic> </p><p>We have revised the discussion on how free ubiquitin chains and Ubqn affect postsynaptic development in <italic>leon</italic> mutants (Discussion section paragraph three on the relationship of Ubqn and free Ub chains, and paragraph five on how SSR and PSD proteins accumulate). In addition, we have performed two additional experiments to address the relationship between free ubiquitin chains, Ubqn and individual SSR or PSD-localized proteins. First, overexpressing free ubiquitin chains also induced Ubqn accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A, B</xref>, also see response to reviewer#1, point 2). Second, overexpression of Ubqn enhanced/stabilized ubiquitinated dPak, Dlg and Cact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Overall, our model proposes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) that lack of <italic>leon</italic> deubiquitinating activity induces accumulation of free ubiquitin chains, which also contributes to Ubqn upregulation, and both accumulations lead to the accumulations of postsynaptic proteins that induce SSR and PSD growth. Based on this model, the role of Leon/USP5 is to maintain ubiquitin homeostasis, a process critical to postsynaptic growth.</p><p><italic>How could free ubiquitin chains alter protein levels / activity? Does overexpressing free ubiquitin chains lead to a similar increase in Ubiquilin levels or are these two events independent?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of this experiment. We examined whether muscle overexpression of different ubiquitins (UbGG, UbAA and K48RUbAA) could regulate Ubqn levels. The result is that only overexpression of UbAA could upregulate Ubqn, indicating that excessive free ubiquitin chains induce Ubqn accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A, B</xref>). In contrast, Ubqn overexpression failed to accumulate free ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Thus, free ubiquitin chains and Ubqn seem to function in a linear pathway upon losing of Leon activity. However, overexpression of UbAA could not fully recapitulate the severity of <italic>leon</italic> phenotypes, which could be that UbAA overexpression hardly reaches the high-level free ubiquitin chains in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, or free ubiquitin chains account partially for Ubqn elevation in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. Ubqn overexpression enhanced the levels of ubiquitinated dPak, Dlg and Cact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The elevated Ubqn could then bind to more ubiquitinated substrates like dPak, Dlg and Cact in postsynapses, leading to their increases in levels and activities. Therefore, this linear part of the pathway from free ubiquitin chains to Ubqn elevation could explain the substrate accumulation, although some other factors could not be excluded.</p><p><italic>In addition, is the increase in Ubiquilin due to a lack of free ubiquitin monomers? For instance, if the authors overexpress ubiquitin in leon mutants, can this rescue the increase in Ubiquilin levels? Does this affect NMJ development?</italic> </p><p>We found no evidence to support that the increase of Ubqn is due to a lack of ubiquitin monomer. In <italic>leon</italic> mutants, while Ubqn was increased, the level of ubiquitin monomers was also increased by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Muscle overexpression of UbGG or K48RUbAA, which produced more ubiquitin monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), failed to alter Ubqn levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A, B</xref>). Thus, the increase of Ubqn is unlikely caused by the lack of ubiquitin monomers. Therefore, we did not perform the rescue experiment of overexpression of UbGG or K48RUbAA in <italic>leon</italic> mutants to suppress Ubqn levels and to affect NMJ development.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[â¦] Major Criticisms:</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: it is not clear to me why they use the heterozygote as the control in panel A. The values for EJC amplitude and quantal content are much lower than the control values in panels B and C. Also, the values for miniEJC amplitude vary greatly from one genetic background to another, hovering around 700 in the D42 and 24B Gal4 lines and more like 900 in the +/19-2 &quot;control&quot;. Because this value is the denominator by which they judge quantal content it is possible that the apparent decrease in quantal content is largely due to an increase in mini amplitude that they missed because the +/19-2 value is abnormally high. I would strongly recommend they include w1118 controls, recorded on the same days, alongside all the measurements for genotypes presented so that one can distinguish effects of the genetic background from those of the mutations. They should use the method of failures to determine quantal content independently since there is good reason to suspect they are misled at present.</italic> </p><p>We respond to this comment with three points below:</p><p>1)The reason to perform electrophysiology recording with the heterozygous mutant <italic>+/19-2</italic> as the control is to avoid possible background mutations that might arise from the deletion allele. However, we also understand the reviewerâs concern that <italic>+/19-2</italic> could have presented a phenotype in comparison to <italic>w1118</italic>. We therefore preformed new mEJC recording for <italic>w1118, +/19-2</italic> and <italic>leon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup>/19-2</italic> and recorded three different genotypes on the same days (Indeed, all our electrophysiological recordings are always done in the same days for different genotypes). The mEJCs of <italic>w1118</italic> and <italic>+/19-2</italic> show little difference (689 v.s. 709 pA). The mEJC of <italic>leon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup>/19-2</italic> showed some increases to <italic>w1118</italic> and <italic>+/19-2,</italic> although they are not statistical significant (p=0.3 and 0.39, respectively, by Studentâs <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Taken together with data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, it seems that mEJCs of <italic>leon<sup>1</sup>/19-2</italic> is likely slightly larger than controls.</p><p>2) However, whether the difference in mEJCs is statistical significant or not depends on the genetic background. When performed with GAL4 driver backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>), the increases are statistical significant, while without the GAL4 driver background, the increases are not statistical significant by comparison to <italic>w1118</italic> and <italic>+/19-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and above). Therefore, we always perform electrophysiological recording with respective GAL4 control in rescue experiments.</p><p>3) The slight increase in mEJCs, whether it is statistically significance or not, could not account for the large reduction in the quantal content, which is mainly due to the reduction in EJCs. As suggested by the reviewer, we also preformed failure analysis in <italic>w1118, +/19-2</italic> and <italic>leon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup>/19-2</italic> and showed that the quantal content was dramatically decreased in <italic>leon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup>/19-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, the quantal content in <italic>leon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup>/19-2</italic> is reduced as compared to both <italic>w1118</italic> and <italic>+/19-2</italic> with studies from two different measurements.

We thank the reviewer for pointing out one better explanation. We rewrote the sentence in the manuscript to describe that fewer boutons might be correlative to lower EJCs and quantal contents detected in <italic>leon</italic> mutants (subsection âImpaired electrophysiological properties at <italic>leon</italic> mutant NMJsâ).</p><p><italic>Subsection âImpaired electrophysiological properties at leon mutant NMJsâ paragraph two: do the authors intend mEJC amplitude or EJC amplitude.

Therefore, we propose that both increase of protein levels and localization to postsynaptic sites are two major regulations. We have also changed images with shorter exposure for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>.</p><p>Regarding ubiquitination, the ubiquitinated proteins are difficult to detect in Western blot for body wall muscle extracts. We have tried to overexpress tagged transgenes for Ub and Dlg or dPak in muscles and still had difficulty to detect any changes in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. One possibility is that the pools of proteins in postsynaptic sites are not sufficient for detecting any change. We also tried to knockdown of Leon in S2 cells by dsRNA for examing Dlg, dPak and Cact ubiquitination. While 90% of Leon was depleted in S2 cells, such knockdown efficiency is not sufficient to disrupt ubiquitin homeostasis in S2 cells, as free ubiquitin chains and ubiquitinated substrates could not be detected. One alternative experiment that we have performed is the detection of protein ubiquitination with or without Ubqn in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We found that ubiquitinations of dPak, Dlg and Cact were elevated when Ubqn was overexpressed. Thus, Ubqn is the important player in mediating protein accumulation in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. The results are described in a paragraph two of subsection âUbqn induces and associates with ubiquitinated postsynaptic proteinsâ, and discussed in paragraph five of the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Re: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, one cannot equate Cactus staining with the SSR (see point re <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> also).

We were not able to obtain Syndapin antibodies for the assessment, either. We therefore used the membrane form of GFP that is enriched in SSR to repeat the genetic suppression test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Since they do not know quantitatively if leon mutations have altered the levels of that protein, they cannot know if the heterozygous allele they use (a seemingly arbitrary decision) has had any impact on the level of the protein, decreased it back to control levels or not, or rendered it lower than controls.

Heterozygous mutants showed a suppression effect on one or the other phenotype (Cact/Dlg or GluRIIA expansion) in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. Thus, whether protein levels are reduced or not, they should have reduced the gene activity in the heterozygous background. Nevertheless, we also tested the RNAi knockdown of <italic>dlg, dpak, pll, dl</italic> and <italic>cact</italic> in muscles of the <italic>leon</italic> mutants, and show the effect on suppression of mCD8GFP-labled SSR or GluRIIA expansions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

The data are imperfect however since there is no quantification of the claimed increase in Ubqn in the leon mutants and the ability of Ubqn loss of function to prevent the expansion of the postsynaptic markers does not really prove that it was directly in the path of the changes.

In the case of dlg mutants, SSR formation is impaired throughout larval development when comparing precisely timed animals. However, as pupa formation is impaired or completely suppressed in dlg mutants, SSR ultimately growths to over a value found in wild type controls. Are their leon mutants undergoing pupa formation timely? They should compare precisely timed cohorts to make sure that really the pace of SSR expansion is increased here.</italic> </p><p>We noticed that the entire larval stage in the <italic>leon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup>/19-2</italic> mutant was one day longer than wild type.

The explanation for the connection between <italic>leon</italic> and <italic>Ubqn</italic> could be found in response to reviewer#1, point 2, and more thoroughly in Discussion (paragraphs three and five). Briefly, elevated free ubiquitin chains in <italic>leon</italic> mutants induced elevation of Ubqn levels.

These results were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> and described in paragraph two of subsection âUbqn induces and associates with ubiquitinated postsynaptic proteinsâ. These results are consistent with that accumulation of Ubqn, such as in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, stabilizes ubiquitinated dPak, Dlg and Cact.

Can they exclude that they are imaging two or more super-imposed receptor fields as one?</italic> </p><p>In our analysis,the diameter of GluRIIA clusters is about 0.63 Âµm in wild type third instar larvae, which is comparable to GluR cluster diameters in a previous report from Graeme Davisâs group, showing that the GluRIIC diameter is about 0.78 Âµm in third instar larvae and the GluRIIA diameter is about 0.52 Âµm in second instar larvae (Pielage et al., 2006). In our study, we were very cautious to select âisolatedâ GluRIIA puncta in both mutants and wild type. The methodology is described in Materials and methods (âQuantificationsâ). Briefly,Z stacks of GluRIIA images were scanned with 0.5 Âµm intervals. Isolated puncta in different Z sections were selected for scoring, thus avoiding super-imposed ones.</p><p><italic>5) Somewhat surprisingly but not without example, they find mini amplitudes to be unchanged despite a severe increase of particularly GluRIIA. However, I was surprised to see a down-regulation of evoked release, means that quantal content is severely down here. Concerning the mechanistic basis of their electrophysiological phenotypes, they say: &quot;which correlates with its requirement in postsynaptic differentiation&quot; I am afraid this is insufficient.</italic> </p><p>We think it is not easy to explain the down-regulation of evoked release through postsynaptic structural defects. One possible explanation is that the overall bouton number was decreased in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, leading to the decreased evoked response (as suggested by reviewer 2). Thus, the description is rewritten as âAs postsynaptic expression of Leon also suppressed bouton reduction in the <italic>leon</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, 1F</xref>), the reduction of the EJC amplitude and the quantal content could be attributed to the reduction of the bouton and hence the release sites in <italic>leon</italic> mutantsâ.</p><p><italic>6) They state that both free polyubiquitin chains and ubiquitinated substrate proteins were changed in leon mutants. Is the availability of monomeric Ubiquitin determining their phenotype?

However, it cannot promote SSR and PSD expansion. Instead, UbAA that could form free ubiquitin chains (lane 3) promotes SSR and PSD expansion. While ubiquitin monomers were increased in <italic>leon</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), elevated ubiquitin monomers seem have no contribution to SSR and PSD expansion.</p><p><italic>7) Why in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> much more poly-U signal when overexpressing the kinase dead ED Leon?</italic> </p><p>We think that ED-Leon could associate with polyubiquitin chains but fail to disassemble polyubiquitin chains due to inactivation of the enzymatic activity. It is possible that binding to ED-Leon sequesters ubiquitinated substrates from degradation and leads to their accumulation.</p><p><italic>General comment: the manuscript clearly needs language editing.

We also made figure and bar graph format consistent throughout the text.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the second round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript is stronger, the electrophysiology more rigorous, and I also think it should be published. The phenotype is big, clear, and the genetics of rescue and RNAi are all very robust. The supplemental table with full statistics is very valuable, as is the inclusion of data from the cd8GFP reporter of the ssr. Some issues can (and should) be improved in the text. My chief concern is that the mechanism behind the phenotypes is not nearly as clear as the authors state. It is fine with me that some things remain poorly explained; but the authors need not try to make it appear as if the very modest changes in certain protein levels are sufficient to explain the phenoptyes or that the changes in bouton number can adequately explain what is happening to quantal content. Ubiquitin homeostasis and protein turn over are very complicated and broadly acting processes and not easily pinned down to the few proteins one looks at. By the end of the Results, a very strong case has been made for the importance of ubiquitination and Ubqn in regulating the development of the postsynapse. The remarks below are to help the authors avoid certain overstatements and premature conclusions in what is otherwise a very interesting and complete manuscript.</italic> </p><p><italic>1. In the subsection âIncreases of postsynaptic proteins in leon mutantsâ and in the Discussion, it is a little awkward to say that each bouton houses tens of synapses (and it isn't always that many) because the term synapse is used sometimes to refer to the whole junction, sometimes to a bouton, and sometimes to each release site. If they say each bouton contains multiple release sites that face discrete receptor clusters the sentence will be less awkward.</italic> </p><p>Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we modified the sentences as âAt NMJs, each bouton contains multiple release sites paired with discrete receptor clusters thatâ¦â and âEach bouton contains multiple release sites where neurotransmittersâ¦â.</p><p><italic>2. At the end of the subsection âImpaired electrophysiological properties at leon mutant NMJsâ: the change in bouton number (which this reviewer suggested as an explanation) doesn't really completely account for the change in the ejc amplitude and quantal content. It may account for some of it, but the ephys parameters are decreased by 50% or more (perhaps 65% for quantal content) and bouton # is only decreased by 20-25%. If the density of release sites per bouton and size of boutons is really unchanged, there remains a mismatch that should still be acknowledged. It is tedious, but it would also help if the authors counted brp puncta in an entire NMJ to get a real value for release sites per NMJ. There may be changes in density, for example, that don't reach statistical significance on their own but, coupled with changes in bouton diameter and number might add up to a larger difference in release sites per NMJ. The bottom line is that it is ok if some of the ephys remains mysterious to explain - but this reviewer did not mean to imply that bouton number alone can actually explain the whole phenotype.</italic> </p><p>We quantified the Brp number per NMJ: <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>, 731.6 Â± 31.6; <italic>leon<sup>2</sup>/19-2</italic>, 631.9 Â± 28.1; <italic>leon<sup>1</sup>/19-2</italic>, 619.5 Â± 31.1; n = 10 for all genotypes; Statistics by Studentâs t test showed that both leon mutants were p &lt; 0.05 in comparison to <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>. These reductions of Brp numbers are about 15%, and are close to the 20% reduction in the bouton numbers in <italic>leon</italic> mutants. As EJC and quantal content were decreased by 50%, we think reduction of bouton and the releasing sites contribute partly to the reduction of EJC and quantal content. We present this quantification and modified the description accordingly.</p><p><italic>3. There is obviously a disconnect between the very large changes in the SSR and dlg and gluR distributions, and the very small (and in the case of the weaker allele, insignificant) changes in the levels of Pak, dlg, and cact. I think it is fair to guess that many other proteins are increased in order to produce the large changes in the structure of the synapse. In addition, the fact that mutations in those proteins and others can prevent to increase in SSR or GluR markers does not in any way indicate that those proteins are part of the pathway through which leon is acting â it only confirms those proteins are important for normal SSR and GluR development, i.e. they could as easily be part of parallel pathways regulating development as part of a linear pathway.</italic> </p><p>We agree that many proteins are altered in <italic>leon</italic> mutants, and we are only able to examine a handful of them. The slight but not dramatic increases in protein levels of dPak, Dlg and Cact as shown by Western blots could explain at least partly the protein accumulation in postsynaptic specializations. Other mechanisms such as protein recruitment could be also involved. We modified the texts to describe this idea in the Results and Discussion. Regarding whether these proteins are part of the Leon pathway or not, we have not implied that Leon is in direct regulation of these proteins. Instead, we have included Ubqn in the model to explain how these proteins might be stabilized and contribute to postsynaptic structural expansions (Discussion, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> for a schematic model).</p><p><italic>4. At the end of the subsection âSuppression of leon mutant phenotypes by reducing Ubqn levelsâ: the conclusion regarding the Ubqn increases seen in leon mutants is also overstated at this point in the paper. It is certainly likely that this contributes to the other phenotypes and the finding of a large increase in Ubqn in leon mutants and the finding that reducing Ubqn can prevent some or all of the phenotypes is important. But to really prove that the change in Ubqn is causative and not merely part of the phenotype, it needs the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> that shows that overexpression of Ubqn in the muscle has the same phenotype as leon loss of function. (Ideally, they would also show that simply reducing Ubqn back to wildtype levels with RNAi or a heterozygote would be sufficient to reverse the leon phenotype. Instead they have used RNAi that nearly entirely remove the Ubqn.) The text for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> should therefore be more circumspect or the big summary of the data for Ubqn in the pathway should wait till after the overexpression of Ubqn is presented in 8A,B.</italic></p><p>We modified the conclusion for Fig. 7. This modified text was shown in Lines 431-433, as âThese results are consistent with that the increase in the Ubqn level in <italic>leon</italic> mutants could mediate expansions of Dlg-positive zones, dPak patches and GluRIIA clusters in <italic>leon</italic> mutants.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
