germ cell fate across species. Little is known about the physical properties of germ granules and how these relate to germ cell function. Here we study two types of germ granules in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo: cytoplasmic germ granules that instruct primordial germ cells (PGCs) formation and nuclear germ granules within early PGCs with unknown function. We show that cytoplasmic and nuclear germ granules are phase transitioned condensates nucleated by Oskar protein that display liquid as well as hydrogel-like properties. Focusing on nuclear granules, we find that Oskar drives their formation in heterologous cell systems. Multiple, independent Oskar protein domains synergize to promote granule phase separation. Deletion of Oskar’s nuclear localization sequence specifically ablates nuclear granules in cell systems. In the embryo, nuclear germ granules promote germ cell divisions thereby increasing PGC number for the next generation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>germ cells</kwd><kwd>germ granules</kwd><kwd>mebraneless RNP granules</kwd><kwd>phase transition</kwd><kwd>Oskar protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehmann</surname><given-names>Ruth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99HD088675</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trcek</surname><given-names>Tatjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The scaffolding protein Oskar organizes two types of germ granules by phase transition within the same cell but with distinct morphologies, composition and biological functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Specialized ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are a hallmark of all germ cells. Throughout the animal kingdom, these granules share germline-specific proteins such as the ATP-dependent RNA helicase Vasa and are present during different stages of germ cell development. Morphologically, germ granules resemble other non-membrane bound RNP condensates such as P bodies and stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Courchaine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Decker and Parker, 2012</xref>). Biophysical studies describe membrane-less granules as droplets that form by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) where proteins phase separate by concentration-dependent de-mixing thereby markedly increasing their concentration within the condensate compared to the solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brangwynne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Courchaine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). Proteins engaged in these transitions exchange freely with their environment. Transitions to a more structured, highly polymerized phase have been described for FUS (Fused in sarcoma) granules found in ALS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Murray et al., 2017</xref>), Rim4 amyloids in meiotic fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berchowitz et al., 2015</xref>) and the FG repeat proteins of the nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frey et al., 2006</xref>). Here concentration-dependent phase transitions lead from a liquid to a less fluid hydrogel-like state, where at least a fraction of granule protein is polymerized into β-sheet filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). Because of this, the proteins that reside within hydrogels are more stably associated and only slowly exchange with their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). Proteins that mediate these concentration dependent transitions often contain low complexity (LC) domains (domains that contain an overrepresentation of a subset of amino acids (aa) in the primary protein sequence) or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which promote non-specific protein-protein interactions, as well as RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), posttranslational modifications and higher specificity dimerization and protein-protein interaction domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brangwynne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Courchaine et al., 2016</xref>). P granules, the embryonic germ granules of <italic>C. elegans,</italic> are composed of different LC and IDR domain containing proteins and behave largely as condensed liquid droplets but by high resolution microcopy also reveal compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In vivo, aged yeast and mammalian stress granules adopt both liquid and hydrogel-like granule arrangements: they can nucleate as liquid droplets and mature into hydrogels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin et al., 2015</xref>), or are simultaneously comprised of both arrangements with a more solid hydrogel-like core surrounded by a liquid-like shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Niewidok et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We are interested in connecting the biophysical properties of <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ granules to their cellular function. Germ granules are part of the germ plasm that forms at the posterior pole during oogenesis where it occupies only ~0.01% of the embryo’s volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Trcek et al., 2015</xref>). A careful examination of germ plasm with electron microscopy (EM) revealed that germ plasm proteins and mRNAs are organized into small (up to 500 nm) germ granules that are round and non-membrane bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arkov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mahowald, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mahowald et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nakamura et al., 1996</xref>). Germ granules are tightly associated with ribosomes indicating that they are sites of active translational regulation. Indeed, referred to as the hubs for post-translational regulation, germ granule localization specifically promotes translation of many germ plasm-enriched mRNAs while their un-localized counterparts remain translationally repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gavis and Lehmann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rangan et al., 2009</xref>). Formation of the germ plasm relies on Oskar protein, whose mRNA localizes at the posterior pole of a developing oocyte. Once translated, the short isoform of Oskar (Short Oskar) recruits other germ plasm components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ephrussi and Lehmann, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lehmann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Markussen et al., 1995</xref>). Among these, the core germ plasm protein Vasa, a DEAD-box helicase, Tudor (Tud), the founder of the Tudor domain family of proteins, and Aubergine (Aub), a Piwi family Pi RNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lehmann, 2016</xref>), as well as up to 200 maternally-provided mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frise et al., 2010</xref>). A second, N-terminally extended isoform, called Long Oskar, has been implicated in the formation of an extended actin meshwork at the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>) where it promotes germ granule tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rongo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vanzo and Ephrussi, 2002</xref>) and recruits maternally-provided mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hurd et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Germ plasm is essential for <italic>Drosophila</italic> fertility as it promotes the formation and specification of the PGCs, the first cell lineage to form in the fertilized embryo. At the initial stages of embryonic development, nuclei divide in the center of the embryo. With the onset of the ninth nuclear division nuclei migrate towards the embryo’s periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Su et al., 1998</xref>). Those nuclei that migrate to the posterior end of the embryo become engulfed by the germ plasm. At this stage, germ plasm nuclei become separated from the rest of the embryo by embryonic membranes to form the PGCs, while the remaining nuclei continue their synchronous divisions for four more cycles prior to the cellularization of the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cinalli and Lehmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>). Soon after PGCs cellularize, they no longer divide synchronously with the somatic nuclei and arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle prior to the onset of germ cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cinalli and Lehmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Su et al., 1998</xref>). In addition to the cytoplasmic germ granules of the germ plasm, nuclear granules appear once the PGCs form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jones and Macdonald, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mahowald, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mahowald et al., 1976</xref>). These resemble the cytoplasmic germ granules, but are bigger and appear hollow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arkov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mahowald, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mahowald et al., 1976</xref>). These nuclear granules are populated by Oskar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jones and Macdonald, 2007</xref>) suggesting that they are germ plasm derived. The function or properties of these granules and their relation to the cytoplasmic granules is unknown.</p><p>Here we analyze the biophysical properties of <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ granules in the embryo and find that these granules are best described as phase transitioned condensates. We find that Short Oskar, which nucleates the formation of cytoplasmic germ plasm and germ granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ephrussi and Lehmann, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lehmann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Markussen et al., 1995</xref>), also induces the formation of nuclear granules in the PGCs. Upon Short but not Long Oskar protein expression in heterologous systems such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R + and mammalian HEK293 cell lines, nuclear granules assemble independently of other germ plasm factors. Vasa is recruited to these granules by Oskar and hence we term these condensates ‘nuclear germ granules’. We show that these are phase transitioned granules that display liquid-like and hydrogel-like properties; they can fuse, dissolve, condense and exchange their protein content with the granule environment while they are also stable when purified. Multiple independent domains in Oskar, including its LC and IDR domains synergize to enhance the formation of nuclear germ granules, but surprisingly, no single domain is necessary for granule formation. However, deletion of a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in Short Oskar ablates nuclear assembly of granules in tissue culture and in the embryo. As a result, PGCs missing nuclear germ granules precociously arrest the cell cycle resulting in a reduced number of PGCs. Together our studies show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ granules share properties similar to those of other membraneless granules that form by phase transition. Our studies also reveal a new function for Oskar protein as the nucleator of phase separated granules in the germ cell nuclei. These results provide new insight into how early PGCs division may be regulated independently of the cell cycle timing mechanisms that exist in the syncytial environment of the early embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cytoplasmic germ granules display properties of phase transitioned condensates</title><p>The germ granules of the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo morphologically and compositionally resemble other RNP organelles: they are round and membraneless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arkov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mahowald, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mahowald et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Trcek et al., 2015</xref>) and composed of RNA-binding proteins and RNAs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hurd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lécuyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rangan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thomson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Voronina et al., 2011</xref>). We analyzed the biophysical properties of germ granules in vivo to probe whether they behave like liquid droplets, where components within the granule are ‘liquid-like’ and freely exchange with the environment, or phase transitioned granules, which form more stable structures that exchange less readily with their environment. We quantified the biophysical properties of the germ granules during the early nuclear cycles (NC) one to five when germ plasm is organized into cytoplasmic germ granules at the embryo’s posterior and the nuclei have not yet reached the poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ai–Aiii</xref>). To visualize granules, we used flies that expressed a GFP-tagged Oskar (Osk:GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jambor et al., 2015</xref>) and a Kusabira Orange-tagged Vasa (Vasa:KuOr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cinalli and Lehmann, 2013</xref>). Both transgenes spatially and temporally behave like their untagged counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Trcek et al., 2015</xref>) indicating that they are appropriate germ granule markers. During this stage the two transgenes co-localized within the same granule while they were largely absent from the somatic regions of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ai–Aiii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Trcek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vanzo and Ephrussi, 2002</xref>). Indeed, the concentration of Osk:GFP and Vasa:KuOr was 15 to 21 higher, respectively in granules compared to the surrounding intergranular space or the surrounding somatic cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, during NC one to five, the bulk of germ plasm activity appears concentrated within granules rather than in the intergranular space.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37949.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cytoplasmic germ granules display properties of phase transitioned condensates.</title><p>(<bold>Ai-iii</bold>) <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos stained with an antibody against Oskar (Ai) (green) and counter-stained for DNA with DAPI (white) or expressing Osk:GFP (green) and Vasa:KuOr (magenta) (ii, iii) at NC five.

We photobleached Osk:GFP granules and recorded that 43.6 ± 0.7 percent of Osk:GFP rapidly exchanged with the granule environment with a half time to complete fluorescent recovery (<italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic>) of 10.5 ± 0.9 s, while the rest of Oskar protein remained associated within the granule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, green circles, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). We recorded a similar FRAP recovery for Vasa:GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Because the intergranular space was largely devoid of Osk and Vasa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), these results suggested that the proteins that re-populated the granules arrived from neighboring granules. To address this question, we used fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) assay. We continuously bleached a small germ plasm region (region A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>) and recorded the fluctuation of Osk:GFP fluorescence within the bleached region as well as in neighboring, non-bleached regions B, C and D over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di</xref>,ii). We detected a significant depletion of fluorescence in region B in immediate proximity to region A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di</xref>,ii). This depletion of fluorescence was 20 to 30 percent greater than that observed in the distant regions C and D, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di, ii</xref>), as well as 30 percent greater than would be anticipated if the depletion of fluorescence was due to unintentional photobleaching during imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Di,ii</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—video 3</xref>). We detected a similar behavior for Vasa:GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ei,ii, Fi,ii</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">Figure 1—video 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video5">5</xref>). Importantly, the fraction of mobile Osk:GFP and Vasa:GFP recorded by FRAP (43.6% and 46.0%, respectively) was similar to that recorded by FLIP (~30%) suggesting that the same mobile fraction was captured by both assays. The redistribution of fluorescence was not due to the movement of granules among regions as these movements appeared corralled rather than directional (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">3</xref>), are infrequent and occur over a much longer time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sinsimer et al., 2013</xref>). Rather, Osk:GFP and Vasa:GFP dynamically exchanged among neighboring granules. However, despite displaying liquid-like properties, we and others have not observed fusion of cytoplasmic germ granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sinsimer et al., 2013</xref>), as had been described for P granules in <italic>C. elegans </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>).

We found that none of the four regions was required for granule formation per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–G</xref>). Consistent with the known biological function of the LOTUS domain in Vasa binding, Osk-ΔLOTUS failed to localize Vasa to nuclei and instead Vasa took on a diffuse and non-granular distribution in S2R+ cells that resembled its distribution in the absence of Oskar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jeske et al., 2017</xref>). Osk-ΔL1 protein did not localize to the nucleus, but instead accumulated in cytoplasmic granules and Osk-ΔL2 granules were found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Surprisingly, deletion of L2 prevented accumulation and co-localization of Vasa:GFP with Osk-ΔL2 protein specifically in the nucleus, while it remained co-localized, albeit faintly, with Osk-ΔL2 in cytoplasmic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The size of nuclear granules formed by Osk-ΔLOTUS, Osk-ΔL1 and Osk-ΔL2 mutants was similar to those formed by full length Short Osk, while deletion of the SGNH domain lead to the formation of much larger nuclear granules, which lacked the appearance of a hollow core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Together our results suggest that the ability of Short Osk to homo-dimerize, interact with Vasa, Valois and LASP or bind RNA is dispensable for nuclear granule formation, nor were the LC sequence or the IDR necessary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, the four Oskar regions tested must act redundantly. In support, each domain appeared to affect the efficiency of granule formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).

During embryogenesis, we observed nuclear germ granules as soon as syncytial nuclei reached the germ plasm. As PGCs formed, nuclear germ granules continued to increase in size and number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F,G</xref>) such that within 22 min, the majority of PGCs contained nuclear germ granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Given their localization, we reasoned that nuclear germ granules likely play a role during or upon PGC formation but would not affect earlier stages of germ plasm assembly or function (see also below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cinalli and Lehmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pae et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Su et al., 1998</xref>). Nuclear germ granules could facilitate PGC formation, PGC division or subsequent aspects of PGC development such as PGC survival, migration and maturation of PGCs into germline stem cells and gametes. We therefore counted the number of PGCs in fixed embryos laid by <italic>OskΔNLS</italic> mothers (‘<italic>OskΔNLS</italic> embryos’) and control <italic>OskΔNLS/+</italic> mothers (‘<italic>OskΔNLS/+</italic> embryos’) at NC 14 when PGC divisions have ceased(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Su et al., 1998</xref>). We found that <italic>OskΔNLS/+</italic> embryos had an average of 36.9 ± 1.1 (n = 41) PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,G</xref>) while <italic>OskΔNLS</italic> embryos only had 22.4 ± 1.2 (n = 42) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>), a statistically significant 39.3% decrease (p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). This reduction was not due to fewer nuclei migrating into the posterior pole as the number of PGC buds between the two genotypes was the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Rather, this result indicated that the reduction in PGC number occurred at a later step and was likely due to the reduced capability of <italic>OskΔNLS</italic> PGCs to cellularize, to divide or to be maintained.</p><p>To differentiate among these possibilities, we imaged PGC divisions in live embryos using light sheet microscopy. For precise developmental staging and analysis of mitosis, we introduced an RFP-tagged histone transgene (His2Av:mRFP), which marks the chromatin, and a Vasa:GFP transgene, which marks the germ plasm, into the <italic>OskΔNLS</italic> mutant background. As anticipated from our observations in S2R+ cells, Vasa:GFP accumulated in nuclear germ granules in embryos from <italic>OskΔNLS/+</italic> control females but did not enter the nucleus in embryos from <italic>OskΔNLS</italic> mutant females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). We then collected embryos that had not yet formed PGC buds and acquired images of their posterior pole in three dimensions (3D) every two minutes in the RFP and GFP channels until NC 14, which can be clearly timed by the cellularization of the somatic nuclei. We counted the number of Vasa:GFP-associated nuclei in 3D at every time point for both genotypes where the appearance of the first pole bud represented time 0 min until NC 14 when in wild-type embryos the PGCs stop dividing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Su et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Our experiment revealed that in <italic>OskΔNLS/+</italic> embryos PGCs divided synchronously relative to each other in the same embryo with some variation of cycle length between embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, red line shifted relative to the green one, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>). In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Su et al., 1998</xref>), with each division, fewer and fewer PGCs divided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>) indicating that as the embryo matured PGC divisions became less likely. In <italic>OskΔNLS</italic> embryos, however, synchronous divisions were not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2">Figure 7—video 2</xref>). There were also fewer PGC divisions overall with a marked increase in the time between successive divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). As a result, by NC 14 there were 32.6 percent fewer PGCs in <italic>OskΔNLS</italic> embryos than in <italic>OskΔNLS/+</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I,J</xref>), in agreement with the results obtained with fixed samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–G</xref>). After each division, PGCs of either genotype were retained at the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2">2</xref>) indicating that newly divided PGCs did not die, were properly cellularized (i.e. formed) and maintained at the posterior pole. Thus, the reduction of PGCs in <italic>OskΔNLS</italic> embryos was due to the inability of mutant PGCs to divide properly.</p><p>Lastly, we asked whether the failure of mutant PGCs to divide was specifically due to the absence of nuclear Oskar or whether other aspects of Oskar’s known functions were affected by the NLS mutation. Titration of Oskar protein affects the accumulation of germ plasm and of germ plasm-enriched mRNAs and, ultimately, the formation and specification of PGCs as well as the patterning of the embryonic anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lehmann, 2016</xref>). Thus, the NLS mutation could have rendered Osk protein unstable or unable to accumulate adequately, which could have reduced the number of pole cells or affected embryonic development. However, we detected similar amounts of Oskar protein in embryos of both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>) as well as of germ plasm-enriched Vasa protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>). Furthermore, we observed no difference in the mRNA localization pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M,N</xref>; note the characteristic ‘RNA islands’ around the dividing PGC nuclei) or in the levels of localized mRNAs such as <italic>CycB</italic> and <italic>nos</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7O</xref>), respectively. In support, embryos laid by <italic>OskΔNLS</italic> mothers hatched like their heterozygous siblings suggesting that the amount of germ plasm-enriched <italic>nos</italic> mRNAs were similar between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gavis and Lehmann, 1994</xref>). Importantly, PGCs in <italic>OskΔNLS</italic> embryos remained transcriptionally repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>) indicating that mutant PGCs retained their germ line-specific nuclear character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanyu-Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Martinho et al., 2004</xref>).

Therefore, the phenotype observed in <italic>OskΔNLS</italic> embryos is unlikely due to changes in the amount of germ plasm proteins or reduced enrichment of <italic>gcl</italic> mRNA but rather caused by defects in a previously unknown function of nuclear Oskar in the control of PGC nuclear divisions. Interestingly, the expression of Short Osk in S2R + cell did not affect their ability to divide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1K–M</xref>) indicating that this regulatory function of nuclear germ granules is restricted to PGCs (see Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>First observed by EM over 50 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mahowald, 1962</xref>), we still know little about the biophysical and organizational properties of germ granules in any organism. Here we have used imaging methods and reconstitution experiments to analyze two types of embryonic germ granules in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: cytoplasmic germ granules and nuclear granules. While the function of cytoplasmic granules in germ cell formation and specification is well established, our study reveals a role for nuclear granules in the regulation of early PGC division. Quantitative fluorescent microscopy demonstrates that both granule types have biophysical properties of liquid condensates, where components rapidly diffuse between granules, as well as properties consistent with a hydrogel-like state, where proteins are stably associated within granules and do not exchange freely with their environment. Consistent with previous studies, our data show that short Oskar protein coordinates the assembly of both granule types but nuclear and cytoplasmic granules differ in their protein and RNA composition. Finally, we find that multiple domains contribute, apparently redundantly, to Oskar’s ability to assemble germ granules and that an NLS within the Oskar protein coordinates granule assembly in the nucleus. Surprisingly, expression of Oskar in tissue culture cells reconstitutes aspects of nuclear granule assembly, thereby providing a system to study germ granules in a heterologous, non-germ line cellular system.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Nuclear Oskar controls PGC division</title><p>Our studies identify a new function for Oskar, as a coordinator of PGC’s cell division in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. This function requires nuclear localization of the short isoform of Oskar. Nuclear germ granules are typically bigger, often appear hollow and fail to accumulate core germ granule constituents such as Aubergine and Tudor proteins and <italic>nos</italic>, <italic>pgc</italic> and <italic>gcl</italic> mRNAs consistent with these granules regulating different aspects of PGC development. PGC form four nuclear divisions prior to the cellularization of the somatic cells and thus become separated from the highly synchronized cell cycle control of the syncytial embryo. It is therefore attractive to hypothesize a role for nuclear granules in sequestering factors required for the coordinated division of early PGCs independently of the synchronous divisions of somatic nuclei. One model is that nuclear germ granules would increase the PGC number by sequestering negative regulators that would otherwise precociously inhibit PGC division. Such a role would not be unprecedented. In response to viral infections, cells form stress granules that sequester translational regulators to counteract the increased translational demands of a virus thereby suppressing its multiplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reineke and Lloyd, 2013</xref>). This regulator would be specific to germ cells and may explain why PGCs arrest at NC 14, while somatic cells continue to divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Su et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, in support of a germ cell-specific regulator of cell division, cell divisions of somatic nuclei were unaffected by the NLS mutation and Short Oskar nuclear germ granules did not affect the division of S2R+ cells devoid of core germ plasm constituents.</p><p>Alternatively, nuclear germ granules could enrich proteins that promote cell division thereby increasing their nuclear concentration and augment the likelihood of cells do divide. Indeed, several core components of the cell cycle machinery that promote DNA replication (Mcm3, Mcm5, and Dpa (Mcm4); <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Su et al., 1996</xref>]) and progression through anaphase during mitosis (Apc7 and Cdc16; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harper et al., 2002</xref>]) were enriched in the Short Oskar IP suggesting their sequestration in germ granules. Interestingly, <italic>mcm5</italic> and <italic>mcm3</italic> mRNAs are also posteriorly localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lécuyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vourekas et al., 2016</xref>) indicating that increased concentration of their gene products is important for germ line development. Indeed, cellularized PGCs divide slower than the somatic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Su et al., 1998</xref>), indicating that they are becoming limiting in factors that promote rapid cell division. In this model, PGCs in mutant embryos would ‘run out’ of limiting factors faster than their WT counterparts and stop dividing earlier. This model also explains why Short Oskar nuclear germ granules did not affect cycling of S2R+ cells as these are likely already dividing at a maximal rate. In this model, nuclear germ granules would only serve to accumulate and store the effector molecules that would promote division of PGCs, a function that is similar to cytoplasmic germ granules, which enrich and store mRNAs that code for effector proteins to promote the germ cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lehmann, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, it is also possible that diffuse nucleoplasmic Oskar itself directly regulates PGC division as a cell cycle regulator. In this scenario, the granules would act as a source of Oskar protein in the nucleus. Future work is needed to clarify the role of nuclear Oskar and nuclear germ granules in PGCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Germ granules with similar organizational properties but distinct biological functions</title><p>Oskar nucleates both, cytoplasmic and nuclear germ granules and it is possible that Oskar and possibly Vasa proteins shuttle from the cytoplasm to the nucleus as PGCs form. FRAP, FLIP, photoconversion and experiments with aliphatic alcohols revealed that these two types of granules may use the same biophysical principles to achieve their distinct functions. For instance, their liquid properties could enhance biochemical reactions occurring within granules or provide a constant supply of diffusible protein to perform functions outside of granules. Conversely, the more stable conformation could ensure that their regulatory properties persisted throughout early embryonic development. Indeed, cytoplasmic germ granules begin forming and become functional in a transplantation assay during late oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Illmensee et al., 1976</xref>) and are maintained through early embryogenesis, a process that can last from 5 hr to many hours when fertilization is delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Spradling, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Su et al., 1998</xref>). As a result, the enrichment of localized transcripts also persists, ensuring adequate levels of effector molecules to instruct germ cell fate. This could be achieved in part by making more stable, hydrogel-like organelles.</p><p>We found that multiple independent Short Oskar domains synergize to promote granule condensation, likely engaging both specific and non-specific protein interactions to de-mix, as proposed for other condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Protter et al., 2018</xref>). However, this ability is lost in Long Oskar in cell lines and in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Markussen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vanzo and Ephrussi, 2002</xref>), which contains an additional 138 aa long N-terminus with a short LC domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This N-terminal extension is predicted to fold into three helices (data not shown), which could solubilize the protein and prevent its phase separation. Alternatively, the N-terminus could dictate a particular fold of Short Oskar in which the motifs promoting phase transition could become inaccessible. Interestingly, despite being coded by the same localized mRNA, the two isoforms are spatially segregated. Long Oskar is enriched cortically at the embryo’s posterior and interacts with the actin network which is thought to stabilize germ granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>), while Short Osk is concentrated within germ granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rongo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vanzo and Ephrussi, 2002</xref>). Maintenance of germ granules is crucial for fertility and embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arkov et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, physical separation of Oskar isoforms is likely biologically relevant, perhaps to prevent granule dissolution by Long Osk should the two isoforms mix.</p><p>Despite years of research, it is largely unclear how the distinct functions of Oskar protein are accomplished with such high spatial and temporal precision. Our ability to understand the mechanisms by which Oskar realizes these roles has been limited, because the majority of <italic>osk</italic> mutations prevent germ plasm assembly already during oogenesis and as a result preclude PGC formation and phase separation of nuclear germ granules. Several features of cytoplasmic and nuclear germ granules are recapitulated in nuclear germ granules formed in S2R+ cells including their cellular localization, morphology, composition and their biophysical properties. Thus, reconstitution of germ granules in S2R+ cells now provides an experimentally controllable system to study the distinct properties and functions of Oskar and its granules.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Miscellaneous phase separated condensates - distinct or the same?</title><p>Germ granules are characteristic to germ cells of all species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eddy, 1975</xref>) and many components, such as Vasa, Tud, Aub and granule mRNAs are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Voronina et al., 2011</xref>), including in P granules of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Despite morphologically, compositionally and functionally resembling P granules, our biophysical studies suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ granules behave more like aged yeast and mammalian stress granules by displaying both liquid-like and hydrogel-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>).

How these structural differences between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ granules are realized in their function is unknown. Recent work on mammalian and yeast stress granules revealed that RNAs, the mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) and RuvB-like (RVB) DNA helicase complexes stabilize these granules and promote their maturation from liquid droplets into hydrogels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Some of these proteins including Mcm5, Mcm3, Dpa (MCM helicases) and pontin (RuvB-like helicase 1) associate with Short Osk by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hurd et al., 2016</xref>) suggesting that they populate <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ granules, which could promote hydrogel-like conformation and provide rigidity to <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ granules.</p><p>RNA too can alter the biophysical properties of liquid droplets, decrease the viscosity of granules, their ability to exchange granule proteins with the environment and their propensity to fuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, we and others have noted that the cytoplasmic germ granules that are enriched with mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Little et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Trcek et al., 2015</xref>) do not fuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sinsimer et al., 2013</xref>). We also could not observe fusion of nuclear germ granules in PGCs while fusion of nuclear germ granule in S2R+ cells was infrequent and slower than the fusion of P granules in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that form by LLPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>).

For example, only 16% of CAR-1 in P granules of <italic>C.elegans</italic> can exchange whereas other components appear to exchange more rapidly and readily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, Dcp2 in P bodies of U2OS cells does not exchange while Dcp1a and b exchange to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizer et al., 2008</xref>). It has been proposed that as granules age the polymerization of proteins in liquid-like droplets becomes enhanced and leads to an increased gelation within granules while the rest of the granule proteins retain liquid-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, protein and RNA composition can influence polymerization behavior and may account for the varied biophysical properties even when the same component is analyzed.</p><p>Intriguing also is the spherical morphology and spatial organization of Oskar nuclear germ granules. By immunofluorescence and EM the larger granules have the appearance of a lighter, electron less dense core surrounded by a brighter, electron denser shell. We do not know whether this structure reflects any specific physical and functional properties. In the simplest scenario, Oskar could organize itself into a shell surrounding other protein or RNA components and therefore ‘wet’ the inner granule core. The core could itself be a phase separated condensate with miscible characteristics that would prevent mixing of the two protein phases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feric et al., 2016</xref>).

However, when the concentration of the RNA exceeds the concentration of the peptide, the RNA in the droplet de-mixes in the center of the granule and the protein droplets adopt a hollow appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Milin and Deniz, 2018</xref>).

Intriguingly, the hollow appearance of nuclear granules was lost when Osk’s RNA binding domain was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,I</xref>). We do not know whether and if so which RNAs may occupy nuclear germ granules in PGCs as they are devoid of the known germ plasm enriched mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

The surface 1–2 sections were cut at 100 nm containing marker grid pattern and afterwards recognized under transmission electron microscope (Philips CM-12, Thermo Fisher, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), and serial sections were captured with a Gatan (4k × 2.7 k) digital camera (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantification of granule protein enrichment</title><p>Two different measures were used to quantify the fold enrichment of proteins within granules relative to granule surroundings; by concentration fold enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>) and by quantifying the percent of non-granular nucleoplasmic protein in PGC and S2R + cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To quantify the concentration fold enrichment of Osk:GFP in cytoplasmic germ granules, embryos expressing the Osk:GFP transgene were first imaged in 3D with a laser scanning confocal microscope. Afterwards, 23 granules were segmented in ImageJ and total fluorescence intensity normalized by the granule area. Only the equatorial plane (where the granule is most in focus) was analyzed. The same analysis was then preformed using ROIs within the intergranular space and the somatic cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Means were compared to determine the fold difference in the fluorescent intensity of Osk:GFP located in the granules versus the intergranular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The same approach was employed to quantify the fold enrichment of granular Osk and Vasa in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. To quantify the total amount of non-granular nucleoplasmic protein in PGCs and S2R+ cells, fixed embryos and S2R+ cells were imaged as described above. Afterwards, individual PGC or S2R + cell nuclei were segmented using the DAPI stain and total Oskar or Vasa nuclear fluorescence intensity determined using the 3D object counter plugin in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>). Using the same plugin, individual nuclear granules were segmented and their total fluorescence intensity determined. After subtraction, the percent of non-granular nucleoplasmic Oskar or Vasa protein was determined (% nucleoplasmic content).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantification of granule sizes and protein abundance</title><p>Using ImageJ, lines were drawn through several granules imaged in their equatorial plane and their linear fluorescent profiles extracted using a Plot Profile plugin. Pixels in these profiles where the fluorescence intensity started to increase relative to background represented the edges of the granule (i.e. size in nm), while the summed fluorescence intensity contained within these pixels represented the total fluorescence intensity (i.e. protein abundance) of an individual granule.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)</title><p>Live embryos and S2R+ cells expressing Osk:GFP, Vasa:GFP and Short mCherry:Osk transgenes were prepared as described above. To FRAP Osk:GFP or Vasa:GFP in the germ plasm, an ROI (x = y three µm) located in the middle of germ plasm was bleached using a single strong pulse of 488 laser illumination and afterwards an image of the germ plasm acquired every second to record fluorescence recovery. Initial five images were acquired to establish the levels of pre-bleach fluorescence. To FRAP Osk:GFP or Vasa:GFP in nuclear germ granules in PGCs, a single nuclear granule was bleached per embryo and imaging carried out as described above. To FRAP Short Osk:mCherry in nuclear germ granules in S2R+ cells, a single nuclear granule was bleached per cell. In this case, a single strong pulse of 561 laser illumination was used for bleaching. Imaging was performed using 561 laser illumination as described above.</p><p>Fluorescence fluctuations in the bleached ROIs were extracted in ImageJ. Afterwards, using easyFRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rapsomaniki et al., 2012</xref>), a full-scale normalization procedure was used to normalize recovery curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rapsomaniki et al., 2012</xref>). We used the full scale normalization because it corrects for differences in bleaching depth among different experiments. As such, all normalized recovery curves started from 0 value and could be easily compared with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rapsomaniki et al., 2012</xref>). Normalized curves were then averaged and fit to a single term exponential equation (<italic>f(t)=a*(1-exp(-b*t))</italic>) in Sigmaplot, where <italic>a</italic> represented the percent mobile fraction and <italic>b</italic> represented the rate constant of fluorescence recovery.

The fluorescence recovery was recorded, recovery curves normalized and analyzed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching (FLIP)</title><p>Live NC 1–5 embryos expressing transgenic Osk:GFP or Vasa:GFP were prepared as described above. To record FLIP, a single ROI (x = y three µm, region A) located in the middle of the germ plasm was continuously bleached using a single strong pulse of 488 laser illumination while concurrently acquiring an image of germ plasm every second for the duration of four minutes. Initial five images were acquired to establish the pre-bleach fluorescence levels. Fluorescence loss in the bleached region A as well as in the neighboring regions B, C, D (x = y three µm) was extracted in ImageJ. These values were then normalized to the initial value (time 0 s) and expressed as a percent (% fluorescence remaining). To determine the rates of fluorescence loss due to unintended photobleaching, an ROI (x = y three µm) located outside of the embryo was continuously bleached and % fluorescence remaining for regions A, B, C and D located in the germ plasm determined as described above. No additional normalization steps as described for FRAP experiments were performed. For both transgenes, unintentional bleaching reduced the level of fluorescence by five to 24% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Di,Fi</xref>), intentional bleaching within region A by 95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ei</xref>), and redistribution of Oskar and Vasa from ROI B into neighboring ROIs by 45% to 59%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ei</xref>). Thus, compared to unintentional bleaching, redistribution of granule protein into neighboring ROIs accounted for redistribution of minimally 20% to 30% of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantifying granule numbers and phenotypes in S2R+ cells</title><p>Cells expressing Short mCherry:Osk or its truncations were fixed 24, 48 and 72 hr after transfection.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript focuses on understanding the formation and function of germ granules in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, with a focus on the previously mysterious nuclear granules that are driven by Oskar protein. The authors use both embryos and an S2 cell-line to assess the properties of cytoplasmic and nuclear granules using standard assays such as sphericity, and recovery or loss from photobleaching to support that the granules behave as phase-separated condensates. Unlike the P granules of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the germline granules of <italic>Drosophila</italic> appear to have at least two states – one that is more liquid-like and dynamic and one that is more gel-like and non-exchanging. A striking &quot;hollow&quot; structure is repeatedly seen even by TEM indicating some degree of structural organization akin to other systems (i.e. stress granules) and the shell may represent one of the distinct material states detected. The establishment of an S2 cell line-based assay is important for structure/function (with regard to granule formation) studies because mutants are defective in forming germline so it is difficult to assess mutant phenotypes and this should prove to be a useful system for future analysis of germline components. Using this assay, they characterize a variety of domains need redundantly for phase separation and identify and show that an NLS in Oskar is critical for the nuclear condensates and they go on and demonstrate this in animals using gene-edited mutants.</p><p>The most interesting result is the description of a possible function of the nuclear granules in regulating the division cycles of the germ cells. The authors show that the nuclear granules have distinct components and that they have different sizes from cytoplasmic granules but most interestingly, when the nuclear granules are eliminated with the NLS mutant, the division cycles of the GC become asynchronous, fewer cells divide and divisions take longer. This indicates that there is some function for the nuclear granules (and controls were done to support that this is not due to trivial impacts on protein stability or other known Oskar targets being misregulated) in coordinating cell cycle progression in this specific subpopulation of cells.</p><p>However, before publication, we would like you to address the following issues.</p><p>1) You mainly studied protein dynamics, and while the findings are suggestive of the claims regarding phase separated liquid-like and/or hydrogel-like character of germ granules, more evidence is required to justify the claims.</p><p>A) As further support for liquid-like character, it would be good if fusion of germ granules should be documented in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (in addition to that demonstrated in cell culture lines).</p><p>B) Throughout the study, FRAP experiments have been conducted by photobleaching full germ granules. Additional FRAP experiments where only part of a germ granule has been photobleached should be done (possibly with large &quot;Fused&quot; germ granules, Figure 3). This will help test if the extent of immobile fraction is comparable in these two types of FRAP experiments (which probe rates of material exchange with the surroundings and that of internal rearrangements).</p><p>2) In line with this, you suggest that Oskar germ granules are more stable than other granules (subsection “Nuclear germ granules in S2R+ cells are phase transitioned condensates”, second paragraph). However, in Figure 4H, you report the FRAP <italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic> and immobile fractions for a few P granule, p body, and stress granule components, some of which have similar or slower exchange rates and larger immobile fractions compared to Oskar. In fact 1 mammalian p body protein has 0% mobility and a large recovery <italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic>. From the granule components currently noted in Figure 4H, it would actually suggest that many granules have a range of stable to dynamic components. You should also include other germ granules such as Buckyball which has been shown to have a slow and small mobile fraction (Boke, et al., 2016).(*side note, it is not clear how a protein with 0% mobility can have a meaningful <italic>t<sub>1/2</sub>,</italic> and this distorts the y axis of Figure 4H in a way that makes it look like granule components all have the same dynamics. It might be helpful to separate this data point from the others). (*they also cite Courchaine et al., 2016 for P granule FRAP; however it does not seem that these data were included in this paper).</p><p>3) With respect to your claim that the assembly of nuclear germ granules depends mainly on short-Oskar. But, germ granule-like punctate structures can be observed in the nucleus in absence of Oskar nuclear localization signal (see Figure 7B). You attribute this observation to &quot;non-specific signal&quot;. It should be tested if some nuclear germ granules containing Vasa assemble in PGCs in absence of Oskar nuclear localization signal. It is worth noting that Vasa can form some nuclear puncta lacking Oskar (see Figure 3I). Some statistics describing the composition of nuclear germ granules in embryos and cell lines: Oskar (+) Vasa (+), Oskar (+) Vasa (-), or Oskar (-) Vasa (+) would be helpful.</p><p>One more point that was brought up was that we would be eager to see if cell cycle regulators are being sequestered in the nuclear granules as speculated and to us seeing this would make for a more impactful paper as it would point to a molecular function for condensates.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37949.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) You mainly studied protein dynamics, and while the findings are suggestive of the claims regarding phase separated liquid-like and/or hydrogel-like character of germ granules, more evidence is required to justify the claims.</p><p>A) As further support for liquid-like character, it would be good if fusion of germ granules should be documented in Drosophila embryos (in addition to that demonstrated in cell culture lines).</p></disp-quote><p>Using live imaging and laser scanning confocal microscopy we could not detect fusion of cytoplasmic germ granules or nuclear germ granules in the embryo (subsection “Cytoplasmic germ granules display properties of phase transitioned condensates”, last paragraph; subsection “Core germ granule proteins Oskar and Vasa form phase transitioned nuclear germ granules in primordial germ cells”, second paragraph). We did observe infrequent fusion of nuclear germ granule in S2R+ cells (Video 9; subsection “Nuclear germ granules in S2R+ cells are phase transitioned condensates”, first paragraph). Further, when fusion occurred it was slower than the fusion of characterized liquid-droplets such as P granules in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Figure 4D, Video 8; see the aforementioned paragraph). We interpret this result as a behavior characteristic of phase transitioned droplets(Kato et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015) and in supports of our conclusion that cytoplasmic and nuclear germ granules in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are best be described as ‘phase transitioned condensates’. However, even when droplets phase transition, a fraction of the condensed protein can retain liquid-like properties and this population can be captured by FRAP. This has been shown for aged stress granules in mammalian cell lines (Lin et al., 2015; Niewidok et al., 2018; Wheeler et al., 2016), Whi3 granules in <italic>Ashbya gossypii</italic> (Zhang et al., 2015) and for hnRNPA2 granules (Xiang et al., 2015). To our knowledge, fusion of these specific granules has not been demonstrated in vivo despite the fact that they display (some) liquid-like properties. Thus, while informative, granule fusion is not the only or the ultimate indicator that granules behave like liquid droplets and exchange content with the environment. We used a number of different methods, FRAP, FLIP and photoconversion experiments to illustrate this point. These different types of measurements conclusively revealed a population (~30-40% ) of granular Oskar or Vasa with liquid properties (subsection “Miscellaneous phase separated condensates - distinct or the same?”, second paragraph). In the current version of the manuscript we complement these experiments by bleaching half of nuclear Oskar granules in S2R+ cells. These experiments revealed that Oskar protein can rearrange within the granule (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B; subsection “Nuclear germ granules in S2R+ cells are phase transitioned condensates”, second paragraph; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 legend; subsection “Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)”, second paragraph) further supporting our initial hypothesis that <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ granules display a liquid-like character.</p><p>Indeed, our findings are not unique, many granules that have been referred in the literature as ‘phase separated granules’ that form by LLPS display properties that appear liquid-like (mobile fraction recorded by FRAP) as well as hydrogel-like (immobile fraction recorded by FRAP) – see our new table that summarizes FRAP recordings for various proteins that populate such condensates (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). As demonstrated in this table, granules differ in the percent of each of these fractions in the granule, and there are clear differences in the mobility of different proteins within the same type of granule. Recently, the McKnight group proposed that over time polymerization in liquid droplets increases, which leads to an increase of the hydrogel-like fraction while the rest of the granule protein retains more liquid-like properties(Xiang et al., 2015). In in vitro systems granule transitions can be observed over time, and reveal a decreased propensity of granules to fuse with age (Kato et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2016; Xiang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015). We likely observe a similar behavior for Oskar granules; the liquid-like fraction is smaller than the hydrogel-like fraction and consequently, fusion of cytoplasmic or nuclear Oskar granules is rare. We have further discussed these issues in the revised Discussion section (subsection “Miscellaneous phase separated condensates - distinct or the same?”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Throughout the study, FRAP experiments have been conducted by photobleaching full germ granules. Additional FRAP experiments where only part of a germ granule has been photobleached should be done (possibly with large &quot;Fused&quot; germ granules, Figure 3). This will help test if the extent of immobile fraction is comparable in these two types of FRAP experiments (which probe rates of material exchange with the surroundings and that of internal rearrangements).</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed these experiments and describe them in our revised manuscript (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B; subsection “Nuclear germ granules in S2R+ cells are phase transitioned condensates”, second paragraph; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 legend; subsection “Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)”, second paragraph). We focused on the fluorescence recovery of a partially bleached nuclear germ granule formed by mCherry:Osk in S2R+ cells as suggested by the reviewers. We recorded 28.6% higher mobile fraction than recorded when the entire granule was bleached (Figure 1C vs. Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). Thus, Oskar protein rearranges within the granule as well as with the granule environment, a result that further supports our observations that Oskar granules display liquid-like character. The kinetics of recovery (<italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic>), which reports the average rate of protein exchange, is slower after partial bleaching (86.6 s vs. 10.2s) suggesting that this recovery is likely comprised of two rates, the rate of internal rearrangement which is likely a slow process and the rate of exchange of the protein with the granule environment which is fast (Figure 4E, F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In line with this, you suggest that Oskar germ granules are more stable than other granules (subsection “Nuclear germ granules in S2R+ cells are phase transitioned condensates”, second paragraph). However, in Figure 4H, you report the FRAP t<sub>1/2</sub> and immobile fractions for a few P granule, p body, and stress granule components, some of which have similar or slower exchange rates and larger immobile fractions compared to Oskar. In fact 1 mammalian p body protein has 0% mobility and a large recovery t<sub>1/2</sub>. From the granule components currently noted in Figure 4H, it would actually suggest that many granules have a range of stable to dynamic components. You should also include other germ granules such as Buckyball which has been shown to have a slow and small mobile fraction (Boke, et al., 2016).(*side note, it is not clear how a protein with 0% mobility can have a meaningful t<sub>1/2</sub>, and this distorts the y axis of Figure 4H in a way that makes it look like granule components all have the same dynamics. It might be helpful to separate this data point from the others). (*they also cite Courchaine et al., 2016 for P granule FRAP; however it does not seem that these data were included in this paper).</p></disp-quote><p>To more clearly present the data, we have removed the panel H from Figure 4 and instead summarized the data in a table format now found in the supplement (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). First, we added the information about the exchange rates of Buck and Xvelo (Boke et al., 2016), as suggested by the reviewers. Where FRAP recordings were mentioned in the manuscript, we cite only the primary literature and not the reviews that referred to these recordings, as suggested by the reviewers (subsection “Nuclear germ granules in S2R+ cells are phase transitioned condensates”, second paragraph, Figure 4—figure supplement 1C legend).</p><p>Further, the table also includes FRAP recordings obtained for Vasa populating cytoplasmic and nuclear germ granules in the embryo (see also Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, Figure 2—figure supplement 1E).</p><p>Finally, in the original manuscript we stated that “given its large immobile fraction (~ 60%) Oskar cytoplasmic and nuclear germ granules in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in S2R+ cells “are considerably more stable than other phase separated granules (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C)”. We have now removed the word “considerably” from the text to avoid over-statement.</p><p>The new table illustrates our conclusions that Oskar and Vasa in <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ granules have a smaller mobile fraction than reported for other the proteins that inhabit other membraneless granules (i.e.: PGL-1, GHL-1, PIE-1, TIA-1, PABP-1, LSm6, eIF4E, Dcp1a, Dcp1b; (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C)). The reviewers are correct in pointing out that most of these granules are also populated by proteins that seem to exchange less readily than Oskar or Vasa, however such proteins seem to be less abundant granule components. We did not intend to imply that <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ granules are the most stable condensates identified but rather to demonstrate that the two core functional components, Vasa and Oskar, which build these granules, on average appear less mobile than the proteins that populate other mebraneless granules. We have further clarified these observations in the manuscript (subsection “Miscellaneous phase separated condensates - distinct or the same?”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) With respect to your claim that the assembly of nuclear germ granules depends mainly on short-Oskar. But, germ granule-like punctate structures can be observed in the nucleus in absence of Oskar nuclear localization signal (see Figure 7B). You attribute this observation to &quot;non-specific signal&quot;. It should be tested if some nuclear germ granules containing Vasa assemble in PGCs in absence of Oskar nuclear localization signal. It is worth noting that Vasa can form some nuclear puncta lacking Oskar (see Figure 3I). Some statistics describing the composition of nuclear germ granules in embryos and cell lines: Oskar (+) Vasa (+), Oskar (+) Vasa (-), or Oskar (-) Vasa (+) would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewers’ comments, we have collected embryos laid by mothers that do not express Oskar protein (<italic>ΔOsk</italic>) and immunostained them with an antibody against Oskar (Figure 7—figure supplement 1DL, subsection “Ablation of nuclear germ granules reduces cell divisions in PGCs”, first paragraph). This experiment supports our initial conclusion that the small speckles that appear in the PGCs of the <italic>OskΔNLS</italic> embryos are due to non-specific staining of the polyclonal (rabbit) Oskar antibody. Furthermore, we and others do not observe nuclear accumulation of Vasa in the absence of Oskar (Figure 3H, I; Figure 6E; Figure 5—figure supplement 1B (see <italic>oskΔLOTUS</italic> panel where the Vasa interaction domain was deleted in Oskar resulting in Vasa not to accumulate with Oskar in the nucleus). This result is also consistent with the observations from Anne Ephrussi’s group published in: (Jeske et al., 2017)); Figure 7—figure supplement 1C, E, F, subsection “Core germ granule proteins Oskar and Vasa form phase transitioned nuclear germ granules in primordial germ cells”, first paragraph; subsection “Expression of Short Oskar in cell lines reconstitutes nuclear germ granules”, fourth paragraph). Experiments from our and other labs have further shown that in the embryo, Oskar functions as the sole nucleator of granules. Oskar is not only necessary but also sufficient to initiate germ granule formation. In the absence of Oskar, Vasa does not form germ granules in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (Breitwieser et al., 1996; Ephrussi et al., 1991; Ephrussi and Lehmann, 1992; Jeske et al., 2015; Markussen et al., 1995). Consistent with these results is our observation that known <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ granule proteins did not form nuclear granules in the absence of Osk in S2R+ cells (Figure 3J, Figure 3—figure supplement 1G).</p><p>Finally, as reviewers suggested, we have statistically described the composition of nuclear germ granules in the embryo and in S2R+ cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A; Figure 3—figure supplement 1F; subsection “Core germ granule proteins Oskar and Vasa form phase transitioned nuclear germ granules in primordial germ cells”, first paragraph, subsection “Expression of Short Oskar in cell lines reconstitutes nuclear germ granules”, fourth paragraph). We have quantitatively characterized cytoplasmic germ granules previously(Trcek et al., 2015)). We find that Vasa:KuOr co-localized with Osk:GFP in 95.1% of nuclear germ granules (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), in 90.3% cytoplasmic germ granules(Trcek et al., 2015) and in 80.3% nuclear germ granules in S2R+ cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F). In the embryo, all Vasa:KuOr nuclear granules also contained Osk:GFP (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), indicating that Vasa can populate nuclear germ granules only when Oskar protein is present (Breitwieser et al., 1996; Lehmann, 2016). We did record that in S2R+ cells, 7.2% of Vasa positive granules appeared not to contain Oskar (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Given that Vasa cannot enter the nuclei or form germ granules by itself in S2R+ cells (see above) we prefer the hypothesis that those Vasa nuclear germ granules, which apparently lacked Oskar, were most likely populated by both proteins but that Oskar levels were not detected, rather than Vasa forming distinct granules devoid of Oskar protein (as discussed in the aforementioned paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One more point that was brought up was that we would be eager to see if cell cycle regulators are being sequestered in the nuclear granules as speculated and to us seeing this would make for a more impactful paper as it would point to a molecular function for condensates.</p></disp-quote><p>In our manuscript, we discuss that several known cell cycle regulators such as Mcm5, Mcm3, Dpa(Mcm4), Apc7 and Cdc16 were identified as specific interactors of Short Oskar by co-immunoprecipitation and are thus potential candidates for a function in the regulation of PGC division (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E). We agree with the reviewers that this is a very interesting and important aspect of our manuscript. Using fluorescent immunostaining we attempted to address whether these regulators co-localized with Oskar in nuclear germ granules as suggested by the reviewers. <italic>Drosophila</italic> specific antibodies were raised only against Mcm5 and DPA but had only be tested on Western blots and not in tissue(Su et al., 1997). For others, we acquired commercially available antibodies raised against mouse (Apc7, Cdc16) or human homologs (Mcm3, two variants). Unfortunately, none of the antibodies revealed a positive granule staining and these results remain inconclusive: the Mcm5 antibody never produced a nuclear stain although it is a nuclear protein at the end of G1 and S phase and Apc7, Cdc16 and Mcm3 might not be reactive against <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs. Only DPA produced a nuclear stain but did not react with nuclear germ granules. Yet, even this result seems at best inconclusive without further experimentation. For example, we know from our experience with Vasa antibodies that these do not detect Vasa in nuclear germ granules, while we can clearly detect GFP or Kusabira Orange tagged Vasa in nuclear Oskar-granules in embryos and in tissue culture cells. Thus, our Vasa antibody somehow does not recognize Vasa in the nucleus. Since the same could be true for Dpa, we feel that at this stage the results are inconclusive. We have thus decided to not present and discuss these results in the manuscript.</p><p>We believe that addressing the question of how nuclear oskar may affect PGC division requires significant further investment in building tools and reagents and thus goes beyond the scope of our manuscript. We would like to stress that our manuscript already contains a large amount of new information by demonstrating that cytoplasmic and nuclear embryonic germ granules in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are phase transitioned condensates. Indeed, when one surveys the literature, only rarely is a clear function of phase transitions granules known. Indeed, even for the biophysically very well-studied <italic>C. elegans</italic> granules is a function in the embryo unclear as they are apparently not required for germ cell specification. In the case of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, embryonic germ granules have a clear and well-defined role: cytoplasmic granules function in germ cell specification and anterior-posterior patterning and our study now adds a new role for nuclear germ granules in early PGC cell division. Deciphering the mechanism and the regulator(s) by which these granules achieve this will be the work of future investigation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
