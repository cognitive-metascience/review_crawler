Additionally, other Apicomplexans such as <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, <italic>Eimeria</italic>, <italic>Theileria</italic> and <italic>Babesia</italic> spp. infect farm animals and are responsible for considerable economic losses. No efficient vaccines or eradicating drug treatments are available against this important group of pathogens.</p><p>Invasion and egress are two key steps in the lytic cycle of Apicomplexa as they go through complex life stage development in one or multiple hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dubey et al., 1998</xref>). The sequential and regulated discharge of protein factors from two apical secretory organelles called micronemes and rhoptries is essential for parasite survival and for dissemination of the infection in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carruthers and Sibley, 1997</xref>). The content of these two types of organelles includes notably adhesins, perforins, proteases, lipases and kinases that are critical for motility, host attachment, formation of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) during invasion and for lysis of the PVM and host plasma membrane upon egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kemp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roiko and Carruthers, 2009</xref>). The microneme (MICs), rhoptry neck (RONs) and rhoptry bulb (ROPs) proteins are produced late during the parasite cell cycle and undergo extensive proteolytic maturation in an endosomal-like compartment (ELC) along their trafficking from the Golgi to their respective target organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishi et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>MICs typically exist as complexes composed of adhesive and transmembrane domain-containing proteins that are discharged onto the parasite surface at the apical tip. Some of these complexes engage with host receptors and translocate to the posterior end of the parasite, hence mediating gliding motility and invasion. The characterized complexes to date include MIC2-M2AP (MIC2-associated protein) involved in gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huynh and Carruthers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huynh et al., 2003</xref>), MIC6-MIC1-MIC4 contributing to parasite attachment and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reiss et al., 2001</xref>), and MIC3-MIC8 associated with rhoptry secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cérède et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kessler et al., 2008</xref>). The majority of the MICs undergo extensive pre- and post-exocytosis proteolytic processing. Intracellular processing occurs post-Golgi and prior to the storage in the micronemes. The MIC pro-domains have been implicated in facilitating traffic to microneme organelles. A propeptide deletion mutant of M2AP is retained in the post-Golgi region, hampering its trafficking to the micronemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harper et al., 2006</xref>). While the cleavage mutant of M2AP shows normal trafficking to micronemes, the removal of the pro-domain appears to be important for MIC2-M2AP complex formation and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harper et al., 2006</xref>). The first of the three EGF-like domains of MIC6 is cleaved off, but this event does not impact on the MIC1-MIC4-MIC6 complex formation and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reiss et al., 2001</xref>). Similarly, MIC3, MIC5 and M2AP are processed prior to reaching the micronemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brydges et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cérède et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rabenau et al., 2001</xref>). Once on the parasite surface, the transmembrane MICs, are shed by the microneme protein protease 1 (MPP1) activity that has been attributed to rhomboid protease dependent intramembrane proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rugarabamu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shen et al., 2014b</xref>). In addition, the MPP2 activity mediated by the action of subtilisin protease SUB1 (SUB1) also participates in post-exocytosis processing of the MICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lagal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saouros et al., 2012</xref>). The protease responsible for the pre-exocytosis processing of these secreted proteins has not been identified to date, although the presence of cathespin L (CPL) is required for optimal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parussini et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Following attachment and apical reorientation of the parasite towards the host cell, the rhoptries’ membranous material and proteins are directly discharged into the host cell cytosol during parasite entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carruthers and Boothroyd, 2007</xref>). A subset of proteins at the neck of the rhoptries, termed rhoptry neck proteins (RONs) form a complex (RON2-4-5-8) that is anchored into the host cell membrane and associated with the microneme protein AMA1 on the parasite surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Besteiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lebrun et al., 2005</xref>). This AMA1-RONs complex plays a central role in moving junction (MJ) formation and host cell entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargieri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lamarque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mital et al., 2005</xref>). The MJ presumably serves as a support for the propulsion of the parasite into the host cell powered by the actomyosin system and the connector GAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jacot et al., 2016</xref>). The rhoptry bulb proteins (ROPs), on the other hand, act as effectors and subvert host cellular functions by either interacting with the PVM to protect the parasites against host defense and clearance mechanisms or trafficking to the host nucleus to reprogram gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bradley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Håkansson et al., 2001</xref>). Many ROPs contain kinase and pseudokinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">El Hajj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peixoto et al., 2010</xref>) and act as key virulence factors such as ROP18, which along with ROP5 promotes parasite survival in mice by inactivating immunity-related GTPase (IRGs) by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Niedelman et al., 2012</xref>) and ROP16, which interacts with the host cell STAT signaling cascade, phosphorylating STAT3/STAT6 and suppressing TLR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saeij et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamamoto et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Most of the rhoptry proteins are synthesized with an N-terminal pro-domain subsequently cleaved in a post-Golgi compartment. The ROPs, in particular, contain a putative cleavage site with the consensus sequence SφXE (φ is hydrophobic, X is any amino acid), and presumably processed by the rhoptry subtilisin SUB2 within the immature rhoptries of nascent daughter parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2003</xref>). The cleavage site has been experimentally confirmed only for ROP1, ROP13 and SUB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley and Boothroyd, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soldati et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Turetzky et al., 2010</xref>). Though the pro-domain of ROP1 is shown to be sufficient for rhoptry targeting, the removal of the pro-domain does not appear to affect its targeting to the organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Turetzky et al., 2010</xref>) and few of the ROPs, e.g. ROP5, are not processed during their trafficking. RONs are also extensively processed along the secretory pathway, and have SφXE consensus motifs within their sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Besteiro et al., 2009</xref>), however, the proteases implicated in their maturation are not known.</p><p><italic>T. gondii</italic> encodes 7 aspartyl proteases (ASPs), with only ASP1, ASP3 and ASP5 being significantly expressed in the tachyzoite stage. Among these, ASP1 is coccidian-specific and dispensable in tissue culture as well as in the mouse model of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Polonais et al., 2011</xref>). The Golgi-associated aspartyl protease ASP5 has recently been associated to the establishment of the intravacuolar network and the trafficking of effectors to the PVM and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coffey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Curt-Varesano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammoudi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we report the functional dissection of ASP3 and demonstrate its essential nature for invasion and egress from the host cells. We exploited the power of a proteomics pipeline based on the novel terminal amine isotopic labelling of substrates (TAILS) technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kleifeld et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kleifeld et al., 2011</xref>) to compare the N-terminome of wild type and ASP3-depleted parasites. The TAILS analysis identified the repertoire of ASP3 substrates and revealed that ASP3 acts as maturase for ROPs, RONs and MICs along their trafficking route from Golgi to their respective organelles. We validated a series of known as well as novel ASP3 substrates both in vivo and in vitro toward a molecular understanding of the dramatic phenotype of ASP3 depletion in invasion and egress. Importantly, a hydroxyethylamine scaffold based compound, 49c, disrupts the <italic>T. gondii</italic> lytic cycle by inhibiting ASP3 at submicromolar concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ASP3 is a post-Golgi resident aspartyl protease essential for invasion and egress</title><p>In the phylum of Apicomplexa, aspartyl proteases cluster into 6 distinct clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Members of this class of proteases exhibit two catalytic aspartic acid residues (conserved motifs DTG or DTG/DSG), a polyproline loop and a flap predicted to close over the active site, thereby influencing substrate binding. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). ASP3 groups together with two phylogenetically related genes in the subgroup Haemosporidia, that correspond to Plasmepsin IX and X (PMIX and PMX) in the malaria parasites. To characterize ASP3, we first tagged C-terminally its endogenous locus with 3xty tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Western blot analysis (WB) of the tagged strain (ASP3ty) revealed two major forms, a band at ~70 kDa corresponding to the predicted full-length protein, and a 50 kDa processed form of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Ectopically expressed ASP3 was previously localized to a post-Golgi compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shea et al., 2007</xref>), which was confirmed in the ASP3ty strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Indirect immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) using markers for various compartments of the secretory pathway (GRASP – cis-Golgi, DrpB – post-Golgi, proM2AP – ELC) revealed that ectopically expressed ASP3 localizes in the vicinity of the ELC and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Breinich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harper et al., 2006</xref>). Since ASP3 did not co-localize perfectly with any of these markers, we conclude that the enzyme is likely to be present in more than one subcompartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27480.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ASP3 is present in the secretory pathway and is essential for invasion and egress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ty-tagged endogenous ASP3 (ASP3ty) expression and tight regulation of ASP3ty tet-inducible knockdown (ASP3ty-iKD -/+ATc) assessed by western blot.

The secretion of RONs can be monitored by assessing MJ formation by IFA on 0.1% saponin permeabilized parasites.

In this context, toxolysin 4 (TLN4) is a metalloproteinase stored in the micronemes, extensively processed prior to secretion and previously reported to participate in invasion and egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laliberté and Carruthers, 2011</xref>).

Since parasites lacking PLP1 remain trapped into host cells and still surrounded by the PMV, we also assessed the processing of PLP1 in ASP3ty-iKD +/-ATc by C-terminal tagging at the endogenous locus. The processing of PLP1 was difficult to assess by western blot, however, it does not appear to be severely compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Although depletion of ASP3 does not impact on microneme secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), the post-exocytosis processing pattern of some MICs is nonetheless altered with an accumulation of unprocessed forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In WT parasites, M2AP undergoes multiple cleavages post-exocytosis generating four fragments, MIC2 (100 kDa) is processed at the N-terminus, which removes a 5 kDa fragment and MIC4 (72 kDa) is sequentially cleaved N-terminally to generate 70 kDa and 50 kDa products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lagal et al., 2010</xref>). In ASP3 depleted parasites, M2AP secreted products, the 95 kDa secreted form of MIC2 and the 50 kDa form of MIC4 are absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–I</xref>). In contrast, the rhomboid–dependent cleavage within the transmembrane domain of MIC2 and AMA1 occurs normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Consistent with these observations, the rhomboid proteases ROM4 and ROM5 responsible for AMA1 and MIC2 cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rugarabamu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shen et al., 2014b</xref>) are known to be constitutively active, whereas SUB1 involved in the post-exocytosis processing of MIC2, MIC4 and M2AP needs to be activated by a maturation process implicating the removal of the SUB1 pro-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lagal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saouros et al., 2012</xref>). Output data from the TAILS analysis revealed abundant enrichment for SUB1 peptides, indicative of a plausible ASP3 substrate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Toxolysin-1 (TLN1) is a metalloprotease, localized both to the bulb and the neck of the rhoptries, which is known to undergo a C-terminal cleavage in addition to the removal of its pro-domain mediated by two distinct, uncharacterized maturases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hajagos et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this previous observation, ASP3 depletion prevents the pro-domain processing whereas the C-terminal cleavage remains unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Subtilisin 2 (SUB2) is a rhoptry protease previously suspected to participate in the removal of the pro-domains of the rhoptry proteins at a consensus SφXE site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2003</xref>). As observed for SUB1, we envisioned that ASP3 could be implicated in the maturation and activation of SUB2 and thus indirectly affected the cleavage of ROPs and RONs. However, endogenous tagging of SUB2 in the background of an inducible ASP3 knockdown strain (SUB2ty/ASP3-iKD) did not reveal any evident defect in the protease maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). To more firmly confirm this result, the disruption of <italic>SUB2</italic> gene was performed with the assistance of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and revealed that ROPs and RONs are still processed normally in SUB2-KO parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B–E</xref>). This excludes the presumed role of SUB2 as a maturase for the ROPs, and suggests instead that ASP3 could be directly responsible for the processing of ROPs and RONs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Novel rhoptry proteins identified as ASP3 substrates by the TAILS analysis</title><p>To further validate the TAILS analysis, we explored 8 hypothetical proteins (named TAILS1-8) from the TAILS dataset (relaxed stringency, with either &gt;2 and &lt;0.5 ratios), selected based on their expression profile, fitness score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>) and conservation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Epitope-tagging of the candidates at the endogenous locus in ASP3myc-iKD revealed that 5 out of the 8 gene products localized to the rhoptries, overlapping with ARO, a known marker of the rhoptries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D,F,H,J</xref>).

While TAILS1 (TGME49_202870) has a nuclear localization, TAILS4 (TGME49_239050) appears to be cytosolic (data not shown). Despite having a typical rhoptry expression profile TAILS2 (TGME49_225860) could not be localized. TAILS3 (TGME49_230350), referred to as a hypothetical protein, corresponds to RON11, a polytopic protein containing a calcium binding EF-hand at its C-terminus recently characterized as a dispensable rhoptry neck protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Western blot analysis of these tagged TAILS proteins in ASP3myc-iKD +/−ATc revealed defects in processing of all the rhoptry localized proteins and hence confirming them as either direct or indirect ASP3 substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,E,G,I,K</xref>).

Given the significant sequence conservation between the members of this cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), we hypothesized that 49c could target ASP3 and impact on <italic>T. gondii</italic> invasion and egress.

A deeper analysis confirmed that 49c blocks invasion, egress and rhoptry discharge without impacting on gliding motility, intracellular growth and microneme secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Moreover, 49c accurately recapitulates ASP3 depletion by inhibiting MICs, ROPs and RONs pre-exocytosis as well as some post-exocytosis processing events of MICs, without affecting their trafficking to the respective secretory organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>).

We took advantage of the inhibitory effect of 49c on ASP3 to narrow down the time of action of ASP3 during biogenesis and maturation of the secretory organelles. A minimal impact on invasion and egress was measured when the parasites were treated with 49c either in extracellular condition or less than 3 hr prior to natural egress or calcium ionophore stimulated egress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–K</xref>).

MICs are processed prior to exocytosis by uncharacterized proteases and post-exocytosis by subtilisin and rhomboid-like proteases. Even less in known about the processing of RONs and ROPs and the protease(s) implicated. Earlier studies have postulated the contribution of CPL and SUB2 towards the processing of MICs and ROPs respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parussini et al., 2010</xref>), however, in both cases, either limited or no direct evidence were supporting the claims.</p><p>We have demonstrated here that ASP3 is a resident aspartyl protease of the ELC, critical for tachyzoites invasion and egress but not implicated in parasite replication, gliding motility and host cell attachment. To explain ASP3 depletion phenotypes at the molecular level, we applied for the first time the power of TAILS analysis to generate in-depth characterization of ASP3 dependent protein N-termini in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. TAILS pipeline is based on negative selection, where native as well as proteolytically generated protein N-termini are identified and quantified. A comparative analysis between WT and ASP3-depleted parasites identified protease cleavage sites dependent on ASP3. The obtained TAILS data document many proteolytic processing events accurately but as a method also highlight secondary effects of ASP3 knockdown with considerable sensitivity. The most frequent case is detection of peptides representing degradation products that increase in +ATc conditions presumably due to accumulation of unprocessed precursors, and in some cases temporally and spatially incorrect trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prudova et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The criteria applied for the identification of ASP3-dependent processing events are +ATc/-ATc ratios of &lt;0.22 (0.5) for N-terminal peptides in conjunction with the detection of additional peptides representing immature or degraded products with ratios &gt;2. The over-representation of MICs, ROPs and RONs as ASP3 candidate substrates was compelling. Taken together, the results of the TAILS analysis to detect ASP3-dependent substrates show that interpretation of peptide ratio profiles can be relatively straightforward in some cases (e.g. MIC3, 11), but requires more in-depth analysis of the MS data in others (e.g. MIC6, TGGT1_273860 – TAILS3) (Appendix 1). Even though TAILS can never be comprehensive in terms of defining protease-specific substrates in knockdown parasites, a detailed analysis of the data was instrumental to inform about new targets for experimental testing.</p><p>The TAILS analysis confirms the previously reported cleavage site of MIC6 (VQLS|ETPA), ROP1 (SFVE|APVR) and ROP13 (SFTE|GTNE). Similarly, several peptides corresponding to cleavage sites around the putative rhoptry cleavages site, SφXE, were detected, confirming the reliability of the experimental procedure and highlighting the strength of TAILS N-terminomics. The purified ASP3 was used to firmly prove that MIC6, MIC3, ROP1 and ROP13 are ASP3 substrates based on enzymatic cleavage assay on the corresponding fluorogenic peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>). However, the data did not reveal an obvious consensus sequence motif for ASP3-specific cleavage sites. It is likely that substrate recognition and cleavage are governed by both secondary structure features and interactions between the amino acids surrounding the substrate cleavage site and the protease. It should also be noted that the many cleavage events and enriched peptides could possibly be due to secondary effects caused by altered abundance or activation of other proteases upon ASP3 depletion. The combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrates the role of ASP3 in the pre-exocytosis processing of apical organellar proteins – MICs, ROPs. While no direct evidence was obtained to demonstrate that ASP3 processes the RONs, it is likely to be the case.</p><p>In parallel, we also obtained experimental evidence for ASP3-dependent processing in the absence of TAILS supporting data. Importantly, it was possible to show that the pattern of SUB1 processing is altered in absence of ASP3, which hampers its activation and thus explains the indirect impact of ASP3 depletion on the post-exocytosis processing of MIC2, M2AP and MIC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–J</xref>).</p><p>Depletion of ASP3 causes a severe block both in invasion and egress that could be attributed to a defect in rhoptry discharge and in host plasma membrane lysis, respectively. As reported earlier, the cleavage per se is not essential for trafficking of organellar proteins to their respective organelles. In consequence, the phenotypic links between an absence of proteolytic processing of ROP/RON/MIC proteins and the observed phenotypes are not obvious. Both microneme exocytosis and rhoptry discharge occur at the apex of the parasite during invasion. While microneme secretion is driven by changes in cytoplasmic calcium concentration and by phosphatidic acid production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bullen et al., 2016</xref>) that can be triggered by various chemicals such as ethanol, the trigger for rhoptry secretion is still elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lourido and Moreno, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharma and Chitnis, 2013</xref>). At the time of invasion, the parasite’s apical tip comes in close contact with the host cell membrane leading to rhoptry discharge. The secreted rhoptry material fuses with the invaginating host cell membrane and forms the PVM. To date, only two proteins have been associated to rhoptry discharge – ARO, which is implicated in the apical positioning of the rhoptries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>) whereas the role of type I transmembrane microneme protein MIC8 is not understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kessler et al., 2008</xref>). Here we show that the rhoptries are apically positioned and MIC8 is not affected by ASP3 depletion, which leaves open the identification of the ASP3 substrate implicated in rhoptry discharge. In contrast, PLP1 is an obvious candidate to explain the defect in egress observed in ASP3 depleted parasites. PLP1 was identified in the TAILS analysis and WB performed in absence of ASP3 indicates slight alternation of the processing pattern that might result in a partial dysfunction of the perforin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roiko and Carruthers, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The TAILS dataset identified several hypothetical proteins and 5 out of the 8 candidates analyzed further, were confirmed as bona fide rhoptry proteins and ASP3 substrates. Functional characterization of these and other TAILS candidates should help identifying the factor critical for the initial step of invasion and implicated in rhoptry discharge.</p><p>Invasion and egress are key events for survival and dissemination of the Apicomplexa and an aspartic protease essential for these two steps constitutes an attractive target for drug intervention. Antimalarials primarily target apicoplast or food vacuole that are hosting metabolic pathways and ensuring parasite growth. The Plasmodium aspartic proteases in particular have been explored for specific inhibitors, with a main focus on the food vacuole Plasmepsins implicated in haemoglobin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, a considerable redundancy among the proteases involved render them sub-optimal targets.

TAILS uses primary amine labelling-based quantification as the discriminating factor, negatively selecting non-natural N-terminal peptides by using depletion with a dendritic polyglycerol aldehyde polymer (HPG-ALD). In addition, besides substrate protein identification, TAILS allows mapping of cleavage sites with amino acid precision. The TAILS procedure involves, tryptic digestion of the TMT labelled sample proteome (ASP3ty-iKD parasites +ATc/-ATc), which generates internal tryptic peptides with free amines at N termini (Pre-TAILS sample). The tryptic peptides were depleted by amine-reactive aldehyde-derivatized polymer.

The sample was reduced for 30 min at 65°C in the dark by adding 0.01 volumes of 350 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), and alkylated by addition of 0.02 volumes of 250 mM iodoacetic acid (IAA) and incubation for 30 min at room temperature. For isobaric labeling of protein N-termini we applied TMT10plex reagents (Thermo Scientific) at 0.8 ug/100 ug of denatured protein in 50% DMSO. A labeling scheme is provided in the supplementary materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Subsequent to access label quenching by (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C0<sub>3</sub> addition (100 mM final) and reagent cleanup by acetone-methanol precipitation, we digested proteins to peptides by adding trypsin at a 100:1 substrate/enzyme ratio (w/w). Following overnight digestion, peptides having a free alpha amine were removed from the sample by HPG-ALD polymer treatment in the presence of 20 mM NaBH<sub>3</sub>CN. Prior to HPG-ALD polymer pullout (po) we removed 10% of the sample for separate analysis by LC-MS (termed Pre-TAILS sample). Finally, we separated free peptides from polymer by ultra-filtration (Amicon ultra 30 kDa, Millipore) and purified TAILS and Pre-TAILS peptides by reverse phase chromatography on C18 SPEs (Waters).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>LC-MS analysis</title><p>Peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) operated in line with an EASY-nLC 1000 Liquid Chromatography system (Thermo Scientific) in data dependent analysis mode (DDA). In brief, we separated peptides by reverse phase (RP) chromatography on custom made 150 cm x 75 μm ID frit columns packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm (Dr. Maisch GmbH). The liquid phase was mixed from 0.1% FA in water (A) and 0.1% FA in ACN (B) both obtained in MS-grade from Biosolve. For separation, peptides were directly loaded onto the analytical column and resolved by applying a linear gradient from 2% to 35% B in 120 min at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min. The analytical column was heated to 50˚C by an electronic column heater for fused silica columns (PST). Eluted peptides were electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer using a 10 μm PicoTip Emitter (New Objective) in combination with a Nanospray Flex Ion Source (Thermo Scientific) operated at a spray voltage of 2.6 kV. The MS method was composed of a precursor scan (MS1) from 350 to 1250 m/z at an orbitrap resolution of 60 k (maxIT: 60 ms, AGC target: 5e5) followed by fragment ion scans (MS2) acquired post HCD activation at a collision energy of 35% in the orbitrap at a resolution of 60 k (maxIT: 118 ms, AGC target: 1e5). The first mass for all MS2 scans was set to 100 m/z and the cycle time was limited to 2 s (top speed option). Precursors were selected by quadrupole isolation using a window of 1.6 m/z around the respective target ion. Target ions and their respective isotopes were excluded from fragmentation for 20 s after the 2nd appearance within 15 s. In general, only ions of the charge state 2–5 were considered for fragment ion spectrum recording. We preformed LC-MS data analysis using proteome discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Scientific). In brief, we imported all LC-MS runs as fractions ignoring MS peaks below 3 S/N. Subsequently, we matched MS2 spectra to the <italic>Toxoplasma gondi</italic> proteome (5811 GT1) using the SEQUEST HT search engine and the following settings: Enzyme specificity: semi-ArgC, Peptide mass tolerance: 10 ppm, Fragment mass tolerance: 0.05 Da, Ion series: y- and b incl. neutral losses; Static modifications: Carbamidomethyl (C) and TMT6plex (K); Variable modifications: Oxidation (M), Acetylation or TMT6plex (peptide n-terminus), Met-loss (protein terminus). FDR was set to 1% by the target +decoy approach in conjunction with Percolator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Käll et al., 2007</xref>). Reporter ions were extracted with an integration tolerance of 20 ppm. The resulting reporter ion abundance (S/N) was normalized using the total peptide approach implemented in pd 2.1 (median normalization) and summarized on the peptide group level applying a co-isolation threshold of 30% per matched PSM. For further statistical analysis, we imported the Peptide Group report into the R software environment for statistical computing (version 3.3.2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Parsing of datasets and interpretation</title><p>Generally speaking, abundance ratios of &lt;1 were interpreted as proteolytic processing due to active ASP3 in –ATc conditions, that is, higher abundance of the correctly processed (acetylated) N-terminal peptide. Conversely, ratios &gt;1 may be either due to higher abundance of peptides representing unprocessed N-termini or accumulation of degradation products in +ATc conditions. However, for the purpose of identifying likely biologically relevant changes of +ATc/-ATc peptide ratios we calculated stringent cut-offs based on the distribution of log2 ratios in the normalized pre-TAILS dataset. Using an assumption-free empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) to determine the distribution of log2 ratios for R.XXXXR peptides, that is, all peptides generated by tryptic cleavage (pre-TAILS data) cut-off ratios at the 1% and 99% quantiles were calculated. The calculated log2 values of −0.4719 (0.72) and 0.919 (1.89), respectively, predict 1% false-positives in the dataset. However, manual surveillance of the data indicated that a more stringent lower cut-off ratio of 0.22 was more appropriate considering that ASP3 is virtually absent in +ATc conditions. Instead of the calculated upper cut-off (log2 0.9119) we applied a slightly more stringent threshold of 2-fold higher abundance of peptides in +ATc conditions as secondary criterion for interpretation of the TAILS dataset in terms of ASP3 substrate specificity. In addition, we also considered more relaxed selection criteria with +ATc/-ATc ratio cut-off above or below 2-fold change on either side, i.e. ratios of &lt;0.5 and&gt;2, respectively). The criteria for substrate selection and further pertinent analysis are described in Appendix 1.</p><p>The LC-MS-MS datasets generated in this study have been deposited on ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vizcaíno et al., 2016</xref>) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD006235.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>In vitro measurement of IC50</title><p><italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites expressing luciferase (RH-pTub-CBG99-luciferase) (200 parasites) were added in HFF coated 96-well plate harbouring 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well. Inhibitors, (49c and 49b) along with Pyrimethamine (used as a positive control in this experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Donald and Roos, 1993</xref>), were diluted in supplemented DMEM and added to the monolayers at various concentrations in triplicates along with DMSO treated control for each set. The assay was performed in a 100 μl final volume. The plates were incubated for 96 hr at 37°C, cells were washed once with PBS and lysis was performed in the wells with 100 μl lysis buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM DTT). Uninfected host cells were also lysed as negative control. 20 μl of lysate was added to 96well MicroliteTM TCT plate and incubated with 20 μL of Luciferase substrate solution (1 mM Luciferin, 3 mM ATP, 15 mM MgSO4.7H2O, 30 mM Tris HCL pH7.5) and reading was taken immediately. Growth of <italic>T. gondii</italic> was evaluated by measurement of relative luciferase unit (RLU) in the SynergyH1 multi-well plate reader (BioTek). Assays were performed in triplicates for each drug and IC50 (50% reduction in luciferase activity as compared no drug treated control) were determined by plotting luminescence against the drug concentrations from analysis of dose response curve using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>In vitro cleavage assays</title><p>Protease cleavage assays were performed using ASP3ty or with the catalytically dead asp3ty-D299A immuno-purified from parasite lysates using mouse αTy antibody, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boddey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coffey et al., 2015</xref>). Proteases bound to agarose was prepared by incubating αTy-agarose in parasite lysate, for 2 hr at 4°C, followed by extensive wash in 1% TritonX-100/PBS and stored in PBS. Either 40 ul of ASP3ty or asp3ty-D299A -agarose-bound proteins were resuspended in digestion buffer (25 mM Tris.HCl, 25 mM MES, pH 5.5; different pH ranges were tested and pH 5.5 was optimal) with 20 uM of synthetic peptide substrate (ThermoFisher scientific, &gt;98% purity) MIC6: DABCYL-G-FVQLSETPAA-G-EDANS in 100 μL of total volume. Samples were gently shaken during incubation to disperse protease-agarose. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 5 hr and processing measured using a SynergyH1 multi-well plate reader (BioTek) excited at 340 nm and reading emissions at 490 nm. Change in Relative Fluorescence Unit (ΔRFU) was measured for each time point (0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 mins) by subtracting RFU from blank (without enzyme) for each time point. Inhibition of ASP3 by compounds 49b (1 μM), 49c (100 nM) and pepstatin (10 μM) was performed in exact similar manner as mentioned above by performing ASP3 cleavage assay (ASP3ty) in presence of each compound. The results were plotted using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Cleavage assay with recombinant MIC6 was performed with approximately 1 μg of recombinant MIC6. Recombinant MIC6 was incubated with immunoprecipitated ASP3ty or asp3ty-D299A resuspended in digestion buffer (50 μL total volume) for 5 hr at 37°C with constant shaking. In some case the assay was performed in presence of inhibitors such as Pepstatin (10 μM), 49c (1 μM) or 49b (1 μM). Samples were resuspended in SDS loading buffer and analyzed by WB withα-Profilin-GST and α-Ty Ab.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Expression of recombinant MIC6</title><p>Recombinant MIC6 was expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> harbouring plasmid pET-GST-MIC6, which encodes residues 15–288 of MIC6 (containing amino acid sequence <sub>91</sub>VQLSETPA<sub>98</sub>) fused with GST in the N-terminal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Phylogenetic tree construction</title><p>Sequences of Apicomplexan aspartyl proteases were procured from EuPathDB and aligned using MUSCLE sequence alignment software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edgar, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2004b</xref>).

pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27480.045</object-id><p>As the primary selection criterion for identifying potential ASP3 substrates we considered peptide ratios of &lt;0.22 or &lt;0.5 (relaxed) representing N-termini, which are significantly less abundant in +ATc conditions, i.e. when ASP3 activity is essentially abolished. This is true for 23 (95) peptide groups representing 17 (59) proteins, 10 (29) of which have a confirmed/predicted signal peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>). Of note, and in line with the invasion and egress phenotypes, half of the predicted secreted proteins in these datasets are annotated in ToxoDB as ROP, RON or MIC proteins, some of which are known to be processed in a post-Golgi compartment.</p><p>In addition to lower abundance/disappearance of processed N-termini generated by ASP3 in +ATc conditions as a primary criterion for identifying ASP3 substrates, we also identified 42 peptide groups with +ATc/-ATc ratios &gt;2 representing 29 proteins, 21 of which have a predicted signal sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Because ASP3 is an essential, post-Golgi resident processing enzyme, we reasoned that parasite growth in +ATc conditions might lead to a general perturbation of their distal secretory system resulting in an increased occurrence of N-terminal peptides representing degradation products. More importantly, this also predicts that unprocessed direct or indirect ASP3 substrates may be subject to an increased rate of degradation eliciting increased proportions of tryptic peptides that are not represented in –ATc conditions. Indeed, by intersecting both datasets, we identified 5 (8) proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which are represented by peptides with strongly polarized +ATc/-ATc ratios. Using relaxed criteria this set comprises SUB1, MIC3, MIC11, ROP9, ROP16, and ROP40, as well as two hypothetical transmembrane proteins of unknown function and localization. While we consider this as robust support for candidate ASP3 substrates, the 17 remaining secreted proteins in the curated TAILS dataset represented only by peptides with a ratio &lt;0.5 are also considered valid candidate substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, considering that N-termini may not be detected in the LC-MS-MS analysis for purely technical reasons (cleavage generates peptides incompatible with LC-MS analysis due to peptide length, charge state or hydrophobicity), this leaves the possibility that some ASP3 substrates are represented only by peptides with a ratio &gt;2, that is, putative degradation products.</p><p>The most robust indication for directly ASP3-dependent processing events are +ATc/-ATc ratios of &lt;0.22 (0.5) for N-terminal peptides in conjunction with the detection of additional peptides representing immature or degraded products with ratios &gt;2. While this is the case for some examples such as MIC3 or MIC11, many of the 12 (39) proteins represented only by the former require additional evaluation. Experimentally validated ASP3 substrates provide an excellent framework for interpreting TAILS datasets. MIC3 is a classic case of experimentally validated posttranslational processing represented in TAILS. The MIC3 N-terminal peptide [F].AVTETHSSVQSPSKQETQLCAISSEGKPCR.[N] (57–869 has an acetyl modification at the N-terminal alanine and an +ATc/-ATc ratio of 0.074 which is 3-fold lower than the stringent cutoff of &lt;0.22. A second, non-acetylated N-terminus at S67 is also represented with a peptide ratio of 0.079. Prima facie the former would be considered the more likely mature N-terminus of the processed ASP3 substrate. However, if normalized abundances are taken into account it becomes clear that the latter is represented with a &gt;100 fold higher abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>, Line 35, Columns AO-AR). Although a minor proportion of MIC3 is processed at position S69 there is no indication in the TAILS dataset that this is due to technical reasons and therefore likely represents a natural variability. Taken together, both qualitative and quantitative parameters of the TAILS data are in complete agreement with the predicted cleavage site at [SSVQ | SPSK] and in support of MIC3 being an ASP3 substrate. MIC11 provides another, albeit non-validated example presenting a very similar profile in TAILS. A highly abundant N-terminal peptide [T].EDDKSAASIVR.[G] (58-68) with a ratio of 0.045 robustly predicts an ASP3-dependent cleavage site in this 204 aa protein at [VETT | EDDK]. Here too, detection of an N-terminal peptide shifted by two amino acids (56-68) with a ~15 fold lower abundance likely represents a minor alternative cleavage site. In addition, four peptides with ratios &gt;2 were detected, one of which is highly abundant in +ATc conditions and likely represents an immature N-terminus after cleavage of the signal peptide.</p><p>Some ASP3 substrates may be revealed in the TAILS dataset only by peptides with ratios &lt;0.22 (0.5). This is the case for MIC6 whose predicted ASP3 cleavage site [VQLS | ETPA] is represented by the abundant peptide [S].ETPAACSSNPCGPEAAGTCKETNSGYICR.[C] with an +ATc/-ATc ratio of 0.089 in the TAILS dataset. No peptides with ratios &gt;2 have been detected in this experiment. ASP3-dependent processing of MIC6 has been experimentally validated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as well as for the hypothetical protein TGGT1_273860 (TAILS3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which presents a very similar profile in TAILS analysis. Conversely, ROP1 was only represented by peptides with +ATc/-ATc ratios &gt;2 in the TAILS dataset. Nevertheless, in vitro cleavage experiments show ASP3-dependent processing producing a mature protein of ~55 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Although two acetylated N-termini were detected in MS analysis, in this case, likely for technical reasons (e.g. flyability), the quantitative information was not sufficient to calculate peptide abundances. However, the high number of peptides (4 N-terminal, 5 internal) in the TAILS profile with ratios &gt;2 is consistent with ROP1 being an ASP3 substrate.</p><p>Taken together, TAILS allowed efficient (albeit not comprehensive) identification of ASP3 substrates by interpretation of +ATc/-ATc peptide ratios, and provided biochemical information on processed N-termini.</p></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27480.048</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Mignot</surname><given-names>Tâm</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Aix Marseille University-CNRS UMR7283</institution><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Mohamed-ali Hakimi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a thoroughly conducted study that defines the role of an important protease called Asp3 in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. The data convincingly shows that this protease is necessary for maturation of secretory proteins derived from the rhoptries and micronemes. Conditional knockdown results in a string phenotype in invasion and egress. The authors also demonstrate that a potent inhibitor of ASP3 in vitro, phenocopies the phenotype of loss of ASP3 expression.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>In general the authors are miscalling the inhibitor as &quot;selective&quot;. The authors are using this to indicate that 49c is potent while 49b is not. This is not selectivity in the typical sense used in inhibitor studies. Selectivity implies that an inhibitor does not act on other targets, such as other plasmepsins, not that it has an activity not seen in related chemical structures. This is not simply a semantic issue as it relates to the point above and raises the question: could 49c act on other proteases in the parasite and might this contribute to its in vivo potency?</p><p>In fact, there is no data showing that the hydroxyethylamine compound &quot;selectively&quot; targets ASP3. It is true that this compound inhibits ASP3, this does not mean that it is acting on ASP3 selectively. Given the number of off target effects that have been found for previously described &quot;selective&quot; inhibitors, some caution is due here. Whilst it is clear from the data that the inhibitor blocks ASP3 activity on some substrates in vitro and also phenocopies the conditional knockdown, this does not rule out that an alternative target is partially responsible for its activity in blocking the lytic growth cycle. It would therefore be important to show that non Asp3-targets are not affected by the drug, or ideally identify Asp3 mutant alleles that confer 49c resistance. That could prove difficult but at the very least, the authors should test MIC5 and PLP1 processing, which is Asp3-independent, and thus should not be sensitive to 49c treatment.</p><p>In general, it would be less prone to controversy to state: &quot;a potent inhibitor of ASP3 in vitro interrupted the lytic growth cycle, suggesting that targeting ASP3 may be an effective means of blocking parasite growth.&quot;</p><p>A major finding presented here is that ASP3 is playing an essential role at the invasion step that correlates with the absence of TJ/MJ at the surface of host cells. The authors rule out an effect of asp3 mutant on MIC secretion based on ESA assay and analysis of the two microneme proteins MIC2 and AMA1. Then, the authors are backing up on MIC analysis to reveal that asp3 affects MIC processing. An excellent candidate that could explain the phenotype of asp3 on at the parasite invasion step is MIC8. However, this hypothesis is ruled out based on the argument that MIC8 activity is not dependent on a processing step for maturation. Given the phenotype of asp3 on the TJ/MJ, notably RON4 whose processing is not affected by asp3, it sounds reasonable to think that asp3 depletion could have some effect on secreted proteins although their processing remains independent of ASP3. Is there any assay that could determine whether MIC8 is still secreted in the absence of ASP3?</p><p>The authors report the localization of Asp3 and tried to validate its localisation in Golgi and endosomal like compartments. The protein was however not found residing in these compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). Rather it is expected to localize to post-Golgi compartment. Ectopically expressed and the WT Asp3 have been reported to localise in this sub-compartment by Shea et al., 2007, which authors have acknowledged. In this case for further proof, experiment using brefeldin A (PMID: 1629235, PMID: 11532123) is advisable. By inhibition of trans Golgi transport, the substrates of Asp3 are expected to accumulate in the post-Golgi region. And, if authors can use any known marker of post-Golgi compartments, the localisation of Asp3 will be more clear.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27480.049</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major comments:</italic> </p><p> <italic>In general the authors are miscalling the inhibitor as &quot;selective&quot;.

RH strain parasites individually lacking TgASP1, TgASP2 are readily propagating in culture and are virulent in mice while TgASP5 is dispensable but shows a significant decrease in fitness and virulence (Curt-Varesano et al., 2015; Hammoudi et al., 2015; Coffey et al., 2015). TgASP4, TgASP6 and TgASP7 are not expressed in tachyzoites. In consequence, the fact that 49c phenocopies depletion of ASP3 is not a solid evidence for selectivity.</p><p>Since TgASP5 plays a key role in the formation of the intravacuolar membranous nanotubular network (MNN), we examined parasites depleted in ASP3 and parasites treated with 49c by EM and showed that MNN formation is not affected, inferring that 49c does not inhibit TgASP5. In addition, we add data pertaining to the action of 49c on ASP5, showing that 49c has no impact on maturation of ASP5 or on the processing and export of GRA16 (an ASP5 substrate).These data are now included in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p> <italic>In fact, there is no data showing that the hydroxyethylamine compound &quot;selectively&quot; targets ASP3.

We have addressed the selectivity of 49c toward the cluster of aspartyl proteases that groups TgASP3 and the Plasmepsins IX and X in a separate study. The work is based on 3D modeling of these enzymes and docking of substrates as well as the peptidomimetic inhibitor 49c. The results led to a plausible molecular explanation for the selective sensitivity of TgASP3, PMIX and PMX to 49c compared to the other apicomplexan ASPs and Plasmepsins.

In this study, metabolic labeling coupled to pulse-chase experiments established that ROP1 processing was Brefeldin A sensitive and thus occurring post ER. Moreover and importantly the same pulse-chase experiments were also performed in combination with 15°C and 20°C temperature blocks known to prevent transport in a pre-Golgi compartment (like Brefeldin A) and in the trans-Golgi network, respectively. These functional data supported unambiguously a post-Golgi compartment for the maturase of ROP1.</p><p>Concordantly, ASP3 localizes in a post-Golgi compartment as shown by IFA with the markers GRASP (cis-Golgi), DrpB (post-Golgi), and proM2AP (ELC).
