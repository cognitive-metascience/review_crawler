Here, we produce biosensors based on a ligand-binding domain (LBD) by using a method that, in principle, can be applied to any target molecule. The LBD is fused to either a fluorescent protein or a transcriptional activator and is destabilized by mutation such that the fusion accumulates only in cells containing the target ligand. We illustrate the power of this method by developing biosensors for digoxin and progesterone. Addition of ligand to yeast, mammalian, or plant cells expressing a biosensor activates transcription with a dynamic range of up to ~100-fold. We use the biosensors to improve the biotransformation of pregnenolone to progesterone in yeast and to regulate CRISPR activity in mammalian cells. This work provides a general methodology to develop biosensors for a broad range of molecules in eukaryotes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10606.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10606.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10606.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Small molecules play essential roles in organisms, and so methods to sense these molecules within living cells could have wide-ranging uses in both biology and biotechnology. However, current methods for making new “biosensors” are limited and only a narrow range of small molecules can be detected.</p><p>One approach to biosensor design in yeast and other eukaryotic organisms uses proteins called ligand-binding domains, which bind to small molecules. Here, Feng, Jester, Tinberg, Mandell et al. have developed a new method to make biosensors from ligand-binding domains that could, in principle, be applied to any target small molecule. The new method involves taking a ligand-binding domain that is either engineered or occurs in nature and linking it to something that can be readily detected, such as a protein that fluoresces or that controls gene expression. This combined biosensor protein is then engineered, via mutations, such that it is unstable unless it binds to the small molecule. This means that, in the absence of the small molecule, these proteins are destroyed inside living cells. However, the binding of a target molecule to one of these proteins protects it from degradation, which allows the signal to be detected.</p><p>Feng, Jester, Tinberg, Mandell et al. use this method to create biosensors for a human hormone called progesterone and a drug called digoxin, which is used to treat heart disease. Further experiments used the biosensors to optimize the production of progesterone in yeast and to regulate the activity of a gene editing protein called Cas9 in human cells. The biosensors can be also used to produce long-term environmental sensors in plant cells.</p><p>This approach makes it possible to produce a wide variety of biosensors for different organisms. The next step is to continue to explore the ability of various proteins to be converted into biosensors, and to find out how easy it is to transfer a biosensor produced in one species to another.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10606.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10606.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biosensors capable of sensing and responding to small molecules in vivo have wide-ranging applications in biological research and biotechnology, including metabolic pathway regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), biosynthetic pathway optimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raman et al., 2014</xref>;

Despite such broad utility, no single strategy for the construction of biosensors has proven sufficiently generalizable to gain widespread use. Current methods typically couple binding of a small molecule to a single output signal, and use a limited repertoire of natural protein- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2013</xref>) or nucleic acid aptamer-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2013</xref>) domains, which narrows the scope of small molecules that can be detected. A general solution to small molecule biosensing should be adaptable to a range of small molecules and responses.</p><p>A promising approach to biosensor design in eukaryotes uses conditionally stable ligand-binding domains (LBDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banaszynski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tucker and Fields, 2001</xref>). In the absence of a cognate ligand, these proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egeler et al., 2011</xref>). Binding of the ligand stabilizes the LBD and prevents its degradation. Fusing the destabilized LBD to a suitable reporter protein, such as an enzyme, fluorescent protein, or transcription factor, renders the fusion conditionally stable and generates sensor response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Naturally-occurring LBDs can be engineered to be conditionally stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banaszynski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyazaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iwamoto et al., 2010</xref>), making it possible in principle to convert them into biosensors for target ligands. Designed LBDs can also be used, especially in cases for which natural binding proteins do not exist or lack sufficient specificity or bioorthogonality.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10606.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A general method for construction of biosensors for small molecules.</title><p>(<bold><bold>a</bold></bold>) Modular biosensor construction from a conditionally destabilized LBD and a genetically fused reporter.

Introduction of three rationally-designed binding site mutations into DIG<sub>0</sub> resulted in a progesterone binder (PRO<sub>0</sub>) with nanomolar affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tinberg et al., 2013</xref>).

Work by Wandless and co-workers has shown that mutagenesis of LBDs can be used to identify variants that are stable only in the presence of a target ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banaszynski et al., 2006</xref>). We randomly mutagenized the LBDs of DIG<sub>0</sub>-GFP and PRO<sub>0</sub>-GFP by error-prone PCR and subjected libraries of 10<sup>5</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gil et al., 2000</xref>) integrants to multiple rounds of FACS, sorting alternately for high fluorescence in the presence of the ligand and low fluorescence in its absence. We isolated LBD variants having greater than 5-fold activation by cognate ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By making additional variants that contain only one of the up to four mutations found in the progesterone biosensors, we showed that some mutations are additive, while others predominately contribute to sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>).

A FACS-based screen of an error-prone PCR library of G-DIG<sub>0</sub>-V, G-DIG<sub>1</sub>-V, and G-DIG<sub>2</sub>-V variants identified mutations L77F and R60S in the Gal4 dimer interface (hereafter G<sub>L77F</sub>, G<sub>R60S</sub>) that further increased TF-biosensor response by lowering background activity in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Although these Gal4 mutations were identified by screening the libraries of digoxin-dependent TF-biosensors, they also increased progesterone-dependent activation of the G-PRO-V series of biosensors, indicating a shared mechanism of conditional stability in both systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Combining mutations in Gal4 and DIG<sub>0</sub> or PRO<sub>0</sub> led to activations of up to 60-fold by cognate ligand, a ten-fold improvement over the most responsive LBD-biosensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>) and a dynamic range that has been challenging to achieve with stability-based biosensors in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rakhit et al., 2011</xref>). The TF-biosensors were also rapidly activated, showing a five-fold increase in signal after 1 hr of incubation with ligand and full activation after ~14 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). In contrast to the LBD-biosensors, the TF-biosensors exhibited a broad range of fluorescence levels across single cells, as well as a population of nonfluorescent cells in the presence of ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The response of the TF-biosensors to the withdrawal of ligand is likely much faster than observed by fluorescence, as the reduction in fluorescence signal is dependent on both the degradation of the TF-biosensors as well as the degradation and dilution of previously expressed yEGFP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>TF-biosensors are tunable and modular</title><p>An attractive feature of the TF-biosensors is that the constituent parts – the DBD/promoter pair, the LBD, the TAD, the reporter, and the yeast strain – are modular, such that the system can be modified for additional applications. To demonstrate tunability, we replaced the DBD of G-DIG<sub>1</sub>-V with the bacterial repressor LexA and replaced the Gal4 DNA-binding sites in the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter with those for LexA. LexA-based TF-biosensors with DIG<sub>1</sub> and a weak TAD (B42) showed a strong response to digoxin (nearly 40-fold) only when the promoter-driving reporter expression contained LexA-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). These results demonstrate that the biosensors can function with different combinations of DBDs and TADs, which could produce diverse behaviors and permit their use in eukaryotes requiring different promoters.

A key step in the production of both steroids is the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone by the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). We aimed to use a progesterone biosensor to detect and improve this transformation. An important feature of biosensors intended for pathway engineering is their ability to detect a product with minimal activation by substrate or other related chemicals.

If yeast-derived biosensors function in more complex eukaryotes, the design-build-test cycle in those organisms could be rapidly accelerated. We first assessed the portability of yeast TF-biosensors to mammalian cells. Single constructs containing digoxin and progesterone TF-biosensors with the greatest dynamic ranges (without codon optimization) were stably integrated into human K562 cells using PiggyBac transposition. We characterized the dynamics of the TF-biosensors in human cells by dose response and time course assays similar to the yeast experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–d</xref>). As with yeast, the human cells demonstrated greater sensitivity to digoxin, with fluorescence activation increasing up to 100 nM of cognate ligand for digoxin biosensors and 1 mM for progesterone biosensors. We observed &gt;100-fold activation for the most sensitive progesterone biosensor G<sub>L77F</sub>-PRO<sub>1</sub>-V. The increase in mammalian dynamic range over yeast may arise from more aggressive degradation of destabilized biosensors or greater accumulation of target-stabilized biosensors or reporters resulting from larger cell sizes and slower doubling times. The time course data show that fluorescence increased four-fold within 4 hr of target introduction and rose logarithmically for 24–48 hr.</p><p>We next assessed whether these biosensors could drive more complex mammalian phenotypes.

Here, we show that LBDs can be conditionally destabilized to create biosensors that function in yeast, mammalian cells, and plants, and we demonstrate the use of these biosensors in metabolic engineering and genome editing applications. While this method requires a high-affinity ligand-binding domain as a starting point, nearly all small molecules of interest have a natural protein interactor. Furthermore, the use of de novo<italic>-</italic>designed binders opens the possibility of generating biosensors for ligands with unsuitable or unknown binding proteins. By incorporating standard mutagenesis and screening, our method constitutes a simple platform for sensor development that can be applied to many areas of biotechnology. These sensors act either at the level of post-translational control over protein function or at the level of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), and they can be tuned by altering any of their components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>) or by modifying efflux of the target ligand in the host organism. These tunable features should make the biosensors useful in many different cellular and environmental contexts.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10606.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic of biosensor platform.</title><p>(<bold><bold>a</bold></bold>) Biosensors for small molecules are modularly constructed by replacing the LBD with proteins possessing altered substrate preferences.

Furthermore, the portability of the mutations we identified suggests a structural basis for conferring conditional stability to the DIG<sub>0</sub> LBD scaffold. Both the DIG<sub>0</sub> LBD and Gal4 are homodimers, and the majority of the conditionally-stabilizing mutations are located at the dimer interfaces. A computational model of the Gal4-DIG<sub>0</sub> complex indicates that the orientation of the two domains allows a homodimeric fusion to form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). These results suggest an allosteric interplay between ligand binding and dimer formation: weakening of the dimer interface, in either the DIG<sub>0</sub> or the Gal4 domain, is compensated by ligand binding. This LBD scaffold is derived from a member of the nuclear transport factor 2 family, a fold class that typically has a large dimer interface (~1200 Å<sup>2</sup>) that facilitates the large and open ligand-binding site (~600 Å<sup>2</sup>). These protein folds are well suited for <italic>de novo</italic> design of other LBDs because of their large binding pocket and natural substrate diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Todd et al., 2002</xref>). Exploiting dimer interfaces to modulate stability without impairing ligand binding may be a general mechanism to confer conditional stability on LBDs. This possibility is supported by the observation that interface mutations in DIG<sub>0</sub> and Gal4 conferring digoxin-dependent stability lead to progesterone-dependent stability in a progesterone biosensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>).</p><p>A long-standing challenge in metabolic engineering is to rapidly detect and control how changes to the regulation and composition of biosynthetic pathways affect product titers.

These approaches require high selectivity against intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang and Keasling, 2011</xref>), a feature demonstrated here that can be explicitly considered during the computational design and screening process. Our method allows biosensors to be generated that are highly selective for a small molecule, facilitating a simple directed evolution strategy without requiring prior structural or bioinformatic knowledge about the targeted enzyme(s) or pathway(s). Because the biosensors are TF-based, sophisticated systems of optimizing metabolic output, such as dynamic control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) and feedback-regulated genome evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou and Keasling, 2013</xref>), are possible.</p><p>A reliance on the general principles of protein stability and ligand binding allows the development of biosensors that function in any organism with similar protein quality control machinery. Here, we engineered biosensors based on a designed scaffold derived from a bacterial protein. These biosensors required only minimal modifications to retain high levels of sensitivity when developed in yeast and deployed across mammalian and plant species, demonstrating unprecedented portability for biosensors. In some cases, these biosensors showed a greater dynamic range in mammalian cells relative to yeast, possibly due to larger cell volume and variations in protein degradation machinery. Further work using biosensors based on multiple different LBD scaffolds and introduced into diverse organisms will allow us to better understand the principles by which biosensor variability across hosts arises.</p><p>Small molecule biosensors with the modularity incorporated here enable diverse cellular responses to a variety of exogenous and endogenous signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banaszynski et al., 2008</xref>).

While small molecule inducers including doxycycline and rapamycin have been used, these molecules may confer leaky expression and cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xie et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, an expanded chemical repertoire is needed for tightly regulated gene editing and gene therapy applications. By exploiting the low background of the LBD-biosensors, we produced biosensor-Cas9 fusions with tightly controlled activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). This switch-like control over CRISPR/Cas9 activity could reduce background activity and off-target editing, a critical feature for safer gene therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mandal, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwank et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our biosensor design approach should have numerous applications in agriculture. For example, biosensors could be developed to enable plants to monitor the environment for pollutants, toxins or dangerous compounds. Coupling biosensors with a phytoremediation trait could enable plants to both sense a contaminant and activate a bioremediation gene circuit. When paired with an agronomic or biofuel trait, such biosensors could serve as triggers for bioproduction. In the transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants, we observed ligand-dependent activation in all cells, tissues and organs examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The technology introduced here operates at either the transcriptional or post-translational level. These biosensors can be developed in yeast and readily transferred with minimal modification to other eukaryotic cell types, where they retain a high level of sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). The generality of our approach arises from the universality of the transcriptional activation and protein degradation machinery across eukaryotes, together with the modularity and tunability of the constituent parts. These biosensors should find broad application, including improving metabolically engineered pathway flux and product titers, exerting ligand-dependent control over genome editing, and detecting exogenous small molecules or endogenous metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culture and growth conditions</title><p>Biological replicates are defined as samples inoculated from distinct colonies.

The lowest energy model satisfied the dimer constraints, indicating that a homodimer configuration of the fusion is possible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>TF-biosensor titration assays in yeast</title><p>Yeast strain PyE1 transformed with p16C plasmids containing G-LBD-V variants were inoculated from colonies into SD –ura media supplemented and grown at 30°C overnight (16 h). 10 μL of the culture was resuspended into 490 μL of separately prepared media each containing a steroid of interest (SD –ura media supplemented the steroid of interest and DMSO to a final concentration of 1% DMSO).

of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;A general strategy to construct small molecule biosensors in eukaryotes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jeffery Kelly (Reviewing editor) and John Kuriyan (Senior Editor).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Please consider all the reviewer comments and suggestions pasted below and address as many of them as possible in the two month time frame.</p><p>The authors are requested to spend a few sentences addressing whether their current strategy lends itself to quantification, or whether the use of coupled, intermolecular systems (i.e., transcription of a reporter gene) precludes accurate quantification. The idea that these biosensors can be quickly ported from yeast to other eukaryotes is compelling and important, but the authors did not rigorously support this claim with experiments specifically designed to show and characterize organism-to-organism portability. Addressing this would be desirable.</p><p>The editors feel that the paper could benefit from a careful reading, with an eye towards integration of the results and conclusions, done by one of the senior authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a nice paper from the Church, Fields, and Baker labs. I think that many will find this paper interesting and I recommend it for publication with one suggestion (not a requirement) for additional data.</p><p>Responding to the appearance of the analyte appears to be the primary goal of this work. However, biosensors of this sort would be extremely useful for single-cell analyses of biological processes such as signaling (think of Tsien's calcium dyes). In this light, it is important for the reader to know how these engineered biosensors respond to the loss of the analyte as well as the appearance of the analyte, which is well-treated in the current paper. I imagine the authors have already done these experiments, and analyte withdrawal data would nicely complement the data currently in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (as new panels G and H, showing a time course of signal loss when dig or prog are removed).</p><p>One definition of &quot;biosensor&quot; only requires detection of a particular analyte. A more ambitious definition would capture quantification of the analyte. I would appreciate if the authors could spend a few sentences addressing whether their current strategy lends itself to quantification, or whether the use of coupled, intermolecular systems (i.e., transcription of a reporter gene) precludes accurate quantification. This same issue likely prevents these biosensors from responding rapidly/accurately to the disappearance of analyte. This is fine. I don't think the authors should be asked to invent version 2 of the system for this paper, but I do think it would be a good idea for the authors to address this issue in the text. Having protein stability as the readout makes a biosensor less sensitive (no amplification from transcription), but it also makes it more responsive to analyte in terms of speed and quantification.</p><p>One issue missing from this study is how the presence of the biosensor might change or affect the behavior of the cell. In other words, progesterone that is sequestered by the biosensor is not available to bind to the endogenous target. Additionally, this biosensor strategy is &quot;general&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) only insofar as a researcher has access to a high-affinity, protein-based ligand-binding domain for a particular analyte.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This work is impressive in the scope of different design features/perturbations and applications implemented in engineering biosensors. However, most of these features have been previously reported (and appropriately cited in each case by the authors), and it is therefore difficult to determine the novelty and utility for the greater scientific community. If the authors' intended finding is an overall approach of implementing many different strategies to achieve an improved end goal application, and that their strategy is generalizable, more efficient, or possessing of some other hitherto lacking feature, then the manuscript would need to more directly demonstrate this. As one example, the idea that these biosensors can be quickly ported from yeast to other eukaryotes is compelling and important, but the authors did not rigorously support this claim with experiments specifically designed to show and characterize organism-organism portability. That is, transferring a set of proteins and showing they work in other organisms may not be a sufficiently systematic study that statistically supports organism-organism portability. If the authors could better refine/clarify the contribution of their work, this would help to motivate readers to adopt the strategies and findings from this work.</p><p>The authors showed tremendous versatility in demonstrating several potential applications. However, the depth of each of these demonstrations was somewhat lacking and appeared more as minimal proof of principle experiments. For example, the authors demonstrated increased bioproduction of progesterone. This could indeed serve as a compelling model of how to engineer and use biosensors. However, the effects seen were not large (~2 fold with large error bars). Perhaps if any one of the applications were flushed out in more depth, more detail, or with greater effect, this would have greater impact on the community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10606.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>Responding to the appearance of the analyte appears to be the primary goal of this work.

We observe rapid decrease in fluorescence levels with 50% reduction after approximately 5 hours, and almost complete loss after 10-15 hours. Destabilization likely occurs more rapidly than observed by fluorescence, as the reduction in fluorescence signal is dependent on both the degradation of the TF-biosensors after ligand withdrawal, as well as the degradation and dilution of previously expressed yEGFP.</p><p><italic>One definition of &quot;biosensor&quot; only requires detection of a particular analyte.

I don't think the authors should be asked to invent version 2 of the system for this paper, but I do think it would be a good idea for the authors to address this issue in the text. Having protein stability as the readout makes a biosensor less sensitive (no amplification from transcription), but it also makes it more responsive to analyte in terms of speed and quantification.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need to distinguish between signal from bulk populations versus single cells. The levels of accuracy and noise at single-cell resolution are important aspects when deciding whether our biosensors in both the direct fusion or the TF systems are suitable for different applications. We have added single cell flow cytometry event data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, together with a discussion in the subsection “TF-biosensors amplify ligand-dependent responses”. We observe a more rapid response with direct fusions at the expense of dynamic range. We also observe tighter distributions using direct fusions, which would allow for more accurate quantification of ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). At very high levels of ligand, the TF-biosensors exhibit tight distributions as well, but at intermediate ligand concentrations, the GFP levels span a fairly broad range. We used FACS to isolate cells from the dark population peak and found those cells to be inviable. Further optimizations could possibly reduce noise in the TF system, such as integrating the constructs instead of using a plasmid-borne system, or exploring a larger library of promoters.</p><p><italic>One issue missing from this study is how the presence of the biosensor might change or affect the behavior of the cell. In other words, progesterone that is sequestered by the biosensor is not available to bind to the endogenous target. Additionally, this biosensor strategy is &quot;general&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) only insofar as a researcher has access to a high-affinity, protein-based ligand-binding domain for a particular analyte.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer correctly points out the importance of developing biosensors with activity that is compatible with intended downstream applications. In this study, we chose two steroids orthogonal to the yeast sterol biosynthesis pathway in order to reduce biological responses from the host. 3β-HSD mutations identified in the histidine selections and yEGFP activation assays were re-transformed into yeast strains not expressing our TF-biosensors for quantification using GC/MS, so the improvements in 3β-HSD bioproduction were observed both with and without the progesterone biosensors present.</p><p>The CYC1 promoter used to express the TF-biosensors leads to fairly low expression and causes only a small amount of ligand to be sequestered. If an application were particularly sensitive to very minute changes in ligand concentration, the TF-biosensor could be used with an even weaker promoter.</p><p>It is also true that this method requires a high-affinity ligand-binding domain as a starting point, but nearly any small molecule of interest will have a natural protein that interacts with it. Using de novodesigned binders opens the possibility of generating biosensors for ligands with unsuitable or unknown binding proteins.</p><p>We have added text to the Discussion to discuss these key points.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>This work is impressive in the scope of different design features/perturbations and applications implemented in engineering biosensors. However, most of these features have been previously reported (and appropriately cited in each case by the authors), and it is therefore difficult to determine the novelty and utility for the greater scientific community. If the authors' intended finding is an overall approach of implementing many different strategies to achieve an improved end goal application, and that their strategy is generalizable, more efficient, or possessing of some other hitherto lacking feature, then the manuscript would need to more directly demonstrate this. As one example, the idea that these biosensors can be quickly ported from yeast to other eukaryotes is compelling and important, but the authors did not rigorously support this claim with experiments specifically designed to show and characterize organism-organism portability. That is, transferring a set of proteins and showing they work in other organisms may not be a sufficiently systematic study that statistically supports organism-organism portability. If the authors could better refine/clarify the contribution of their work, this would help to motivate readers to adopt the strategies and findings from this work.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting further discussion on the key issue of multi-organism portability of our biosensors. Previous work has shown that conditionally destabilized proteins are degraded by the highly conserved ubiquitin proteasome system (Egeler et al., 2011). Relying on the general principles of protein stability and ligand binding allows for the development of biosensors in any organism with similar protein quality control machinery. The fact that our biosensors engineered from a bacterial protein scaffold retained high levels of sensitivity with minimal modifications when developed in yeast and deployed across mammalian and plant species demonstrates unprecedented portability for biosensors and suggests than even further portability may be possible. We have added text to the fourth paragraph of the Discussion to clarify these points.</p><p>We do agree that further work on portability will allow us to better understand the principles for using biosensors across diverse organisms, which we believe will require multiple novel biosensors originating from multiple LBD scaffolds, forming the basis of an intriguing follow-up study.</p><p><italic>The authors showed tremendous versatility in demonstrating several potential applications. However, the depth of each of these demonstrations was somewhat lacking and appeared more as minimal proof of principle experiments. For example, the authors demonstrated increased bioproduction of progesterone. This could indeed serve as a compelling model of how to engineer and use biosensors. However, the effects seen were not large (~2 fold with large error bars). Perhaps if any one of the applications were flushed out in more depth, more detail, or with greater effect, this would have greater impact on the community.</italic></p><p>The GC/MS results show statistically significant increases in progesterone bioproduction when compared to wildtype after a 76 hr period. The difference in the TF-biosensor yEGFP activation assay and the GC/MS results may be due to a difference in the experimental length, with the pregnenolone possibly becoming limited over the course of a three-day experiment. In addition, the identified mutations were discovered after a single round of random mutagenesis with no previous knowledge of the enzyme’s structure or function applied. We believe a more thorough search of the sequence space, either through saturation mutagenesis or iterative rounds of selections and error-prone PCR, would yield other beneficial mutations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
