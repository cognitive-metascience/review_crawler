formation, a process that requires co-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by small RNAs and their associated argonaute proteins. Heterochromatin formation requires erasing the active epigenetic mark, such as H3K4me2, but the molecular link between HP1 and H3K4 demethylation remains unclear. In a fertility screen in female <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we identified <italic>ovaries absent</italic> (<italic>ova</italic>), which functions in the stem cell niche, downstream of Piwi, to support germline stem cell differentiation. Moreover, <italic>ova</italic> acts as a suppressor of position effect variegation, and is required for silencing telomeric transposons in the germline. Biochemically, Ova acts to link the H3K4 demethylase dLsd1 to HP1a for local histone modifications. Therefore, our study provides a molecular connection between HP1a and local H3K4 demethylation during HP1a-mediated gene silencing that is required for ovary development, transposon silencing, and heterochromatin formation.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

The genomes of human and other animal cells have regions of active genes interspersed with ‘dark’ regions known as heterochromatin, which contain genes and other types of genetic material that have been inactivated.</p><p>Heterochromatin commonly contains sections of genetic material known as transposons. When a transposon is active it is able to move around the genome, therefore, inactivating (or ‘silencing’) transposons helps to maintain the integrity of the genetic material in a cell.

This process requires an enzyme called dLsd1 to remove a small tag from the genetic material but it is not clear how HP1a regulates the activity of dLsd1.

Heterochromatin is defined by the presence of repressive epigenetic methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me) and by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which binds to H3K9me sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lachner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bannister et al., 2001</xref>). Heterochromatin formation is mediated by co-transcriptional gene silencing, a process that requires small RNAs and their associated argonaute proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Martienssen and Moazed, 2015</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the argonaute protein Piwi and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) use base-pairing to target nascent transcripts to the corresponding transposon regions. The Piwi/piRNAs then recruit gene silencing machinery, including HP1a and the H3K9 methyltransferase Egg to form heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang and Xi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Czech and Hannon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brower-Toland et al., 2007</xref>). The formation of heterochromatin also requires erasing of active epigenetic mark by the H3K4 demethylase dLsd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rudolph et al., 2007</xref>), but the molecular link between HP1a and local H3k4 demethylation remains elusive.</p><p>Piwi, a founding member of the piRNA pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, was initially identified as a fertility factor; its mutation results in germline degeneration and sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cox et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lin and Spradling, 1997</xref>). To identify new genes involved in Piwi/piRNA-mediated gene silencing, we here conducted a female fertility screen by EMS mutagenesis and identified a novel recessive mutation on the second chromosome. The homozygous mutant males are semi-lethal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 1), but females are viable but do not lay any eggs; other than sterility, these females do not have other notable defects. Dissection revealed that these females had rudimentary ovaries: rather than a normal ovary, each oviduct in these mutant females was connected to only a tiny mass of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). Given this nearly ‘ovaryless’ phenotype, we named the gene associated with this mutation as <italic>ovaries absent</italic> (<italic>ova</italic>) and named this mutant allele <italic>ova<sup>1</sup> </italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40806.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ova is a niche factor for GSCs and ovary development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Phase contrast images of dissected ovaries from flies of indicated genotypes.

CG5694 encodes a protein with no obvious sequence similarity to any existing proteins in the NCBI database, but does have a conserved nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1)- like domain at its N-terminus (15–105 aa); this DNA-binding domain was initially identified in the mammalian transcription factor NRF-1 and are known to occur in at least one other <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcription factor, Erect Wing (Ewg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>). We used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate a knock-out allele in which the entire coding region of <italic>CG5694</italic> was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Homozygous knock-out allele females are sterile and exhibit virtually identical ‘ovaryless’ phenotypes as the <italic>ova<sup>1</sup></italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Additionally, transgenic expression of a genomic DNA fragment containing the <italic>ova</italic> gene region was able to effectively rescue the ovary defect and restore fertility of <italic>ova<sup>1</sup></italic> homozygous or <italic>CG5694</italic> null females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). Therefore, <italic>ova</italic> is allelic to <italic>CG5694</italic>.</p><p>Normally, oogenesis initiates in the germarium, an anterior part of the ovariole where germline stem cells (GSCs) reside. Each germarium normally harbors 2–3 GSCs that can be distinguished by spherically-shaped spectrosome and by their direct contact with the cap cell niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The decedents of GSCs move posteriorly as they differentiate into germline cyst, and then bud off from the germarium to form egg chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xie, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spradling, 1993</xref>). Immunostaining of <italic>ova<sup>1</sup></italic> homozygous and <italic>ova<sup>1/4</sup></italic> trans-heterozygous ovaries revealed that the mutant ovaries completely lacked vitellaria, and the germaria were either full of GSC-like cells [77% (n = 117) of <italic>ova<sup>1</sup></italic> germaria] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d,g</xref>) or entirely germless (lacking Vasa expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d,g</xref>), suggesting that <italic>ova</italic> is required for GSC differentiation and for germline survival.</p><p>To determine whether <italic>ova</italic> functions cell-autonomously in the germline and/or non-cell-autonomously in somatic supporting cells to regulate GSCs, we conducted mosaic analysis by inducing mitotic clones using a FLP-FRT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu and Rubin, 1993</xref>). Similar to wild-type control clones, <italic>ova<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant GSC clones behaved normally: the mutant GSCs were properly maintained in the niche, and their descendant cells were properly differentiated into germline cysts and egg chambers with properly specified oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–d</xref>), although germline mutant eggs failed to hatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Similarly, germline-specific knocking down <italic>ova</italic> by UAS-Dcr2; nos-GAL4 (thereafter referred as <italic>ova</italic> GLKD) also did not cause any obvious defects in ovary morphology, and the number of GSCs and their immediate daughter cystoblasts (collectively referred to as GSC-like cells) per germarium remained largely normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2g,h</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that <italic>ova</italic> is not cell-autonomously required for the early stages of GSC differentiation. We next used a temperature sensitive GAL4/UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McGuire et al., 2004</xref>) to specifically deplete <italic>ova</italic> in somatic escort cells with c587-GAL4 (c587 &gt;ova RNAi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Song et al., 2004</xref>). The somatic escort cells, which usually send out long protrusions that encapsulate the germline, are known to provide the niche environment required for germline cyst differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kirilly et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Morris and Spradling, 2011</xref>). After treatment at the restrictive temperature, c587 &gt;ova RNAi germaria began to exhibit a significantly increased number of spectrosome-containing GSC-like cells in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,g</xref>). The mutant escort cells were still able to send protrusions to the encapsulate the germline cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), indicating that the GSC differentiation defects is likely not caused by defects in escort cell morphology. The requirement for <italic>ova</italic> i in somatic escort cells for proper GSC differentiation was further supported by the observation that escort cell-specific expression of an <italic>ova</italic> transgene was sufficient to rescue the ovary defects of <italic>ova</italic> mutant females (hereafter referred to as <italic>ova</italic> germline mutants) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Therefore, <italic>ova</italic> functions in somatic escort cells and regulates germline differentiation in the germarium in a non-cell-autonomous manner.</p><p>The <italic>ova</italic> mutant phenotype is reminiscent of the <italic>piwi</italic> mutant phenotypes: <italic>piwi</italic> mutant flies also have rudimentary ovaries that contain an abnormal number of differentiation-blocked GSC-like cells, and <italic>piwi</italic> also functions primarily in somatic escort cells to regulate GSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). Loss of <italic>piwi</italic> in escort cells causes de-repression of <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>), a major self-renewal signal for GSCs, leading to GSC-like cell accumulation in the germarium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the <italic>ova</italic> phenotype was also associated with increased <italic>dpp</italic> signaling. The extra GSC-like cells in c587 &gt;ova RNAi germaria had dramatically increased expression of Dad-lacZ and phosphorylated Mad (pMad) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h,i</xref>), both of which are reporters of BMP pathway activity, and decreased expression of <italic>bam</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), a gene whose expression is normally suppressed by BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Song et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen and McKearin, 2003</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that loss of <italic>ova</italic> in escort cells leads to ectopic <italic>dpp</italic> signaling that blocks further GSC differentiation, leading to GSC-like cell accumulation in the germarium.</p><p>The phenotypic and molecular similarities between the <italic>ova</italic> and <italic>piwi</italic> mutants led us to further test whether Ova and Piwi act via the same genetic pathway to regulate GSCs. As expected, we observed that homozygous <italic>piwi</italic> mutant females had rudimentary ovaries. As a positive control, escort cell-specific expression of a <italic>piwi</italic> transgene was sufficient to rescue the <italic>piwi</italic> mutant ovary phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). On the one hand, transgenic expression of <italic>ova</italic> in escort cells of <italic>piwi</italic> mutants also partially rescued the ovary morphology phenotype with the frequent appearance of developing germline cysts, including late stages of egg chambers, although oogenesis was still abnormal, GSC-like tumor still remained, and no mature eggs were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b,c</xref>).

Interestingly, nos &gt; ova RNAi ovaries had dramatically up-regulated transcripts of a subset of transposons that included the LTR element 412 and the telomeric non-LTR repeats Het-A, TAHRE, Tart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). By comparison, the expression of protein-coding genes and piRNAs was largely un-altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a,b,e</xref>). Somatic cell-specific knock-down of <italic>ova</italic> (tj-GAL4 &gt;ova RNAi) only caused mild, if any, TE upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3f</xref>). Consistent with a role in germline transposon silencing, a previously reported genetic screen for genes involved in germline transposon silencing identified <italic>ova</italic> (CG5694) as one of the top hits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Muerdter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czech et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, germline-specifc knock-down of either <italic>ova</italic> (<italic>ova</italic> GLKD) or <italic>dLsd1</italic> (<italic>dLsd1</italic> GLKD) exhibited de-repression of a similar subset of transposons (R = 0.9463 by Pearson’s correlation coefficient, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>); this subset is distinguished by enrichment for bivalent histone marks (both H3K9me3 and H3K4me2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czech et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klenov et al., 2014</xref>). In mutants deficient in piRNA biogenesis, the inability to form Piwi/piRNA complexes typically results in retention of Piwi in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang and Elgin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Olivieri et al., 2010</xref>). The fact that nuclear Piwi localization was largely unaffected in the <italic>ova</italic> mutant germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref>) further supports our conclusion that <italic>ova</italic> is not required for piRNA biogenesis, but may function at the chromatin to mediate Piwi/piRNAs- induced transcriptional gene silencing, a phase that has been referred to as ‘effector step’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czech et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To explore the biochemical mechanisms underlying Ova function in greater detail, we used Y2H assays to identify the Ova domains required for its interactions with HP1a and/or dLsd1. We constructed multiple truncated forms of Ova (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), and found that the Ova 250–486 fragment and the Ova 388–623 fragment were both able to interact with the chromo shadow domain (CSD) of HP1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>); neither of these Ova fragments could interact with the chromodomain (CD) of HP1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). We next constructed an Ova fragment composed of the overlapped 388–486 region and confirmed that this fragment was sufficient for interaction with the CSD domain of HP1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Mapping the interaction domains of Ova with dLsd1 revealed that both Ova 1–388 and Ova 250–486 fragments, but not Ova 388–486 fragment, could interact with dLsd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Interestingly, transgene expression of the Ova 250–486 fragment, which is able to interact with both HP1a and dLsd1, was sufficient to rescue both the ovary development defect and transposon silencing defect of <italic>ova</italic> mutant females, similar to the effect produced by transgene expression of a full length <italic>ova</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,f</xref>). In contrast, no rescue effect was observed with the transgenic expression of the Ova 388–623 fragment, which interacts with HP1a only, or with expression of the Ova 1–388 fragment, which interacts with dLsd1 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Therefore, the domain that is sufficient to interact with both HP1a and dLsd1 is sufficient for Ova function in ovary development and transposon silencing. These biochemical and genetic experiments indicate that Ova may serve as a protein adaptor that links HP1a and dLsd1. To functionally test this putative adaptor function in vivo, we generated a transgene expressing HP1a::dLsd1 fusion protein. If Ova merely functions as an adapter that bridges the two proteins, the HP1a::dLsd1 transgene should render Ova dispensable and therefore should be able to rescue the <italic>ova</italic> mutant phenotypes. Strikingly, transgenic expression of HP1a::dLsd1 in escort cells was sufficient to rescue the rudimentary ovary phenotype of <italic>ova</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Eighty percent of the HP1a::dLsd1 rescued germaria contained 2–5 GSC-l (n = 41) and all the germaria had properly differentiating cysts. Moreover, ubiquitous expression of HP1a::dLsd1 also significantly rescued the transposon silencing defects of <italic>ova</italic> mutants and partially restored female fertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Given that the genomic fragment transgene of <italic>ova</italic> (ova-g), which includes the cis-elements of <italic>ova</italic>, could fully restore fertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), the incomplete rescue of fertility by the HP1a::dLsd1 fusion could be due to non-physiological levels of the transgene expression. Alternatively, <italic>ova</italic> could have additional roles beyond the adaptor role that are important for female fertility. In addition to increased expression of transposons, <italic>ova</italic> germline mutant ovaries also showed moderate upregulation of many protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, this transgene expression also effectively brought the expression of many protein-coding genes back to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations indicate that HP1a and Ova may participate in transcriptional silencing of many regular protein-coding genes, in addition to transposons. We conclude that Ova acts as a protein adaptor to link HP1a and dLsd1 to promote HP1a-mediated gene silencing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40806.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ova acts as a protein adaptor to link dLsd1 with HP1a.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic drawings of full length and truncated forms of Ova.

Further analysis revealed that there was a significant increase in H3K4me2 levels and in RNA Pol II occupancy at the 3’UTR of the Het-A and TAHRE transposons in <italic>ova</italic> GLKD ovarian germline cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>).

To further test this potential role of Ova in linking H3K4 demethylation during HP1a-mediated gene silencing in vivo, we used a clean lacI/lacO reporter system to tether lacI-HP1a to the promoter of a lacO-GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sienski et al., 2015</xref>).

This should result in blocked transcription no matter whether a transcriptional activator/repressor is present or not. As expected, this reporter showed a significant reduction of baseline transcription (down to approximately 3.8%) (<italic>P</italic> value by two-tailed Student <italic>t</italic>-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>). We found that tethering lacI-HP1a to the promoter failed to alter the H3K4me2 level proximal to the tethering site. Co-expression of Ova, however, almost erased entirely the H3K4me2 marks in the proximal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g,h</xref>). These observations further support the notion that Ova links HP1a and dLsd1 for local erasing of H3K4me2 marks.</p><p>We also tested whether Ova itself can induce gene silencing by tethering Ova directly to DNA and to mRNA using in vivo reporter systems in the ovarian germline. We used a lacI-Ova and lacO-GFP binary system to tether Ova to genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sienski et al., 2015</xref>) and found that such tethering did not have any obvious effect on GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a–c</xref>). Similarly, tethering Ova to mRNA using a λN-Ova and GFP-boxB binary system did not cause any obvious effect on GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2d–f</xref>). These results are consistent with the idea that Ova acts downstream of HP1a in heterochromatic gene silencing.</p><p>Similar to other ‘effector step’ mutations, the loss of <italic>ova</italic> or <italic>dlsd1</italic> only causes de-repression of a subset of transposons; this is in contrast with the widespread transposon de-repression that is common in mutations affecting piRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czech et al., 2013</xref>). This disparity can possibly be explained by the existence of different silencing mechanisms for particular subsets of transposons. Illustrating this idea, our work suggests that transposons with bivalent histone marks may be preferential targets for Ova and dLsd1. A bivalent pattern of histone methylation may help to regulate the expression of transposons that require a delicate On/Off balance, for example with the expression of telomeric repeats known to be required for normal telomere function (e.g., Het-A, TAHRE, and Tart). The results of our study establishes that Ova has an indispensable role in facilitating dLsd1’s H3K4 demethylation activity during HP1a-induced heterochromatic gene silencing and demonstrates that this Ova function is essential for germline development, heterochromatin formation, and Piwi/piRNA-mediated co-transcriptional gene silencing. Our study suggests that the Piwi/piRNA pathway may adapt a similar effector machinery to repress regular genes, such as the <italic>dpp</italic> gene in escort cells, in addition to TEs. A study in <italic>S. pombe</italic> reported a mechanism in which a RNAi protein complex links the activity of the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 with H3K4 demethylation by the H3K4 demethylase Lid2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2008</xref>), indicating an evolutionarily conserved interplay of epigenetic marks during transcriptional gene silencing. Given that the mechanisms underlying heterochromatic gene silencing are known to be strongly conserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to mammals, an equivalent functional module that links HP1a with H3K4 demethylation likely exists in mammals as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

The membrane was developed by Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate Kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>RNA purification and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)</title><p>Total RNA from 10 to 20 ovaries was extracted using TRIzol reagent (TaKaRa). After DNase treatment, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using HiScript II Q RT SuperMix (Vazyme Biotech, R223-01). RT-qPCR was performed in three duplicates using ChamQ SYBR qPCR master Mix (Vazyme Biotech, Q331) on an ABI PRISM 7500 fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Fold changes for mRNA were calculated using the △△Ct method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Livak and Schmittgen, 2001</xref>). Primers used were shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>RNA sequencing and computational analysis</title><p>Total RNA from ovaries was isolated using TRIzol reagent (TaKaRa). 10 μg of total RNA from each sample used for library preparation after poly(A)-containing mRNA molecule purification (NEB, #S1419S), RNA amplification, double-strand cDNA synthesis, and adaptor ligation (NEB, #E7645S). For the small RNA sequencing, 10 μg enriched small RNA were separated on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and 18- to 30-nt RNAs were purified according to RNA oligo markers. All the libraries were prepared by following the manufacturer’s instructions and subsequent sequencing on the Illumina GAII instrument (Vazyme, NR801). For CDS gene expression analysis, all the sequencing reads were mapped to the D.mel genome (BDGP6) using STAR program (options: --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 --alignIntronMin 20 --alignIntronMax 500000). The mapped reads were used for expression analysis via Cufflinks package with reference gene annotation from Ensembl. And Cuffdiff was used to perform differential expression. For transposon expression analysis, sequencing reads were mapped to the transposon sequences which download from flybase website using STAR program with default parameters. Then alignment reads were used for calculating the expression level of transposons. Different transposons were combined together if they belong to the same one. The expression levels were normalized to reads per million (RPM). For small RNA analysis, Cutadapt package was used to remove adapter from 3’ end. The reads were aligned to the genome sequence by Bowtie. The reads were discarded which mapped to rRNA, tRNA, snoRNA sequences. And retained reads were aligned to miRNA (pre-miRNA sequences download from miRBase) and whole genome sequences (r5.42) with one mismatch and unique hit. Sequences in the 25–32 nt size range, not annotated as a previously known RNA were classified as candidate piRNAs. The expression levels of small RNA were normalized to RPM according to the total mapped reads number.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>ChIP-seq analysis</title><p>ChIP was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, about 200 pairs of ovaries were dissected into cold PBS and washed once. Ovaries were cross-linked in 1.8% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature then quenched with glycine. Ovaries were homogenized by douncing. Pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer and incubated 10 min on ice. Chromatin was sonicated for immunoprecipitation and followed by reverse crosslink and DNA purification. Recovered DNA fragment was used to prepare libraries using VAHTS Universal DNA Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, ND607) and TruePrep Index Kit (Vazyme Biotech, TD202) sequencing was done on HiSeq2500 (Illumina). Antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-H3K4me2 (Abcam, ab7766) and monoclonal mouse anti-RNA polymerase II (Abcam, ab817). ChIP-seq reads were aligned using Bowtie (version 1.1.2) to build version BDGP6 of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. MACS (version 1.4.1) was used to identify regions of ChIP-seq enrichment. The density of reads in each region was normalized to 10 million reads library size. For lacO-GFP ChIP-seq, normalized reads were removed <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> ChIP reads as the reporter unique mapped reads due to lacO-GFP reporter shared common sequences in fly genome. BigWig files were generated for visualization using Homer package. For transposons, all raw reads were mapped to the transposon database using Bowtie (version 1.1.2) with –v 3 –-best parameters. The sum of the number reads that mapped to genome and transposon was used as a normalization factor for all samples, reporting all feature abundances as RPM mapped.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of the fly community as cited in the Materials and Methods for generously providing fly stocks and antibodies, the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center, Vienna Drosophila Stock Center, Tsinghua Fly Center, and Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB) for reagents, Dr. Bing Zhu for reading of the manuscript, and Drs.

Whereas individual experiments are well-done overall, all reviewers are concerned that the results do not necessarily support a cohesive story at this point. Specifically, the effects in the soma vs. germline on overall sterility remains unclear, and accordingly, the impact/relevance of transposon activation in ova- on sterility is unclear. (The detailed, specific individual comments are provided below.)</p><p>Whereas all the reviewers appreciate the potential impact of this manuscript, these major concerns would be normally deemed 'not within the scope of straightforward revision' per <italic>eLife</italic>'s policy. Thus, we encourage the authors to thoroughly address the major points raised by reviewers in revising this manuscript.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Yang and colleagues identified a new factor, Ovaries absent (Ova), which is required for maintaining the fertility of female fruit fly. Molecularly, this factor bridges H3K4 demethylase dLsd1 and HP1a together for heterochromatic silencing. At cellular level, the authors propose: 1) Ova functions in somatic escort cells to maintain the niche environment for germline stem cell differentiation by suppressing dpp signaling; 2) in germ cells, Ova promotes transposon silencing (only a subgroup of transposons) during oogenesis. The authors use a broad range of techniques (from genetics, biochemistry, cell biology), and the conclusions are overall convincing and interesting. I particularly think that the &quot;rescuing&quot; experiment by HP1a::dLsd1-fusion is elegant and compelling.</p><p>Here I suggest a few further experiments/explanations that can further strengthen this story:</p><p>1) I still do not understand in germ cells, how Ova is required for fertility. Is this exclusively caused by the activation of telomeric transposons? Or there are additional triggers? Since the HP1a::dLsd1 fusion can rescue the transposon de-repression, the authors should look and report the fertility of these &quot;rescued&quot; flies.</p><p>2) I feel the wm4h section is distracting and unnecessary in this story. Wm4h model is sensitive to genetic background, and likely reflects epigenetic regulation during eye development. I think it would be wise to focus on oogenesis for this story. With wm4h data, the readers (like me) would ask questions regarding how epigenetic marks maintained/passed through generations in somatic cells.</p><p>3) The qPCR results (panel T of Figure 1) on dpp are not conclusive and (again) unnecessary. The panels N-S of Figure 1 already provide compelling data at protein level in early germarium. I am assuming the qPCR data (panel T) are from the RNAs extracted from whole ovaries, which are mainly from the late stage egg chambers. Therefore, the RNA data (from late stage egg chambers) could not explain the change of protein level in germarium. Also, I am confused what is ova-RNAi in panel T. Is this c578 driven RNAi or nanos driven? The authors need to explain in figure legend.</p><p>4) The authors mentioned that Ova was identified from a genetic screen. But there is no information provided on this screen.</p><p>5) The ChIP-seq data currently only reported the K4me2 deposition on two transposons. How about the K4me2 level on other transposons and other genomic regions?</p><p>6) How about the HP1a and dLsd1 localization upon Ova depletion?</p><p>7) In Figure 4—figure supplement 1, what is the genotype of ova germline mutant (again, the figure legends are not informative, need to revise)? Are ovaries from these flies normal or rudimentary? If rudimentary, given the dramatic difference of ovary structure, it does not make sense to compare them with WT ovaries.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Typos in main text paragraph seven: &quot;of in&quot; and &quot;Figure A&quot;.</p><p>Main text paragraph eleven: &quot;80.43%&quot;. I think the number has to be written as words at the beginning of a sentence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Yang and colleagues described a new factor required for adult ovary development in flies. Through an EMS screen, they uncovered a recessive mutation in the CG5694/ova gene, which led to drastic ovarian phenotype reminiscent of that observed in piwi mutants. Similar to Piwi, Ova is required in both ovarian somatic and germ cells, and somatic tissues depleted for Ova fail to support germline stem cell (GSC) differentiation. Importantly, the authors provided evidence that over-expression of Ova in ovarian somatic cells was able to partially rescue the phenotypic defects induced by piwi mutants, indicating that both genes genetically interact. By using two-hybrid experiments, the authors provided convincing evidence that Ova can physically interact with HP1a and Lsd1, two chromatin factors involved in establishing silence chromatin. In agreement, they showed that Ova is required for the spreading of heterochromatin in somatic tissues. Finally, by using transgenic reporters and tethering experiments, the authors provided evidence that Ova recruitment to an HP1a-bound reporter locus is sufficient to locally induce H3K4 demethylation – and activity that is mediated by Lsd1.</p><p>The antagonism between H3K4 and H3K9 methylation is pervasive throughout evolution, and the balance between activities promoting each of these marks is essential for proper genome regulation. The manuscript – which is clearly presented and well written – provides strong evidence that Ova can act as a linker between the H3K9me2/3 reader HP1a and the enzyme responsible for the removal of H3K4 methylation, proposing an interesting molecular mechanism for heterochromatic establishment.</p><p>Major comment:</p><p>Transposable elements are a major target of H3K9me2/3-mediated repression mechanisms in both soma and germline. However, in the current version, the experiment testing the effect of loss of ova on transposon repression is poorly documented (Figure 3E-F). Given the importance of such analysis for the conclusion of the manuscript, I believe this needs to be better characterized.</p><p>Basically, the evidence that Ova mediates transposon silencing is provided by germline KD experiments (Figure 3E), in which the nanos-GAL4 driver is used in combination with an UAS-RNAi line for the ova gene. RNA-seq results obtained from nanos-GAL4&gt;ova-RNAi ovaries were compared to w[1118] ovaries, suggesting the upregulation of a limited number of TE families (basically the telomeric-associated Het-A, TAHRE, and TART families). First, it is well-established in the literature that germline KD using UAS-RNAi lines originated from the VDRC collection (such as the ova-RNAi line) requires the concomitant over-expression of Drc2 (using the UAS-Dcr2 transgene; Wang and Elgin, 2011; Handler et al., 2011; Czech et al., 2013; Handler et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2014; Sanchez et al., 2016; among others). Despite that, no mention to the use of the UAS-Drc2 transgene was seen in the main text or in the Materials and methods section – the authors need to clarify this point. Second, given the existing variation on transposon content in different stock backgrounds (especially true for the telomeric transposons), it is important to compare the results from ova-RNAi ovaries to appropriate control-RNAi samples (this is also valid for the lsd1-RNAi analysis). Finally, given the requirement of ova in somatic tissues, it would be important to determine whether the same specific regulation (restricted to telomeric-associated transposons) is observed in the soma (by using tj-Gal4 or C587-Gal4 drivers to induce somatic KD).</p><p>Along the same line, it would be very important to determine whether TE-family-specific changes in piRNA accumulation can be detected in Ova germline KD experiments (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B). As it is currently presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 3B, the results indicate that Ova is not required for global piRNA production, but it is nonetheless possible that it is involved in the accumulation of piRNAs for telomeric-associated transposons. Similar to the analysis presented in Figure 3E (RNA-seq), it would be good if the authors could expand the analysis on piRNA accumulation to each individual TE family (using the existing data).</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) While introducing the process leading to the Piwi/piRNA-mediated recruitment of the silencing machinery in the first paragraph of the main text, the authors mentioned that HP1 binds to Su(var)3-9. While it has been shown that HP1 and Su(var)3-9 physically interact and cooperate in the maintenance and spreading of heterochromatic domains (mostly centromeric heterochromatin) in somatic tissues (Schotta et al., 2002), there's no evidence to date that Su(var)3-9 is involved in Piwi-mediated silencing. To the contrary, Sienski et al., 2015, has recently provided substantial data indicating that SetDB1, but not Su(var)3-9, is involved in Piwi-mediated establishment of silent chromatin. In this context, I suggest the authors revise the text to make this distinction clear to readers.</p><p>2) Given the origin of the ova[1] allele (EMS-screen) and the rather strong and specific effect on male viability, it would be useful if the authors could include the viability data for ova[1]/ova[4] trans-heterozygous in Table S1. As it is, it is not clear whether the viability defect is due to ova or to other second-site mutations induced by the EMS-mutagenesis.</p><p>3) Main text paragraph eight, in the first sentence, it should be noticed that Piwi mediates transposon silencing in both soma and germline (and not only in the germline). Most important however, while it has been shown that loss of piwi in somatic cells is associated with ectopic dpp signalling (Jin et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2014), I am under the impression that the formal demonstration that this effect is direct – and that it involves gene silencing mediated by Piwi or piRNAs – is still missing. Could the authors clarify this point?</p><p>4) In paragraph ten, the authors state that &quot;ova and lsd1 mutants exhibited de-repression of a similar subset of transposons&quot; (Figure 3F). However, the analysis on Figure 3 seems to concern germline KDs, and not mutants – please clarify.</p><p>5) In the Materials and methods section, please verify the source of the ova-RNAi line: it is listed as a BDSC stock, but it seems like it was in fact obtained from the VDRC collection. Please also include the source of the lsd1-RNAi line, as it is not currently listed in the Materials and methods section. Finally, clarify whether or not the UAS-Dcr2 transgene was used in the germline KD analysis.</p><p>6) In subsection “RNA sequencing and computational analysis”, please indicate the manufacture and kits used to generate the small RNA- and RNA-seq libraries.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In Yang et al., the authors generate mutants for ovaries absent (Ova) a previously identified gene in the piRNA pathway and characterize its function. They show (1) Ova is required in the somatic escort cells for germline stem cell differentiation and in the germ line for fertility, (2) Ova acts downstream of Piwi, (3) Interacts with HP1 and dLsd1 regulators of heterochromatin formation and promotes association of HP1a and dLsd1 and (4) Can induce HP1a induced demethylation. I have some major concerns about this paper: (1) The authors switch between germ line function and somatic function without explanation, (2) the phenotypes are not clearly characterized, (3) Some of the controls for the experiments they have carried out are not correct in that they compare ovaries that have late stage egg chambers to ovaries that accumulate undifferentiated cells and (4) changes in ChIPSeq are modest at the best and are not quantitated, and I am not sure are statistically significant.</p><p>Lastly, the model is confusing. The current dogma is that demethylation of H3K4 results loss of K9ac. This then promotes methylation of K9 and which then recruits HP1. In Yang et al's model, how do they propose HP1 can get to its targets in the first place? This needs to clearly explained. I suspect, Ova should affect heterochromatin spreading not formation of heterochromatin. This is something they have not tested nor propose.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>Figure 1A-D: The authors have used Ova1/4 in all the rescues including Figure 1 and 2. They should include the phenotypic characterization of this allelic combination in this figure panel.</p><p>Figure 1F-G: This panel needs better pictures as even the &quot;germless&quot; germaria usually stain of anti-spectrin antibody. All the pictures need to be at the same magnification for easy comparison.</p><p>Figure 1J-K: The controls should include the non-restrictive temperature and well as C587 at the restrictive temperature at 14 days. 14 days is a long time for restrictive temperature. What happens in 5 -7 days? Also, what happens to protrusions? The idea about protrusions were introduced but then not followed up on.</p><p>Figure 1M: Again, please include controls for ova4</p><p>Figure 1N-S: Please include quantitation for all these phenotypes. As they show a link to piwi and piwi mutant phenotype is quite complicated, they should categorize Ova phenotype in detail.</p><p>Figure 1T: They should not use C587 as a control as this is comparing completely morphologically different ovaries. One enriches for the earlier stages and the other for later stages. They should use bam mutants as a control. Additionally, they should show the RNA seq data and tracks for these experiments for Dpp levels – these data are available to them.</p><p>They also report that loss of ova in germ line results in eggs that do not hatch as data not shown. They should report the data.</p><p>Figure 2: While the results that over expression of ova in piwi mutant ovaries is exciting they should better characterize what aspect of the piwi mutant does this protein rescue? Are the transposons levels in piwi rescued? What about protrusions? What about Dpp levels? What about Ova germ line expression in piwi mutants? Does it rescue loss of fertility in piwi mutants as well? This is important as they switch from somatic effects to germ line effects.</p><p>Figure 3: What happens to heterochromatin levels in ova mutants during oogenesis? Can they stain for H3K9me3 marks?</p><p>Figure 3E: Why are the authors looking for only upregulation of transposons in the germ line when the phenotype is mostly from the soma? They should report transposon levels in somatic loss of function of ova. As the major phenotype of piwi, dlsd1 and ova are from the escort cells. They should carry out an RNAseq for this and report the transposons upregulated in the soma.</p><p>Figure 4: In this figure, the authors switch back and forth between the somatic effects and germ line. This is not right. They should be direct that for expediency they use germ line as a read out. They should set up the paper that way as well. The paper reads as if one is discovering the role of Ova in escort cells whereas most of the functional data comes from the germ line. For example 4D vs 4F, in D they are using somatic drivers and in F they use a ubiquitous driver and measure germ line effects.</p><p>Figure 4F: Again, using <italic>w1118</italic> as control is not right. One does not know if the undifferentiated stages express Het-A and TAHRE at higher levels compared to control. Again, the control and experiment are comparing two different morphologically different ovaries.</p><p>Figure 5A: Is this germ line or somatic KD? The authors should clearly state this. It is not available in text of figure legends. I assume it is germ line KD. How does this change compare with the genes that are not affected? Is there any quantification for these changes? I am not sure these changes 0-0.75 are real?</p><p>There should be quantification for panels A, E and F.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40806.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Whereas all the reviewers appreciate the potential impact of this manuscript, these major concerns would be normally deemed 'not within the scope of straightforward revision' per eLife's policy.

The effect on PEV is also found in several other PEV models in which the white gene is inserted on the fourth chromosome (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).

H3K4me2 density is increased in Het-A and TAHRE loci, but not in the majority of other transposons.

The manuscript – which is clearly presented and well written – provides strong evidence that Ova can act as a linker between the H3K9me2/3 reader HP1a and the enzyme responsible for the removal of H3K4 methylation, proposing an interesting molecular mechanism for heterochromatic establishment.</p><p>Major comment:</p><p>Transposable elements are a major target of H3K9me2/3-mediated repression mechanisms in both soma and germline. However, in the current version, the experiment testing the effect of loss of ova on transposon repression is poorly documented (Figure 3E-F). Given the importance of such analysis for the conclusion of the manuscript, I believe this needs to be better characterized.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We have tried several times for ChIP-seq analysis of H3K9me2/3 from wild type and germline mutant ovaries, but unfortunately we failed to get any high quality data. This part of the analysis has therefore been hampered by the technical difficulties that we have encountered. We immunostained H3K9me3 in ovary tissues to see if there is a global change in H3K9me3 levels, and we failed to observe any obvious alterations in H3K9me3 expression in the germline cells with <italic>ova</italic> GLKD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Basically, the evidence that Ova mediates transposon silencing is provided by germline KD experiments (Figure 3E), in which the nanos-GAL4 driver is used in combination with an UAS-RNAi line for the ova gene. RNA-seq results obtained from nanos-GAL4&gt;ova-RNAi ovaries were compared to w[1118] ovaries, suggesting the upregulation of a limited number of TE families (basically the telomeric-associated Het-A, TAHRE, and TART families). First, it is well-established in the literature that germline KD using UAS-RNAi lines originated from the VDRC collection (such as the ova-RNAi line) requires the concomitant over-expression of Drc2 (using the UAS-Dcr2 transgene; Wang and Elgin, 2011; Handler et al., 2011; Czech et al., 2013; Handler et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2014; Sanchez et al., 2016; among others). Despite that, no mention to the use of the UAS-Drc2 transgene was seen in the main text or in the Materials and methods section – the authors need to clarify this point. Second, given the existing variation on transposon content in different stock backgrounds (especially true for the telomeric transposons), it is important to compare the results from ova-RNAi ovaries to appropriate control-RNAi samples (this is also valid for the lsd1-RNAi analysis). Finally, given the requirement of ova in somatic tissues, it would be important to determine whether the same specific regulation (restricted to telomeric-associated transposons) is observed in the soma (by using tj-Gal4 or C587-Gal4 drivers to induce somatic KD).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s points and apologize for not clearly describing our methods. We indeed used the BSC#25751 fly, whose genotype is UAS-Dcr2;nosGAL4 (referred as &quot;GLKD&quot; throughout the updated manuscript). We compared the <italic>w1118, ova RNAi</italic> alone, and UAS-Dcr2;nosGAL4 ovaries by qPCR and found no obvious difference among them, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>. We used tjGAL4 to knock down ova and found that TE mRNA levels only mildly increased (not statistically significant) compared to the controls, as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 3F. It is possible that the upregulation has been underestimated because we used the whole ovary for RNA analysis, but it appears to us that the transposon derepression phenotype is much more profound in the germline than in the soma following ova depletion.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>qPCR to detect TE levels in controls and <italic>ova</italic> GLKD ovaries.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40806-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the same line, it would be very important to determine whether TE-family-specific changes in piRNA accumulation can be detected in Ova germline KD experiments (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B). As it is currently presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 3B, the results indicate that Ova is not required for global piRNA production, but it is nonetheless possible that it is involved in the accumulation of piRNAs for telomeric-associated transposons. Similar to the analysis presented in Figure 3E (RNA-seq), it would be good if the authors could expand the analysis on piRNA accumulation to each individual TE family (using the existing data).</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. Guided by this suggestion, we performed the analysis of the piRNA accumulation in each TE-specific piRNAs, and found that most TE-specific piRNAs are also unchanged in <italic>ova</italic> RNAi ovaries compared to control ones, excepting a mild reduction in Tart-specific piRNAs. This new data is included in the updated Figure 3—figure supplement 3E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) While introducing the process leading to the Piwi/piRNA-mediated recruitment of the silencing machinery in the first paragraph of the main text, the authors mentioned that HP1 binds to Su(var)3-9. While it has been shown that HP1 and Su(var)3-9 physically interact and cooperate in the maintenance and spreading of heterochromatic domains (mostly centromeric heterochromatin) in somatic tissues (Schotta et al., 2002), there's no evidence to date that Su(var)3-9 is involved in Piwi-mediated silencing. To the contrary, Sienski et al., 2015, has recently provided substantial data indicating that SetDB1, but not Su(var)3-9, is involved in Piwi-mediated establishment of silent chromatin. In this context, I suggest the authors revise the text to make this distinction clear to readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this input. We have revised the introduction accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the origin of the ova[1] allele (EMS-screen) and the rather strong and specific effect on male viability, it would be useful if the authors could include the viability data for ova[1]/ova[4] trans-heterozygous in Table S1. As it is, it is not clear whether the viability defect is due to ova or to other second-site mutations induced by the EMS-mutagenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the <italic>ova[1]/ova[4]</italic> viability in updated Table S1. Similar to <italic>ova[1]</italic> homozygous flies, <italic>ova[1]/ova[4]</italic> is semi-lethal for male.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Main text paragraph eight, in the first sentence, it should be noticed that Piwi mediates transposon silencing in both soma and germline (and not only in the germline). Most important however, while it has been shown that loss of piwi in somatic cells is associated with ectopic dpp signalling (Jin et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2014), I am under the impression that the formal demonstration that this effect is direct – and that it involves gene silencing mediated by Piwi or piRNAs – is still missing. Could the authors clarify this point?</p></disp-quote><p>Great point. Consistent with previous reports, we have knocked down two well-known piRNA pathway genes, <italic>piwi</italic> and <italic>panx</italic>, in escort cells and found that they have similar phenotypes with <italic>ova</italic> (Figure 2D, E). Together with the finding that HP1a::dLsd1 fusion protein could render <italic>ova</italic> dispensable for germline differentiation, we believe that the Piwi pathway adapts a similar effector machinery to repress <italic>dpp</italic> and TEs in escort cells. We agree that although many observations are consistent with the idea that <italic>dpp</italic> in escort cells is silenced by piRNA-mediated gene silencing machinery, the direct evidence, such as direct binding of Piwi or Ova to the <italic>dpp</italic> locus, is still lacking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In paragraph ten, the authors state that &quot;ova and lsd1 mutants exhibited de-repression of a similar subset of transposons&quot; (Figure 3F). However, the analysis on Figure 3 seems to concern germline KDs, and not mutants – please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Both of them are germline-specific RNAi using UAS-Dcr2; nosGAL4 (referred as GLKD). We have modified our statements as “germline specific knock-down of <italic>ova</italic> and <italic>dlsd1</italic> exhibited de-repression of a similar subset of transposons”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the Materials and methods section, please verify the source of the ova-RNAi line: it is listed as a BDSC stock, but it seems like it was in fact obtained from the VDRC collection. Please also include the source of the lsd1-RNAi line, as it is not currently listed in the Materials and methods section. Finally, clarify whether or not the UAS-Dcr2 transgene was used in the germline KD analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added all the missing information in the Materials and methods section. Note that all the germline-specific RNAi were performed using UAS-Dcr2; nosGAL4 (referred as GLKD throughout the manuscript), and we have updated this information in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In subsection “RNA sequencing and computational analysis”, please indicate the manufacture and kits used to generate the small RNA- and RNA-seq libraries.</p></disp-quote><p>We used Oligo d(T)25 magnetic beads (NEB, #S1419S) to purify mRNA and NEBNext ultra DNA library prep kits for Illumina (NEB, #E7645S) to generate the library. For small RNA library, we used a VAHTS small RNA library prep kit for Illumina (Vazyme, NR801). We have updated this information in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Yang et al., the authors generate mutants for ovaries absent (Ova) a previously identified gene in the piRNA pathway and characterize its function. They show (1) Ova is required in the somatic escort cells for germline stem cell differentiation and in the germ line for fertility, (2) Ova acts downstream of Piwi, (3) Interacts with HP1 and dLsd1 regulators of heterochromatin formation and promotes association of HP1a and dLsd1 and (4) Can induce HP1a induced demethylation. I have some major concerns about this paper: (1) The authors switch between germ line function and somatic function without explanation, (2) the phenotypes are not clearly characterized, (3) Some of the controls for the experiments they have carried out are not correct in that they compare ovaries that have late stage egg chambers to ovaries that accumulate undifferentiated cells and (4) changes in ChIPSeq are modest at the best and are not quantitated, and I am not sure are statistically significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for the thoughtful comments. We will give a brief response here, and detailed responses below in our point-by-point responses. We admit that we mixed descriptions of both germline and somatic functions of <italic>ova</italic> in our study, and this could potentially cause confusion. However, we believe that our phenotype analysis from both somatic and germline cells is a reasonable approach to reveal the basic mechanism of Piwi/piRNA pathway genes. Piwi, the founding member of the Piwi/piRNA pathway, has been demonstrated to have different functions in somatic cells and germline cells. The phenotypes caused by soma and germline-specific depletion of <italic>piwi</italic> are very similar to those caused by the <italic>ova</italic> depletion that we report here. Our mechanistic study reveals that the molecular function of Ova is to link HP1a and dLsd1; consider that the HP1a::dLsd1 fusion protein could rescue both TE and GSC defects. We believe that our study provides a first solid step towards a unified explanation of soma and germline phenotypes caused by the Piwi/piRNA pathway mutations: specifically, Piwi/piRNAs, through recruiting heterochromatic silencing machinery, repress TEs in the germline, and represses regular genes (especially <italic>dpp</italic>) in the somatic escort cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, the model is confusing. The current dogma is that demethylation of H3K4 results loss of K9ac. This then promotes methylation of K9 and which then recruits HP1. In Yang et al's model, how do they propose HP1 can get to its targets in the first place? This needs to clearly explained. I suspect, Ova should affect heterochromatin spreading not formation of heterochromatin. This is something they have not tested nor propose.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe what the reviewer is here indicating a general mechanism for heterochromatin establishment (Rudolph et al., 2007). We would note that other studies have shown that bivalent markers (active H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3) can be simultaneously present in small genomic regions (e.g., some TEs as in Bernastein <italic>et al.</italic>, (2006); Voigt et al., 2012). In 2015, two studies showed that TEs are co-transcriptionally silenced, and Piwi/piRNA can recruit dLsd1 and Egg for H3K4 demethylation in the promoter region and spread H3K9 methyl downstream of TE body region (Yu et al., 2015; Sienski et al., 2015). In our study, we show that Ova is required for heterochromatic silencing. Meanwhile, <italic>ova</italic> GLKD leads to an increase in the H3K4me2 level at the promoter regions of TEs. In a lacO-GFP reporter assay, we observed that Ova recruitment alone fails to silence the GFP reporter. However, with pre-deposited HP1a to the lacO sites, <italic>ova</italic> overexpression could lead to local H3K4me2 reduction and silencing of the GFP reporter. Results from our co-IP, Y2H, and truncated/ chimeric transgenes experiments suggest that Ova acts as a linker between HP1a and dLsd1. Collectively, our data suggest that Ova acts downstream of HP1a to recruit dLsd1 for local H3K4 demethylation and heterochromatic silencing. This epigenetic connection seems to be evolutionarily conserved, as physical and functional links between H3K4 demethylation and H3K9 methylation have also been reported in yeast (Li et al., 2008).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>Figure 1A-D: The authors have used Ova1/4 in all the rescues including figure 1 and 2.

Does it rescue loss of fertility in piwi mutants as well? This is important as they switch from somatic effects to germ line effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Ova expression in <italic>piwi</italic> mutants (both c587-GAL4 and tub-GAL4) could moderately rescue the oogenesis defects of <italic>piwi</italic> mutants. As shown in the added Figure 2C, escort cell overexpression of <italic>ova</italic> in <italic>piwi</italic> mutant ovaries could bring frequent appearance of developing germline cysts that can be developed into late stage egg chambers. However, the GSC-like tumors still exit (see arrow in Figure 2C). In addition, ubiquitous overexpression of <italic>ova</italic> fails to rescue the TE depression phenotype in <italic>piwi</italic> germline mutants. Therefore, although <italic>ova</italic> appears to be genetically downstream of <italic>piwi</italic>, there must be additional factors downstream of <italic>piwi</italic> that cooperatively function with <italic>ova</italic> to mediate heterochromatic gene silencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: What happens to heterochromatin levels in ova mutants during oogenesis?

However, genome-wide H3K9me3 ChIP-seq experiments will need to be done in the future to confirmatively draw this conclusion.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>H3K9me3 expression in control and ova GLKD germaria.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40806-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3E: Why are the authors looking for only upregulation of transposons in the germ line when the phenotype is mostly from the soma?
