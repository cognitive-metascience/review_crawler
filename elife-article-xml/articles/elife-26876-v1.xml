Yet, mammalian cells carrying Rb deletions are still able to arrest under growth-limiting conditions. The Rb-related proteins p107 and p130, which are components of the DREAM complex, had been suggested to be responsible for a continued ability to arrest by inhibiting E2f activity and by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes. Here, we show that p130 and p107 are not sufficient for DREAM-dependent repression. We identify the MuvB protein Lin37 as an essential factor for DREAM function. Cells not expressing Lin37 proliferate normally, but DREAM completely loses its ability to repress genes in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> while all remaining subunits, including p130/p107, still bind to target gene promoters. Furthermore, cells lacking both Rb and Lin37 are incapable of exiting the cell cycle. Thus, Lin37 is an essential component of DREAM that cooperates with Rb to induce quiescence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell cycle regulation</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>cell cycle exit</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MU 3798/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Gerd A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ICGC-Data Mining 01KU1505-C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhart</surname><given-names>Stephan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lin37 is essential for cell-cycle gene repression by the DREAM complex in cellular quiescence and a combined loss of Lin37 and Rb prevents cell-cycle exit in response to growth-limiting signals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The retinoblastoma protein Rb regulates cell cycle-dependent gene expression and is mutated in many cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</xref>). Rb and the related proteins p130 and p107 are members of the pocket protein family. All of them interact with E2f proteins to form complexes that repress expression of genes necessary for cell cycle progression in G<sub>0</sub> and early G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Classon and Dyson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Classon and Harlow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cobrinik, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dick and Rubin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</xref>). Rb preferentially interacts with E2f1-3, and p130/p107 mainly bind to E2f4/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Helin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lees et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liban et al., 2017</xref>). p107 or p130 are components of the DREAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guiley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Litovchick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pilkinton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmit et al., 2007</xref>). While DREAM binds and represses cell cycle genes with maximal expression in S, G<sub>2</sub>, and M phases through E2F and CHR promoter elements, E2f-Rb complexes cannot bind to CHR sites. However, they can interact with E2F binding sites of S phase genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Litovchick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hurford et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Müller et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, Rb and p130/p107 have overlapping, but also clearly distinct functions in the repression of cell cycle genes.</p><p>Pocket protein triple knockout cells can proliferate, but are unable to exit the cell cycle under growth-limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dannenberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sage et al., 2000</xref>).

It was suggested that pocket proteins can substitute for each other in repressing E2f function and recruiting histone-modifying enzymes to promoters of cell cycle genes. After it was discovered that p130 or p107 bind to cell cycle gene promoters as part of DREAM in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Litovchick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmit et al., 2007</xref>), it remained unclear whether MuvB components of DREAM contribute to the repressor function.</p><p>The MuvB core complex consists of Lin54, Lin52, Lin37, Lin9, and Rbbp4. The p130/p107-E2f4/5-Dp module is recruited to the MuvB core through a direct interaction of p130/p107 with Lin52 phosphorylated at Serine 28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guiley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Litovchick et al., 2011</xref>). Lin54 mediates binding of MuvB complexes to DNA through CHR promoter elements of G<sub>2</sub>/M cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmit et al., 2009</xref>), and E2f4/5-Dp interact with E2F sites in promoters of G<sub>1</sub>/S genes. Because of its binding to E2F and CHR sites, DREAM is recruited to a broad set of cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Litovchick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Müller et al., 2016</xref>). Since Lin9 binds to several MuvB complex proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wiseman et al., 2015</xref>), it seems to be the central structural component of MuvB complexes. Rbbp4 can bind to histones and is involved in chromatin remodeling while being a component of other complexes like NuRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tong et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>), however, its exact function as part of MuvB complexes still has to be evaluated.</p><p>During progression through the cell cycle, p130/p107, E2f4/5, and Dp dissociate from MuvB. The MuvB core complex then interacts with B-myb and Foxm1 and switches its function from a transcriptional repressor to an activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Litovchick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sadasivam et al., 2012</xref>). The B-myb-MuvB (MMB) complex forms in S phase, and is required for initial transcriptional activation and for recruiting Foxm1. Finally, the Foxm1-MuvB complex stimulates maximum expression of G<sub>2</sub>/M cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sadasivam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Down et al., 2012</xref>). Mutation or reduced expression of Foxm1 or B-myb lead to decreased expression levels of G<sub>2</sub>/M genes followed by defects and cellular arrest during mitotis and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tarasov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laoukili et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knight et al., 2009</xref>). Similar observations were made for several MuvB proteins. Since they are components of the transcriptional repressor and activator complexes, depletion of Lin9, Lin52, or Lin54 leads to elevated cell cycle gene expression in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Litovchick et al., 2007</xref>), but also to reduced expression during S, G<sub>2</sub>, and M followed by mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knight et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boichuk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kittler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reichert et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Lin37 is the only MuvB component without a defined role in transcription or generally in cell cycle regulation. Thus, we created and analyzed Lin37-deficient cells. We find that <italic>Lin37<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells proliferate normally. However, DREAM no longer acts as a transcriptional repressor in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>. In contrast, activation of transcription by MMB and Foxm1-MuvB complexes still functions in Lin37-deficient cells. Interestingly, DREAM without Lin37 can still assemble and bind to promoters. Hence, recruitment of p130 or p107 pocket proteins is not sufficient for cell cycle gene repression. Furthermore, we show that <italic>Lin37<sup>−/−</sup>/Rb<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells are essentially unable to exit the cell cycle. In conclusion, our data suggest that Lin37 as a part of DREAM cooperates with Rb in initiating quiescence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lin37 is a nuclear protein that binds to MuvB complexes through two conserved domains</title><p>We aligned Lin37 protein sequences of several deuterostome species to identify evolutionary conserved regions that may exhibit specific functions. The sequence analysis revealed that Lin37 does not contain any conserved domains with known function. Lin37 is highly conserved in mammals, but poorly conserved in deuterostomes. However, three small conserved regions in the central part of the protein could be identified: a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) and two adjacent conserved domains (CD1 and CD2) that are separated by a spacer of eight weakly conserved amino acids. To analyze the impact of the domains, we introduced point mutations changing the amino acid composition at two or three positions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given that Lin37 has been identified as a component of MuvB complexes in several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadasivam and DeCaprio, 2013</xref>), we hypothesized that the interaction of Lin37 with the other MuvB core proteins may rely on the conserved domains CD1 or CD2. Indeed, mutation of CD1 or CD2 leads to reduced binding to Lin9, Lin54 and B-myb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Binding was essentially lost when both domains were mutated simultaneously, providing evidence that both domains mediate binding of Lin37 to the MuvB core complex. GFP-tagged Lin37 was clearly localized to the nucleus, while mutation of the NLS resulted in a homogeneous protein distribution in the cell. In contrast, mutation of CD1 and CD2 domains did not influence subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, proper nuclear import of Lin37 depends on the NLS, but not on the interaction with MuvB.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26876.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conserved sequences in LIN37 are essential for nuclear localization and interaction with MuvB complex components.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure and evolutionary conservation of Lin37.

To this end, we performed luciferase reporter assays with promoters of known DREAM target genes. In serum-starved NIH3T3 wild-type cells, activity of DREAM target promoters was up-regulated when the E2F binding sites (<italic>Orc1</italic>, <italic>Cdc45</italic>) or the CHRs (<italic>Ttk</italic>, <italic>Ccnb2</italic>) were mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Because DREAM cannot bind and repress these promoters anymore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Müller et al., 2016</xref>), the increase in activity reflects complete loss of DREAM function at each specific promoter. Notably, mutating the CHR in the <italic>Ttk</italic> promoter led to an increase in activity of merely 2-fold in knockout cells compared to 136-fold in Lin37 wild-type cells. Furthermore, the <italic>Ccnb2</italic> CHR mutant promoter displayed even slightly less activity than the wild-type promoter in <italic>Lin37<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells. Activities of <italic>Cdc45</italic> wild-type and E2F-site mutant promoters were not significantly different in Lin37 knockout cells, while mutating the E2F binding site in the <italic>Orc1</italic> promoter still increased activity 2.7-fold in the absence of Lin37. Importantly, repression of all wild-type promoters could completely be restored when a Lin37 expression plasmid was co-transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As mutation of CHR sites, which exclusively bind DREAM but not E2F/Rb in repressed promoters, did not significantly increase gene expression in Lin37 knockout cells, we conclude that activity of DREAM is completely lost in these cells. We propose that the small but significant increase of <italic>Orc1</italic> activity upon E2F site mutation relates to E2f/Rb repressor complexes that bind to E2F elements and are still active in Lin37 knockout cells. Together, these results strongly suggest that DREAM is essential for repression of cell cycle genes through CHR and E2F sites in quiescence and that loss of DREAM activity is not compensated by other repressor complexes.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26876.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Knockout of Lin37 leads to a de-repression of cell cycle gene promoters in quiescence.</title><p>Wild-type (WT) or Lin37 knockout cells (Lin37-KO; clone 632–2) were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs of G<sub>1</sub>/S (yellow) and G<sub>2</sub>/M (blue) cell cycle gene promoters.

Additionally, expression of more than one third of cell cycle genes de-repressed in <italic>Lin37<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells displayed peak expression in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and can bind DREAM though E2F sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Knockout of Lin37 leads to a complete loss of DREAM function. However, the mechanism beyond the key function of Lin37 in transcriptional repression by DREAM is still unclear. The pocket proteins p130/p107 can recruit chromatin-modifying enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Classon and Dyson, 2001</xref>) which may support a compact nucleosome structure leading to gene repression. Combined knockdown of both proteins leads to a loss of DREAM function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Litovchick et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it was believed that p130 and p107 are the central DREAM-specific components mediating gene repression. However, our results provide evidence that p130/p107 cannot repress cell cycle genes when Lin37 is absent or unable to bind to DREAM, although they are still recruited to target gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Given that DREAM can assemble and bind to CHR or E2F sites in the absence of Lin37, it remains to be shown why Lin37 is essential for DREAM-mediated repression. Several models could provide possible explanations: First, Lin37 may recruit yet unknown proteins that are essential for repression by DREAM – most likely chromatin modifiers. Second, loss of Lin37 binding may render DREAM inactive because of conformational changes, which may prevent proper positioning of the complex or inhibit binding of proteins to DREAM without directly contacting Lin37. Third, loss of Lin37 could change post-translational modifications at other DREAM components, possibly p130/p107, that are necessary for function of the complex.</p><p>Given that knockdown of DREAM components led to only a moderate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Litovchick et al., 2007</xref>) or no (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmit et al., 2007</xref>) de-repression of cell cycle gene expression in serum-starved cells, it was suggested that DREAM may act redundantly with other repressor complexes like NuRD to repress genes in quiescence. Furthermore, many experiments have shown that cell cycle gene repression and binding of DREAM coincide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Litovchick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Müller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quaas et al., 2012</xref>), but these experiments did not directly address the role of DREAM as a repressor. In contrast, the results presented here provide strong evidence that DREAM is an essential transcriptional repressor to induce quiescence. In serum-starved and density-arrested <italic>Lin37<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, expression of cell cycle genes is highly up-regulated. This de-repression is not limited to G<sub>2</sub>/M cell cycle genes that are bound by DREAM through CHR promoter elements, but includes also G<sub>1</sub>/S cell cycle genes containing E2F binding sites, which also recruit repressing E2f/Rb complexes. Hence, in quiescent cells, loss of DREAM function cannot be compensated by E2f/Rb or by chromatin-modifying complexes. Importantly, promoters become activated in Lin37 knockout cells to a degree that is comparable with mutated promoters containing non-functional CHR sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Thus, it is unlikely that other proteins binding to CHR sites independent of DREAM contribute to repression. We conclude that DREAM is an essential repressor complex that shuts down expression of both G<sub>1</sub>/S and G<sub>2</sub>/M cell cycle genes during quiescence.</p><p>We observed an up-regulation of more than 300 cell cycle genes in <italic>Lin37<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells under serum starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), but these cells largely kept their potential to arrest in response to growth inhibiting factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). This phenotype corresponds to that observed in <italic>p107<sup>−/−</sup>/p130<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hurford et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dannenberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Classon et al., 2000</xref>) and <italic>E2f4<sup>−/−</sup>/E2f5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaubatz et al., 2000</xref>) cells. Given that the loss of all three pocket proteins resulted in an inability of cells to arrest in response to growth-limiting signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dannenberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sage et al., 2000</xref>), we asked whether a combined knockout of Lin37 and Rb would mirror this phenotype. Indeed, we found that <italic>Lin37<sup>−/−</sup>/Rb<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells exhibit massive defects in cell cycle gene expression and do not arrest in response to serum starvation or contact inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). These results indicate that either DREAM or E2f/Rb is sufficient to induce G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> arrest, even if many cell cycle genes are de-repressed when only one of both complexes is disturbed. In general, our data in combination with earlier findings suggest that Rb and p130/p107 may regulate gene expression through different mechanisms. While Rb can recruit a large variety of chromatin-modifying enzymes through its LxCxE binding cleft, this domain in p130/p107 is essential for DREAM formation and binds to Lin52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guiley et al., 2015</xref>) making it inaccessible for other proteins. Furthermore, binding of Rb to E2f/Dp complexes is sufficient for repressing target genes, while p130/p107 function depends also on MuvB proteins.</p><p>The strong activation of cell cycle gene expression in serum-starved <italic>Lin37<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells as well as the inability of cells to enter quiescence when both Lin37 and Rb are depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>) indicate that Lin37 may be a tumor suppressor. Furthermore, expression of the transcriptional activators <italic>E2f1</italic>, <italic>E2f</italic>2, <italic>Mybl2/B-myb</italic>, and <italic>Foxm1</italic> is up-regulated in <italic>Lin37<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These genes are highly expressed in many cancer types which generally predicts poor patient prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gentles et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, viral proteins like HPV E7 and SV40 large T antigen support transformation of cells and cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McLaughlin-Drubin and Münger, 2009</xref>) and disrupt DREAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nor Rashid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pang et al., 2014</xref>) as well as E2f/Rb complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyson et al., 1989</xref>). In contrast to Rb, mutations of p130 or p107 are only rarely found in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cinti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Helin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Claudio et al., 2000</xref>). Similar to p130 and p107, to the best of our knowledge, a significant enrichment of tumor-derived mutations inactivating Lin37 function has not been identified, even if several amplification, deletion, and mutation events could be detected in some cancer studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org">www.cbioportal.org</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk</ext-link>). Furthermore, we checked several gene expression databases to investigate whether Lin37 protein expression is altered in cancer tissues (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org">http://www.cbioportal.org</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">http://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://medical-genome.kribb.re.kr/GENT">http://medical-genome.kribb.re.kr/GENT</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://omictools.com/gene-expression-database-of-normal-and-tumor-tissues-tool">https://omictools.com/gene-expression-database-of-normal-and-tumor-tissues-tool</ext-link>). However, we could not deduce a general trend in Lin37 expression from these data. While some cancer tissues show reduced Lin37 levels compared to normal tissue (e.g. testis, ovary), others show no significant alteration (e.g. skin, lung) or even an upregulated Lin37 expression (e.g. breast, pancreas). In order to investigate whether a reduced Lin37 expression contributes to cancer formation in specific tissues, additional studies such as experiments in a Lin37 knockout mouse model have to be conducted. However, p130 and p107 have been shown to exhibit tumor suppressive functions in Rb null mouse models when loss of p130 and p107 can support tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wirt and Sage, 2010</xref>). Considering that p130/p107 and Lin37 are connected through their function in transcriptional repression, Lin37 may be inactivated only in specific types of cancer or be alternatively mutated to p130 or p107.</p><p>Taken together, our data reveal that Lin37 is essential for cell cycle gene repression in cellular quiescence and that a combined loss of Lin37 and Rb impairs cell cycle arrest in response to growth-limiting signals.

Fragmented RNA was further processed using the Ovation Human FFPE RNA-Seq Library Systems (Nugen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The barcoded libraries were purified and quantified using the Library Quantification Kit - Illumina/Universal (KAPA Biosystems). A pool of up to 10 libraries was used for cluster generation at a concentration of 10 nM using an Illumina cBot. Sequencing of 2 × 100 bp was performed with an Illumina HiScanSQ sequencer at the sequencing core facility of the Faculty of Medicine (University Leipzig) using version three chemistry and flowcell according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The DREAM complex through its subunit Lin37 cooperates with Rb to initiate quiescence&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript provides important new insights into the functions of the Lin37 protein, a factor previously shown to be associated with MuvB proteins. The key finding is that Lin37 seems to be essential for repression of cell cycle genes under conditions that generally led to senescence or cell cycle exit in NIH 3T3 cells in the wt situation. Thus it is a co-factor of other pocket proteins in the complex: p130/107. Interesting though not a paradigm shift for repressive complexes in general, in Lin37 null mutations other factors for repression maintain association with endogenous locations but are not active in repression. Furthermore consistent with this point nuclear extracts when incubated with DNA probes for either wt or mutant cells still IP together plus or minus Lin37 in extracts. An important phenotype is that with Lin37 and Rb double null cells cell-cycle arrest is dramatically inefficient. The mechanism of repression for the DREAM complex remains a key problem in the field and the reviewers all agreed that this study presents an important finding that was unexpected and while raising new questions will and should lead to a resolution of this issue. There were only a few major points that need to be dealt with in a revision.</p><p>1) A concern for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> is that the work is limited to a single established cell line and thus while solid needs to be – in the opinion of one reviewer – generalized to primary cells or other cell types. The work would be very much enhanced with a CRISPR/CAS knock out in the mouse – particularly with the single Lin 37 and the double rb-/rb; lin37-lin37, which might be embryonic lethal. However, while the mouse work is beyond the present scope, some of the phenotypes, not all, need to be demonstrated in primary cells or another model cell line.</p><p>2) The nuclear localization domain studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) add little to the study and one wonders if this experiment indicates that the protein when expressed from recombinant vectors enters with the entire complex into the nuclear space or by itself and exchanges? The issue being in the wt situation does this domain in Lin37 help the entire complex transit or is it even required for function, in an undisturbed setting. That is what would happen with the loss of the NLS in the native gene encoding the Lin 37? The present study could be deleted from the paper or somehow be brought into the major findings with some further experimentation.</p><p>3) The authors propose that in the absence of Lin37, cells traverse G1 more rapidly based on their analysis of flow cytometric analysis of DNA content. A similar phenotype was previously reported following the over-expression of cyclin D [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8339933]. In that case the cells exhibited a &quot;wee&quot; phenotype with reduced mean cell volume. It would therefore be interesting to know if the Lin37-deficient cells exhibited a similar phenotype. Ideally cell volume is assessed by a Coulter counter analysis of an unsynchronized population of cells. However, forward light scatter in flow cytometry is a common surrogate measurement of cell size that is usually collected at the same time as fluorescence data. Although not essential for the authors' conclusions, I think these data on cell size would be of interest either way and should be easy to obtain either from existing raw cytometry data, or from a Coulter counter analysis.</p><p>4) Unless we are mistaken, all of the experiments described were performed with murine NIH 3T3 cells, except for the nuclear localization and co-IPs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panels B and C, which used human HCT116 cells. Ideally these experiments should also have been done in NIH3T3 cells. If not, the authors should at least provide some explanation for this switch. This may not affect the results, but HCT116 are epitheial cells that are wild type for P53 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/content/103/4/976.long">http://www.pnas.org/content/103/4/976.long</ext-link>], whereas 3T3 cells are mesenchymal cells that are generally mutant for either P53 or for ARF in the same pathway [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9393858">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9393858</ext-link>]. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper, it would be interesting to restore the P53 pathway in the Lin37-deficient 3T3 cells and see if perhaps they are prone to P53-mediated apoptosis.</p><p>5) Because the authors are interested in fold-changes in transcription, either of endogenous genes or of reporter genes, the data would be better represented using a log-scale. This makes a two-fold increase equivalent to a two-fold decrease. In addition, the standard errors would then be based on geometric rather than arithmetic means and would likely be more similar at different absolute levels of gene expression.</p><p>6) The software used to analyze cell cycle based on DNA content measured by flow cytometry is not really adequate for the task [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4082777/]. I recommend using software that incorporates cell cycle models, rather than just simple (but arbitrary) linear cutoffs.

We were already in the process of creating Lin37-negative C2C12 cells when we received the decision letter. Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have added a new paragraph to our manuscript and show that loss of Lin37 has similar effects in C2C12 myoblast cells as we have shown for NIH3T3 cells. Based on several independent C2C12 knockout lines, we show that these cells proliferate normally and arrest in G0, but lose DREAM repressor function since cell cycle genes are de-repressed during quiescence upon Lin37 knockout. Re-expression of Lin37 restores DREAM activity in these cells. Thus, we can show that the phenotype of Lin37-deficient cells is not restricted to fibroblast. Moreover, experiments to create Lin37 knockout mice are in preparation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The nuclear localization domain studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) add little to the study and one wonders if this experiment indicates that the protein when expressed from recombinant vectors enters with the entire complex into the nuclear space or by itself and exchanges?

In general, as this is the first manuscript providing detailed information on Lin37, we believe that describing the functions of the few conserved domains is of importance.</p><p>As the expression of the Lin37 NLS mutant in Lin37-negative cells completely rescues DREAM function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we can assume that the NLS is not essential for the whole complex to enter the nucleus. In addition, we have shown by ChIP that several DREAM components still bind to target gene promoters in Lin37-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), which supports this observation. Furthermore, since the DREAM-binding deficient variant of Lin37 (CD1+2) is still imported in the nucleus, we know that binding of Lin37 to DREAM is not essential for nuclear import. We hope that, even if we did not perform additional experiments, the reviewers agree with us that the data should be shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors propose that in the absence of Lin37, cells traverse G1 more rapidly based on their analysis of flow cytometric analysis of DNA content.

As the data published in Quelle et al. were obtained from proliferating and contact-inhibited NIH3T3 cells, we performed Coulter counter analyses not only in proliferating knockout and rescue (wild-type and CD1+2 mutant), but also in density-arrested cells. Our data show that the volume of the cells does not change significantly in cells that have lost Lin37 function.

Furthermore, we have expressed Lin37 variants with an N-terminal FLAG-tag to show that the C-terminal EGFP-tag used for the experiments in HCT116 cells does not influence binding.
