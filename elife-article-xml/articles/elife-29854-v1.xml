Yet, the functions of caveolae and the molecular mechanisms critical for shaping them still are debated. We show that muscle cells of <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO mice show severe reductions of caveolae reminiscent of human caveolinopathies. Yet, different from other mouse models, the levels of the plasma membrane-associated caveolar coat proteins caveolin3 and cavin1 were both not reduced upon <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO. This allowed for dissecting bona fide caveolar functions from those supported by mere caveolin presence and also demonstrated that neither caveolin3 nor caveolin3 and cavin1 are sufficient to form caveolae. The membrane-shaping protein syndapin III is crucial for caveolar invagination and KO rendered the cells sensitive to membrane tensions. Consistent with this physiological role of caveolae in counterpoising membrane tensions, syndapin III KO skeletal muscles showed pathological parameters upon physical exercise that are also found in <italic>CAVEOLIN3</italic> mutation-associated muscle diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>caveolar invagination</kwd><kwd>nanodomains</kwd><kwd>ultrastructural analyses of membrane topologies</kwd><kwd>mechanical stress</kwd><kwd>caveolinopathies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huebner</surname><given-names>Christian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KE685/3-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessels</surname><given-names>Michael M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QU116/6-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qualmann</surname><given-names>Britta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTG1715</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qualmann</surname><given-names>Britta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mice lacking the membrane-shaping protein syndapin III show severe reduction of caveolae reminiscent of human caveolinopathies but maintain plasma membrane-associated caveolar coats proteins and thereby unveil physiological impairments associated with lack of invaginated caveolae.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Caveolae - uniform plasma membrane invaginations with ~70 nm diameter - were first described more than 60 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamada, 1955</xref>). Yet, their functions are still matter of debate. For decades, they were considered as membrane trafficking compartments. More recent data suggested that caveolae may rather represent signaling platforms and/or mechanosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nassoy and Lamaze, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shvets et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Nichols, 2016</xref>).</p><p>A main structural component of caveolar coats in muscles is caveolin3 (cav3). <italic>CAV3</italic> mutations manifest in several human diseases, for example limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), rippling muscle disease (RMD), hyperCK(creatine kinase)emia, distal myopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic-long-QT syndrome and sudden-infant-death syndrome. Most patients with <italic>CAV3</italic> mutations are heterozygous and the pathophysiology seems to be caused by the mutated protein acting dominant-negatively on WT-cav3 via self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gazzerro et al., 2010</xref>). Consistently, also overexpression of dominant-negative mutants in mice caused symptoms resembling hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohsawa et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p><italic>Cav3</italic> KO led to a lack of caveolae, size variability of muscle fibers and cases of necrosis considered as signs of muscle dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hagiwara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galbiati et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>Cav3</italic> KO hearts were unaltered in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galbiati et al., 2001</xref>), whereas another reported heart hypertrophy and dilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woodman et al., 2002</xref>). In zebrafish, cav3 knock-down caused notochord and myoblast fusion defects and impaired movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nixon et al., 2005</xref>). Cav3 interacts with a variety of signaling components and may also have roles in energy metabolism. It is therefore unclear whether the broad effects of <italic>CAV3</italic> deficiency reflected by the different diseases and the in part contradictory effects of <italic>cav3</italic> mutants are caused by aberrant signaling or caveolar dysfunctions. Similar limitations hampered the interpretations of cav1 analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gazzerro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Lay and Kurzchalia, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, a variety of examinations of human mutations argue against simple correlations of caveolin availability and disease phenotypes or against simply correlating caveolae numbers and clinical symptoms. Patients with heterozygous V57M exchange showed hyperCKemia, yet, cav3 levels only were reduced by 62% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alias et al., 2004</xref>). The heterozygous disease mutations CAV3 P28L and R27E did not lead to any significant reduction in caveolae density in quantitative electron microscopical analyses of patient biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Timmel et al., 2015</xref>). Even in LGMD-1C patients with the severest cases of <italic>CAV3</italic> missense mutations known (63TFT65del and P104L) showing full clinical symptoms, caveolae formation was not fully abolished but 7 or 24% of WT remained, as judged from the representative images presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Minetti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Minetti et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the observation that the same <italic>CAV3</italic> mutation can lead to different clinical phenotypes suggests additional, maybe indirect mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fischer et al., 2003</xref>). Extensive quantitative analyses demonstrated that major portions of both of the endogenous non-muscle caveolins, cav1 and cav2, were not located at deeply invaginated classical caveolar profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujimoto et al., 2000</xref>). It thus seems possible that some <italic>CAV</italic> phenotypes may be linked to caveolins acting as membrane-associated scaffolds rather than to caveolae as such. Apart from such putatively distinct functions of caveolin, cav1-caveolar invaginations were highlighted as membrane tension buffers in a recent seminal paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>). Further, most recent papers support this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Thus far, however, it has been impossible to clearly distinguish caveolin and caveolar functions. Caveolin-deficiencies obviously are unable to distinguish between these possibilities, as they lack both invaginated caveolae and caveolins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen and Nichols, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nassoy and Lamaze, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shvets et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Nichols, 2016</xref>). Unfortunately, the same is true for deficiency of CAVIN-1, a caveolae-associated protein, which forms a flexible, net-like protein mesh around caveolin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stoeber et al., 2016</xref>) and has been introduced as factor critical for caveolae formation and function. <italic>CAVIN-1</italic> KO phenotypically mimicked caveolin deficiency merely due to a concomitant, massive decrease of caveolin protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and Pilch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We here describe that KO of <italic>syndapin III</italic> (also called <italic>PACSIN3</italic>), which encodes for the muscle-enriched isoform of the syndapin family of F-BAR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kessels and Qualmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qualmann et al., 2011</xref>), impairs caveolar invagination without affecting cav3 plasma membrane levels. This represents the desired possibility to dissect the physiological importance of caveolae from that of cav3 and to thereby reveal the cell biological and physiological functions of caveolar invaginations by comparing the <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO phenotypes to those attributed to cav3 deficiency. Our analyses unveil that - whereas some, mostly cardiac caveolinopathy phenotypes seem unrelated to impairments of caveolar invagination – in particular cellular integrity under strong mechanical stress was significantly affected in <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO muscles. Under physical exercise, failure to invaginate caveolae using the membrane-shaping protein syndapin III coincided with a widened caliber spectrum, detached nuclei and signs of inflammation and necrosis. This pathophysiology in <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO muscles is reminiscent of human myopathies associated with <italic>CAV3</italic> mutation. Thus, syndapin III is crucial for caveolar invagination and thereby highlights that the physiological function of cav3-coated caveolae is to preserve muscle cell integrity upon acute membrane tensions, as they occur during physical exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of s<italic>yndapin III</italic> KO mice</title><p>Caveolins are required for caveolae formation. Bacterial reconstitutions, furthermore, suggested that caveolins also were sufficient for caveolar invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Walser et al., 2012</xref>). In this case, discrimination between caveolin and bona fide caveolar functions would be impossible. Recent observations, however, suggested that it might nevertheless be possible to unveil specifically the functions of caveolar invaginations. RNAi against the F-BAR protein syndapin II led to a reduction of deeply invaginated caveolae without affecting the presence of endogenous cav1 at the plasma membrane of NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koch et al., 2012</xref>) and to increased levels of overexpressed cav1 in the TIRF-zone of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Toward addressing the role of caveolar invaginations in the various diseases associated with <italic>CAV3</italic> mutations, we therefore studied the muscle-enriched member of the syndapin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kessels and Qualmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qualmann et al., 2011</xref>), syndapin III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), by generating <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO mice.

Thus, the identified <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO phenotype specifically and exclusively reflected a loss of the functions of syndapin III and not of other members of the syndapin family.</p><p>Thin sectioning of fixed cells is a standard technique, but we were concerned that several caveats of this classical method may compromise our data. First, lipids cannot be fixed well chemically and caveolae are known to be induced, morphologically changed and/or promoted by chemical fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Severs, 1988</xref>) shedding doubt on the numbers and caveolar morphologies we obtained using chemically fixed samples. Second, the membrane profiles we observed were not always clearly identifiable as caveolae. Therefore, especially in WT samples, many of them had to be excluded from the quantitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,a’</xref>; question marks). Unambiguous identification of caveolar structures would require 3D-information and immunolabeling. However, even serial sectioning using 50 nm thin sections and 3D-reconstruction would fail to provide reliable 3D-information on 70-nm wide structures. Furthermore, immunolabeling of thin sections is inefficient, as only the section surfaces are accessible for immunodetection. Indeed, even in cases of exceptionally high labeling efficiencies reported, anti-caveolin immunolabeling of sections with caveolae selected for superimposition analyses only reached an average of 2.5 gold particles/caveola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ludwig et al., 2013</xref>). Unlabeled caveolae would severely compromise our quantitative analyses. Third, even if caveolae are efficiently recognized, quantitative analyses of membrane topologies would be restricted to areas defined by the length of a membrane segment multiplied by the thickness of the ultrathin section (50 nm), that is would merely represent 0.05 µm<sup>2</sup> area per µm membrane stretch evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, colored lines). Furthermore, we noticed WT plasma membrane stretches without any caveolar profiles, whereas others showed accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,a’</xref>). Caveolar frequency thus also largely depends on the random orientation of sections in relation to caveolae-enriched regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>).</p><p>In order to i) preserve membrane topologies by rapid freezing, ii) image perpendicular views of large plasma membrane fields, iii) obtain 3D-information and iv) be able to probe wide areas of the plasma membrane with antibodies, we therefore established immunogold labeling protocols for freeze-fractured primary cardiomyocytes. The P-halves of the fractured membranes provide full antibody access to the entire cytosolic membrane surface (P-face). Labeling densities can thus reach high values. This will ensure the identification of most caveolar membrane profiles as caveolae. The cooling rates used exceeded 4000 K/s, that is membrane topologies were preserved within milliseconds, whereas chemical fixation takes minutes, that is &gt;100,000 times longer. TEM analyses of such membranes provided perpendicular views onto large membrane fields and rotation shadowing provided 3D-information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29854.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><italic>Syndapin III</italic> KO leads to impairments in the formation of cav3-coated caveolae.</title><p>(<bold>a,b</bold>) Details of wide-field TEM images of anti-syndapin III immunogold-labeled P-faces of freeze-fractured plasma membranes of cardiomyocytes (CDMC) from WT (<bold>a</bold>) and <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO mice (<bold>b</bold>).

In WT cardiomyocytes, CAVIN-1 localized to deeply invaginated, shallowly invaginated and flat membrane areas. As expected, anti-CAVIN-1 immunogold signals were colocalized with the signals of anti-cav3 antibodies, which we used at low concentration to formally prove that the plasma membranes analyzed indeed correspond to cardiomyocytes and not to other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, CAVIN-1’s membrane association, its ability to form clusters and its colocalization with cav3 seemed not to be impaired upon <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Instead, the CAVIN-1 density at the plasma membrane even moderately increased by about 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). The CAVIN-1 density within CAVIN-1 clusters rose accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). Since also the density of CAVIN-1 clusters found was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>), these increases of CAVIN-1 in clusters at <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO plasma membranes of cardiomyocytes obviously came at the expense of the disperse labeling.

And if so, would syndapin III integrate everywhere into the cav3 coat to control its topology or rather act as a locally restricted curvature-inducer? The first question seemed critical, as in vitro-reconstitutions with liposomes analyzed by negative-staining procedures suggested that a fragment of syndapin III can induce membrane curvatures but the diameters were very invariant (around 110 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2012</xref>]), that is they did not fit caveolar diameters. However, our analyses with full-length syndapin III using two different methods of evaluation, freeze-fracture/TEM as well as cryoTEM, showed that syndapin III had mechanistic properties in line with its caveolar localization and function. Both tagged and untagged full-length syndapin III formed tubules with an average diameter of about 80 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–e</xref>). The observed diameter range of 75–90 nm corresponded very well to the membrane topologies that were immuno-positive for syndapin III in vivo.

For decades, they were considered as endocytic structures. More recent data suggested that caveolae may represent signaling hubs or mechanosensing membrane reservoirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>). Model systems with caveolin-deficiency are unable to distinguish between these possibilities, as they lack both invaginated caveolae and caveolins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen and Nichols, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nassoy and Lamaze, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shvets et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Nichols, 2016</xref>).

This demand seemed impossible to meet, as overexpression experiments in bacteria suggested that caveolins are not only crucial but also sufficient for caveolae formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Walser et al., 2012</xref>). Our quantitative analyses of <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO cardiomyocytes, heart and skeletal muscles show that <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO does not affect the presence of cav3 at the plasma membrane but specifically impaired caveolar invagination to an extent resembling the reductions of caveolae found in human patients with <italic>CAV3</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gazzerro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alias et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Timmel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Minetti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Minetti et al., 2002</xref>). These observations finally made it possible to dissect the functions of caveolae as cell biological structure from those of caveolin proteins at the plasma membrane and to thereby address the physiological relevance of caveolar invaginations at the whole animal level. Although it is a general limitation of all gene KO studies that phenotypes, such as those observed for <italic>cav3</italic> or <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO at caveolae, formally never prove a direct involvement of the lacking protein at these sites, several lines of experimental data support the conclusion that the dramatic caveolar phenotypes we observed in <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO heart and muscle cells reflect a direct involvement of syndapin III in the underlying, required membrane shaping process. First, syndapin III colocalized with cav3-enriched membrane domains at the light microscopical level and at cav3-marked caveolae at the ultra-structural level, that is showed the localization required for caveolar function. Second, syndapin III interacts with cav3 in coprecipitation experiments and the syndapin III F-BAR domain enriched together with cav3 in distinct plasma membrane areas. Efficient subcellular recruitment of interaction partners to membranes has also been observed for other syndapin family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kessels and Qualmann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwintzer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hou et al., 2015</xref>). Third, syndapins associate with phosphatidylserine using their F-BAR-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qualmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Itoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dharmalingam et al., 2009</xref>) and caveolar microdomains are enriched for phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fairn et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that syndapin III-mediated membrane associations and nanocluster formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>) may help to establish membrane domains promoting cav3 assembly. In support of this, syndapin III floated with cav3-enriched DRMs and syndapin III deficiency changed the biophysical properties of cav3-associated DRMs. Fourth, an active role of syndapin III in this process is suggested by syndapin III’s ability to induce tubule formation. The induced membrane tubules were about 80 nm in diameter and thereby fitted with membrane curvatures found at caveolae. Fifth, syndapin III localized specifically to necks of cav3-coated caveolar invaginations – sites, which can be expected to represent zones of curvature modulation during invagination. Finally, caveolar necks have a complex topology with negative membrane curvatures being turned into positive ones. Syndapins have a unique, curved but also tilde-like shape and may thus especially prefer and/or promote the complex membrane topologies found at caveolar necks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qualmann et al., 2011</xref>). Syndapin III thus seems to use its membrane-shaping properties to promote caveolar invagination and caveolar organization. It is conceivable that a key step in this process will be the initiation of membrane curvature in at first minimal membrane areas. This would explain how few syndapin III molecules at the neck of caveolae would suffice for triggering invagination and why not all caveolae at all times were syndapin III-positive. It is likely that this function critically required for caveolar invagination can then be propagated further by the self-assembly of cav3 (and other coat components) into bent coats.</p><p>Whether CAVIN-1 plays some role in such propagation or stabilization of caveolar invaginations or whether it simply exerts its critical role by stabilizing caveolin proteins can neither be answered by the conducted CAVIN-1 loss-of-function studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and Pilch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2008</xref>) nor by our phenotypical analyses of <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO. Yet, two somewhat unexpected conclusions can be drawn firmly. First, even a combination of the two coat proteins cav3 and CAVIN-1 – both not reduced, that is still available, at the plasma membrane in <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO muscle cells - is not sufficient for efficient caveolar invagination. Second, in contrast to previous immunofluorescence studies with overexpressed CAVIN-1-mCherry and cav1-EGFP in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>), our quantitative ultra-high-resolution studies show that CAVIN-1 is not dissociating from the plasma membrane of muscle cells when caveolae are flat but CAVIN-1 remained and its levels even increased at the plasma membrane. Our data thereby seem to be in line with a previous report showing only slightly increased cav1/CAVIN-1 ratios together with strongly increased cav1 values, which thus can be interpreted as increased CAVIN-1 levels in the TIRF zone of fixed, syndapin II RNAi-transfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, CAVIN-1 could still be detected in cav3-enriched nanodomains, which also remained present at the predominantly flat plasma membranes found in syndapin III KO cells.</p><p>It remains to be shown whether the apparent discrepancy of our quantitative data showing that both cav3 and CAVIN-1 are still available at the plasma membrane, when membrane topologies are flat, with a part of the literature on cav1-based caveolae suggesting a dissociation or dispersion of these coat components from their membrane nanodomains is caused by the improved resolution in our study, by the fact that we studied the endogenous proteins and/or is a specialty of cav3-caveolae and muscle cells.</p><p>It will furthermore be interesting to evaluate in detail whether similar to cav3 also cav1/cav2 in non-muscle cells would critically rely on membrane-shaping factors, too. Reports of recent years suggest that these components could for example be syndapin II and/or its binding partners, the EHD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yeow et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Caveolae were hypothesized to act as mechanosensitive signaling hubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shvets et al., 2014</xref>). A significant portion of the plethora of physiological defects in <italic>caveolin</italic>-deficient mice may be mediated by MAPK hyperactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woodman et al., 2002</xref>). We neither observe such hyperactivation nor any changes in dystrophin and β-dystroglycan expression levels or distribution upon impairment of caveolar invagination by <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO. We, furthermore, did not observe cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and left ventricular wall thickening in <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO mice. Since <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO did not mirror these <italic>cav3</italic> KO phenotypes, they either require a complete loss of all caveolae or they reflect a lack of cav3 protein as membrane-associated hub rather than dysfunctions of caveolae as invaginated cell biological structure. It thus is attractive to consider the idea that not all phenotypes and clinical symptoms observed upon cav3 deficiency may be due to currently untreatable caveolar dysfunctions, but to quite some extent may represent derailed, that is presumable treatable, signaling processes. Also the fact that even LGMD-1C patients with the severest cases of <italic>CAV3</italic> missense mutations known (63TFT65del and P104L) showing full clinical symptoms do not exhibit a complete impairment of caveolae formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Minetti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Minetti et al., 2002</xref>) clearly argues in favor of the view that a complete loss of caveolae is not a prerequisite for the development of caveolinopathy symptoms. Instead, it seems that a severe reduction is sufficient for mirroring the caveolar defects in caveolinopathies. <italic>Syndapin III</italic> KO led to a severe impairment of caveolar invagination but did not alter cav3 levels at the plasma membrane of isolated cardiomyocytes, heart and skeletal muscle and thereby represents a valuable model for dissection of caveolae and caveolin functions.</p><p>Our work shows that cav3-coated caveolae serve as membrane reservoirs of muscle cells and that syndapin III plays a crucial role in forming a membrane buffer reservoir represented by invaginated caveolae. A lack of these membrane reservoirs within the plasma membrane can be expected to render cells vulnerable to all conditions associated with mechanic stress. Indeed hypoosmotic swelling caused <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO cardiomyocytes to rupture, whereas WT cells responded by caveolar flattening and thereby counteracted the membrane tensions induced.</p><p>Muscles are faced with abrupt changes of membrane tension and <italic>CAV3</italic> mutations cause muscle diseases, such as LGMD-1C and RMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gazzerro et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, caveolae morphology and density at the plasma membrane of rat myofibers were found to be unchanged upon different modes of contractile activity as well as upon myofiber stretching within normal myofiber limits but were greatly reduced by the more severe mechanical forces occurring during tearing of myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poulos et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dulhunty and Franzini-Armstrong, 1975</xref>). The muscle fibers of untrained <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO mice displayed an extended caliber spectrum being a sign of impaired muscle integrity. Yet, <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO-induced impairment of caveolar invagination did not have dramatic consequences for muscular integrity as long as mice were just housed in cages. When mice were subjected to physical exercise, however, the severe reduction of deeply invaginated caveolar structures upon <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO was associated with observations of hypertrophy, centronuclear myopathy and necrosis, that is were reminiscent of the clinical symptoms of human muscle diseases linked to <italic>CAV3</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gazzerro et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, it seems that muscular caveolar invaginations are largely dispensable for life. This is in line with the viability of <italic>cav3</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hagiwara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galbiati et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woodman et al., 2002</xref>). Yet, our studies unveil that muscular caveolae help to preserve muscle cells from the abrupt tear forces. Our data thereby shed light on the exact cellular functions impaired in caveolinopathies and strongly suggest that, when caveolae as membrane tension compensators are impaired, physical exercise-inducible hypertrophy is counterproductive to compensate the weakness of muscle fibers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (mouse and rat)</td><td>PACSIN3/syndapin III</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">C57BL/6J</td><td>Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, Maine)</td><td valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>129/SvJ mouse genomic λ library</td><td>Stratagene (San Diego, California)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">NIH3T3</td><td>Cell Lines Services GmbH (Eppelheim, Germany)</td><td valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0594">CVCL_0594</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td valign="bottom">HEK293</td><td>Cell Lines Services GmbH</td><td valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL0045">CVCL0045</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (rat)</td><td valign="bottom">GFP-syndapin III F-BAR (aa 1–336; extended F-BAR)</td><td>this paper</td><td valign="bottom"/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (mouse)</td><td valign="bottom">Syndapin III aa1-70 peptide (plus five unrelated aa encoded by exon5/6 deletion-induced frame shift and multiple stop codons)</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>guinea pig anti-syndapin I, rabbit anti-syndapin II, rabbit anti-syndapin III, anti-GST</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch et al.

After post-fixation in 1% osmiumtetroxide for 1 hr, dehydration in ascending ethanol series with post-staining in uranylacetate was performed. The samples were embedded in epoxy resin (Araldite) and finally sectioned ultrathin using a LKB Ultratome III (LKB). After mounting on coated copper grids and post-staining with lead citrate for 10 min, the sections were examined in a TEM (EM 902A, Zeiss) at 80 kV. Images were recorded digitally using an 1 k FastScan-CCD-camera (TVIPS camera and software). Plasma membrane sections of about 2 µm length each were analyzed for the presence or absence of caveolar membrane profiles. Data were expressed as caveolae/length of membrane stretch. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Freeze-fracturing of cardiomyocytes, of NIH3T3 cells and of heart and skeletal muscle tissues</title><p>Freeze-fracturing of NIH3T3 cells and primary cardiomyocytes was essentially done as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To obtain freeze-fracture replica directly from skeletal muscles and hearts, heart and <italic>musculus gastrocnemius</italic> were isolated and cut longitudinal in 300 μm-thick slices using a McIlwain Tissue Chopper. Sections were transferred into PBS and frozen in 20% (w/v) BSA between a copper head sandwich profile. Copper sandwiches were freeze-fractured, shadowed with carbon and platinum/carbon, and incubated in 0.2% collagenase II in DMEM at 37°C overnight. After washing, replica were incubated in 5% (w/v) SDS and 30 mM sucrose in 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.4 overnight.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Immunolabeling and TEM of freeze-fractured plasma membranes</title><p>Replica were immunolabeled and analyzed by TEM as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). Quantitative evaluations were performed by an independent experimentator and in a blinded manner using samples from several independent freeze-fracturing experiments. Cav1, cav3, CAVIN-1 and syndapin III labeling densities were determined per 3.47 µm<sup>2</sup> image and analyzable ROI, respectively, and expressed as % of the corresponding WT and isoosmotic condition, respectively, of each assay (set at 100%). Immunolabels were only considered as localized to a caveolar invagination if localized &lt;50 nm from the (inner) caveolar rim. In total, 1087 µm<sup>2</sup> membrane were scored for quantitative analyses and 2889 caveolin-positive invaginations were evaluated.</p><p>Cluster analyses of cav3 and CAVIN-1 immunogold signals were done using circular ROIs of 150 nm diameter around caveolae (70 nm (inner caveolar diameter) + 2×10 nm (PM curvature zone around the caveolae) + 2×30 nm (maximally possible primary/secondary antibody extension and gold particle size).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Suzanne Pfeffer, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>In their study, the authors analyzed the physiological function of syndapin III (also called PACSIN III), which they found to localize to caveolae in cardiomyocytes and muscle. For this, they generated a syndapin III knockout (KO) mouse model and investigated the morphology of caveolae in heart and muscle sections. Surprisingly, syndapin III KO myocytes revealed a severe reduction of caveolae. However, the authors could not find a severe cardiac or muscle phenotype, as described for caveolin3 knockout mouse models, which essentially lack caveolae in muscle and heart. The authors suggest that the syndapin III KO mouse can be used as a tool to dissect the function of caveolae independently from the function of caveolin3 and/or cavin1.</p><p>This is an extensive manuscript which could be very important for the caveolae field and beyond, since the lack of muscular caveolae in syndapin III ko mice suggests an unexpected function of syndapin III in the generation of caveolae. However, additional experiments will add much to the potential significance of the story, and are essential because the results presented here are so unexpected. Furthermore, there are numerous experiments for which the presentation can be improved.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>The reviewers were not yet completely convinced that the proposed model of syndapin-III as a curvature generator for caveolae is correct because there are still some normally shaped caveolae left in the ko animals; they thought that a BAR domain containing protein might stabilize the neck of a membrane invagination, as many other BAR domain proteins do, rather than generate the invagination. To address this issue, the reviewers suggest inclusion of some light microscopy-based experiments to quantify caveolin and cavin levels at the plasma membrane, at the plasma membrane in punctae, and at intracellular membranes in wt and ko cells. If possible, they felt that monitoring the dynamics of caveolae by transfecting cardiomyocytes with a caveolin3-GFP construct should be a rather straightforward experiment and would add a great deal to the present story (as long as it is expressed at low levels).</p><p>The reviewers have gone to great lengths to suggest specific manuscript improvements, thus I am attaching the detailed comments in full, to aid in the revision process.</p><p>1) The authors failed to mention that a model for syndapin II within caveolae was already described by Senju et al., 2015 and Hansen et al., 2011. Both studies showed that PACSIN II binds to EHD2 and is therefore recruited to caveolae, most probably to stabilize caveolar structures within the plasma membrane and not as trigger for the invagination process during caveolae generation. Hansen et al. also found a reduction of caveolae after knockdown of PACSIN II, but, in contrast to the present study, an increase of caveolin and cavin proteins in the membrane whereas in the current study, only cavin1 staining was increased in EM stainings of syndapin III KO cells. Thus, instead of invoking a decreased formation of caveolae in the absence of syndapin III, one could explain the syndapin III ko phenotype also by an increased uptake of caveolae in the absence of syndapins III. The authors should address this issue by directly looking at caveolar dynamics in primary wt and syndapins III ko cardiomyoctes or muscle cells overexpressing caveolin-3.</p><p>2) Figure 3: A double staining of syndapin III and caveolin3 was used to prove the localization of syndapin III to caveolae. However, in the KO example picture (i), it is difficult to see the cav3 staining. More micrographs, especially for the KO, and the same magnifications for wt and KO should be used to support the result. Furthermore, the authors found no significant difference between WT and KO cav3 staining at the plasma membrane (m). However, electron microscopy may not be the best method to quantitatively evaluate protein densities if different cellular structures (e.g. invaginations versus flat membranes) with potentially different accessibilities of the antibody epitopes are stained. As described in point 1, some light microscopy-based methods would be desirable to support the claims of the authors. Are Cav3 and cavin 1 still clustered?</p><p>3) Surface invaginations, caveolae, and syndapin III.</p><p>The authors use freeze-fracture and immunogold analysis to detect caveolae and the presence of syndapin III and caveolin3 at invaginations. A number of quantifications are shown, but rather than absolute quantifications, only relative quantifications between wt/ko are shown. What should in addition be shown are</p><p>- The fraction of invaginations positive for cav3 over total invaginations (are all total invaginations actual caveolae?</p><p>- The fraction of invaginations positive for sdp III over total invaginations</p><p>- The fraction of invaginations positive for both cav3 and sdp3 over total invaginations.</p><p>The cell types used in Figure 3, Figure 9 and Figure 12 might have other invaginations (clathrin-coated, non-coated), whose abundance should not be affected by Sdp III KO.</p><p>Since EM techniques allow only for fractions of cell surface areas to be examined, it would be informative to additionally determine the fraction of Sdp III-positive cav1- or cavin1-positive puncta on the surface of cultured cells using immunofluorescence of endogenous proteins (as in #2 above).</p><p>4) Caveolar and non-caveolar functions of caveolar coat components.</p><p>Knockout of Syndapin III/Pacsin3 causes loss of morphological caveolae, but not of caveolins or cavins. Based on this finding, the authors strongly emphasize that this situation uniquely allows them to disentangle the regulatory/signaling functions of caveolar coat components from the physiological role of caveolae as invaginated membrane structures. However, in this study they do not directly compare syndapin III/Pacsin3 knockout mice with caveolin3 knockout mice side-by-side and rely for their comparison on data from other studies. The authors state that &quot;… syndapin III KO skeletal muscles showed pathological parameters upon physical exercise that are also found in CAVEOLIN3 mutation-associated diseases.&quot;, i.e. the effects of syndapin III KO are similar to a loss of caveolin3 function. We are surprised that such strong emphasis is placed on the separation of the functions of caveolar invaginations vs coat components, when no dramatic differences were found. This point could be addressed by text changes alone.</p><p>5) DRM association of dystrophin and dystroglycan (Figure 8).</p><p>The authors cite previous work that loss of caveolin3 has been associated with loss of DRM association of the dystrophin-glycoportein complex and therefore aimed at testing whether syndapin III KO caused a similar defect. In their experiments, however, even in wt animals, neither dystrophin nor β-dystroglycan floated on density gradients (Figure 7). Since there was no DRM association in lysates from WT tissues, it is impossible to determine or conclude whether syndapin III is necessary for DRM association of dystrophin or β-dystroglycan. DRM association depends on the sample/detergent ratio, the precise lysis conditions, and is therefore difficult to interpret, even more so when no DRM association is observed. In our view panels c-f do not provide significant insight and should be removed from the manuscript.</p><p>6) DRM association of cav3 and flotillin (Figure 6).</p><p>Figure 6 shows that Sdp III KO causes a change in flotation behavior of caveolin3 where the floating fraction(s) shift by two fractions towards the bottom of the gradient in Sdp III KO tissues: From fraction 3 to 5 in skeletal muscle, and from 4-6 in the heart. Flotillin1, which should not be associated with caveolar membranes, also shifts by two fractions towards the bottom of the gradient in KO tissues. The authors find support for their model that Sdp III is required specifically for organizing cav3-containing membrane domains. One could equally conclude that Sdp III is required for organizing flotillin1-containing membrane domains. Could the authors explain why they are convinced Sdp III is not involved in organizing flotillin1-containing membrane domains?</p><p>However, rather than questioning the specific role of Sdp III in caveola formation, to me this demonstrates how little can be concluded from DRM association assays. Flotillin1 might associate with caveolin-containing membranes post lysis during the centrifugation and its co-floating and shifting with cav3 may not have any biological meaning. Figure 6D-I in our view add little information to the manuscript. In the future (not required here), a more informative way for assessing the assembly state of the caveolar coat could be velocity gradients as used by the Helenius and Nichols labs (PMID: 20070607, PMID: 24013648).</p><p>7) The manuscript contains many experiments, but the organization is sometimes confusing and difficult to follow. For example, the authors often jump in between tissue and cell culture experiments for heart and muscle. It may be easier to show the immuno-stainings of syndapins III in heart and muscle directly behind the cardiomyocyte stainings (e.g. combine Figure 1, 4, 11, 12). It would also be easier to first describe the localization of syndapin III at caveolae before showing the reduced caveolar numbers in syndapin III ko cells. The previously described localization of syndapin II at caveolae should be mentioned in the Introduction.</p><p>Figure 1: The immunofluorescence experiments in C-E and I are difficult to recognize, the size of the pictures should be increased. Also the pictures in P and Q are difficult to analyze – it would be helpful if colocalisation of syndapin III and caveolin3 was investigated in more detail, e.g. using increased magnification during confocal microscopy, colocalisation analysis within ImageJ or ZEN software (see above).</p><p>Figure 2: As the authors acknowledge, the displayed EM pictures are of rather bad quality, so that caveolae cannot be precisely distinguished. Are these pictures essential?</p><p>Figure 2: The western blots for syndapin I (D) are difficult to interpret because the GAPDH signal used as loading control is very weak and no GAPDH band can be detected for the heart lysates – the authors used 50 ug/lane, so there should be a very strong signal for GAPDH. Further, the number of investigated WT and KO mice used for the western blot analysis is missing in the figure legends.</p><p>Figure 5: In G/H, the colocalization of cavin1 and caveolin3 is difficult to see. Further, the authors mentioned clustered cavin1 protein which is also not well seen in the two examples. The graphs A-F can be reduced in size and more detailed EM labeling pictures for both wt and KO can be shown in the supplement to support the results.</p><p>Figure 6: The 3D reconstruction images show the localization of syndapin III within caveolae. The authors therefore claim that syndapin III is responsible for the invagination process. However, for this model, it is quite surprising to see that only two molecules of syndapin III are detected, and only at one side/part of the caveolae. How can invagination be supported by syndapin III, if it is not found around the whole neck of caveolae? The authors should comment on this in their discussion.</p><p>Figure 8: The authors wrote in the figure legend: ' not all described cav3 loss-of-function[…]' If we understand the results described in this study, none of the previously published cav3 KO phenotypes was found in the syndapin III KO mouse?</p><p>Figure 11: Picture G, KO heart section is not well chosen, because the right ventricle is somehow cut or enrolled.</p><p>Figure 13: The muscle cell size in KO sections (C) seems to be increased. Did the author further analyze this?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>In the Introduction, the authors suggest that caveolae and caveolin 3 function can now be better dissected, but the discussion for this is quite vague and could be extended (e.g. what do we learn?). Do the authors envisage a similar scenario for caveolin1-related caveolae in different tissue in relation to PACSIN II?</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>Statistical analysis should be described in more detail in the Materials and methods part, e.g. which statistical test and methods were used (t -test vs. Mann-Whitney-U test, distribution analysis of the data sets,..).</p><p>Legends for <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref> refer to the wrong figure (it should be Figure 6, not Figure 5).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29854.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>The reviewers were not yet completely convinced that the proposed model of syndapin-III as a curvature generator for caveolae is correct because there are still some normally shaped caveolae left in the ko animals; they thought that a BAR domain containing protein might stabilize the neck of a membrane invagination, as many other BAR domain proteins do, rather than generate the invagination.

We are happy to – besides the plethora of controls and comparisons already presented in the initial manuscript – provide further evidence that the fact that <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO leads to disruption of caveolar invagination of caveolae is not due to a reduction in cav3 levels (as it has been described for other caveolin coat-associated proteins) in our revised manuscript, which we herewith would like to submit.</p><p>We understand that beyond the classical thin sectioning and transmission electron microscopy and the biochemistry, which we used as additional techniques in parallel to our more innovative approach to label and quantitatively analyze caveolae by freeze-fracturing and TEM, the reviewers would like to see some more standard corroborative immunofluorescence analyses. We agree that this even further solidifies our study. The revised manuscript now contains several of such analyses.</p><p>Although the resolution of light microscopy is of course not sufficient to visualize single caveolae (which are only 70 nm in diameter, i.e. way below the resolution of light microscopy) and the membrane topologies within the nanodomains showing clustered cav3 signal cannot be visualized either, the lack of information on individual sites is compensated for by the power of signal averaging and intensity measurements. The revised manuscript now also by light microcopy shows that - fully consistent with our quantitative EM data in cardiomyocytes, in heart and in skeletal muscles and the biochemical evaluations – cav3 levels did not change upon <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO. Imaging of endogenous cav3 in sections of muscle tissue demonstrate that neither at the plasma membrane, intracellularly nor directly within puncta at the plasma membranes there were any changes in cav3 levels (newly added quantitative data panels in revised Figure 1 and Figure 12).</p><p>In addition, we were also able to answer the reviewers questions about the frequency of labeling overlap using 3D surface renderings of image stacks obtained by confocal microscopy (newly added Figure 12M, N). However, since this information is much more powerfully addressed by ultra-high resolution studies, the revised manuscript now additionally contains quantitative EM data on this (newly added Figures 3J, M and Figure 12C, D).</p><p>Furthermore, we also quantitatively analyzed the distribution of cav3 and of CAVIN-1 in detail in order to be able to describe how <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO affects the abundance and organization of caveolar coat components (newly added Figure 3P, Figure 5J-L and Figure 12S, T).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If possible, they felt that monitoring the dynamics of caveolae by transfecting cardiomyocytes with a caveolin3-GFP construct should be a rather straightforward experiment and would add a great deal to the present story (as long as it is expressed at low levels).</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we agreed to corroborate and accordingly expanded our mostly EM work by additional light microscopy data in the revised manuscript.

We carefully went through all of them and improved the manuscript accordingly. Besides the above mentioned additional analyses and text changes, this also led to an increase of Figure Supplements from previously 1 to now 7 (plus 2 videos). We hope that you and the reviewers will appreciate our efforts and enjoy reading the improved manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors failed to mention that a model for syndapin II within caveolae was already described by Senju et al., 2015 and Hansen et al., 2011.

Although exclusively focusing on syndapin II in cell lines and not on the muscle-enriched isoform syndapin III, Hansen et al., 2011 was of course cited (introductory start of results). Careful reading of the paper published by Hansen et al., however, makes clear that these authors did <underline>not</underline> favor a caveolae stabilization model. Quote: <italic>“Rather, pacsin 2 appears to be specifically required for these microdomains to adopt the characteristic curved caveolar membrane profile”</italic>. Work of the Suetsugu lab on syndapin II was cited as well (Senju et al., 2011) in our quite extensive literature list (61 ref.).</p><p>We are aware of the fact that syndapin II binds to EHD2 and may thereby be recruited to caveolae; thank you for this note. Syndapin III, however, is different. As we have already shown in 2005 (Braun et al., 2005), syndapin I and II interact with EHD proteins but syndapin III does not because it lacks the required binding interface. This information is now included in the revised manuscript (including the additional references on this).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Hansen et al. also found a reduction of caveolae after knockdown of PACSIN II, but, in contrast to the present study, an increase of caveolin and cavin proteins in the membrane whereas in the current study, only cavin1 staining was increased in EM stainings of syndapin III KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Careful reading of the Hansen et al., 2011 paper leaves one with a picture more complicated than summarized by the reviewer, it seems. Hansen et al. indeed described some reduction of caveolae (defined as morphological profiles resembling caveolae in 2D) upon Pacsin2 RNAi. In contrast to that, however, the mean fluorescence intensity of the anti-cav1 and of the anti-cav2 staining per cell in TIRF images was reported as increased in the portion of RNAi cells selected for analysis due to their lower Pacsin2 epifluorescence. However, there was no statistical significance reported despite a 2fold (cav2) to 3fold (cav1) increase (Figure 6 in Hansen et al., 2011).</p><p>The CAVIN-1 data (Figure 7 in Hansen et al., 2011) is even harder to interpret, as it is presented as cav1/CAVIN-1 ratio. The curve maximum of intensity distributions per cell was shifted from about 0.33 in control to 0.42 in RNAi cells – thus by about a third (yet, this increase was described as decrease in the legend and text) – again lacking a statistical significance. It furthermore remains somewhat unclear to the reader what the cav1/CAVIN-1 ratio increase from 0.33 to 0.42 means for the absolute summed up CAVIN-1 signal per cell and for the anti-CAVIN-1 signal per cell membrane area (density) considering that cav1 levels were increased by factor 3. From this, it has to be concluded that there must have been more CAVIN-1 because with factor 3 more cav1 the maximum in the cav1/CAVIN-1 distribution curve (Figure 7 in Hansen et al., 2011) would have had to rise to about 0.9 instead of only reaching 0.42 in Pascin2 RNAi cells. Since the findings reported in Hansen et al., 2011 are difficult to report and interpret, the revised manuscript now very carefully describes and cites these particular observations of Hansen et al., 2011. We hope that the reviewer is content with the description and wording.</p><p>Apart from that, it has to be noted that Hansen et al. studied Pacsin2/syndapin II in HeLa and NIH3T3 cells and not syndapin III in muscle cells, as we did. The reviewer pointed out him/herself, that syndapin II will use molecular mechanisms completely different from those of syndapin III, as syndapin II can interact with the caveolar component EHD2, whereas syndapin III is unable to associate with EHD proteins (Braun et al., 2005).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thus, instead of invoking a decreased formation of caveolae in the absence of syndapin III, one could explain the syndapin III ko phenotype also by an increased uptake of caveolae in the absence of syndapins III. The authors should address this issue by directly looking at caveolar dynamics in primary wt and syndapins III ko cardiomyoctes or muscle cells overexpressing caveolin-3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully thought about the idea of the reviewer. It remained somewhat unclear to us how to relate the idea of a putatively increased uptake to the fact that we observed constant levels or even slightly increased levels of cav3 and CAVIN-1 at the plasma membrane (which are in line with increased or similar levels of cav1 and CAVIN-1 in HeLa cells described by Hansen et al. 2011).</p><p>Furthermore, one has to take into account two aspects: First, TIRF formally does not show internalization (which in other cell biological uptake processes e.g. can be proven by pH-sensitive tools or assays tracking chemical labeling access from the outside) but just addresses presence or disappearance from a TIRF zone, which is about 100-200 nm in depth. It thus usually remains open whether the fluorescence signal dissolves in the membrane (lateral dispersion of coat components), complexes disassemble in 3D (i.e. including dispersion into the cytosol), or whether a given signal leaves the TIRF zone by trafficking of some membrane compartment. Also, it remains unclear what the start situation is. Since the width of the PM is only 6-10 nm, not 200 nm, cortically localized, vesicle-docked components can reside in a TIRF zone without ever having been part of the PM.</p><p>Second, analyses of overexpressed GFP-cav3 seemed not advisable for two reasons: i) Hayer et al. 2010 (J. Cell Biol.) have revisited and extensively analyzed live imaging approaches and documented that live-imaging with GFP-caveolin leads to all sorts of artifacts, mainly to aberrant localizations of the fusion protein to non-caveolar surface pools as well as to different organelles of endosomal nature. The authors explicitly stated that even low expression (only 4-5 h after transfection!) is enough to cause these mislocalizations. ii) The low transfection rates achievable with primary cardiomyocytes or even with cultured muscle cell, as suggested by the reviewer, would lead to low n-numbers of cells accessible for analysis.</p><p>We thus rather concentrated on the endogenous protein and on the physiologically relevant situation in skeletal muscles to further address the idea of the reviewer that caveolae internalization is changed upon <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO and analyzed the intensity of intracellular cav3. The intracellular cav3 levels in muscle cells turned out to be unchanged, as addressed by quantitative immunofluorescence analyses of skeletal muscle sections (newly added Figure 12I of the revised manuscript).</p><p>These data are in line with the biochemical and EM data presented in our manuscript. The findings that the Triton-insoluble pool of cav3 was not changed (Figure 11R, 12K) and that the plasma membrane-associated pool was not changed in <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO animals (Figure 3O, 11Q and 12H,L) can only be related to the also unchanged general expression levels of cav3 (Figure 5), if also the intracellular pool of cav3 was unchanged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 3: A double staining of syndapin III and caveolin3 was used to prove the localization of sydapin III to caveolae. However, in the KO example picture (i), it is difficult to see the cav3 staining. More micrographs, especially for the KO, and the same magnifications for wt and KO should be used to support the result.</p></disp-quote><p>As documented by the bars (in both h and i panels 100 nm), the magnifications of WT and KO are identical.</p><p>We acknowledge that the anti-cav3 labels (10 nm gold) in Figure 3H and I – although highlighted by arrowheads – may have been hard to see. We have therefore now highlighted them with blue color (and the anti-syndapin III labels with red color) (revised Figure 3H,I).</p><p>We hope that the reviewer will agree with us that this makes it much easier to see the localization of cav3 and cav3 clusters as well as the cav3/syndapin III colocalization at caveolar structures, at shallow membrane indentations and at flat membrane areas. The unlabeled raw data sets are presented in the additionally added Figure 3—figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>As far as some more data on colocalization of syndapin III with cav3 is concerned, we would also like to refer the reviewer to the quantitative analyses of confocal images of transversal muscle sections in the newly added Figure 1Q of the revised manuscript and to the analyses of longitudinal sections shown in the newly added Figure 12E-J. Furthermore we specified the frequency of colabeling at cav3 puncta in such longitudinal sections at the light microscopical level (newly added Figure 12M,N). Furthermore, we used quantitative electron microscopy to work this out in more detail (newly added Figure 3J (cardiomyocytes) and Figure 12C (skeletal muscle) of the revised manuscript).</p><p>Since the reviewer also requested to show even larger membrane areas to document the reduction of cav3-positive caveolar invaginations upon <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO (already the previous manuscript presented an enlarged membrane area when compared to WT to visualize this finding of our quantitative analyses), we furthermore added another KO picture to Figure 3I so that the revised Figure 3 now contains the panels I and I’. Besides this addition to the main manuscript, we also added the WT image of the large membrane area, from which the small insets (Figure 3H’ and H’’) have been taken, to the Supplements (newly added Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors found no significant difference between WT and KO cav3 staining at the plasma membrane (m). However, electron microscopy may not be the best method to quantitatively evaluate protein densities if different cellular structures (e.g. invaginations versus flat membranes) with potentially different accessibilities of the antibody epitopes are stained. As described in point 1, some light microscopy-based methods would be desirable to support the claims of the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer considered it important to corroborate the findings we obtained by sophisticated EM methods not only by standard EM techniques and biochemical examinations but also by further light microscopical analyses, the revised manuscript now further strengthens our results with several light microscopical evaluations: The cav3 levels at the plasma membrane of muscle cells remained identical upon <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO and the intracellular cav3 levels also remained identical upon <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO (consistent with EM and quantitative biochemical examinations showing similar general expression and Triton-resistant levels of cav3) (newly added Figure 12H,L of the revised manuscript).</p><p>Quantitative, confocal analyses of longitudinal muscle sections furthermore revealed that also the cav3 content in “puncta” at the plasma membrane was similar in WT and syndapin KO muscle fibers (newly added Figure 12J of the revised manuscript).</p><p>In general, different accessibilities of antibodies at different places could of course always be a problem. This criticism of the reviewer, however, applies to all antibody-based methods in life sciences.</p><p>Furthermore, immunofluorescence labeling and imaging due to its low sensitivity for single molecules and due to its low resolution (especially in Z) is susceptible to thresholding and 3D artefacts.</p><p>More classical imaging methods, such as confocal microscopy, TIRF or even TEM of sections fail to firmly prove that an antibody label, i.e. the protein of interest, is not just by chance in the vicinity of the membrane (confocal, about 100-300 nm; TIRF area, 100-200 nm; TEM, resolution easily reaches 1-2 nm but antibody extensions are about 20 nm and no selection is obtained at the level of sample preparation). As explained in the manuscript, these disadvantages are circumvented by freeze-fracturing (only membrane-inserted material remains) and immunogold labeling (excellent resolution in Y,X and by shadowing, table tilting and/or tomography also good resolution in Z). Thus, quantitative analysis of immunogold labeled, freeze-fractured replica is a very accurate method of analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are Cav3 and cavin 1 still clustered?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the revised manuscript, Figure 3I, Figure 4F and Figure 5H suggest that this still is the case for both cav3 and CAVIN-1 at the plasma membrane in cardiomyocytes. More importantly, also in the tissue context (Figure 11N (heart) and Figure 12B (skeletal muscle)), cav3 clusters prevail upon <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO.</p><p>As this aspect may be of some mechanistic importance, we conducted a detailed cav3 cluster analysis directly in tissue samples of skeletal muscles. Interestingly, <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO led to a small (-7%) but significant drop of the density of cav3 within clusters accompanied with a reduction of cav3 clusters at the plasma membrane. Thus, syndapin III either directly or indirectly seems to have some importance for cav3 clustering, too (newly added Figure 12S,T).</p><p>Additional CAVIN-1 analyses at freeze-fractured muscle membranes unfortunately were not possible for technical reasons and/or CAVIN-1 in muscle cells shows too low expression. In fact, confocal immunofluorescence analyses of skeletal muscles suggested that CAVIN-1 expression is low at plasma membranes of muscle cells suggesting that a large part of the anti-CAVIN-1 immunosignal that one can e.g. see in western blotting of muscle samples predominantly may actually stem from satellite and endothelial cells (our unpublished results). We were, however, able to address the clustering of CAVIN-1 in dissociated <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO cardiomyocytes. Importantly, CAVIN-1 clusters clearly remained present in <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO and the density of CAVIN-1 immunolabels in the clusters increased accordingly to the overall increase of CAVIN-1 at the plasma membrane (newly added Figure 5J). Thus, even clustered cav3 and CAVIN-1 at the plasma membrane is not sufficient for bringing about caveolae, if syndapin III is absent.</p><p>In fact the CAVIN-1 cluster densities even increased (newly added Figure 5K). This may be caused by the increased levels of CAVIN-1 at the plasma membrane already described in the previous version of the manuscript (Figure 5I). An increased percentage of the more abundant CAVIN-1 clusters in <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO cardiomyocytes, however, were cav3-negative (newly added Figure 5L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Surface invaginations, caveolae, and syndapin III.</p><p>The authors use freeze-fracture and immunogold analysis to detect caveolae and the presence of syndapin III and caveolin3 at invaginations.

In muscles, 19% of all invaginations are double-positive for syndapin III and cav3, i.e. almost all syndapin III-positive structures also are positive for cav3 (newly added Figure 12C).</p><p>In both cases, all of these double-labelled invaginations are of caveolar morphology (newly added Figure 3J and 12C).</p><p>Additional analyses at the light microscopical level confirmed this. 32% of all cav3-enriched fields/puncta at the plasma membrane of longitudinal muscle sections were positive for syndapin III (newly added Figure 12M,N).</p><p>Hansen et al., 2011 reported that in cell lines “Co-staining of pacsin 2 and caveolin 1 revealed that many, but not all, caveolin 1 puncta also contain pacsin 2 (Figure 2A). Approximately 35% of caveolin 1 puncta were positive for pacsin2”. Thus, our quantitative data for muscle tissues and cav3/syndapin III seem to be consistent with the estimation reported for the syndapin II isoform and cav1 in non-muscle cells at the light microscopical level.</p><p>The (very low) abundance of the non-caveolar invaginations we detected was not significantly affected by <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO. In both cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle tissue, there was no statistically significant difference between WT and KO (newly added Figures 3M and 12D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since EM techniques allow only for fractions of cell surface areas to be examined, it would be informative to additionally determine the fraction of Sdp III-positive cav1- or cavin1-positive puncta on the surface of cultured cells using immunofluorescence of endogenous proteins (as in #2 above).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer probably means cav3 and not cav1, as we have demonstrated that cav1 and syndapin III are not coexpressed. Figure 4 shows that cav1 is only present in non-muscle cells and cav3 and syndapin III are expressed in muscle cells.</p><p>In case of cav3, as already described above, we conducted such immunofluorescence analyses during our revision work and observed that at the level of light microscopical resolution 32% of all anti-cav3 puncta are immunopositive for endogenous syndapin III in confocal microscopy analyses of longitudinal muscle sections (please see newly added Figure 12M,N). As also already mentioned above, this is somewhat reminiscent of the estimation reported by Hansen et al., 2011 for syndapin II/Pacsin2 and cav1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Caveolar and non-caveolar functions of caveolar coat components.</p><p>Knockout of Syndapin III/Pacsin3 causes loss of morphological caveolae, but not of caveolins or cavins. Based on this finding, the authors strongly emphasize that this situation uniquely allows them to disentangle the regulatory/signaling functions of caveolar coat components from the physiological role of caveolae as invaginated membrane structures. However, in this study they do not directly compare syndapin III/Pacsin3 knockout mice with caveolin3 knockout mice side-by-side and rely for their comparison on data from other studies. The authors state that &quot;… syndapin III KO skeletal muscles showed pathological parameters upon physical exercise that are also found in CAVEOLIN3 mutation-associated diseases.&quot;, i.e. the effects of syndapin III KO are similar to a loss of caveolin3 function. We are surprised that such strong emphasis is placed on the separation of the functions of caveolar invaginations vs coat components, when no dramatic differences were found. This point could be addressed by text changes alone.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the changes we made to the revised manuscript will help to prevent such misunderstandings. The skeletal muscle defects mirror cav3 defects, i.e. indeed reflect the loss of caveolar functions.</p><p>In contrast, e.g. in the heart and in the case of ERK1/2 signaling, the results of <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO – despite the strong reduction of caveolar structures – do NOT mirror the effects of caveolin deficiency. This strongly suggest that those impairments observed upon caveolin deficiency rather reflect a lack of caveolin at the membrane (or are indirect consequences of this) rather than reflecting a loss of caveolar structures and their functions. Thus, here we can for the first time dissect biological functions of caveolar invagination from those merely reflecting caveolin presence. For understanding the pathophysiology of caveolinopathies this is of utmost importance. Also, it may focus therapeutic efforts at parameters one may actually have a chance of influencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) DRM association of dystrophin and dystroglycan (Figure 8).</p><p>The authors cite previous work that loss of caveolin3 has been associated with loss of DRM association of the dystrophin-glycoportein complex and therefore aimed at testing whether syndapin III KO caused a similar defect. In their experiments, however, even in wt animals, neither dystrophin nor β-dystroglycan floated on density gradients (Figure 8 C,E). Since there was no DRM association in lysates from WT tissues, it is impossible to determine or conclude whether syndapin III is necessary for DRM association of dystrophin or β-dystroglycan. DRM association depends on the sample/detergent ratio, the precise lysis conditions, and is therefore difficult to interpret, even more so when no DRM association is observed. In our view panels c-f do not provide significant insight and should be removed from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right. Indeed we found it quite surprising that the DRM association of dystrophin and β-dystroglycan reported in the literature obviously is not robust and therefore a hard to interpret caveolin loss-of-function phenotype. Although we think that the reviewer will agree with us that the results we obtained were correctly described in the previous version of the manuscript, we omitted these findings from the revised manuscript, as the reviewer requested (please see revised Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) DRM association of cav3 and flotillin (Figure 7).</p><p>Figure 7 shows that Sdp III KO causes a change in flotation behavior of caveolin3 where the floating fraction(s) shift by two fractions towards the bottom of the gradient in Sdp III KO tissues: From fraction 3 to 5 in skeletal muscle, and from 4-6 in the heart. Flotillin1, which should not be associated with caveolar membranes, also shifts by two fractions towards the bottom of the gradient in KO tissues. The authors find support for their model that Sdp III is required specifically for organizing cav3-containing membrane domains. One could equally conclude that Sdp III is required for organizing flotillin1-containing membrane domains. Could the authors explain why they are convinced Sdp III is not involved in organizing flotillin1-containing membrane domains?</p><p>However, rather than questioning the specific role of Sdp III in caveola formation, to me this demonstrates how little can be concluded from DRM association assays. Flotillin1 might associate with caveolin-containing membranes post lysis during the centrifugation and its co-floating and shifting with cav3 may not have any biological meaning. Figure 7D-I in our view add little information to the manuscript. In the future (not required here), a more informative way for assessing the assembly state of the caveolar coat could be velocity gradients as used by the Helenius and Nichols labs (PMID: 20070607, PMID: 24013648).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her advice on future biochemical examinations using velocity gradients instead of classical DRM association assays.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that DRM association assays indeed often are difficult to interpret and that flotillin associations even may be post lysis. Although this would still suggest that some alterations of the protein/lipid composition and/or the organization of cav3-containing membrane domains occur upon <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO (and only this point was made by the flotillin observation in the previous manuscript), we followed the advice of the reviewer and let out the flotillin data to not confuse readers (revised Figure 7D-G).</p><p>Whether the flotillin effects are post-lysis artifacts, are indirectly somehow dependent on cav/lipid/syndapin III nanodomains or are independently caused by <italic>syndapin III</italic> KO, can currently not be answered and would be way beyond the scope of the current manuscript focusing on caveolar invagination and caveolar function in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The manuscript contains many experiments, but the organization is sometimes confusing and difficult to follow. For example, the authors often jump in between tissue and cell culture experiments for heart and muscle. It may be easier to show the immuno-stainings of syndapins III in heart and muscle directly behind the cardiomyocyte stainings (e.g. combine Figure 1, 4, 11, 12).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that our manuscript contains a lot of data and it is acknowledged that some of the figures, such as Figure 4 and 9 (maybe even Figure 8 and 11 as well) in other high-profile journals only accepting fewer main figures could probably have been supplementary figures rather than integrated into the main manuscript as it is the policy of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Our report starts with the discovery of a striking cell biological phenotype of a new KO mouse and then in detail and step by step unveils the mechanistic principles behind these impairment to provide a full picture of the cell biological and molecular details. Finally, after the cell biology is understood, the manuscript then reports on examinations addressing the physiological relevance at the animal level. In your eyes, this design of our study and this structure of our manuscript is very much appropriate for a high-ranking journal, such as <italic>eLife</italic>, which publishes comprehensive studies on important cell biological processes.</p><p>To organize the data a little bit more according to the cellular system analyzed and less according to scientific question, as the reviewer suggested, we have moved the biochemical examinations of cav3 in heart and skeletal muscles, which previously was part of the cardiomyocyte-Figure 3 into the figures that deal with heart tissue analyses (Figure 11) and with examinations of cav3 and caveolar functions in skeletal muscle tissues (Figure 12), respectively (inserted panels Figure 11R and 12K (from Figure 3N,O).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be easier to first describe the localization of syndapin III at caveolae before showing the reduced caveolar numbers in syndapin III ko cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The localization of syndapin III at caveolae is shown before the reduced numbers of caveolae in syndapin III cells are examined and described in detail. Please see Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplements and the respective Results text of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The previously described localization of syndapin II at caveolae should be mentioned in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to move cited work on other syndapin isoforms – especially on syndapin II and cav1 – forward from Results and Discussion into the Introduction. However, the introduction focuses on CAV3 mutations and caveolinopathies and not on syndapins. Therefore, we did not find a reasonable solution for including information on the other syndapin isoforms and their similar and different functions and their different protein properties without disrupting the flow of the Introduction or expanding its length significantly. We hope the reviewer will be content with the changes we made to the revised manuscript to discuss work on syndapin II.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: The immunofluorescence experiments in c-e and i are difficult to recognize, the size of the pictures should be increased.</p></disp-quote><p>All of these panels have been slightly increased in size in the revised manuscript (see revised Figure 1C-E, I). In addition, the localization of syndapin III in membrane folds and mCherry-F-marked plasma membrane domains can now be seen better in a magnified inset placed into the revised Figure 1E.</p><p>The increased Figure 1C-E and Figure 1I panels can in addition be found at significantly higher magnification in the Supplements (newly added Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also the pictures in p and q are difficult to analyze – it would be helpful if colocalisation of syndapin III and caveolin3 was investigated in more detail, e.g. using increased magnification during confocal microscopy, colocalisation analysis within ImageJ or ZEN software (see above).</p></disp-quote><p>We have done this in two ways. First, we did not just run colocalization analyses on the images 1p and 1q shown, as the reviewer suggested, but conducted systematic analyses of transversal muscle sections and in total analyzed 230 PM ROIs and 160 intracellular ROIs. For the plasma membrane, the Pearson coefficient was positive and very high (0.55). Intracellularly, the correlation was just random, i.e. around zero (0.08). These quantitative analyses of the localization of cav3 and syndapin III in confocal image stacks of transversally cut skeletal muscles are now included in the revised manuscript (newly added Figure 1Q).</p><p>Second, we have analyzed the frequency of syndapin III in cav3-positive membrane domains in more detail using EM (newly added Figure 3J (cardiomyocytes) and newly added Figure 12C (skeletal muscle)) as well as by additionally employing confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of longitudinal sections of skeletal muscles to further increase the resolution of such light microscopical colocalization studies (newly added Figure 12E-G,J). Also these different colocalization studies were evaluated quantitatively.</p><p>The confocal microscopy analyses clearly showed the presence of syndapin III at a subpopulation of caveolae (Pearson coefficient for 60 puncta ROIs in longitudinal sections still positive, 0.3; newly added Figure 12E-G). Depending on the biological systems analyzed, the frequencies of syndapin III labeling also were very good. 32% of the endogenous anti-cav3 puncta were also positive for syndapin III at the lower light microscopical resolution (newly added Figure 12m,n). At the EM, level, syndapin III immunolabeling was observed at 20% of all invaginations in cryo-preserved and freeze-fractured skeletal muscles (all of caveolae-like profile; 19% also proven to represent caveolar structures by cav3 association; newly added Figure 12C) and at 59% of all invaginations in cardiomyocytes (58% caveolae-like syndapin III-positive, only 1% non-caveolar and syndapin III-positive; newly added Figure 3J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: As the authors acknowledge, the displayed EM pictures are of rather bad quality, so that caveolae cannot be precisely distinguished. Are these pictures essential?</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that also the reviewer will acknowledge that it is not the images presented that are of bad quality but that this type of analysis just has several technique-immanent limitations. This is also what we wrote in the manuscript. The pictures therefore just highlight these technique-immanent limitations.</p><p>Furthermore, TEM of sections is a standard method used in the field and we therefore had to compare our phenotypical analysis with this standard technique additionally to presenting the much more informative, quantitative analysis of large areas of membrane by immunolabeling of freeze-fractured samples – i.e. use a more sophisticated method only few labs in the world have established.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: The western blots for syndapin I (d) are difficult to interpret because the GAPDH signal used as loading control is very weak and no GAPDH band can be detected for the heart lysates – the authors used 50 ug/lane, so there should be a very strong signal for GAPDH.

The authors therefore claim that syndapin III is responsible for the invagination process.

How can invagination be supported by syndapin III, if it is not found around the whole neck of caveolae? The authors should comment on this in their discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Obviously much less syndapin than caveolin coat proteins are needed for invagination. This is expected because syndapin III is not a general coat component, as seen in the tomographs.</p><p>It is conceivable that induction of membrane curvature at a nanodomain (generated by syndapin III self-association) is enough to trigger caveolin coat assembly and/or bending. Once such an invagination is triggered, the coat component cav3 (presumably with the help of further factors) may then propagate this further.
