Methanol or formalin-fixed specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs, then soaked in solutions containing the photo-tag: 4-benzoylbenzyl-glycyl-hexahistidine. Confocal imaging along with two photon excitation are used to covalently couple photo-tags to all proteins within each ROI, to a resolution of 0.67 µm in the xy-plane and 1.48 µm axially. After tissue solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. As a test case, we examined amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and a post-mortem AD case, confirming known plaque constituents and discovering new ones.

In many of these diseases, toxic proteins accumulate in the brain and build up as small ‘plaques’ in the gaps, or synapses, that cells called neurons communicate across. Eventually, the plaques prevent the neurons signaling to each other correctly, leading to problems such as memory loss.</p><p>Identifying the proteins present in plaques is technically challenging, partly because the plaques are very small. Hadley, Rakhit et al. have now developed a new method called spatially targeted optical microproteomics (or STOMP) that can collect proteins from small areas of cells. In this method, plaques are identified under a light microscope, and their contents are attached to a molecule called a photo-affinity tag using lasers. The photo-tagged proteins are then pulled out using beads that specifically bind to the photo-affinity tag. The proteins can then be identified using a well-established method called mass spectrometry.</p><p>Hadley, Rakhit et al. used STOMP to analyze plaques present in the brains of mice that develop similar symptoms to those seen in humans with Alzheimer's disease. This revealed that these plaques contain more than 50 different proteins, some of which had not previously been found in plaques. In particular, several proteins from the ‘presynaptic’ neuron that sends signals across the synapse were found in the plaques. However, no proteins from the receiving (‘postsynaptic’) neuron on the other side of the synapse were present in the plaque.</p><p>Fixed human brain tissue is more difficult to analyze than mouse samples because it is modified for storage. In spite of these issues, Hadley, Rakhit et al. successfully also used STOMP to identify the proteins in human plaques. STOMP can be used to identify the proteins present in any area of a cell and thus has the potential to be widely used by scientists, not just those studying plaques.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09579.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09579.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>confocal microscopy</kwd><kwd>mass spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>protein misfolding</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009017</institution-id><institution>ALS Society of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bernice Ramsay Discovery Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rakhit</surname><given-names>Rishi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hadley</surname><given-names>Kevin C</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>STOMP is a technique that can determine the proteomic composition of any feature that is identifiable by laser scanning microscopy and is at least one cubic micron in size.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pathological protein deposits have a long history as hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease. Early methods used to identify these deposits include the silver stain introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Golgi (1873)</xref>, and Virchow's iodine–sulfuric acid stain for starch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Virchow, 1854</xref>) that led to the coining of the term amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Virchow, 1855</xref>). More specialized stains and labels have emerged which have begun to probe the structure and composition of pathological protein deposits. The stains Congo red and thioflavin S (ThS) were discovered later and remain in use (reviewed by Westermark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sipe and Westermark, 2005</xref>) and Tanskanen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tanskanen, 2013</xref>)), specifically identifying deposits containing a particular structural motif: amyloid β-pleated sheets. Beyond mere detection lies comprehensive identification of the protein components of these deposits; biochemical analyses of the deposits have produced transformative results in the field of neurodegeneration research. Two classic examples include the discovery of the prion protein and formulation of the protein-only hypothesis of prion disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolton et al., 1982</xref>), and the discovery of the Alzheimer amyloid peptide (Aβ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Glenner and Wong, 1984</xref>) and formulation of the amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD, reviewed by Musiek and Holtzman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Musiek and Holtzman, 2015</xref>)). More recently, there was the discovery that the RNA/DNA binding protein TDP-43 (transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa) is a significant component of ubiquitin-positive intraneuronal inclusions in certain cases of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Neumann et al., 2006</xref>). This discovery helped establish these diseases as spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mackenzie, 2007</xref>), it led to the identification of TDP-43 mutations that are causative for ALS and FTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sreedharan et al., 2008</xref>) and established a role for RNA metabolism in ALS/FTD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lagier-Tourenne and Cleveland, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mackenzie et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Identification of the protein components of pathological deposits has traditionally involved the partial biochemical purification of detergent-insoluble proteins present in a tissue specimen followed by protein sequencing. Immunohistochemical methods are then used to confirm that the identified proteins are bona fide constituents of the pathological deposits. These methods require large amounts of sometimes-scarce pathological tissue and identification of novel protein components can require increasingly elaborate, time-consuming, and costly protocols. For example, the discovery of TDP-43 in ubiquitin-positive intraneuronal inclusions required the generation of ∼1000 monoclonal antibodies, which were used to screen thousands of tissue sections by immunohistochemistry, to obtain a single monoclonal antibody that specifically labeled ubiquitin-positive intraneuronal inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Neumann et al., 2006</xref>). That antibody was used for the proteomic identification of TDP-43 from the detergent-insoluble fraction of pathological tissue homogenates, and confirmatory staining with commercial TDP-43 antibodies was required for validation. In addition to being costly and labor intensive, another major limitation of biochemical purification of protein deposits is that soluble protein components associated with the core aggregates are likely to be lost during fractionation. Identifying deposit-associated soluble proteins could further our understanding of disease mechanisms.</p><p>A different strategy that can preserve some of the deposit-associated soluble proteins is laser capture microdissection (LCM), in which protein deposits are lifted intact out of sections of the fixed specimen; their protein compositions are then determined by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gozal et al., 2006</xref>). The resolution of LCM is ∼10 µm in the horizontal plane and captures the entire thickness of the tissue section along the vertical axis. Thus, for features smaller than ∼10 µm—such as inclusion bodies, small amyloid plaques, narrow fibers, and other irregularly shaped structures—LCM analysis permits enrichment but not complete isolation of target proteins; samples are diluted with extraneous surrounding material. For example, when capturing even a relatively large—3 μm in diameter—inclusion body with a single 10 µm LCM spot, only ∼10% of the recovered protein is from the pathology and 90% from the surrounding cellular milieu. LCM has nevertheless proven useful, however, in the proteomic analysis of systemic amyloidosis, where the amyloid deposits are very large and the feature size is typically ∼50,000 μm<sup>2</sup> in area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sethi et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2013</xref>).</p><p>Mass spectrometry imaging and its variants can also provide spatially resolved mass spectrometry analysis by directly coupling imaging with laser ablation and achieving 1 mm–10 μm resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stoeckli et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wiseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wucher et al., 2007</xref>), but it is usually used to look for specific targets rather than in discovery mode.</p><p>Recently, proximity labeling techniques such as Bio-ID and APEX have provided high spatial resolution to mass spectrometry, and these techniques have been used to elucidate the composition of several difficult to purify organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Roux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Firat-Karalar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hung et al., 2014</xref>). However, proximity labeling relies on genetic manipulations to express an exogenous fusion protein to label adjacent components; this protein must be specifically and accurately targeted into a particular biological structure. Imperfect localization, especially in rare structures, results in selective labeling of neighbors outside of the target region yielding false positive associations.</p><p>Many of these approaches have been brought to bear on amyloid (senile) plaques in AD brain tissue, in an attempt to identify core components, if any, in addition to Aβ. Early LCM studies utilizing 2D gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry have detected a modest number of plaque-associated proteins, including an assortment of proteins associated with cell signaling, chaperone function, membrane trafficking, and proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liao et al., 2004</xref>). A more recent LCM study has suggested that amyloid plaques in AD are highly homogenous structures that are composed almost exclusively of Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Söderberg et al., 2006</xref>). The latter study, however, employed sample washing steps with 1% SDS, which may strip away soluble plaque-associated proteins. Finally, a recent attempt to capture more plaque-associated proteins potentially lost to LCM examined the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of brain samples from patients with AD and appropriate controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gozal et al., 2009</xref>). Altered levels of eleven specific proteins were identified by this approach but colocalization with amyloid plaques was difficult to validate in many cases—not all insoluble proteins within the brain will necessarily originate from senile plaques. A recent proteomic analysis of fractions obtained from differential centrifugation procedures that yield fractions enriched in post-synaptic proteins have demonstrated that the post-synaptic protein IRSp53 was highly down-regulated in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). While extant LCM and biochemical fractionation studies have identified candidate plaque-associated proteins, significant mechanistic insights have not been produced.</p><p>We have developed a semi-automated technique called spatially targeted optical microproteomics (STOMP), which combines two-photon laser scanning microscopy with photochemical affinity labeling and mass spectrometry. While two-photon excitation has previously been used to drive microscopic, 3D-resolved photochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2008</xref>), STOMP represents the first application of this technique to affinity photolabeling, offering single-micron-scale three-dimensional resolution that is an order of magnitude better than the current state of the art LCM. In addition to providing clues to the etiology of neurodegenerative disease, this new proteomic technique also has great potential to advance research in cell biology by yielding the composition of small features that are not amenable to biochemical purification.</p><p>We sought to create an unbiased discovery technique that would: (1) have high spatial resolution, (2) target any identifiable or user-defined spatial region in a biological sample, (3) forgo the need for genetic modification, (4) have sufficient sensitivity to detect minor species within the sample, and (5) have sufficient specificity such that most hits can be readily validated as being enriched in the biological structure of interest. Because STOMP does not require genetic manipulation, this technique is applicable to a large variety of biological samples that run the gamut from cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, human biopsy samples to fixed post-mortem human tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The STOMP technique</title><p>In STOMP, laser light from the microscope is used not only to image the fluorescently stained specimen, but also to photochemically crosslink affinity purification ligands to protein components within pathological deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The photo-affinity ligand or photo-tag used here is a peptide of sequence: 4-benzoylbenzyl-Gly-His-His-His-His-His-His-CONH<sub>2</sub> (6HisBP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Benzoylbenzene is a photoreactive group that forms covalent bonds with C–H and N–H groups upon excitation. The 6HisBP photo-tag molecule (molecular mass, 1105 Da) is of similar size to Congo red (molecular mass, 697 Da) and should have a similar ability to penetrate biological specimens. The specimen is fixed and permeabilized in methanol, then protein deposits in the specimen are selectively stained using antibodies or specific fluorescent dyes. The specimen is then soaked in a solution of 6HisBP to saturate the subcellular compartments with the photo-tag, and imaged using conventional confocal microscopy. The wavelength of the confocal laser is in the visible range and does not excite the UV-absorbing photo-tag. Optical sectioning by confocal microscopy is used to collect a 3D image of the protein deposits in the specimen. This image in turn is used to generate a list of spatial coordinates—a ‘mask’ file—identifying every point in the tissue containing pathological protein deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09579.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of STOMP technology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram comparing volumes selected for excision by laser capture microdissection (LCM) (yellow cylinder) and spatially targeted optical microproteomics (STOMP) (blue volume).

Histidine-rich proteins ubiquitous in all mammalian tissues represent potential contaminants that could bind the nickel affinity beads and confound the STOMP analysis. To circumvent this problem, the first step of the procedure involves limited treatment of the tissue sections with dilute diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). DEPC covalently modifies histidyl residues that abolishes their ability to bind nickel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wallis and Holbrook, 1973</xref>).</p><p>After completion of the photo-tagging step, the specimen is solubilized in buffer containing 2% SDS, 8 M urea, and β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME). The photo-tagged proteins are purified using nickel affinity beads that bind the hexahistidyl moiety of 6HisBP. The purified proteins are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and identified by database searching spectra from peptides resulting from digestion and liquid-chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The resolution of STOMP</title><p>To establish the spatial resolution limits of our photo-tagging procedure, we tagged single-voxel spots within sections of methanol-fixed murine brain tissue.

These mice express a human form of the amyloid precursor protein carrying two mutations associated with familial AD, and they produce amyloid plaques and exhibit spatial learning impairments by 3 months of age. This study used frozen sections (post-fixed in methanol) of the brains known to contain plaques, from TgCRND8 mice of 8 months of age.</p><p>Sets of serial sections on separate slides were treated with DEPC, stained with ThS, and soaked in a solution of 6HisBP. Slides were imaged by confocal microscopy to identify ThS-positive amyloid deposits. Confocal images of ThS-positive amyloid deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C1</xref>) were used to construct individual masks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C2</xref>). Because our technique hinges on selective photolabeling and purification, we needed to assess the extent of non-specific labeling of 6HisBP in ambient light and under immunofluorescence excitation, as well as non-specific binding to affinity purification beads. Adjacent sections were put aside as ‘dark’ controls used to assess the extent of non-specific labeling of 6HisBP to proteins caused by confocal laser light (488 nm) exposure or other handling, and to assess nonspecific binding of proteins to nickel affinity beads.</p><p>The STOMP macro was used to deliver two-photon excitation light to regions of the specimen corresponding to each pixel in the mask image. This excitation light has two effects. First, and most importantly, it photo-activates 6HisBP molecules that are in the amyloid deposits causing photo-tagging of constituent proteins. Second, it serendipitously photo-bleaches the ThS fluorophores present in regions of the specimen targeted by the mask. Immunofluorescence staining of the tissue section with anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibody after photo-activation superimposes on the digital mask, thus highlighting the very high accuracy of targeting of the two-photon laser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C3</xref>). STOMP combines microscopy with selective photo-labeling to accurately resolve, capture, and affinity-label highly irregular shaped micron-scale structures, via a semi-automated procedure.</p><p>After solubilization of the specimen, the photo-tagged proteins were bound to nickel affinity beads. Each sample was divided into two portions: one used for mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and one for gel electrophoresis and silver staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The dark control sample, which—aside from two-photon excitation—was treated identically to the STOMP sample, was run alongside the STOMP sample. It shows very few bands in the silver-stain gel from material bound to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) beads compared to the STOMP sample, confirming that nonspecific photo-tagging and nonspecific binding of proteins to the nickel affinity beads is minimal. In addition to a number of proteins ranging in molecular weight from 20 kDa to &gt;250 kDa, the STOMP sample contains large amounts of a low molecular weight protein that was subsequently identified as Aβ (4.5 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09579.007</object-id><label>Table

additional control, an entire brain section fixed in methanol and soaked with photo-tag was photo-activated by exposure to 365 nm ultraviolet light. Section-wide photo-activation of this specimen caused indiscriminate photo-tagging of proteins in the specimen.

Greater amounts of tissue will increase sensitivity and enable identification of lower abundance proteins, particularly in very complex samples containing a large number of unique proteins. In this study, we were able to identify proteins present in relative abundance in the pathological feature being examined using a total photo-tagged volume of approximately 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> µm<sup>3</sup>. (This corresponds to a photo-tagged region of 500 µm × 500 µm in an 8-µm thick tissue section or a cube of photo-tagged tissue 130 μm on a side.) Lowering the stringency will increase the number of hits but may introduce more false positives. Two frozen sections of TgCRND8 brain tissue were sufficient to produce the necessary volume of photo-tagged tissue required for one STOMP experiment, and the process required a total of 12–16 hr of microscope time per sample (6–8 hr per section).</p><p>Based on our determination of the resolution of STOMP, regions of interest (ROIs) as small as 0.38 µm can be analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

As expected, the most abundant protein found in STOMP from TgCRND8 mouse plaques was Aβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In addition to Aβ, we identified 454 proteins in at least one of two biological replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Combining our biological and technical replicates with our negative controls (‘dark’ samples and replicates), we used the Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINT) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2011</xref>), which uses Bayesian inference to assign a probability of a true interaction, using Aβ as the bait protein. We found 62 proteins with probability &gt;0.8 of being found associated with the plaques, and 146 with probability &gt;0.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Among these, synaptosomal proteins were highly enriched, including SNAP25, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), vesicular proton pump ATPase (v-ATPase), and synapsins 1 and 2. Apolipoprotein E, which is sometimes associated with senile plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thal et al., 1997</xref>), was also detected, albeit at a SAINT score of 0.70 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Certain common synaptic markers—including chromogranin A/C, synaptophysin, synaptogyrin I, synaptoporin, α-synuclein, and VGLUT1 and 2—were not detected in the plaques. Interestingly, the plaques were also devoid of uniquely post-synaptic proteins. We also identified many mitochondrial proteins; although the reason for this is unclear, it may be that the intrinsic hydrophobicity of mitochondrial membrane proteins may predispose them to associate with amyloid plaques. Comparison with proteins found from STOMP analysis of non-plaque areas revealed only limited overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>); VAMP2, synapsin 1, and dynamin 1 are present in both plaque and non-plaque STOMP analysis but are significantly greater enriched in the plaque STOMP samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Validation of the STOMP results in TgCRND8 mice with immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Using confocal microscopy, we examined colocalization of ThS-positive plaques with immunfluorescently labeled Aβ, SNAP25, VAMP2, v-ATPase, synapsin 1, and ApoE.

One possibility is that damaged dystrophic neurites that are known to surround the plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chishti et al., 2001</xref>) are spilling their contents and the physical properties of certain pre-synaptic proteins cause them to bind with especially high affinity to amyloid plaques. In this regard, it is noteworthy that many of these proteins are membrane proteins with coiled coil domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>). Another possibility, which is not mutually exclusive and provides an explanation for the presence of pre-synaptic proteins in plaques, is that Aβ fibrils and/or oligomers bind directly to synaptic vesicles and interfere with synaptic function. Evidence for a damaging effect of Aβ on synapses and dendrites has been available for some time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mattson et al., 1998</xref>). Diffusible Aβ oligomers added to cultured primary neurons have been shown to associate with synaptosomes and a concomitant synaptic deterioration is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lacor et al., 2007</xref>). In post-mortem AD tissue and in transgenic AD mice, an inverse correlation between levels of Aβ oligomers and levels of synaptic proteins was noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pham et al., 2010</xref>). The reduction in the levels of detectable synaptic protein in AD tissue may be the result of the aggregation and entrapment of the synaptic proteins in the amyloid plaques. In sum, the STOMP technique has provided clear evidence of interaction of amyloid plaques with pre-synaptic proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>STOMP analysis of senile plaques from post-mortem AD brain</title><p>After developing the STOMP method using brain sections of TgCRND8 mice as the test subject, we applied the technique to senile plaques from a case of AD. Human tissue is inherently more difficult to work with than animal tissue because of biochemical changes associated with post-mortem degradation. Furthermore, formalin, the fixative of choice for human tissue, causes covalent modification of proteins and confounds mass spectrometry analysis. These limitations notwithstanding, we find the STOMP technique is suitable for the analysis of formalin-fixed post-mortem human tissue. Senile plaques from brain sections of a severe case of AD were visualized with ThS and photo-tagged using a procedure identical to that used for the TgCRND8 tissue. Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein composition of these senile plaques identified 60 proteins that were statistically significantly enriched, with Aβ being the most abundant protein component (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Synaptic proteins and proteins involved in synaptic vesicle transport comprised 15% of the abundant protein component of the plaques.

Glial proteins, GFAP and excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Swanson, 2000</xref>), were both detected in (human) senile plaques (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>); however, only EAAT was detected in TgCRND8 amyloid plaques (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This apparent discrepancy is likely due to astrocytes being more intimately associated with amyloid plaques in human tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,E,I</xref>) compared to plaques in the TgCRND mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,J,P</xref>). Tau protein was also not among the abundant plaque proteins. Immunofluorescence staining shows that tau, which is contained in dystrophic neurites that surround the plaques, do not occupy the same physical space as the plaques and were hence not detected in the STOMP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,H,N</xref>). SNAP25, on the other hand, was detected in the STOMP analysis and was seen to colocalize with senile plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,H,L</xref>) and amyloid plaques from TgCRND8 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,I,O</xref>). α-synuclein is part of the NAC (non-amyloid components) of plaques—with a possible role in fibril formation but not part of the plaque core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Culvenor et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wirths and Bayer, 2003</xref>).

Senile plaques in the human AD tissue were positive for both SNAP25 and VAMP2. However, synaptophysin staining, which was absent in the amyloid deposits of AD mice, displayed a unique punctate lobular profile that decorated the periphery of the plaque in the human tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These STOMP analyses demonstrate the molecular differences of amyloid deposits in AD mice compared to senile plaques in AD patients, but confirm the segregation of these pre-synaptic proteins in and around amyloid plaques and point to their potential importance in AD pathophysiology.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09579.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Microphotographs of Synaptophysin (<bold>A</bold>), VAMP2 (<bold>B</bold>) and SNAP25 (<bold>C</bold>) immunohistochemistry on the brain of human Alzheimer's disease cases.</title><p>The amyloid plaques (arrow) are positive for VAMP2 and SNAP25, whereas synaptophysin does not stain the core of the plaques and punctate lobular profiles decorating the plaque are positive for synaptophysin.

The procedure does not require large quantities of tissue and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. Using amyloid plaques in TgCRND8 mice as a test subject, we demonstrated that STOMP is capable of determining the protein composition of pathological deposits in neurodegenerative disease. Our discovery that there is an accumulation of certain pre-synaptic proteins in AD plaques and in TgCRND8 mice provides direct evidence for an association between amyloid plaque formation and synaptic function. While our initial work in characterizing amyloid deposits in mouse brain used methanol fixed tissues to minimize problems with solubilizing tissue, our experience with human AD pathological tissue shows that STOMP of formalin-fixed archival tissue is possible. The STOMP technique is ideally suited for determination of the compositions of intracellular protein inclusions seen in ALS and FTD. While the principle components of these inclusions, such as TDP-43<sup>9</sup>, FUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kwiatkowski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vance et al., 2009</xref>), and dipeptide repeat proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mori et al., 2013</xref>) are known, determination of the secondary components of the inclusions could shed light on disease etiology.</p><p>In developing the STOMP technique, we have focused on identification of photo-tagged proteins, however, the nonspecific nature of benzophenone photochemistry should cause photo-tagging of nonprotein components as well. In this regard, the STOMP technique can easily be modified to identify the RNA composition of biological features. RNA-containing subcellular structures such as P-bodies and stress granules have been implicated in neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2013</xref>); these structures are of suitable size for STOMP, and there is a realistic possibility of determining jointly their proteomic and transcriptomic composition with this technique. The application of this technique to many other aspects of cell biology research is also conceivable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, all dry reagents are from Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Huda Zoghbi (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Jeffery Kelly, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>We are pleased to inform you that your paper has been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> with minor revisions. In preparing your revised manuscript for publication please consider the minor comments of both reviewers, although our preference would be to leave the Introduction as it is.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (General assessment and major comments):</italic> This manuscript from Hadley and co-workers describes an exciting new technique called STOMP, which promises to revolutionise targeted microproteomics. The concept is very simple and at the same time very clever. Regions of interest in a biological specimen prepared for imaging are selected on the basis of the distribution of a suitable marker labelled with an antibody or fluorescent protein, and then a tag (in this case hexahistidine) is photo-crosslinked to the proteins distributed in this area using a multiphoton microscope. Upon solubilisation of the fixed sample on the slide, tagged proteins are purified using a nickel matrix and identified by mass spec. This is an ingenious alternative to labelling approaches such as BioID and Apex, with the important advantage that STOMP does not require expression of recombinant proteins in the cell of interest. In addition, the authors demonstrated that STOMP can be used in formalin-fixed tissue, a feature which great expand its application potential.</p><p>The authors apply this method to the analysis of amyloid plaques both in mouse tissue and in post-mortem specimens providing proof-of-principle of the reliability of the technique. Even though this paper did not strictly provide a novel mechanistic discovery, a method like STOMP can change the way we approach fundamental biological problems and therefore represents a major advance to the life science toolbox.</p><p>All my concerns are minor and deal more with the presentation of the data (see below). However, one possible major addition to this work is providing a proof-of-principle that this technique can be used with nucleic acids as well (e.g. RNA) as mentioned in the Conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Minor comments):</italic> The Introduction is a little bit overlong, and should be prioritised. I suggest focussing on Abeta and the data already in the literature about the composition of amyloid plaques. Consideration about BioID and Apex may be better placed in the Discussion.</p><p>In the subsection “Validation of the STOMP results in TgCRND8 mice with immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry”, the discussion on the impact of Abeta on synaptic function and synaptic protein distribution should be better organised.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: consider making the blue colour more visible (panel A) and the chemical structure bigger and clearer.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The top panels are not very effective since they show virtually no staining. Consider including a different area in which staining for these proteins is present.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> The STOMP macro and the raw MS/MS data should be made available via a public server.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (General assessment and major comments):</italic> In Spatially targeted optical microproteomics (STOMP), the method under development in this manuscript, laser light from the microscope is used not only to image the fluorescently-stained specimen, but also to photochemically crosslink affinity purification ligands to protein components within pathological deposits (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to characterize the proteome within the imaged region. In principle a (1 micrometer) 3 volume can be imaged, but often a greater volume is needed to detect protein components with confidence. Nonetheless a much smaller volume is used herein that in laser dissection capture mass spectrometry-currently being used by the Mayo Clinic commercially to identify the amyloid composing the fibrils in systemic amyloidoises.</p><p>The photo-affinity ligand or photo-tag used here is the peptide 4-benzoylbenzyl-Gly-His<sub>6</sub>-CONH. A confocal image is used to generate a list of spatial coordinates-a “mask” file-identifying every point in the tissue containing pathological protein deposits. Two-photon microscopy is then used to photoexcite the benzophenone in a 1 micron3 (10,000 Å)3 volume as a minimal volume. Nickle affinity chromatography is then used to isolate the modified proteins. There are established endogenous proteins that bind to Nickle affinity chromatography resin supports, thus the permeabilized tissue sample is pretreated with diethylpyrocarbonate to destroy the binding of these proteins to the affinity resin via His modification before photoconjugation. The tagged proteins are dissolved in 2% SDS, 8M urea and β-mercaptoethanol, separated by gel electrophoresis and using a parallel sample identified by LC-MS/MS.</p><p>The authors used the TgCRND8 murine model featuring a mutated APP found in familial AD patients, employing thioflavine S to detect amyloid. In and around amyloid deposits from these transgenics and from formalin-fixed human brain tissue, it was found that v-ATPase, dynamin, SNAP25, VAMP2, synapsin, clathrin, ankyrin were enriched, and with the exception v-ATPase and dynamin, this study reveals they are enriched in or surround Abeta amyloid fibrils.</p><p>The authors demonstrate they can determine the proteome composition of micron-scale microscopic features in tissue samples of 500μmx500μm in an 8μm-thick tissue section, which is a significant advance. The proteomic data invoke Abeta aggregation and dysfunction of the synapse, which is supported by other methodology besides the STOMP method, which is the focus of this paper.</p><p>This is a very well thought, thorough study that in my mind demonstrates proof-of-principle, and for that reason is a strong contender for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Minor comments):</italic> The authors argue that the hexahistidine benzophenone tag is of similar size to Congo red and should have a similar ability to penetrate biological specimens which have been fixed and permeabilized using methanol. ClogP or other parameters along with a MW less than 750 typically predict cell permeability. In the future, why not use a small molecule high affinity binder to the nickel resin having more favorable physical chemical properties than hexa-His? This would allow this approach to be extended to intracellular amyloid in tissues.</p><p>Thioflavin S is not very specific for amyloid fibrils in tissue, which is a limitation the authors should mention in a revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09579.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1 (Minor comments): <italic>The Introduction is a little bit overlong, and should be prioritised.

Our two hypotheses are that: 1) some physical attribute of the proteins observed cause them to co-aggregate with amyloid plaques, or that 2) some physical property of synaptic vesicles as a whole cause them to bind to amyloid plaques. We changed the wording of the manuscript to better delineate these two possibilities.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>: consider making the blue colour more visible (panel A) and the chemical structure bigger and clearer.</italic></p><p>It is unclear whether the reviewer here was looking at a full-resolution image here or a compressed image.

In order to see whether STOMP merely missed these proteins, or whether these proteins were truly absent from the plaques, we carried out the analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we show that certain pre-synaptic proteins not found by STOMP are in fact absent from the plaques using immunofluorescence with well-validated antibodies. We have added a line in the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to clarify this point.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Additional data files and statistical comments): T<italic>he STOMP macro and the raw MS/MS data should be made available via a public server.</italic></p><p>The STOMP macro will be made available as per request to the corresponding author, and we have made a note as such in the manuscript.

However, these rules are meant for living cells/tissues, rather than fixed cells; the STOMP technique specifically uses fixed cells. Our discussion about 6HisBP being similar size to Congo Red was simply to illustrate the fact that, unlike a large molecule such as an antibody, 6HisBP can freely diffuse into fixed tissues. In our experience, STOMP can be equally applied to intracellular targets without any modification to the procedures discussed in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Thioflavin S is not very specific for amyloid fibrils in tissue, which is a limitation the authors should mention in a revised manuscript.</italic></p><p>It is true that all commonly used dyes to detect amyloid have some non-specific binding. Here we modified the manuscript (subsection “The STOMP technique”) to highlight these limitations and to briefly discuss the image processing steps that we undertook in order to overcome these limitations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
