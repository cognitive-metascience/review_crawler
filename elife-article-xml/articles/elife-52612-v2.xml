The β-processing of APP involves an initial cleavage of the APP ectodomain by β-secretase (BACE1), followed by the cleavage of the resultant β-COOH-terminal fragment (βCTF) by γ-secretase to produce amyloid beta (Aβ) and the APP intracellular domain (AID/AICD). Alternatively, in the nonamyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved within the Aβ region sequentially by α- and γ-secretase, which produces a smaller P3 fragment and AID/AICD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sisodia et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sisodia and St George-Hyslop, 2002</xref>). APP processing is central to understanding AD for two reasons: 1. The biological functions of APP and its metabolites affect many important neuronal functions, related to AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbagallo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbagallo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matrone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matrone et al., 2012</xref>). Not just amyloid beta, but the other APP metabolites and the holoprotein itself have important effects on the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Prete et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanutza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fogel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gulisano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matrone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nikolaev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Passer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puzzo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rice et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tambini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zott et al., 2019</xref>). 2. Mutations that affect APP processing either cause or prevent AD. This is true for both early and late-onset AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). For example, the K670N/M671L (Swedish) mutation of the NH2-terminal side of the β-cleavage site of APP increases its β-processing and causes a familial form of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Citron et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Citron et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnston et al., 1994</xref>). The A673T (Icelandic or protective) mutation, which is COOH-terminal to the β-site of APP, decreases the affinity of APP for BACE1, and thereby reduces β-processing and protects against late-onset AD and normal cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jonsson et al., 2012</xref>). Late-onset AD can also be caused by mutations which block the α-processing of APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suh et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The choice of animal model and genetic approach has important implications for the study of the effects of mutations on APP processing. Analysis of transgenic APP models, which are extensively used in AD research, are confounded by several factors: the overexpression of APP above physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saito et al., 2016</xref>), the disruption of genes in the transgene integration sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodwin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tosh et al., 2017</xref>), the use of exogenous promoters, which do not replicate the temporal, cell type-specific or spatial expression of the endogenous gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodgers et al., 2012</xref>), and the overproduction of multiple, biologically active APP metabolites. This last point is potentially important: the reduction in some APP metabolites, due to either pathogenic or protective mutations, may participate in either pathogenic or protective mechanisms. A transgenic approach will not mimic this loss of function effect but, on the contrary, it will generate a gain of function model organism (i.e. the opposite of the human process that the organism aims to model). A knock-in (KI) approach, in which the mutations of interest are introduced into the endogenous gene locus and in which the endogenous regulatory elements of the gene are left intact, eliminates these confounding factors.</p><p>Rats are better suited to study neurodegenerative diseases for the following reasons. The rat was the organism of choice for most behavioral, memory and cognitive research, which is critical when studying neurodegenerative diseases, because physiological processes are similar in rats and humans, and the rat is an intelligent and quick learner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deacon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foote and Crystal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kepecs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whishaw et al., 2001</xref>). Several procedures that are important in dementia research are more easily performed in rats as compared to mice due to the larger size of the rat brain. Cannulas -to administer drugs, biologics, viruses etc.- and micro-dialysis probes –for sampling extracellular brain levels of neurotransmitters, Aβ, soluble tau etc.- can be accurately directed to individual brain regions, causing less damage and increasing specificity. In vivo brain imaging techniques, such as MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartelle et al., 2016</xref>) and PET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leuzy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zimmer et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zimmer et al., 2014b</xref>), can assess the extent and course of neurodegeneration with better spatial resolution in rats. Moreover, rats are large enough for convenient in vivo electrophysiological recordings or serial sampling of cerebrospinal fluid for detection of biomarkers. Gene-expression differences suggest that rats may be advantageous model of neurodegenerative diseases compared to mice.

Adult human and rat brains express both 3R and 4R tau isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanes et al., 2009</xref>): in contrast, adult mouse brains express only 4R tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McMillan et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that the rat may be a better model organism for dementias with tauopathy.</p><p>Recent developments in gene-editing technologies can make the rat once more the organism of choice to study dementias. Thus, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to create KI rat models of protective and pathogenic <italic>APP</italic> mutations. Rat and human APP differ by 3 amino acids in the Aβ region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): since aggregated forms of Aβ are by and large considered the main pathogenic molecule in AD and given that human Aβ may have higher propensity to form toxic Aβ species as compared to rodent Aβ, together with the protective and Swedish mutations we introduced mutations to ‘humanize’ the rat Aβ sequence.

The most studied APP processing pathways involve APP cleavage by α-, β- and γ-secretases. Cleavage of APP by β-secretase takes place predominantly in acidic compartments: this processing releases a long (595 amino acid long, if referring to the APP695 isoform- the most highly expressed in brain) soluble NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal APP ectodomain (sAPPβ) and a membrane-bound 99 amino acid long fragment (C99 or βCTF). βCTF is cleaved with lax site specificity by γ-secretase into Aβ peptide and the APP intracellular domain (AICD/AID). Alternatively, α-secretase cleaves APP along the secretory pathway or on the plasma membrane. This cleavage occurs within the Aβ sequence to produce soluble APPα (sAPPα) and a COOH-terminal membrane-bound 83 amino acid long fragment (C83 or αCTF). αCTF can be also cleaved by γ-secretase into a ‘shorter Aβ’ peptide, called P3 (see Figure 3A for a depiction of the major Aβ and P3 species), and AID.</p><p>The steady-state levels of APP metabolites in the brain depend on the rate of production, aggregation and catabolism. sAPPα and sAPPβ are stable APP metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morales-Corraliza et al., 2009</xref>), unlike αCTF and βCTF, which are cleared by γ-secretase and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbagallo et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, sAPPα and sAPPβ are better indicators of the rate of cleavage of APP by either α- or β-secretase, respectively. As noted above, in vitro studies have shown that the protective Icelandic mutation reduces the rate of APP processing by β-secretase; in addition, a non-significant trend towards an increase in the rate of APP cleavage by α-secretase was also noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jonsson et al., 2012</xref>). To test whether these APP metabolic changes are reproduced in our <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> KI rats and to verify whether the protein product of the <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> allele contains the humanizing mutations, we analyzed brain samples isolated from <italic>App<sup>w/w</sup></italic>, <italic>App<sup>δ7/δ7</sup></italic> -rats that contain two hypomorphic <italic>App<sup>δ7</sup></italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tambini et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic>, <italic>App<sup>s/s</sup></italic>, and <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> rats.

Brain samples from these rat lines were tested by western blot (WB) with the following anti-APP antibodies. Y188, a rabbit polyclonal raised against the COOH-terminal 20 amino acids of APP, an epitope that is unchanged by the humanizing, Swedish and Icelandic mutations. M3.2, a mouse monoclonal raised against the rat APP sequence between the β- and α-secretase cleavage sites (DAEFGHDSGFEVRHQK); this antibody only recognizes APP molecules containing the rat Aβ sequence and not APP molecules containing the human Aβ sequence (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQK, the 3 amino acid differences with the rat sequence are highlighted in black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversely, 6E10, a mouse monoclonal whose epitope is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, only recognizes APP molecules containing the human Aβ sequence. Y188 detects APP, βCTF and αCTF in <italic>App<sup>w/w</sup>, App<sup>h/h</sup></italic>, <italic>App<sup>s/s</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). M3.2 detects APP and βCTF only in <italic>App<sup>w/w</sup></italic> brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). On the other hand, 6E10 detected APP and βCTF only in <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic>, <italic>App<sup>s/s</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As expected, none of these antibodies gave specific signal in <italic>App<sup>δ7/δ7</sup></italic> samples. Thus, APPh, APPSw and APPp, the protein products of the <italic>App<sup>h</sup></italic>, <italic>App<sup>s</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> alleles, contain the humanized Aβ sequence, respectively.

These findings support the notion that the APPp mutant expressed by the <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> allele is cleaved more efficiently by α-secretase and less efficiently by β-secretase, just like the human counterpart.</p><p>To validate further these findings, we quantified the other APP metabolites detected by WB analysis (APP, αCTF and βCTF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>) as well as Aβ peptides by ELISA. APP levels are unchanged in <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, APP levels detected by 6E10 -P = 0.4586-, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> APP levels detected by Y188 -P = 0.9385). βCTF levels detected by 6E10 were significantly lower in <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> as compared to <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic> brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, p=0.0484): in contrast quantification of βCTF levels detected by Y188 did not show significant differences between these two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, p=0.4109). Quantification of βCTF levels in 6E10 blots, where αCTF is not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), is more accurate than quantification of βCTF levels in Y188 blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), where αCTF, which runs very close to βCTF, is the predominant APP-CTF species. Levels of αCTF, albeit slightly higher in <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> rats, where also not significantly different between <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic> brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, p=0.3121). We also analyzed the ratio of βCTF detected either by Y188 or 6E10 to αCTF detected by Y188, βCTF-Y188/αCTF, and -βCTF-6E10/αCTF, respectively. While the βCTF-Y188/αCTF ratio was not different in <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, p=0.6681), the βCTF-6E10/αCTF ratio was significantly lower in <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, p=0.0007). Finally, we measured Aβ40 peptides (human Aβ40 since our KI rats produce human Aβ species) by ELISA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>, Aβ40 levels are significantly reduced in <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> as compared to <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic> brains (p=0.0003). In summary, the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> suggest that our <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> KI rats reproduce the APP metabolic changes caused by the Icelandic protective mutation in humans: that is reduced rate of APP processing by β-secretase and increased rate of APP cleavage by α-secretase.</p><p>Next, we analyzed a new cohort of animals for the following reasons: 1) to determine reproducibility of our findings in a different rat cohort that includes a larger number of subjects; 2) to test whether these APP metabolic changes are also evident in heterozygous <italic>App<sup>p/h</sup></italic> rats, which genocopy the condition that protects humans from dementia and normal cognitive decline; 3) to determine whether sex influences these alterations; 4) to measure other Aβ and P3 species; 5) to measure sAPPα and sAPPβ in total brain homogenates.</p><p>The WAKO Aβ42 ELISA kit could not reliably measure Aβ42, which is considered the main pathogenic Aβ species in humans, in <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> rats (data not shown). Thus, we tested several other ELISA kits including the MSD Aβ38/Aβ40/Aβ42 ELISA kit. There are two versions of this kit: one which uses 6E10 as detection antibody and one that uses 4G8 as detection antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, 6E10 will only measure Aβ38, Aβ40 and Aβ42; in contrast, 4G8 will detect Aβ38, Aβ40, Aβ42 as well as the corresponding P3 peptides P3-22, P2-24 and P3-26, respectively. Thus, comparing the signal obtained with the two kits may yield information concerning levels of both Aβ and P3 peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Siegel et al., 2017</xref>). To determine specificity of these kits, we tested brain homogenates derived from <italic>App<sup>δ7/δ7</sup></italic>, in which the Aβ-coding region is out of frame with <italic>App</italic> due to the 7 base pair deletion and that at any rate results in a hypomorphic allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tambini et al., 2019</xref>), and <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic> rats. Both kits detect a specific signal -that is in <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic> but not <italic>App<sup>δ7/δ7</sup></italic> brain homogenates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Having established the validity of these ELISA assays, we analyzed our experimental samples. Aβ38+P3-22 (F (5, 24)=2.578, p=0.0529) and Aβ38 (F (5, 24)=2.554, p=0.0546) were detectable in a few <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic> brain homogenates only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Aβ40+P3-24 (F (5, 24)=34.30, p&lt;0.0001), Aβ40 (F (5, 24)=43.32, p&lt;0.0001), Aβ42+P3-26 (F (5, 24)=5.062, p=0.0026) and Aβ42 (F (5, 24)=13.76, p&lt;0.0001) peptides were significantly reduced, in a gene-dosage-dependent manner, in <italic>App<sup>p/h</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). We did not detect any sex-specific effect on Aβ/P3 peptides production. In addition, while the Aβ42+P3-26/Aβ40+P3-24 ratio was unchanged (F (5, 24)=1.694, p=0.1745), analysis of the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio suggests that the Icelandic protective allele may reduce this ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E,F</xref> (5 and 24)=5.756, p=0.013), which could underlie a protective mechanism prompted by the Icelandic variant. However, more animals need to be analyzed to determine the significance of this observation. As for P3 levels, we rejected the idea of measuring P3 peptides by subtracting the 6E10 measurements from the 4G8 measurements because in several brain samples the 6E10 signal was higher than the 4G8 signal. This suggests that the two kits have different efficiencies. Although the significance of the differences among genotypes is higher in 6E10 measurements as compared to 4G8 measurements -this is obviously evident when comparing Aβ42+P3-26 and Aβ42 ELISAs- suggesting that P3 peptides may be increased in <italic>App<sup>p/h</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> rats, we cannot draw definitive conclusions concerning levels of P3 and whether these levels are changed in a genotype-dependent manner. Nevertheless, the finding that Aβ peptides are consistently reduced using two different detection antibodies stresses the significance of the finding. In addition, they exclude the possibility that the reduction of Aβ peptides in <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> rats seen in the 6E10-based ELISA may be due to a reduced affinity of Aβ species carrying the protective Icelandic mutation, which is adjacent to the 6E10 epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), for 6E10.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ELISA of APP metabolites in <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> rats shows decreased APP processing by β-secretase and increased processing by α-secretase.</title><p>To test whether the APP protective mutation results in the expected changes in APP metabolism, we extracted brain tissue from a larger cohort that can identify sex-dependent changes in <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic>, <italic>App<sup>p/h</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> 28 day old rats.

We used total brain homogenates for the following reasons. While α-secretase cleaves APP in the secretory pathway or on the plasma membrane releasing sAPPα into the extracellular fluid, β-secretase cleaves mAPP in acidic organelles, including synaptic vesicles and late endosomes. A fraction of sAPPβ is released extracellularly during exocytosis but significant amounts of sAPPβ are present in intracellular compartments. Analysis of ELISA by sex showed some significant decrease in sAPPβ (F (5, 24)=4.552, p=0.0046), but not in sAPPα (F (5, 24)=2.263, p=0.0806) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Further experiments will be needed to verify the reproducibility of this finding. Even for this set of animals, the significance of the differences among genotypes is higher in 6E10 measurements as compared to 4G8 measurements, once again especially when comparing Aβ42+P3-26 and Aβ42 ELISAs- suggesting that P3 peptides may be decreased <italic>App<sup>s/h</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>s/s</sup></italic> rats.</p><p>Next, we measured sAPPα and sAPPβ. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> (F (5, 23)=5.762, p=0.0014), sAPPα is significantly reduced in both <italic>App<sup>s/h</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>s/s</sup></italic> male rats. Female rats show a significant sAPPα steady-state levels reduction only in homozygous <italic>App<sup>s/s</sup></italic> rats. The sAPPβ produced by β-cleavage of the Swedish APP mutant -which is called sAPPβ-Sw- differs at the COOH-terminus from the sAPPβ produced by β-cleavage of humanized APP mutant -which we refer to as sAPPβ-WT- since the KM &gt; NL mutations are in the 2 COOH-terminal residues of sAPPβ moieties. Thus, the MSD sAPPα/sAPPβ MSD ELISA kit will only recognize sAPPβ-WT, as shown by the fact that this kit does not detect sAPPβ in <italic>App<sup>s/s</sup></italic> rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, left panel). To measure sAPPβ-Sw we used the MSD ELISA kit K151BUE that, conversely, detects sAPPβ-Sw molecules in <italic>App<sup>s/h</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>s/s</sup></italic> but not <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic> rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, middle panel). The first striking observation is that, in <italic>App<sup>s/h</sup></italic> rats, levels of sAPPβ-Sw are ~10 times higher than the levels of sAPPβ-WT suggesting that in these animals, APPSw is cleaved by β-secretase at a rate 10 times higher than APPwt. Even if these two kits have slightly different efficiencies, as observed earlier for the 6E10 and 4G8 ELISA kits, it is highly improbable that they may account for this result. To compare the total sAPPβ steady-state levels in these rats, we added the signals detected for sAPPβ-WT to those detected for sAPPβ-Sw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, left panel). Total sAPPβ is significantly increased in a gene-dosage dependent manner in both sexes: in addition, male <italic>App<sup>s/s</sup></italic> rats had significantly higher sAPPβ-Sw levels as compared to female <italic>App<sup>s/s</sup></italic> rats (F (5, 23)=163.1, p&lt;0.0001).</p><p>Western analysis was performed on these 30 samples to detect changes in APP-CTF levels consistent with a shift toward β-processing of APP. Examples of the WB analyses with Y188 and an anti-GAPDH antibody are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I and J</xref>. Probing against the C-terminus of APP revealed a trend towards decreased amounts of total full-length APP in <italic>App<sup>s/s</sup></italic> rats, which reached significance only in male <italic>App<sup>s/s</sup></italic> rats compared to <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic> rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, males F (2, 11)=11.08, p=0.0023; females F (2, 12)=2.987, p=0.0886).

First, it links APP processing to the sporadic forms of dementia. Previously, though amyloid plaques linked the histopathology of early and late-onset AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katzman, 1986</xref>), all mutations in <italic>APP</italic> resulted in early-onset AD or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The previous exclusive linkage of APP to the rarer early-onset forms of AD, combined with the failures of anti-amyloid clinical trials to improve cognition in late-onset AD patients, led some to suggest separate disease etiologies in the late and early onset forms of AD. That A673T <italic>APP</italic> protects against late-onset AD would argue against this separation and suggest that intervention in APP processing is sufficient for AD prevention, as long as these interventions correct pathogenic alterations in APP metabolism without inhibiting APP-cleaving enzymes, which have multiple substrates.</p><p>The second notable aspect of the A673T mutation is that it does not per se exclusively implicate Aβ in AD pathogenesis. As noted in the initial report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jonsson et al., 2012</xref>), examined in follow-up studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maloney et al., 2014</xref>), and demonstrated here for the first time in an animal KI model, the A673T mutation, via a decrease in affinity in APP for BACE1, results in, as a secondary effect, an attenuation of Aβ production. However, the direct consequences of this mutation are a decrease in βCTF and sAPPβ production, the metabolites generated by β-cleavage of APP. In addition, α-cleavage of the protective APPp mutant is increased, causing increased production of αCTF and sAPPα and possibly, as a secondary effect, of P3 peptides. Changes in APP metabolism caused by the protective Icelandic mutation are not as dramatic in magnitude as those induced by the pathogenic Swedish mutation. As a consequence, some variability in data significance between different animal cohorts and different experiments emerges. This variability is not surprising taking into consideration the inherent and inevitable differences between biological samples and the variability introduced by multistep biochemical analyses. In addition, as it was noted during the review process, ‘the changes in APP metabolism, if observed, are in general more pronounced in female vs male rats’. This potentially important sex-difference will need to be fully explored in future studies with greater power.</p><p>Thus, in addition to Aβ many other metabolites of APP are differentially affected by the A673T mutation. Any of these metabolic changes, alone or in any possible combination, may mediate the protective effects of the Icelandic mutation. The evidence that the protective and pathogenic Swedish mutations have opposite effects on APP processing by β- and α-secretases, that is decreased β-cleavage and increased α-cleavage for the former and increased β-cleavage and decreased α-cleavage for the latter, is striking and may suggest that protection from and pathogenesis of dementia may depend upon a complex alteration in APP metabolites and their functions rather than simply on Aβ levels. These pathogenic/protective changes in APP metabolism are probably present during embryonic development and the lifespan of carriers. Thus, even subtle changes may have a significant role in either pathogenic or protective mechanism, especially for diseases that manifest clinically at advanced age.</p><p>The fundamental differences between transgenic and KI approaches are illustrated by animal models of Familial Danish and British dementia (FDD and FBD). Overexpression of mutant genes produced an increase in Bri2 (the protein coded by <italic>ITM2b</italic>, the gene mutated in FDD and FBD) levels and a gain of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coomaraswamy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garringer et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, FDD and FBD KI mouse models showed reduction of Bri2 levels and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tamayev et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tamayev et al., 2010b</xref>). Thus, FDD and FBD may be correctly modeled by either transgenic mice, which show a gain of function, or KI mice, which show a loss of function, but not by both. Paradoxically, either transgenic or KI mice may model the opposite of the pathogenic mechanisms causing FDD/FBD. Hypotheses of pathogenic mechanisms generated from incorrect model organisms may produce harm when they inform drug discovery and human clinical trials. In conclusion, transgenic and knock-in models may, for some diseases, be genetically distinct but valid disease models. For other diseases however, a transgenic approach may lead to incorrect and harmful assessments, which is unlikely to happen when using KI model organisms.</p><p>In addition to the quantity of these metabolites, there is a potential qualitative effect: the amino acid substitutions A673T alters the primary structure of several APP metabolites including full-length APP, Aβ, βCTF and sAPPα. These primary structure changes may, per se, have a protective effect. Reports of decreased tendency towards aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benilova et al., 2014</xref>) of A2T Aβ, the form of Aβ generated from A673T APP, suggest that the biological functions of other APP metabolites that bear the same mutation may also be affected. The biochemical effects caused by the protective <italic>APP</italic> mutation, therefore, are complex and can be exerted across multiple APP metabolites.</p><p>Processing of APP may also downregulate the function of the full-length precursor protein, with potential physiological and pathological consequences. For instance, β-secretase cleaves APP within a functional domain of APP called ISVAID, which interacts with glutamatergic synaptic vesicle proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). Increased cleavage of APP by BACE1, as in <italic>App<sup>s</sup></italic> KI rats, disables the ISVAID and facilitates glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tambini et al., 2019</xref>), a phenomenon known as <underline>B</underline>ACE1 on <underline>A</underline>PP-<underline>d</underline>ependent <underline>glu</underline>tamate release (BAD-Glu). It is possible that reduced β-cleavage of APP may lead to an opposite glutamatergic transmission alteration in <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> rats.</p><p>The generation of a KI-rat model of the protective <italic>App</italic> mutation has other advantages apart from the avoidance of the confounding effects of the transgenic approach. The protective model will be useful in testing what other AD-causing mutations and AD-related polymorphisms have on disease pathogenesis. Specifically, if a mutation acts via alteration in APP processing, theoretically, it would be possible to cross rat models with <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> rats to determine to what extent the mutation’s or polymorphism’s effects are APP-β/α-processing-dependent. The <italic>App<sup>s/p</sup></italic> rats are an example of such combined-mutation model organism. In <italic>App<sup>s/p</sup></italic> rats, which carry one protective and one pathogenic Swedish allele, the steady-state levels of APP metabolites are dictated by an additive effect of the two mutations. In this particular model, the effects of the Swedish mutation on APP metabolism, which are quantitatively greater as compared to those of the Icelandic variant, predominate. Thus, it is not likely that the <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> allele will protect from neurodegeneration caused by the Swedish allele, albeit this remains to be experimentally tested. However, pathological conditions leading to milder APP processing alteration may be counteracted by the <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> allele.</p><p>Just as the <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> KI-rat model can be used to determine interactions of other mutations on APP processing, it could also be used to determine if the mechanism of action of potential pharmacological AD treatments is β/α-processing dependent. For example, if the mechanism of action of a potential AD drug required a shift from β- to α-processing of APP, the effect would be attenuated in <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> rats.</p><p>Finally, the evidence that the Icelandic mutation delays/protects from what is known as aging-dependent normal cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jonsson et al., 2012</xref>) suggests that <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> rats will also be useful to understand mechanisms causing cognitive decline during aging. Mimicking these mechanisms pharmacologically may provide powerful tools to offset cognitive aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The procedures were described and approved by the Rutgers Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (protocol number 201702513). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and reduce the number of animals used. The animals were housed two per cage under controlled laboratory conditions with a 12 hr dark light cycle, a temperature of 22 ± 2°C. Rats had free access to standard rodent diet and tap water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Rat brain preparation</title><p>Rats, 28 days old, were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused via intracardiac catheterization with ice-cold PBS. Brains were extracted and homogenized using a glass-Teflon homogenizer (w/v = 100 mg tissue/1 ml buffer) in 20 mM Tris-base pH 7.4, 250 mM Sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA plus phosphatase and protease inhibitors (ThermoScientific): all steps were carried out on ice or at 4°C. Total lysate was solubilized with 0.1% SDS and 1% NP-40 for 30 min rotating. Solubilized lysate was spun at 20,000 g for 10 m, the supernatant was collected and analyzed by ELISA and Western blotting. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, soluble lysate was prepared by the centrifugation of total lysate at 100,000 g for 30 m.

Real-time PCR was performed using 50 ng of cDNA, TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo 4444556), and the appropriate TaqMan (Thermo) probes. Samples were analyzed on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo). LinRegPCR software (hartfaalcentrum.nl) was used to quantify relative mRNA amounts. The probe Rn00570673_m1 (exon junctions 11–12, 12–13, and 13–14) was used to detect rat <italic>App</italic> mRNA.

In the study described here, a rat knockin model of the Icelandic APP mutation was developed and characterized with multiple advantages over previously generated models. This model is extensively analyzed for the effect of the mutation on APP processing and the data compared to the changes in a previously generated and characterized rat knockin model expressing APP with the Swedish mutation. The importance of this work is that the data show that the Icelandic APP mutation that protects from sporadic Alzheimer's disease has the opposite effect on APP processing compared to the Swedish pathogenic APP mutation, emphasizing the role of APP and its metabolism in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript by Tambini, Norris, and D'Adamio, the authors aim to investigate APP protective and pathogenic mechanisms through their generated <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>s</sup></italic> knock-in (KI) rats. Tambini et al. developed this KI rat model with the background knowledge that cleavage of APP by α-secretase initiates a non-amyloidogenic pathway, while the β-secretase pathway leads to amyloid-β production, thereby opposing the α-secretase APP cleavage pathway. Moreover, in familial Alzheimer's disease (AD), the Icelandic APP mutation that cleaves at the BACE1 site is protective against developing sporadic dementia. Due to the nature of the Swedish mutation, <italic>App<sup>s</sup></italic>, and the protective mutation, <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic>, in rats, Tambini et al. concluded that AD pathogenesis depends on a combination, as well as reverse modifications, of APP metabolism than the focusing of only on amyloid-β levels. The novelty of the study comes with the use of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to develop the KI rats with both the protective and pathogenic APP mutations. Additionally, the KI mutation was chosen to be done in rats over the typical mouse models as the authors cite numerous reasons for the rat species being better suited to study neurodegenerative diseases than mice. The authors conclude that, since that theses rat models will be helpful to the neurodegeneration field in being able to understand aging cognitive decline mechanisms to allow for (eventual) pharmacological intervention. Overall, while a novel rat model, to be sure, could be of great benefit to the AD basic and translational fields, this manuscript does have concerns that would need to be addressed prior to being accepted by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Concerns that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) One large issue with the manuscript is the continual references to Tambini et al., 2019 in Aging Cell earlier this year. Figure 2 A-D in this submitted manuscript are directly replicated from the 2019 Aging Cell published article. Is it necessary to repeat the entire generation of the KI rat model in this manuscript as it was already done in another article by the same authors? Additionally, to be perfectly honest, this manuscript looks as if it should have been published first, before the Aging Cell article, as the &quot;Facilitation of glutamate, but not GABA, […]&quot; builds off developing the rat KI model.</p><p>2) In the Introduction and Discussion, the abbreviations of Familial Danish and British dementia are found to be swapped incorrectly.</p><p>3) In the Introduction paragraph describing analysis of transgenic APP models being confounded by several factors, it would be preferential to have these reasons cited to add validity to the authors' argument.</p><p>4) The Introduction has numerous grammatical errors and spacing next to parenthesis that needs to be addressed.</p><p>5) All figures should have asterisks within the bar graphs denoting statistical significance (if present), with the p-values being cited in the main text rather than in the tables underneath the bar graphs.</p><p>6) Why does Figure 2B's western blot looks so different compared to Figure 2A, C andD? Presumably these were all run on the same machine, which appears to be a capillary electrophoresis instrument; yet, Figure 2B displays lighter contrast than the other blots and does not seem to be in the linear portion of the curve like the others. Also, there is a 'smile' that occurs in a western blot gel, but not in capillary electrophoresis.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Tambini et al. report the generation of a new <italic>App<sup>p</sup></italic> knock-in rat model carrying a protective Icelandic mutation in the <italic>App</italic> gene, and the characterization of the APP metabolism in the newly generated model. In addition, they compare APP metabolism in the novel model vs. rats carrying the pathogenic APP Swedish mutation. Considering the limitations of the widely used &quot;overexpression&quot; animal models in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field, the generation of knock-in models is of critical importance. Furthermore, as mentioned and discussed in the manuscript, the generated rat model present several advantages over the mouse ones for memory and cognitive research. These points support the relevance of the presented studies. Nevertheless, the manuscript is largely descriptive and the derived insights are not entirely novel but rather incremental. In this regard, the study presents several intriguing, sex-dependent phenotypes that could offer novel insights, however they remain as observations.</p><p>1) In order to demonstrate the relevance of the novel rat model for AD, analysis of the AD pathological hallmarks as well as behavioural changes should be performed.</p><p>2) In the Figure 2, the authors analyse the APP proteolysis in <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> rats. As stated in the text, they could have not accurately measured the βCTF levels using Y188 antibody. Nevertheless, they use this antibody again in Figures 4 and 6. This reviewer suggests including only data generated with the validated 6E10 antibody.</p><p>3) In several figures, the authors show very complex statistical comparisons (all the conditions are compared to each other) but little is discussed about the relevance of the observations. For instance, it is interesting that the changes, if observed, are in general more pronounced in female vs. male rats, but the observations are not discussed. The complex presentation and lack of discussion only leads to the loss of the main message.</p><p>4) There is an overlap between data presented in Figures 3 and 5 and 7. However, the overlapping data seem to be inconsistent between the figures. For example, trends towards decreased sAPPα levels are seen in <italic>App<sup>p/h</sup></italic> M vs. <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic> M rats in Figure 7 while an opposite trend is seen in Figure 3. Similarly, there is an overlap between Figure 4, 6 and 9. The overlapping data seem to be inconsistent between the figures for the βCTF/αCTF analyses.</p><p>5) In the Introduction, the authors write that the Icelandic mutation increases the rate of APP cleavage by α-secretase. However, this aspect is uncertain. In the original, cited publication (Jonsson et al., 2012) &quot;sAPPα trended non-significantly towards an increase&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52612.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are three issues we would like addressed before acceptance:</p><p>1) All three reviewers found distracting grammatical errors and typos, especially in the Introduction, as well as some under-referenced sections.

We run the gels in the same buffer and at the same voltage, but sometimes the gels “smile.” We suspect, given that these are precast gels, there may be some differences across batches. Additionally, our machines hold 2 gels per apparatus, and the differences described may reflect that they were run on different apparatuses. We avoid stripping and reblotting as this may introduce artifacts (protein effaced from gel, high background, nonspecific bands from prior blots).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) In order to demonstrate the relevance of the novel rat model for AD, analysis of the AD pathological hallmarks as well as behavioural changes should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>Those are indeed important questions that we are addressing in long-term longitudinal studies.

We did notice that the changes in APP processing caused by the Swedish and Icelandic mutations seem to be clearer in females. However, we preferred, and prefer, not to discuss in depth potential sex-differences to avoid overinterpretation of our data. It is possible that analysis of much larger number of animals may indeed unveil sex-specific changes in APP metabolism caused by these mutations. But we have introduced the following sentence in the Discussion: “In addition, as it was noted during the review process, “the changes in APP metabolism, if observed, are in general more pronounced in female vs. male rats”. This is a potential interesting and important gender-difference that will need to be fully explored in future studies with greater power.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is an overlap between data presented in Figures 3 and 5 and 7. However, the overlapping data seem to be inconsistent between the figures. For example, trends towards decreased sAPPα levels are seen in App<sup>p/h</sup> M vs. App<sup>h/h</sup> M rats in Figure 7 while an opposite trend is seen in Figure 3. Similarly, there is an overlap between Figure 4, 6 and 9. The overlapping data seem to be inconsistent between the figures for the βCTF/αCTF analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>For the data in Figure 9 (now Figure 10), there was a mislabeling of the legend. <italic>App<sup>p/h</sup></italic> and <italic>App<sup>s/h</sup></italic> are switched in the quantitation section. The western blots to which they correspond are labeled correctly. Once the data are labeled correctly, the βCTF/αCTF analyses agree with the previous figures. We apologize for this error. For the data in Figure 7 (now Figure 8), that is correct, the discrepancy was also pointed out by reviewer 1 and has been addressed as follows. In Figure 3F, in which data were segregated by sex (n=5), there was a trend toward increase in sAPPα levels in <italic>App<sup>p/h</sup></italic> vs. <italic>App<sup>h/h</sup></italic> rats, for both males and females. The grouped data (n=10) in Figure 3G shows a significant increase. In Figure 7E (now Figure 8E), there is a trend seen only in females and not in males. When we look at pooled data from male and females there is no increase in sAPPα levels in <italic>App<sup>p/h</sup></italic> rats (not shown). The discrepancy between these two sets of data are likely the result of inherent variability between biological samples, which may conceal a subtle change in α-processing of APP caused by the protective mutation. Accordingly, the Results section describing Figure 7E (now Figure 8E), data has been changed to acknowledge the differing results in Figures 3 and 7 (now Figure 8). Nevertheless, the data obtained with homozygous <italic>App<sup>p/p</sup></italic> rats indicate an association of the protective mutation with reduced α-processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the Introduction, the authors write that the Icelandic mutation increases the rate of APP cleavage by α-secretase.
