post-translationally cleaved into disulfide-linked polypeptides α<sub>2</sub> and δ. We now show, using α<sub>2</sub>δ constructs containing artificial cleavage sites, that this processing is an essential step permitting voltage-dependent activation of plasma membrane N-type (Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2) calcium channels. Indeed, uncleaved α2δ inhibits native calcium currents in mammalian neurons. By inducing acute cell-surface proteolytic cleavage of α<sub>2</sub>δ, voltage-dependent activation of channels is promoted, independent from the trafficking role of α<sub>2</sub>δ. Uncleaved α<sub>2</sub>δ does not support trafficking of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channel complexes into neuronal processes, and inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into synaptic boutons, and we can reverse this by controlled intracellular proteolytic cleavage. We propose a model whereby uncleaved α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits maintain immature calcium channels in an inhibited state. Proteolytic processing of α<sub>2</sub>δ then permits voltage-dependent activation of the channels, acting as a checkpoint allowing trafficking only of mature calcium channel complexes into neuronal processes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21143.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21143.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Ca2+ channels</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098360/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kadurin</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferron</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name><name><surname>Rothwell</surname><given-names>Simon W</given-names></name><name><surname>Margas</surname><given-names>Wojciech</given-names></name><name><surname>Nieto-Rostro</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0901758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferron</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name><name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>Leon R</given-names></name><name><surname>Bauer</surname><given-names>Claudia S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0801756</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferron</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name><name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>Leon R</given-names></name><name><surname>Bauer</surname><given-names>Claudia S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/J013285/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferron</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name><name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>Leon R</given-names></name><name><surname>Bauer</surname><given-names>Claudia S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multiple roles of the auxiliary calcium channel α2δ subunits require proteolytic cleavage of the precursor protein into α2 and δ.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>) have been identified to be key proteins in synaptic function and synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kurshan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eroglu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saheki and Bargmann, 2009</xref>). Therefore an understanding of their basic mechanism(s) of action is of paramount importance. Although Ca<sub>V</sub>α1 subunits form the pore and determine the main functional and pharmacological attributes of the channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Catterall, 2000</xref>), the Ca<sub>V</sub>1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels are associated with auxiliary β and α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flockerzi et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Witcher et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 1996</xref>). The α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits increase Ca<sub>V</sub> currents by a mechanism that is less well understood than that of the β subunits, which have a chaperone function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van Petegem et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buraei and Yang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolphin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zamponi et al., 2015</xref>). The topology of the α<sub>2</sub>δ proteins was initially determined for skeletal muscle α<sub>2</sub>δ-1, but is likely to generalize for all α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brickley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gurnett et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">1997</xref>). A single gene encodes each α<sub>2</sub>δ protein, which undergoes several post-translational processing steps, including proteolytic cleavage into disulfide-linked α<sub>2</sub> and δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davies et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jay et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ellis et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Jongh et al., 1990</xref>). Both α<sub>2</sub> and δ have been shown previously to be important for the function of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 to increase Ca<sub>V</sub> currents and influence the biophysical properties of the currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gurnett et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">1997</xref>). The structure of the skeletal muscle Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 complex has recently been determined at 3.6 Å by cryo-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). It shows the interaction of the α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 with several extracellular linkers in Domains I-III of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1. In particular the metal ion adhesion site (MIDAS) motif of the von Willebrand factor-A (VWA) domain interacts with the extracellular loop between transmembrane segments 1 and 2 in Domain I.</p><p>Regarding the mechanism of action of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits, we have recently shown that α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 increases the density of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels inserted into the plasma membrane by about two-fold in undifferentiated neuro2A (N2A) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassidy et al., 2014</xref>); however the increase in currents directly attributable to α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 is much greater than this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, we therefore examined whether there was an additional step responsible for promoting Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 calcium current function by α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits, in addition to their demonstrated effect on calcium channel trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassidy et al., 2014</xref>). We have specifically tested the hypothesis that this step involves the proteolytic processing of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1. Our results show that proteolytic maturation of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits is not only a prerequisite for voltage-dependent activation of calcium channels, but is also an essential checkpoint for trafficking of these mature calcium channels into neuronal processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutation of six amino acids flanking the cleavage site in α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 prevents proteolytic processing of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 into α<sub>2</sub> and δ</title><p>We identified the proteolytic cleavage site in rat α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 to be between A and V in the sequence LEA//VEM, by homology with the published data in rabbit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jay et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Jongh et al., 1990</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). This sequence is strongly conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We initially manipulated the cleavage site in α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), in order to determine the extent of mutation required across this site required to completely prevent proteolytic processing. Transient expression in cell lines of wild type (WT) α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 resulted in only partial cleavage into α<sub>2</sub> and δ subunits, clearly observed only following deglycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, lanes 1 and 3), compared to the complete proteolytic cleavage observed in brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, lanes 2 and 4). Replacing LEAVEM in α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 with a hexavaline (V6) sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) completely prevented its proteolytic processing, as shown by the absence of cleaved α<sub>2</sub>-1 on reducing gels of whole cell lysate (WCL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). More conservative mutations did not effectively prevent the cleavage (data not shown). However, we found that the lack of proteolytic cleavage did not affect the ability of α<sub>2</sub>(V6)δ-1 to bind <sup>3</sup>H-gabapentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Furthermore, the α<sub>2</sub>(V6)δ-1, like wild-type (WT) α<sub>2</sub>δ-1, was found to be concentrated in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and the K<sub>D</sub> for <sup>3</sup>H-gabapentin binding in DRMs was unchanged, being 76.2 ± 7.8 nM for WT α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 and 85.0 ± 13.7 nM for α<sub>2</sub>(V6)δ-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), indicating that the uncleaved pro-form of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 is likely to be correctly folded.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21143.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of mutation of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 to disrupt the proteolytic cleavage site.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cartoon of uncleaved pro-α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 and cleaved α<sub>2</sub>δ-1, showing the approximate position of inserted HA tag and disulfide bonds between α<sub>2</sub> (grey) and δ (blue).

Our main findings are: firstly that proteolytic cleavage of pro-α<sub>2</sub>δ represents an essential step for the expression of mature functional calcium channels. Here we show, using a combination of techniques, that the appearance of functional Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels associated with the proteolytic processing of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits, occurs independently of changes in channel trafficking to the plasma membrane in undifferentiated cell lines. A key experiment is the demonstration that acute restoration of voltage-dependent activation by proteolytic cleavage of pro-α<sub>2</sub>δ can be induced at the cell surface by extracellularly applied protease. Secondly, we find that lack of proteolytic cleavage of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 represents a very significant barrier to trafficking of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels into cultured hippocampal neuronal processes. Trafficking of the channel complex into neurites is dependent on an effect of mature cleaved α<sub>2</sub>δ on Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2, rather than due primarily to the differential ability of mature α<sub>2</sub>δ to be trafficked and uncleaved pro-α<sub>2</sub>δ to be retained in the soma. This is clearly shown by the fact that uncleaved α<sub>2</sub>(3C)δ-1 is fully able to traffic alone into neurites. Thirdly, we provide evidence for an inhibitory role for the pro-form of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1. It is highly likely that proteolytic cleavage of α<sub>2</sub>δ could induce a conformational change, which would impact on its interaction with the α<sub>1</sub>subunit. The recent structure of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 complex resolves the domain structure of the α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 subunit to contain the VWA domain and four tandem cache domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). The δ subunit contributes part of the fourth cache domain, and it is therefore possible that the domain organization would be modified by proteolytic cleavage of α<sub>2</sub>δ.</p><p>In a previous study, we showed that WT α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 increases the amount of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 on the cell surface in N2A cells, by about two-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassidy et al., 2014</xref>). We have also found that heterologously-expressed α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits are only partially processed into α<sub>2</sub> and δ in all expression systems examined, although proteolytic cleavage was much more marked at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davies et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kadurin et al., 2012</xref>). The incomplete cleavage of heterologously expressed WT α<sub>2</sub>δ is in contrast to the complete processing of muscle and brain α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jay et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2013</xref>) and cerebellar α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davies et al., 2006</xref>), and likely represents saturation of the processing enzyme(s). Thus, it was clear that determining the role of proteolytic cleavage of α<sub>2</sub>δ on calcium channel function would require additional strategies. A previous study found that various mutations around the cleavage site reduced, but did not abolish, calcium current enhancement by α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrade et al., 2007</xref>), leaving the role of proteolytic cleavage of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 an open question. Here we show conclusively that for both α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3, mutations that prevent their cleavage into α<sub>2</sub> and δ do not prevent the appearance of pro-α<sub>2</sub>δ on the cell surface. Furthermore, in the cell lines examined here, but not in neurons, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 trafficking to the plasma membrane was enhanced by an uncleaved pro-form of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 to a similar extent as for WT α<sub>2</sub>δ-1, utilising a mechanism that is independent of the plasma membrane potential. However, this led to the increased cell surface expression of a calcium channel complex which appeared to be non-functional, since the uncleaved pro-α<sub>2</sub>δ did not enhance Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 calcium currents. Thus trafficking of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 to the plasma membrane by α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 subunits in cell lines can be uncoupled from the functional effects of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits on voltage-dependent activation of the channels.</p><p>Previous in vitro studies have examined the effect of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits on calcium channel currents resulting from several combinations of Ca<sub>V</sub>α1 and β subunits. In whole-cell current recordings, α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits increase the maximum conductance from 3 to 10-fold, depending on subunit combination and conditions used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mori et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klugbauer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hobom et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barclay et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hendrich et al., 2008</xref>). However, they have no effect on single channel conductance, and for Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels there are only minor effects of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits on most parameters relating to open probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barclay et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodbeck et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wakamori et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meir and Dolphin, 1998</xref>), which would be unlikely to account for the large increase in whole-cell conductance. By contrast, a finding that is consistent with the increase in whole-cell current, is that the fraction of null traces was markedly reduced by α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 in unitary current recordings from oocytes expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2/β1b/α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 (9% null traces), a 3–4-fold decrease, compared with those expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 alone (39% null traces) or Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2/β1b (28% null traces) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wakamori et al., 1999</xref>). This observation suggests that α<sub>2</sub>δ shifts the equilibrium towards active modes of the channel, from an inactive null mode represented by the long closed state. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 promotes voltage sensor movement of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Savalli et al., 2016</xref>), thus hyperpolarizing channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Savalli et al., 2016</xref>). Although the interaction of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits with Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels may differ, as there is not such a clear shift in the voltage-dependence of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kadurin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canti et al., 2005</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that the association of the channels with uncleaved pro-α<sub>2</sub>δ might interfere with voltage sensor movement.</p><p>We have found previously that the MIDAS motif in the VWA domains of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 subunits is key to increasing calcium channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassidy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canti et al., 2005</xref>). The recent structure of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 indicates that the VWA domain MIDAS motif of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 closely associates with the loop between S1 and S2 in Domain I of the α1S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). The VWA domain is present in all α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits, but it only has a perfect MIDAS motif in α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolphin, 2013</xref>). Thus α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 has an incomplete MIDAS motif, which is predicted to have reduced function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Whittaker and Hynes, 2002</xref>), and indeed α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 has less effect on cell surface expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 than α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 in the present study (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4b</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with the hypothesis that pro-α<sub>2</sub>δ is an inhibitory gate-keeper for calcium channel function, we observed here that an uncleaved α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 construct (α<sub>2</sub>(3C)δ-1) had an inhibitory effect on endogenous DRG neuron calcium currents, and on presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in hippocampal neuronal boutons, which could be reversed by co-expression of the 3C-protease. This is in contrast to a previous study in which overexpression of WT α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits, which will form a mixture of both cleaved and uncleaved α<sub>2</sub>δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>). Our result indicates that proteolytic processing of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 represents an essential functional checkpoint to allow channel activation by depolarization, and the pro-α<sub>2</sub>δ species inhibits function.</p><p>Furthermore, we show here that native pro-α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 can be observed in the cell bodies of DRG neurons, but in the axons it is completely processed to α<sub>2</sub> and δ; this is despite the fact that it is still present in intracellular trafficking vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>). It is of interest in this regard that although α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 is elevated in all DRG neurons following nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luo et al., 2001</xref>), calcium currents from DRGs extracted after nerve injury show a variable decrease in calcium currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hogan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCallum et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2011</xref>). This would agree with the present finding that somatic DRG α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 upregulated after nerve injury remains in part uncleaved, and that only when in its mature processed form can it function to increase calcium currents and trafficking of calcium channels into neurites.</p><p>The functional importance of proteolytic cleavage of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits is further emphasised by our finding that the trafficking of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 into the processes of cultured hippocampal neurons is completely prevented by the uncleaved α<sub>2</sub>(3C)δ-1, and this is reversed by its intracellular proteolytic cleavage with the 3C protease. Thus, the proteolytic processing of α<sub>2</sub>δ represents an essential checkpoint for neuronal trafficking of calcium channels, to ensure that only mature channel complexes capable of voltage-dependent activation reach specific plasma membrane domains such as presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have shown previously that the small GTPase, rab11, is involved in α<sub>2</sub>δ-mediated trafficking of calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tran-Van-Minh and Dolphin, 2010</xref>), and rab11, among many other proteins, is important for vesicular cargo transport into neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Villarroel-Campos et al., 2016</xref>). We have also identified the importance of adaptor protein-1 in Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macabuag and Dolphin, 2015</xref>). It will be of great interest in future studies to determine the additional mechanisms present in neurons, in contrast to non-neuronal cell lines, restricting the cargo transport into neurites to activatable calcium channel complexes in which α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits are proteolytically cleaved.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>The cDNAs used were: rat α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 (M86621) and mouse α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 (AJ010949), rabbit Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 (D14157 without 3' UTR), and rat β1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tomlinson et al., 1993</xref>).

Proteolytic cleavage site mutations were made as indicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4c</xref>). GFP-β1b was used in some electrophysiological experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waithe et al., 2011</xref>). Human TASK3 (<italic>KCNK9</italic>) cDNA (NM_001282534) was obtained from Prof. A Mathie. The cDNAs were in the pMT2 vector for expression in tsA-201 cells, in pcDNA3 for expression in N2A cells and pcDNA3 or pCAGGS for expression in DRG or hippocampal neurons, respectively. In our hands expression of the large constructs encoding Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 and α<sub>2</sub>δ in pcDNA3 was very poor in hippocampal neurons (data not shown), whereas expression from the pCAGGS vector, containing chicken β-actin promoter, was strong and sustained. The cDNAs encoding Human Rhinovirus (HRV)−3C protease or mutated 3C (in which the active site Cys-147 was mutated to Val) were first subcloned into the pHLSec vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yurtsever et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aricescu et al., 2006</xref>), using Age I and Kpn I sites in frame with an N-terminal signal sequence, to include the signal sequence from pHLSec, and then into pMT2 and pCAGGS vectors for expression in cell lines or hippocampal neurons. VAMP-mOr2 was generated by replacing mCherry from pCAGGs-VAMPmCherry (gift from Dr. TA Ryan) with mOrange2. Sy-GCaMP6f was made by replacing GCaMP3 in pCMV-SyGCaMP3 (gift from Dr. TA Ryan) by GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).

Briefly, 72 hr after transfection, tsA-201 cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0.5 mg/ml Premium Grade EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo Scientific) in PBS and the reaction was quenched with 200 mM glycine. The cells were incubated for 45 min on ice in PBS, pH 7.4 at 4°C containing 1% Igepal; 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitors (PI, cOmplete, Roche; used according to manufacturer’s instructions), to allow cell lysis. The WCL was then centrifuged at 18,000 ×g for 20 min at 4°C and the pellet discarded. The supernatant was assayed for total protein (Bradford assay, Biorad). Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kadurin et al., 2012</xref>). Cleared WCL corresponding to 20–40 µg total protein was diluted with Laemmli sample buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davies et al., 2010</xref>) supplemented with 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), incubated at 60°C for 10 min and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 3%–8% Tris-Acetate or 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Biorad) by western blotting. When required the membrane was cut and incubated with different antibodies. Biotinylated lysates (adjusted to between 0.5 and 1 mg/ml total protein concentration) were applied to 40 µl prewashed streptavidin-agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) and rotated overnight at 4°C. The beads were then washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Igepal and, when required, the streptavidin beads were re-suspended in PNGase-F buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, supplemented with 75 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Igepal, 0.1% SDS, and PI) and deglycosylated for 3 hr at 37°C with 1 unit of PNGase-F (Roche Applied Science) added per 10 μl volume. The samples were then resuspended in an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli buffer with 100 mM DTT, followed by 10 min incubation at 60°C. The eluted protein was analysed by immunoblotting, as described above. GAPDH is ~39 kDa and does not resolve well in 3–8% Tris-Acetate gels. Therefore, in cases when 3–8% gels were used to resolve high MW proteins, which required GAPDH as negative control for biotinylated fractions, the same samples were re-loaded on a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel to analyse separately.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Co–immunoprecipitation</title><p>The protocol was adapted from a procedure described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gurnett et al., 1997</xref>).

The beads were then pelleted by 500 ×g centrifugation at 4°C and washed three times with co-IP buffer containing 0.2% Digitonin. The beads were then resuspended in an equal volume of PNGase-F buffer and proteins were deglycosylated with PNGase-F as described above.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Johannes Hell (Reviewer #3), and the evaluation has been overseen by Mary Kennedy as Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Kadurin et al. probe the significance of proteolytic processing of the auxiliary α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 for its trafficking to the cell surface and to the presynaptic compartment and for its role in regulation of channel activity. They find that a hexa-valine mutation of the putative proteolytic cleavage site in α<sub>2</sub>δ prevents proteolytic processing but allows cell surface expression of the α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit and normal binding to the Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 channel. Surprisingly, proteolytic processing of α<sub>2</sub>δ is required for voltage-dependent activation, indicating a functional role in ion channel regulation for this posttranslational processing reaction. Addition of an exogenous proteolytic cleavage site allows activation of α<sub>2</sub>δ function by exogenous protease. Proteolytic processing can occur after insertion into the plasma membrane and can rescue inactive Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 channels there. In cultured DRG neurons, α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits are processed in intracellular compartments, and their proteolytic processing controls trafficking into neurites and synaptic boutons, cell surface expression, and voltage-dependent activation of calcium channel function in nerve terminals. Thus, the authors describe three novel physiological aspects of the function of the α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit of voltage-gated Ca channels in the context of the N-type channel Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2. Firstly, α<sub>2</sub>δ strongly augments open probability of Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 independent of its role in promoting surface trafficking. Secondly, cleavage of the uncleaved pro-α<sub>2</sub> is required for this effect, as shown by extremely thorough experiments including acute application of thrombin to a modified α<sub>2</sub>δ in which the endogenous cleavage site has been replaced by a thrombin cleavage site. Thirdly, uncleaved pro-α<sub>2</sub> inhibits secretory trafficking of Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 in neurons.</p><p>This is a very important manuscript because it shows how an auxiliary subunit of a presynaptic calcium channel can control channel localization and function through posttranslational processing. Work from the Dolphin lab and others has shown how the α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit enhances trafficking in transfected cells and neurons. This manuscript adds a major new dimension by showing that proteolytic processing of this subunit is required for both trafficking to nerve terminals and for activation of the channel at the cell surface. The work is comprehensive and exceptionally well done. The findings are of broad interest, not least because upregulation of Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2, and especially its association with α<sub>2</sub>δ, is a critical aspect of neuropathic pain.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The site of proteolytic processing of α<sub>2</sub>δ was shown in two manuscripts in 1990 (JBC 265:14738) and 1991 (JBC 266:3287) to be at Ala934, with the δ subunit beginning with the N-terminal sequence ADMEDDD. Both papers should be cited.</p><p>2) Surprisingly, it seems that the V6 mutation and other mutations used here do not overlap the reported site of cleavage for α<sub>2</sub>δ-1. Has the site of cleavage been verified for the amino acid sequences shown here? Reviewer #3 commented that the original work in rabbit muscle identified the sequence ADMEDDD as the N-terminal sequence of the δ subunit, which is cleaved off the α<sub>2</sub>δ precursor. The preceding sequence in the rabbit (and rat) gene is PRLLEA. Accordingly, the cleavage site consists in rabbit of PRLLEA//ADMEDDD and in rat of PRLLEA//VDMEEDD. It seems to me that this is reasonably good conservation – there are only two conservative differences (Valine instead of Alanine and then in position 5 after cleavage Aspartate instead of Glutamate. The rat sequence is (PRLLEA//VDMEEDD) and this is 100% identical in many other mammals including donkey and camelids. The authors might want to discuss this conservation issue and verify the site of cleavage.</p><p>3) It is not immediately clear to the general reader why in the HEK-derived tsA cells non-cleavable α<sub>2</sub> would (modestly) promote Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 surface expression comparable to wild type α<sub>2</sub>δ when in neurons it clearly impairs trafficking. Perhaps the reason is similar to what one sees for the L-type channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 – most of the channel is stuck inside the cell and doesn't seem to readily traffic to the surface with the exception of a small fraction of the channel population that escapes ER and that escape could be promoted by α<sub>2</sub>δ in a manner that doesn't apply to endogenous systems? It might be difficult to put a finger on the exact reason but perhaps some more explicit discussion would be helpful. This issue doesn't bear on the main findings, which are completely supported by the current work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21143.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the Editor and reviewers for their comments. One point we would like to make clear is that our initial studies using the hexavaline mutations in α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 mainly served as proof of concept that we could disrupt their cleavage sites. These constructs were not used in cell surface expression studies. In all subsequent studies we used α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits with either of the artificial cleavage sites (HRV-3C or thrombin).</p><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions: 1) The site of proteolytic processing of α2δ was shown in two manuscripts in 1990 (JBC 265:14738) and 1991 (JBC 266:3287) to be at Ala934, with the δ subunit beginning with the N-terminal sequence ADMEDDD.

The authors might want to discuss this conservation issue and verify the site of cleavage.</italic> </p><p>The polyvaline and other mutations used <italic>do</italic> overlap the predicted cleavage site in α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 (see alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which as one reviewer mentioned is quite well conserved between rabbit and rat. We now discuss that the cleavage site in rabbit α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 was identified (/ in the sequence below) by N-terminal sequencing of the δ-1 peptides, which identified ADM at the start of all three δ-1 peptides. The sequence in rat α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 used here is aligned below to some other mammalian species.</p><p>NP_001075745 <italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic> TFPRLLEA/ADMEDDDFTASMSK</p><p>NP_037051.2 <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> TFPRLLEA VEMEEDDFTASMSK</p><p>XP_010976290 <italic>Camelus dromedaries</italic> TFPRLLEA VEMEEDDFTASLSK</p><p>XP_014710873 <italic>Equus asinus</italic> TFPRLLEA VEMEEDDFTASLSK</p><p>From the good sequence alignment, identical before the cleavage site, we predicted the cleavage site in rat α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 to be between A and V.

Perhaps the reason is similar to what one sees for the L-type channel Cav1.2 – most of the channel is stuck inside the cell and doesn't seem to readily traffic to the surface with the exception of a small fraction of the channel population that escapes ER and that escape could be promoted by α2δ in a manner that doesn't apply to endogenous systems? It might be difficult to put a finger on the exact reason but perhaps some more explicit discussion would be helpful. This issue doesn't bear on the main findings, which are completely supported by the current work.</italic> </p><p>We were also surprised to find that non-cleavable α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 promotes trafficking of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 in both N2A cells, and to a slightly smaller extent in tsA-201 cells. We suggest this is because there are fewer check points in non-neuronal cells for channel trafficking, which do not apply in neurons. Initially we hypothesised that a difference in membrane potential might be the key feature, discriminating between neurons and non-neuronal cells, but this did not prove to be the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We have now discussed this point further in the Discussion, with respect to the presence of additional checkpoints in neurons for cargo selection into specific trafficking pathways.</p></body></sub-article></article>
