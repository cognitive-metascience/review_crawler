In the complex, Pol α and primase cooperate in the production of RNA-DNA oligonucleotides that prime synthesis of new DNA. Here we report crystal structures of the catalytic core of yeast Pol α in unliganded form, bound to an RNA primer/DNA template and extending an RNA primer with deoxynucleotides. We combine the structural analysis with biochemical and computational data to demonstrate that Pol α specifically recognizes the A-form RNA/DNA helix and that the ensuing synthesis of B-form DNA terminates primer synthesis. The spontaneous release of the completed RNA-DNA primer by the Pol α/primase complex simplifies current models of primer transfer to leading- and lagging strand polymerases. The proposed mechanism of nucleotide polymerization by Pol α might contribute to genomic stability by limiting the amount of inaccurate DNA to be corrected at the start of each Okazaki fragment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00482.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00482.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00482.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During mitosis, a cell duplicates its DNA and then divides, ultimately generating two genetically identical daughter cells. In eukaryotes, the process of DNA duplication occurs at multiple sites throughout the genome: at each site, the antiparallel strands of the parental DNA separate and provide a template for DNA polymerase (Pol), the enzyme that synthesizes the two new DNA strands. Duplication of the DNA proceeds in both directions from each site through the polymerization of nucleotides to form new strands of DNA that are complementary to the template strands. However, since DNA polymerases can only polymerize nucleotides in one direction, the 5′ to 3′ direction, synthesis of the so-called leading strand proceeds continuously, whereas the other, lagging strand is synthesized in fragments.</p><p>The task of duplicating the bulk of the DNA is shared between Pol δ, which is primarily responsible for synthesis of the lagging strand, and Pol ε, which fulfils the same role for the leading strand. However, Pols δ and ε cannot initiate DNA synthesis by themselves; short RNA-DNA chains called primers must also be paired to each template strand. Production of the primers requires the concerted action of two more enzymes: an RNA polymerase known as primase, and another DNA polymerase called Pol α. It is known that completion of the RNA-DNA primer requires Pol α to increase the length of the RNA segment by adding extra nucleotides, but the details of this process are poorly understood.</p><p>Perera et al. combined crystallographic, biochemical and computational evidence to describe how Pol α first recognizes and then extends the RNA strand in the primer. They found that Pol α recognizes the particular shape of double helix—an A-form helix—that is formed by the DNA template and the RNA primer. The geometry of this helix prompts the Pol α enzyme to start adding nucleotides to the RNA in the primer. Perera et al. determined that once a full turn of double-helix DNA has been synthesized, Pol α is no longer in direct contact with the A-form helix, which causes the enzyme to disengage and terminate polymerization, leaving behind the now complete RNA-DNA primer.</p><p>Perera et al. offer a new paradigm for understanding the initiation of DNA synthesis in eukaryotic replication. Their work suggests that Pol α has the ability to discriminate between different shapes of the primer-template helix, thus providing a mechanistic understanding of primer release. The spontaneous release of the primer offers a simple and elegant way to limit DNA synthesis by Pol α, a polymerase that is prone to error, and to make the RNA-DNA primer directly available for extension by Pol δ and Pol ε.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00482.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00482.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>DNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>Initiation of DNA synthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>084279/Z/07/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pellegrini</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The details of how the enzyme DNA polymerase α initiates the polymerization of nucleotides in DNA replication, a critical step in the synthesis of new chromosomal DNA, have been revealed in atomic detail.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular organisms initiate DNA synthesis during genome duplication by the universal mechanism of RNA priming, the assembly of short RNA molecules on the unwound strands of the DNA helix by a specialized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase known as primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frick and Richardson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuchta and Stengel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DePamphilis and Bell, 2011</xref>). The RNA primers are extended in an obligate 5′ to 3′ direction by the replicative DNA polymerases that synthesize the bulk of chromosomal DNA. The initiation of DNA synthesis is made more complicated by the concurrent duplication of the antiparallel strands of parental DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamdan and van Oijen, 2010</xref>). The repeated priming events necessary for the discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand require the constant activity of primase at the replication fork.</p><p>In bacteria and bacteriophages, RNA priming is performed by a single-chain primase, acting in combination with the replicative helicase, to which it is bound by a dynamic interaction or is fused together in the same polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Patel et al., 2011</xref>). The molecular apparatus responsible for initiation of DNA synthesis in eukaryotic replication is more complex. The eukaryotic primase is a heterodimer of catalytic and regulatory subunits that is associated with the catalytic subunit of Pol α and its accessory B subunit in a constitutive heterotetrameric assembly, the Pol α/primase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loeb et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaguni and Lehman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foiani et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lao-Sirieix et al., 2005b</xref>). Reflecting its critical importance to DNA replication, the Pol α/primase complex is an integral component of the eukaryotic replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calzada et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The oligonucleotides synthesized by bacterial and bacteriophage primases are between 4 and 12 nucleotides long and made exclusively of RNA. In contrast, the Pol α/primase complex produces longer, composite RNA-DNA primers that result from the concerted enzymatic activities of primase and Pol α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Singh, et al., 1986</xref>). The constitutive association of Pol α and primase in the cell reflects presumably their tight functional coordination, demanded by the frequent priming necessary for lagging strand synthesis. Detailed knowledge of the mechanism of primer synthesis is lacking, but it must involves initiation, extension and completion of RNA synthesis by primase, intramolecular hand-off of the RNA oligonucleotide to Pol α and limited RNA extension with deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks and Dumas, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuchta et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Copeland and Wang, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sheaff and Kuchta, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sheaff et al., 1994</xref>). The large subunit of primase performs a critical function in the primer initiation step via its Fe-S domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klinge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiner et al., 2007</xref>), whereas the B subunit of Pol α lacks enzymatic activity and likely acts as a scaffold to mediate interactions with other components of the replicative apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uchiyama and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klinge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>After completion of primer synthesis by Pol α/primase, the primer is elongated by the processive Pols δ and ε that synthesize the majority of chromosomal DNA on the lagging and leading strand templates, respectively. Synchronization of priming with Okazaki fragment synthesis requires a concerted mode of primer transfer from Pol α to Pol δ and several mechanisms of polymerase switch have been put forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuzhakov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maga et al., 2000</xref>). Before ligation of the completed Okazaki fragments, the RNA portion of the primer is excised by specific nucleases such as Fen1 and Dna2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgers, 2009</xref>). The composite nature of the RNA-DNA primers poses a special challenge to the eukaryotic replication apparatus, that must further correct the DNA segment synthesized by Pol α, which lacks proofreading activity; current evidence indicates that the DNA portion of the primer might be corrected by Pol δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pavlov et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Despite its central role in genomic duplication, the molecular mechanism of primer synthesis by the Pol α/primase complex is poorly understood and structural insights remain limited. Here we use a multi-disciplinary approach to elucidate the structural basis for the catalytic role of Pol α in the synthesis of the RNA-DNA oligonucleotides that prime DNA synthesis in eukaryotic replication. We demonstrate that Pol α recognizes the intrinsic and induced conformation of the A-form RNA primer/DNA template helix and that the resulting synthesis of B-form DNA forms the basis for a feedback mechanism of primer termination. Our findings provide a new paradigm for a critical step in the complex choreography of events that ultimately lead to replication of the lagging DNA strand.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structure of actively copying Pol α</title><p>We have determined crystal structures of the catalytic core (349–1258; 910 amino acids) of yeast Pol α in unliganded form (apo), bound to an RNA primer/DNA template duplex (binary complex) and in a productive complex with RNA primer/DNA template and incoming dGTP (ternary complex).

The 5′-terminal nucleotide of the RNA primer remains trapped by multiple polar and hydrophobic interactions in a pocket on the surface of the palm domain, whilst its templating nucleotide in the DNA molecule is disordered in the electron density map and is not included in the crystallographic model.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00482.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00482.010</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00482-fig1-figsupp7-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00482.011</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>X-ray data processing and crystallographic refinement</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00482.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00482.011</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td colspan="13">X-ray data processing</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="3">Seleno-methionine</td><td colspan="3">Apo</td><td colspan="3">Binary complex</td><td colspan="3">Ternary complex</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Space group</td><td colspan="3">P 2 2<sub>1</sub> 2<sub>1</sub></td><td colspan="3">P2<sub>1</sub></td><td colspan="3">P1</td><td colspan="3">P 2<sub>1</sub> 2<sub>1</sub> 2<sub>1</sub></td></tr><tr><td>Unit cell (Å)</td><td colspan="3">74.0 127.5 144.1</td><td colspan="3">74.4 127.1 74.5</td><td colspan="3">72.1 74.8 117.0</td><td colspan="3">111.7 145.7 197.2</td></tr><tr><td>Angles (°)</td><td colspan="3">90.0 90.0 90.0</td><td colspan="3">90.0 104.8 90.0</td><td colspan="3">82.3 72.6 82.4</td><td colspan="3">90.0 90.0 90.0</td></tr><tr><td>Mosaicity</td><td colspan="3">0.39</td><td colspan="3">0.54</td><td colspan="3">0.77</td><td colspan="3">0.35</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Overall</td><td>Innershell</td><td>Outershell</td><td>Overall</td><td>Innershell</td><td>Outershell</td><td>Overall</td><td>Innershell</td><td>Outershell</td><td>Overall</td><td>Innershell</td><td>Outershell</td></tr><tr><td>Low resolution limit (Å)</td><td>73.97</td><td>73.97</td><td>2.81</td><td>53.51</td><td>53.51</td><td>2.42</td><td>58.77</td><td>58.77</td><td>3.16</td><td>49.39</td><td>49.39</td><td>3.26</td></tr><tr><td>High resolution limit (Å)</td><td>2.67</td><td>8.43</td><td>2.67</td><td>2.3</td><td>7.27</td><td>2.3</td><td>3</td><td>9.49</td><td>3</td><td>3.1</td><td>9.79</td><td>3.1</td></tr><tr><td>R<sub>merge</sub></td><td>0.133</td><td>0.052</td><td>0.663</td><td>0.085</td><td>0.039</td><td>0.512</td><td>0.073</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.921</td><td>0.105</td><td>0.042</td><td>0.974</td></tr><tr><td>R<sub>merge</sub> in top intensity bin</td><td>0.061</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>0.051</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>0.029</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>0.046</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>R<sub>meas</sub> (within I+/I−)</td><td>0.14</td><td>0.054</td><td>0.703</td><td>0.104</td><td>0.048</td><td>0.621</td><td>0.085</td><td>0.035</td><td>1.068</td><td>0.113</td><td>0.046</td><td>1.05</td></tr><tr><td>R<sub>meas</sub> (all I+ &amp;

Two sequence motifs, residues 1074–1077 in the long segment of the L-shaped thumb, and residues 1130–1150 in the tip of the thumb, form a continuous protein interface that tracks the position of the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA primer. Pol α exploits the wide, shallow nature of the minor groove of the RNA/DNA helix with a series of hydrophobic contacts involving the side chains of Met1131, Leu1133, Tyr1140, Pro1141, Met1146, which recognize the C3′-endo conformation of the ribose moieties of RNA nucleotides in position four to six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>The contiguous pair of invariant arginine residues 1075 and 1076 straddles the ribose-phosphate backbone between nucleotides three and four from the 3′-end of the RNA primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

However, in the case of Pol α the close contact with Arg1075 induces a local rearrangement of the RNA conformation, which includes a B-DNA C2′-endo ribose pucker for Ade4 and unstacking between the aromatic bases of nucleotides four and five (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>).

The result of the structural study prompted us to investigate whether the polymerase activity of Pol α reflected such specificity. In order to test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of the polymerase domain of yeast Pol α to extend with deoxynucleotides a templated primer made of either RNA or DNA. Whereas Pol α displayed only weak activity and limited processivity when extending a DNA primer, extension of an RNA primer resulted in much higher levels of polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Strikingly, the profile of RNA-dependent extension products showed a pronounced peak at between 10 to 12 nucleotides, indicating strong processivity limited to a full-turn of double helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).

Elongation of the RNA primer with deoxynucleotides would cause translocation of the polymerase beyond the RNA/DNA duplex region and onto B-DNA, with loss of the RNA-specific contacts, eventually causing Pol α to stall and terminate primer synthesis. We sought to test this mechanism of primer termination by design of DNA primer sequences with altered conformational properties. It is known that, although double-stranded DNA normally adopts a B-DNA conformation, its structure can display pronounced conformational variation depending on the local sequence of bases. Short runs of consecutive deoxyguanosine nucleotides can induce A-like DNA conformation in double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Svozil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marathe et al., 2009</xref>). We examined the ability of Pol α to extend a templated oligo(dA) primer with increasing deoxyguanylate content, introduced incrementally as di- and tri-nucleotides. Indeed, as the deoxyguanosine content of the DNA primer increased, the size profile of the extension products synthesized by Pol α changed from that expected of a DNA primer to that of an RNA primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>RNA-DNA primer termination and release</title><p>The observation that extension of the RNA primer is limited to a single turn of double helix indicates that termination of primer synthesis might be triggered by the loss of specific interactions of Pol α with the RNA/DNA duplex. Further insight as to the possible structural basis for a termination mechanism can be obtained by comparing the structures of isolated and actively copying Pol α, which reveals a striking difference in the position of the thumb domain. In order to adopt the conformation observed in ternary complex, the thumb domain of Pol α must rotate inwards by about 20°, a large conformational rearrangement compared for instance with the limited movement of the thumb domain observed in structures of isolated and copying RB69 Pol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The large difference in the position of the thumb domain in the ternary complex and in the isolated polymerase suggests a molecular basis for the release of the completed primer-template by Pol α: loss of the interactions with the primer-template duplex would allow the thumb domain to rotate away from the DNA, terminating the productive engagement of the polymerase with its substrate.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00482.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Conformational changes of Pol α during DNA priming.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural superposition of the isolated and active conformations of the polymerase domain of Pol α (left) and RB69 Pol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franklin et al., 2001</xref>; right; PDB entries 1IH7 and 1IG9).

The two copies of binary complex present in the asymmetric unit of the crystals capture intermediate states of the transition, as in one binary complex the conformation of region II is apo-like, whereas in the second copy region II adopts a conformation akin to that observed in the ternary complex. The range of positions adopted by the palm domain in the apo, binary and ternary complex structures suggests that adoption of an active conformation by Pol α might require a wider set of conformational rearrangements than predicted by current models of DNA polymerase activity. The observed movement of the palm domain could participate in a ‘ratchet' mechanism for unidirectional translocation of Pol α, as return of the palm domain to the apo conformation after catalysis would propel the polymerase forward onto the next templating base. Interestingly, site-specific mutations of Ser863 in region II of human Pol α (Ser867 of yeast Pol α), which acts as the pivot during rotation of the palm domain, cause a drastic reduction in the specific activity of the polymerase without changing its kinetic parameters, in agreement with a potential structural role of this serine residue in DNA polymerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 1993</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have presented structural, biochemical and computational experiments that address the essential role of Pol α in the initiation of DNA synthesis in eukaryotic replication.

Recognition of the intrinsic and induced geometry of the RNA/DNA helix by Pol α would prompt rapid dNTP polymerization, until a full turn of DNA double helix has been synthesized.

Loss of the optimal interface contacts between Pol α and the primer-template helix would favor a conformational change towards the apo conformation of the polymerase, with consequent disengagement of Pol α from the completed RNA-DNA primer.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00482.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mechanism of DNA primer synthesis by Pol α.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Priming eukaryotic replication requires synthesis of an RNA primer by the primase subunit of the Pol α/primase complex, intramolecular primer hand-off to the catalytic subunit of Pol α and limited primer extension with DNA; processive elongation of the completed RNA-DNA primer by Pol δ results in Okazaki fragment synthesis.

Uninterrupted DNA synthesis during replication depends on the tight coordination of Pol α function with the upstream activity of primase, that synthesizes the RNA primer, and the downstream activity of Pol δ, that elongates the resulting RNA-DNA primers. The efficient mechanism for the rapid extension and controlled termination of RNA primers by Pol α uncovered here seems ideally suited for the frequently repeated, highly integrated priming events taking place on the lagging strand template. After termination of synthesis and release of the completed primer, the physical tethering of Pol α to primase would facilitate its recycling onto the 3′-end of the next RNA primer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nunez-Ramirez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kilkenny et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The evidence for a mechanism of primer release which stems from Pol α's ability to discriminate between different shapes of the primer-template helix is relevant to our mechanistic understanding of the coordinated sequence of events that take place during Okazaki fragment synthesis. Spontaneous primer release once a helical equivalent of deoxynucleotides has been added to the RNA primer would make the 3′-terminus of the RNA-DNA primer directly available for extension by Pol δ and Pol ε, the DNA polymerases that synthesize the bulk of genomic DNA. Such a mechanism provides a straightforward model of primer hand-off in eukaryotic replication, by removing the need for molecular transactions between primer-bound Pol α and the replicative apparatus deputed to leading and lagging strand synthesis. We note that, although the molecular details differ, the mechanism of primer release by Pol α described here is conceptually similar to the mechanism of polymerase switching proposed for Pol η after lesion by-pass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biertumpfel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Silverstein et al., 2010</xref>): for both polymerases, termination of DNA synthesis appears to be a direct consequence of the specific way in which they interact with their nucleic acid substrate.</p><p>The ability of primases to synthesise RNA primers of discrete size has been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuchta and Stengel, 2010</xref>). Our work has highlighted a previously unappreciated functional similarity between primase and Pol α, as extension of an RNA primer by Pol α leads to controlled termination of synthesis, in a functionally analogous manner to the known counting ability of primase. This functional symmetry in the behavior of the two polymerases responsible for priming DNA synthesis seems logical, as the lack of proof-reading ability by Pol α poses a potential threat to genomic stability. Thus, in addition to excising the RNA portion of the primer, eukaryotic replication faces the additional challenge of correcting possible mismatches introduced by Pol α in the DNA segment of the primer. How mistakes made by Pol α are corrected by the replication apparatus has not been fully elucidated yet but current evidence points to a proofreading role of Pol δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pavlov et al., 2006</xref>). The mechanism of primer termination indicated by our findings would constitute a simple and elegant way to limit the extent of inaccurate DNA that needs to be corrected from the 5′-terminus of each Okazaki fragment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression and purification</title><p>A gene segment corresponding to amino acids 349–1258 of the yeast Pol α (910 residues; hereinafter referred to as Pol α) was PCR amplified from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genomic DNA and inserted by enzymatic restriction into the pRSFDuet-1 vector (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) for bacterial over-expression, as a polypeptide fused at its N-terminus to a dual histidine and streptavidin TEV-cleavable tag.

A longer, disordered loop region spanning amino acids 816–840 (25 residues) was too long for modeling without template; the equivalent region in the crystal structure of Pol δ (residues 578–585; PDB ID 3IAY) was used instead. The C-terminal helix of the thumb domain (residues 1229–1242) is disordered in the apo structure and was modeled based on its conformation in the structure of the ternary complex. After modelling of the missing loops, the Pol α polypeptide comprises 877 residues. In addition to the Pol α polypeptide, the ternary complex contains one template DNA molecule of 16 deoxyribonucleotides, one RNA primer of nine ribonucleotides extended at the 3′-end with two deoxynucleotides and one deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP). The 5′-terminal ribonucleotide of the RNA primer was excluded from the model of ternary complex, as it makes extensive contacts with the other Pol α chain in the asymmetric unit and does not form a Watson-Crick base pair.</p><p>The dynamic behaviour of Pol α was explored by simulating the trajectory of the apo structure (APO trajectory), of the ternary complex (HOLO trajectory) and of the polymerase structure in the conformation adopted in the ternary complex but in the absence of RNA/DNA and dGTP (APOFORCED trajectory). A total of six trajectories were simulated: two APO trajectories of 150 ns, two HOLO trajectories of 100 ns and two APOFORCED trajectories of 100 ns.</p><p>Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the AMBER11 package, using the AMBER FF99SB force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). A dodecahedral box of water molecules, treated as in the TIP3P model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>), was built around the complexes and a physiological concentration of 0.15 M NaCl (72 counterions each) was added to the box. The dGTP molecule, present in the HOLO structure, has been parameterized using the GAFF code, as implemented in AMBER. The following protocol was used for all the simulations: (1) <italic>in vacuo</italic> minimization (1000 steps); (2) minimization, keeping the complexes fixed, allowing water molecules and ions to equilibrate (1000 steps of steepest descent plus 1000 steps of conjugate gradient); (3) minimization of all the system, without restrictions (1000 steps of steepest descent plus 1000 steps of conjugate gradient); (4) NVT equilibration, 1 ns; (5) production phase. All calculations were performed with the CUDA-enabled version of PMEMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goetz, et al., 2012</xref>), using TESLA GPUs at the High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster of the University of Cambridge. Two TESLA-GPUs perform approximately 4 ns/day, when computing a system of approximately 115000 atoms. Analysis of the trajectories was performed with the AMBERTOOLS 1.5 and GROMACS packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hess et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Principal component analysis was used to compare the principal modes of motion of Pol α in the APO, HOLO and APOFORCED trajectories. The covariance matrix of the APOFORCED trajectories was constructed, based on the three-dimensional positional fluctuations of C-α atoms from their ensemble average position, and diagonalized, creating a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues that represent the direction and the amplitude of the motion, respectively. All the trajectories were projected on the first two eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the APOFORCED trajectories, in order to compare the regions sampled along common eigenvectors and to analyze the distribution of the motion. Construction and diagonalization of the covariance matrix was performed using the g_covar command of GROMACS. Projection of structures onto eigenvectors was performed using the g_anaeig command of GROMACS. All the other analyses have been performed with GROMACS tools, such as g_rms, g_rmsf, g_cluster. AmberTools's ptraj was used for the DSSP calculations and for all the transformation of the trajectories.</p><p>Artwork figures were prepared with PyMOL (Version 1.5.0.4, Schrödinger LLC, http://www.pymol.org/), Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and QuteMol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tarini et al., 2006</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers. The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. We anticipate that you will be able to deal with all of these comments by revising the text of the manuscript, and we look forward to receiving your revised manuscript soon.</p><p>This study investigates one of the most frequent DNA transactions in a eukaryotic cell, the initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis during nuclear DNA replication. The manuscript describes X-ray crystal structures of the catalytic subunit of yeast DNA polymerase alpha in three states (apo, bound to RNA-primed DNA, and a complete catalytic complex). The polymerase is shown to bind to an RNA/DNA helix containing a turn of A-form base pairs in the duplex upstream of the active site. Biochemical and computational results are presented that lead the authors to suggest a mechanism for the termination of primer synthesis by polymerase alpha after one helical turn, allowing transfer of the primer-template to the DNA polymerases that perform most of nuclear DNA replication. The enzyme binds selectively to the A-form helix embodied by the RNA-DNA substrate. Primer extension with deoxynucletides is expected to change the conformation of the primer-template towards a B-form helix, which would not be optimal for the observed contacts seen with the A-form primer-template in the crystal structure. Release of Pol α enables Pol δ to proceed to complete the faithful synthesis of Okazaki fragments.</p><p>This is an excellent paper in which the structural and biochemical analyses are augmented by molecular dynamics simulations that show that the polymerase is so constructed that it requires the presence of the RNA-DNA hybrid to maintain a closed form (in contrast to a bacteriophage DNA polymerase of the same family). The crystallographic data presented are impressive and are technically sound, and the structures are novel. The observations presented here are consistent with the authors' hypothesis about DNA release from Pol α, which is logical and elegant in its simplicity. This manuscript elucidates a fundamental mechanism of eukaryotic replication and will therefore be of general interest to a large group of biologists. Publication in <italic>eLife</italic> is recommended after the manuscript is revised to address the following comments.</p><p>1) A key point of emphasis in the manuscript is that Pol α synthesizes about 10 nt. of DNA (i.e., a turn of duplex) before dissociation. This is a key point because that length of DNA suffices to release the RNA from the Pol binding site. The reviewers are confused by apparently contradictory statements about the length of the DNA segment synthesized in the literature. For example, reviews by Burgers (2009) [JBC 284:4041] and Arezi and Kuchta (2000) [TIBS 25: 572] both state that ∼20 nt of DNA are synthesized. If 20 nts of DNA are synthesized, the duplex bound by DNA polymerase α would be all DNA, and the structural features that are suggested to be important for termination would no longer be relevant. We recognize that both reviews simply state this “fact” without attribution, but a review by Balakrishnan and Bambara (2011) [JBC 286:6865] clearly states that experiments with the SV40 system shows synthesis of ∼20 nucleotides of DNA by the primase. What is the length of DNA synthesized by Pol α before dissociation? The authors should clear up this point of confusion by referring clearly to the literature concerning the length of DNA synthesized by Pol α as opposed to SV40. If this is a matter of uncertainty then the manuscript should be revised accordingly to reflect the uncertainty.</p><p>2) The authors indicate that the structure of the ternary complex depicts an actively copying polymerase. The protein was pre-incubated with RNA-DNA and dGTP. Could the observed incorporation have occurred prior to crystal formation? Why is the incoming dGTP observed in the ternary complex not incorporated? Are all atoms needed for catalysis observed and in the correct geometry? If not, and/or if the resolution is insufficient, then the claim is premature. It would be very useful, and standard in this field, to shown the geometry of the polymerase active site in detail, perhaps superimposing it with that of another polymerase (e.g., RB69 Pol), to show that the primer terminus and the 3´-O is the correct position with respect to the catalytic metals and incoming nucleotide.</p><p>3) The models presented in this paper are plausible, rather than completely convincing. The model in Figure 6 might be more convincing (or not) depending on the outcome of more precise mapping experiments using a natural DNA sequence, ideally the sequence used for the crystallography, rather than the artificial template used in Figure 4. It would be straightforward to quantify termination of processive synthesis at each nucleotide position as synthesis proceeds, and map this pattern against the structural features that are hypothesized to be important for switching. This experiment could be applied to derivatives containing amino acid substitutions for residues thought to be important for switching. Even one positive result of this type would lend confidence to the model that is the main take home message of the manuscript.</p><p>It would also be great to have genetic evidence that the proposed mechanism limits genome instability, which is stated in the last sentence of the Abstract more like a fact than a possibility worth investigating. In the absence of such experiments, the authors should adjust the language to reflect the fact that they are proposing plausible but not proven models.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00482.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) A key point of emphasis in the manuscript is that Pol alpha synthesizes about 10 nt. of DNA (i.e., a turn of duplex) before dissociation.

As the editor points out, the reviews by Burgers (2009) [JBC 284:4041] and Arezi and Kuchta (2000) [TIBS 25: 572] do not cite primary references. Furthermore, the review by Balakrishnan and Bambara (2011) [JBC 286:6865] mentioned by the editor, refers to the same review by Arezi and Kuchta (2000) [TIBS 25: 572] (penultimate sentence of page 6865), when discussing the length of DNA synthesized by Pol α. The current state of our knowledge concerning the length of DNA polymerised by Pol α and its role of in priming nucleic acid synthesis is authoritatively summarised by De Pamphilis and Bell in their recent book “Genomic Duplication” (2011), Garland Science. Quoting from Chapter 5, page 102: “Once DNA synthesis begins, Pol α processively extends the RNA primer by approximately 10 dNMPs, and then Pol α begins to dissociate from the primer:template as it begins to incorporate the next 10 dNMPs, thereby allowing RNA-p-DNA primers to become accessible to other DNA polymerases”. The book by De Pamphilis and Bell (2011), Garland Science, is referenced in the opening paragraph of the Introduction.</p><p>Existing biochemical evidence, obtained using similar primer/template substrates to ours, is in agreement with our observation of extension products that peak stochastically at approximately 10–12 deoxynucleotides; see for instance, Singh et al, (1986) [JBC 261:8564]; Brooks and Dumas (1989) [JBC 264:3602]; Kuchta et al (1990) [JBC 265:16158]. In particular, the experiments described in Figure 7 of Brooks and Dumas, (1989) [JBC 264: 3602] allow a direct estimate of the size of the DNA segment of primer polymerised by Pol α, with a distribution of sizes that closely matches what we observe in our extension assays. All of these papers are referenced in the relevant part of the Introduction.</p><p>In the same page of their book, DePamphilis and Bell make the prescient comment that:</p><p>“Transition from an A-form to a B-form duplex may also trigger the hand-off from Pol α either to Pol δ on the lagging strand template or to Pol ε on the leading strand template by stimulating release of Pol α from the primer:template”.</p><p>Our data provide a structural basis for the mechanism of RNA primer extension and release by Pol α envisaged by the authors.</p><p><italic>2) The authors indicate that the structure of the ternary complex depicts an actively copying polymerase. The protein was pre-incubated with RNA-DNA and dGTP. Could the observed incorporation have occurred prior to crystal formation? Why is the incoming dGTP observed in the ternary complex not incorporated? Are all atoms needed for catalysis observed and in the correct geometry? If not, and/or if the resolution is insufficient, then the claim is premature. It would be very useful, and standard in this field, to shown the geometry of the polymerase active site in detail, perhaps superimposing it with that of another polymerase (e.g., RB69 Pol), to show that the primer terminus and the 3´-O is the correct position with respect to the catalytic metals and incoming nucleotide</italic>.</p><p>We believe that polymerization by the D998N Pol α mutant happens during vapour-diffusion crystallization, in the time interval before nucleation of the crystal lattice. Incorporation of two deoxynucleotides, followed by translocation onto the next templating base (position 0 in Figure 2C) and binding of a third dGTP molecule is required in order to trigger formation of the crystal lattice, capturing Pol α in an actively copying conformation. Figure 1–figure supplements 6 and 7 show the non-crystallographic interaction between one polymerase molecule and the DNA/RNA duplex of the NCS-related complex, which is responsible for trapping Pol α in the crystal lattice and arresting further polymerisation.</p><p>In order to seek confirmation of our hypothesis, we devised a crystallisation experiment with an RNA primer/ DNA template substrate that contained an RNA 9mer, i.e., one base shorter of the primer used in the original crystallization experiment. We reasoned that, if addition of two dGTPs to the RNA 10mer in the crystallisation drop was necessary in order to obtain a RNA/DNA duplex of the required length (10 + 2 = 12 bp) to promote crystal growth, the same crystal form could be produced by extension of an RNA 9mer with three dGTPs (9 + 3 = 12 bp). Indeed, the crystallisation experiment with the shorter RNA primer was successful and we were able to solve the structure of the active complex, albeit at the lower resolution of 3.6 Å (Perera and Pellegrini, unpublished data). As predicted, the new crystal structure had the same unit cell, symmetry and non- crystallographic packing of the original structure.</p><p>The active site of Pol α is shown in Figure 1–figure supplement 4. We have now updated the figure as suggested by the reviewer, so that it shows the active site of Pol α superimposed on that of yeast Pol δ (PDB id: 3IAY), its closest structural homologue in the PDB. The superposition shows that the geometry of Pol α's active site is very closely related to that of Pol δ; therefore, we believe that nucleotide polymerization by Pol α proceeds via the same two-metal ion catalysis demonstrated previously for other DNA polymerases. Due to the limited resolution of our study, we did not include Mg2+ ions in our crystallographic model.</p><p><italic>3) The models presented in this paper are plausible, rather than completely convincing. The model in Figure 6 might be more convincing (or not) depending on the outcome of more precise mapping experiments using a natural DNA sequence, ideally the sequence used for the crystallography, rather than the artificial template used in Figure 4. It would be straightforward to quantify termination of processive synthesis at each nucleotide position as synthesis proceeds, and map this pattern against the structural features that are hypothesized to be important for switching.

In the absence of such experiments, the authors should adjust the language to reflect the fact that they are proposing plausible but not proven models</italic>.</p><p>We believe that the quantification of Pol α's extension products shown in Figure 4B effectively achieves the aim of the experiment proposed by the reviewers. We agree with the reviewers that in principle it might be informative to try to assess the relative contribution of single residues at the protein-nucleic acid interface to the specific interaction with the templated RNA primer. However, we believe that it would be hard or impossible to probe the specificity of the interaction by targeted mutagenesis without concurrently impairing the general affinity of the polymerase for its primer/template substrate. Furthermore, a genetic analysis such as the one proposed by the reviewer would be interesting, but we believe that it is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>We have reworded the concluding remarks of the Abstract and the Discussion, in order to reflect the comments of the reviewer concerning the plausibility of the proposed mechanism of primer termination and release by Pol α.</p></body></sub-article></article>
