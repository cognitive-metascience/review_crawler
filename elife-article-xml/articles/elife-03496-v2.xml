Recent studies suggest that levels of ROS generated as a byproduct of oxidative folding rival those produced by mitochondrial respiration. Mechanisms that protect cells against oxidant accumulation within the ER have begun to be elucidated yet many questions still remain regarding how cells prevent oxidant-induced damage from ER folding events. Here we report a new role for a central well-characterized player in ER homeostasis as a direct sensor of ER redox imbalance. Specifically we show that a conserved cysteine in the lumenal chaperone BiP is susceptible to oxidation by peroxide, and we demonstrate that oxidation of this conserved cysteine disrupts BiP's ATPase cycle. We propose that alteration of BiP activity upon oxidation helps cells cope with disruption to oxidative folding within the ER during oxidative stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03496.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03496.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03496.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum is the cellular compartment where approximately one third of the cell's proteins are made. Inside, chaperone molecules bind to newly made protein chains and help them to fold into the three-dimensional structure required for the protein to work correctly. A chaperone called Ero1 helps to facilitate this folding process by catalyzing a reaction that forms strong chemical bonds, which help stabilize the final protein structures. However, this help from Ero1 comes at a cost: forming a stabilizing bond this way also produces a peroxide molecule as a byproduct.</p><p>Peroxide is a ‘reactive oxygen species’: a chemical that can oxidize and damage proteins and DNA, which can potentially kill the cell. Three other enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum can convert peroxide into water, to protect the cells from reactive oxygen species build-up. However, not all cells that use Ero1 have these other enzymes, suggesting that other pathways must exist to manage reactive oxygen species.</p><p>Wang et al. took advantage of yeast cells containing a hyperactive mutant version of the Ero1 enzyme to look for alternative detoxifying mechanisms that occur when the cell is stressed by an excess of reactive oxygen species. In these cells, Wang et al. observed that the high levels of reactive oxygen species caused part of a chaperone molecule called BiP to oxidize. This modification of BiP acts like a switch that the reactive oxygen species flip on. When activated by the reactive oxygen species, BiP enhances its activity as a folding molecular chaperone, keeping proteins apart. This is thought to allow BiP to minimize the protein misfolding that may otherwise occur in the wake of the damage caused by the building levels of peroxide. Wang et al. created a mutant BiP chaperone that mimics the oxidized form, and found that it also protects cells from the damage inflicted by the excess of reactive oxygen species.</p><p>Wang et al. propose that the BiP chaperone may be an important sensor of reactive oxygen species that changes its activity when these harmful chemicals are present and helps to protect the cell from damage. The success in mimicking the protective effects of oxidized BiP with a mutant BiP suggest that in the future one may be able to design small molecule drugs that bind to BiP to produce the activity of the modified form.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03496.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03496.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>BiP</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>Ero1</kwd><kwd>oxidative folding</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM105858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sevier</surname><given-names>Carolyn S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cornell University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sevier</surname><given-names>Carolyn S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF GRF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pareja</surname><given-names>Kristeen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM46941</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaiser</surname><given-names>Chris A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Direct modification by endogenous peroxide of a conserved cysteine in the molecular chaperone BiP decouples its ATPase and peptide-binding activities, allowing for enhanced polypeptide holdase activity during oxidative stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A largely unrecognized yet significant source of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) is oxidative folding within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ero1 is a primary enzymatic catalyst of biosynthetic disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki and Inaba, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ramming and Appenzeller-Herzog, 2012</xref>). A byproduct of Ero1 activity is peroxide, a ROS. Studies with recombinant Ero1 demonstrate that for every disulfide bond generated by Ero1 a peroxide molecule is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tu and Weissman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gross et al., 2006</xref>). Extrapolating from these in vitro results, it is estimated that Ero1 activity in living cells could generate up to 25% of the cellular ROS produced during protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tu and Weissman, 2004</xref>). Fluorescent probes that measure ROS in living cells indicate that the amount of ROS in the ER lumen exceeds the quantity of ROS within the mitochondria, a substantial and well-characterized source of intracellular ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malinouski et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recently, several systems that function to consume ROS in the ER lumen have been uncovered in mammalian cells. A peroxiredoxin (PRDX4) and two glutathione peroxidases (GPx7/8) have been demonstrated to reduce peroxide to water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tavender and Bulleid, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>). These enzymes enhance the efficiency of oxidative protein folding by coupling peroxide reduction with oxidation of the disulfide-bond forming enzyme PDI, ultimately converting peroxide generated as a byproduct of disulfide bond formation into additional nascent chain disulfides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tavender et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>). We expect these identified detoxification pathways operate within the ER alongside additional and more general systems conserved across eukaryotes that remain to be elucidated. Lower eukaryotes maintain robust Ero1-dependent protein oxidation pathways that produce ROS, however these organisms do not contain homologs of either mammalian PDRX4 or GPx7/8.</p><p>To discover systems that respond to redox imbalance within the ER, we capitalized on our prior identification of a key homeostatic feedback system that modulates the activity of Ero1 in disulfide bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sevier et al., 2007</xref>). Regulation of Ero1 activity normally serves to maintain redox homeostasis in the ER lumen and helps to moderate the amount of ROS produced by Ero1. Disruption of the Ero1 feedback loop (de-regulation of Ero1) is detrimental to the ER redox environment, resulting in severe redox imbalance in the ER and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sevier et al., 2007</xref>). We took advantage of the ROS generated by overproduction of a de-regulated, constitutively active mutant of Ero1 (Ero1-C150A-C295A; hereafter referred to as Ero1*) to identify cellular systems activated in response to an overabundance of ER ROS.</p><p>Here we report that oxidative stress in the ER of yeast, created by Ero1* overproduction, results in direct modification by peroxide of a conserved cysteine in the ATP-binding site of the molecular chaperone BiP. We show that modification of BiP decouples the ATPase and peptide-binding activities of BiP, disrupting the normal allostery between these domains. We propose that oxidation of BiP during conditions of increased ER ROS both enhances the ability of BiP to bind polypeptides and prevents consumption of cellular ATP by hydrolysis. We suggest that this conserved ROS-sensing mechanism has evolved to protect against oxidative stress in the ER by minimizing protein aggregation and maintaining ER folding homeostasis during conditions of excess ROS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A cysteine-less BiP strain is more sensitive to oxidative stress</title><p>A search of ER-localized protein sequences for potentially redox-responsive amino acid(s) drew our attention to a cysteine residue highly conserved among BiP orthologs. This cysteine is localized within the ATP-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and is the sole cysteine in yeast BiP (Kar2 Cys63). To probe the role of this conserved cysteine, we replaced the cysteine in yeast BiP with alanine and found that the cysteine is not required for the essential cellular function of BiP. Specifically, we observed that a <italic>kar2-C63A</italic> allele can complement an otherwise inviable <italic>KAR2</italic> chromosomal deletion strain (<italic>kar2Δ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Replacement of the BiP cysteine with alanine did not perturb the UPR response; treatment with the reductant dithiothreitol (DTT), which disrupts disulfide bond formation and causes unfolded proteins to accumulate in the ER lumen, resulted in a comparable UPR induction in both wild-type and <italic>kar2-C63A</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03496.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BiP contains a conserved cysteine that is dispensable for yeast viability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon diagram of human BiP nucleotide binding domain in complex with calcium-ADP (PDB entry 3IUC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wisniewska et al., 2010</xref>).

Cells grown with or without Ero1* induction were lysed under acidic conditions to protonate free thiols, which decreases thiol reactivity and limits post-lysis oxidation. Lysates were subsequently brought to neutral pH in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), to block free thiols, followed by beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) treatment to reduce cysteines originally oxidized in the cell lysates. Cysteines originally oxidized in the cell, and subsequently reduced by BME, were then modified with maleimide-biotin. FLAG-tagged Kar2 was isolated from the lysates with anti-FLAG beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and biotinylated Kar2 was detected by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03496.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>BiP's cysteine is oxidized upon hyperoxidation of the ER by Ero1*.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic for the biotin-switch assay used in panels <bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>.

When lysates were not treated with BME prior to maleimide-biotin addition, a negligible biotin signal was detected for Kar2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 4), confirming that Kar2 biotinylation was not a consequence of residual Kar2 thiols available due to incomplete alkylation by NEM.</p><p>There are many known thiol-oxidation outcomes that are reversible by BME, including disulfide bonds, nitrosothiols, sulfenic acids, and glutathiolated cysteines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2013</xref>). As a primary role of Ero1 is to facilitate disulfide bond formation in the ER, we suspected that Kar2 might form a disulfide bond with itself or another protein upon Ero1* overproduction. However, we did not observe a mobility shift on a non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel for Kar2 isolated from cells expressing Ero1*, which would be expected if Kar2 was disulfide bonded to another protein (data not shown). Consequently, we focused on anticipated changes in small molecular oxidants in the ER that could modify Kar2. Specifically, as peroxide is a byproduct of Ero1* activity, we considered oxidation of the BiP cysteine thiol (−SH) to sulfenic acid (−SOH).</p><p>To determine if peroxide oxidizes the Kar2 cysteine, we replaced the reductant BME in the biotin-switch assay with sodium arsenite, a reductant selective for sulfenic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Torchinsky, 1991</xref>). Treatment with sodium arsenite resulted in Kar2 biotinylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lane 1), demonstrating that Kar2 undergoes direct modification by peroxide.

An increase in biotinylated Kar2 was observed in DAz-2-treated cells overexpressing Ero1* relative to cells grown in the absence of stressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), corroborating sulfenic acid formation at the site of the BiP cysteine during conditions of excess ER ROS. Oxidation of the Kar2 cysteine to sulfenic acid was detected also in cells exposed to exogenous peroxide. Addition of 5 mM cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) to cells for 30 min resulted in the recovery of biotinylated wild-type Kar2 from DAz-2 treated lysates, indicative of sulfenic acid formation on the Kar2 cysteine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, lane 3). Recovery of biotinylated-Kar2 was dependent on both the presence of the Kar2 cysteine and peroxide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Substitution of the conserved BiP cysteine with aspartic acid, phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan can protect against oxidative stress</title><p>Sensitivity of the <italic>kar2-C63A</italic> strain to Ero1* overexpression implies that BiP cysteine oxidation normally protects wild-type cells against oxidative cellular damage and a corresponding loss of viability during Ero1* overproduction. To provide more direct evidence for BiP oxidation in protection against oxidative ER stress, we created BiP alleles designed to mimic the modified form of BiP. Alleles were generated that contained a negatively charged or bulky amino acid in place of the BiP cysteine. We reasoned that the aromatic groups may recapitulate a structural perturbation caused by conversion of cysteine to sulfenic acid. (We will colloquially refer to these as bulky substitution alleles). Due to its charge, we anticipate aspartic acid may be a close mimetic of sulfenic acid, although it is likely an even better mimetic of sulfinic acid (−SO<sub>2</sub>H), which is formed when sulfenic acid is further oxidized by peroxide.</p><p>When expressed ectopically, each of these alleles protected cells against a loss of viability during conditions of increased ER ROS, effectively mimicking the phenotype anticipated for oxidation of the BiP cysteine.

We observed that under conditions of increased ER peroxide production (Ero1* overexpression), a conserved cysteine thiol in BiP is oxidized by peroxide and converted to sulfenic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Biochemical assays of oxidized and alkylated BiP, as well as assays of BiP cysteine-substitution alleles that mimic oxidized BiP, indicate that modification of the BiP cysteine alters BiP chaperone activity, such that ATPase activity is inhibited while avidity of binding to misfolded proteins is increased. Due to the striking conservation of the BiP cysteine among orthologs, we propose that BiP oxidation may be a conserved mechanism for promoting cell viability under conditions of excess ROS within the ER.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Modulation of chaperone activity during oxidative stress</title><p>We propose that BiP oxidation is part of a redox signaling circuit within the ER, wherein hyper-oxidizing conditions in the ER are offset through modulation of BiP activity. A primary outcome of oxidative stress is oxidative damage to proteins, including the mispairing of cysteine residues to form non-native disulfide bonds as well as the oxidation of cysteine thiols with small molecules, which prevents disulfide bond formation. These oxidized proteins are unlikely to be able to fold properly until ER conditions are returned to a less oxidized state. We suggest that activation of a redox switch in BiP upon ROS accumulation in the ER converts BiP from a chaperone driven by ATP hydrolysis to a high avidity polypeptide holdase. An enhanced capacity for oxidized BiP to bind polypeptides may serve to maintain proteins in a folding-competent state until the ER returns to a more reduced status. Upon restoration of a more reduced ER environment, reduction of BiP would reestablish BiP activity as an ATP-driven chaperone to facilitate protein folding through its binding and release of polypeptides. Inactivation of ATPase activity for a pool of BiP upon oxidation may additionally benefit cells by limiting ATP turnover during oxidative stress. In the absence of modification, BiP has the potential to consume ATP while carrying out futile chaperone cycles of binding and release from polypeptides locked into non-native states by covalent bonds; inactivation of BiP ATPase activity would limit hydrolysis of cellular ATP as a byproduct of futile folding cycles. Finally, inhibition of the translocation activity of BiP under hyper-oxidizing conditions could decrease the flux of nascent polypeptides into the ER further decreasing the burden on the ER folding machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We are unable to definitively link translocation attenuation with BiP modification due to the lack of a measurable translocation defect in wild-type cells under ER oxidative stress. Yet these data do not preclude a more modest decrease in polypeptide flux during oxidative stress; note we do not anticipate all BiP becomes modified during oxidative stress, which is consistent with the lack of a complete translocation block during stress.</p><p>Data from our BiP cysteine-mutant alleles suggest that a single population of all reduced or all oxidized BiP is insufficient to maintain cell viability throughout a range of redox conditions. Alleles of BiP that mimic the phenotypic outcomes of BiP oxidation (Kar2-C63D/F/Y/W) are unable to function effectively as the only copy of BiP in cells during standard growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Conversely, a mimetic of reduced BiP (Kar2-C63A) is unable to support robust growth of cells as the only form of cellular BiP during oxidative ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We anticipate the robust growth we observed in the presence of both Kar2-C63A plus Kar2-C63F/Y/W is due to the genetic recapitulation of the normally reduced and oxidized pools of ER BiP.</p><p>Intriguingly, multiple means may exist to post-translationally control BiP activity to benefit cells under oxidative stress.

Wei et al. reported that GPx7 acts as a direct sensor of cellular ROS, and they propose that oxidized GPx7 catalyzes the formation of an intramolecular BiP Cys41-Cys420 disulfide. Similar to what we observed upon BiP oxidation, Wei et al. show that formation of an intramolecular BiP disulfide enhances the ability of BiP to bind denatured luciferase in vitro. Notably, GPx7 and the disulfide-bonded cysteines in BiP are found only in mammals and not in other eukaryotes (yeast BiP has one cysteine), suggesting the GPx7-BiP signaling pathway is likely unique to mammalian cells. Yet it is significant that in their study Wei et al. observed in vitro treatment of recombinant mammalian BiP with peroxide facilitated not only the Cys41-Cys420 disulfide but also a sulfonic acid (−SO<sub>3</sub>H) at Cys41, which corresponds to Kar2 Cys63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). These data demonstrate that mammalian BiP Cys41 is prone to direct oxidation by peroxide like yeast BiP, solidifying the capacity for BiP to serve also as a direct sensor of ROS in mammalian cells.</p><p>Emerging data suggest that decoupling of ATPase and chaperone functions through cysteine oxidation could be a property shared by several Hsp70s. For example, in vitro alkylation of the three cysteines in the cytosolic yeast Hsp70 Ssa1 triggers a loss of ATPase activity and augments the capacity of Ssa1 to prevent aggregation of denatured luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hermawan and Chirico, 1999</xref>). Cys15 in Ssa1 is equivalent to the conserved BiP cysteine, and changes in chaperone activity for alkylated Ssa1 could occur through a mechanism similar to what we describe for BiP. Alternatively, the mechanism may be distinct from what we describe for BiP and make use of the other two Ssa1 cysteine residues; indeed, precedent exists for a redox-sensing role for Ssa1 Cys264 and Cys303 (but not Cys15) in the derepression of Hsf1 in response to a variety of thiol-reactive compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Irreversible inhibition of the Hsp70 ATPase activity of mammalian Hsp70 (HSPA1A) has been shown to occur upon oxidation of the same two cysteines with methylene blue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miyata et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, a separate study reported that the in vitro acquisition of peptides by cytosolic Hsp70 is enhanced in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, raising the possibility that ATPase and chaperone activities of Hsp70 may also be decoupled by oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callahan et al., 2002</xref>). To the best of our knowledge our study shows the first example of an Hsp70 modified by endogenous ROS; given the reported susceptibility of numerous Hsp70s to oxidation by exogenous oxidants it will be exciting to determine if and what endogenous oxidants are sensed by the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Hsp70s.</p><p>Notably, redox modification of Hsp70 cysteines is not restricted to eukaryotes but also has been shown in bacteria. Oxidation of Cys15 in the bacterial Hsp70 DnaK (equivalent to Kar2 Cy63) has been demonstrated to occur when bacteria are exposed to exogenous oxidants at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Winter et al., 2005</xref>). Markedly distinct from what we observe for BiP, oxidant exposure inhibits DnaK's ability to prevent luciferase aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Winter et al., 2005</xref>). Although modification of the DnaK cysteine is detected in cells exposed to oxidant, a DnaK-C15A mutant shows the same oxidant-induced loss of activity as wild-type DnaK, suggesting that cysteine oxidation may contribute to but does not account for the inactivation of DnaK chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Winter et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, the inactivation of DnaK during oxidative stress occurs concurrently with oxidant-induced activation of holdase activity for the general chaperone Hsp33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Winter et al., 2005</xref>). Thus oxidative stress appears to evoke similar functional outcomes in both bacteria and eukaryotes (loss of Hsp70 ATP-dependent chaperone activity and enhanced holdase capacity), but in eukaryotes this can be achieved through a switch in BiP activity alone whereas in bacteria this outcome is a product of altered activities for a coupled DnaK-Hsp33 system.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Physical alterations in BiP upon oxidation</title><p>The position of the BiP cysteine within the ATP binding pocket (less than 10 Å from the nucleotide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wisniewska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yan et al., 2011</xref>) suggests that oxidation of the cysteine thiol may prevent the correct positioning of the nucleotide within the ATP-binding pocket. Sulfenic acid at the site of the cysteine is unlikely itself to physically block ATP entry into the cleft; it seems more likely that cysteine oxidation will perturb the surrounding residues, which in turn may alter residues necessary for ATP positioning or hydrolysis, leading to decreased ATPase activity. It is well established that the nucleotide and peptide binding domains of BiP are allosterically coupled; nucleotide binding and hydrolysis modulates both the structure of the peptide binding domain and its affinity for polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zuiderweg et al., 2013</xref>). We propose that structural changes within the nucleotide-binding pocket upon cysteine oxidation are similarly propagated to the peptide-binding domain to alter peptide affinity, allowing for enhanced peptide binding by BiP without ATP hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>BiP oxidation adduct(s)</title><p>Sulfenic acids are generally considered reactive species prone to further oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jacob et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reddie and Carroll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roos and Messens, 2011</xref>), which raises the possibility that direct modification of BiP with peroxide primes BiP for further oxidative modification(s). Our data indicate that addition of sulfenic acid accounts for at least some portion of the oxidized BiP cysteine that occurs upon oxidative stress. However, our data do not rule out the possibility of additional BiP cysteine modifications. Indeed, the sensitivity of the <italic>kar2-C63A</italic> strain to the thiol-oxidant diamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), thought to primarily impact the redox balance of cells through oxidation of the cellular anti-oxidant glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kosower et al., 1969</xref>), likely indicates the potential for a non-peroxide adduct on the BiP cysteine. Our experiments detect only a small fraction of BiP isolated from cells in an oxidized state; we estimate recovery of less than 1% of the total isolated BiP in a modified form. Low yields of oxidized cellular BiP species have limited our ability to use mass spectrometry for conclusive identification of any additional modifications. It is worth noting that the limited recovery of oxidized BiP from cells likely reflects the difficulty in preserving oxidized thiols, which are prone to reduction during lysate preparation. We speculate that a pool of modified BiP, greater than the recovered 1%, exists in cells during oxidative stress; indeed, it is difficult to envision that a 1% pool of oxidized BiP in wild-type cells during oxidative stress could account for the striking growth difference between the wild-type and <italic>kar2-C63A</italic> strains during oxidative ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>If BiP undergoes oxidation by more than one type of molecule, it is possible that distinct biochemical activities for BiP may be observed dependent on the specific redox modification. Sulfenic acid is known to prime proteins for modification by glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gallogly and Mieyal, 2007</xref>), and the abundance of reduced glutathione in the ER could allow for formation of a reversible BiP protein-glutathione adduct. Consistent with the proposed susceptibility of BiP to glutathione modification, a proteomics approach previously identified mammalian BiP (and 22 additional proteins) as a substrate for glutathiolation during diamide-induced oxidative stress in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lind et al., 2002</xref>). The efficacy of the BiP-C63F/Y/W alleles may reflect the ability of these larger amino acid side chains to mimic BiP glutathiolation and protection. Sulfenic acid can also be further oxidized by peroxide to form sulfinic (−SO<sub>2</sub>H) and sulfonic (−SO<sub>3</sub>H) acid species, which are generally considered irreversible modifications. Modification of BiP by excess peroxide could denote irreparable cellular damage, initiating a pathway for self-destruction (e.g., like apoptotic death induced by unresolved signaling through the unfolded protein response) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Conversely, glutathiolation of BiP could be an important means to protect BiP from irreversible oxidation with excess peroxide, mediating a reversible signaling system for stress protection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>We uncovered BiP oxidation upon genetic manipulation of cells to create hyper-oxidizing ER conditions; the ability to alter the redox environment of the ER was key to reveal BiP oxidation and has been similarly vital for identification of other homeostatic pathways in the ER such as the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kozutsumi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gething and Sambrook, 1992</xref>). Although the UPR was originally designated as a stress response system based on its importance during acute stress, it is now appreciated that the UPR plays crucial roles in maintaining ER plasticity and function under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moore and Hollien, 2012</xref>). Similarly, we propose that BiP oxidation likely influences cell growth and development in the absence of extreme redox imbalance. Notably, modified BiP was detectable even in the absence of Ero1* overproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), consistent with a role for BiP oxidation not only during stress but also during non-stressed growth conditions. Increased ROS content within the ER as a consequence of enhanced secretory capacity could increase the pool of oxidized BiP to help maintain secretory protein dynamics. Assays similar to those described herein should enable future studies of yeast and mammalian BiP oxidation under non-stress conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see all three reviewers appreciated the importance of your paper.</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that the following three points need to be addressed:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> reveals a translocation defect at elevated temperature in cells in which the endogenous KAR2 has been deleted and its function substituted for by plasmids encoding mutant BiPs with modified-cysteine-mimetic-mutations (C63D, C63F and C63Y) but not the neutral (C63A) mutation. The authors have presented this as evidence that modification of wildtype BiP on C63 begets a translocation defect (they mimic the modification with the mutation). From this perspective it is expected that the experiment be conducted under conditions in which the counterparts to the modified BiP (that is unmodified WT and C63A mutant BiP) would have no translocation defect and this is how we understand the experiment to have been designed and executed.</p><p>Further experimental evidence for the imposition of a translocation defect by the modified BiP would greatly strengthen the manuscript and if you are able to muster such evidence please do so. For example, a comparison between the level of translocation defect in cells with WT BIP versus BiP C63A after they have been subjected to a conditions that trigger the modification on WT BiP (e.g. ERO1* overexpression, diamide). The predicted outcome of this experiment is a less pronounced translocation defect in the BiP C63A cells that cannot actuate a translocation block.</p><p>However, we recognize that this goal may not be attainable (for example, if the oxidizing conditions are not associated with a measureable translocation defect in the WT cells in the first place).

This can be addressed as a discussion point.</p><p>The reviewer elaborate on these points as below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic></p><p>This well written paper reports on a detailed study of the responsiveness of yeast BiP to peroxides.</p><p>It begins with the demonstration that yeast BiP's single cysteine C63 undergoes a chemically reversible (by DTT) modification in the ER exposed to hyperoxidizing conditions. The importance of this modification is highlighted by the observations that whereas the Kar2_C63A mutation fully covers the kar2 deficiency under normal conditions, the mutant is impaired in growth under the very conditions associated with enhanced rates of oxidative modification of C63. The benefits of modified C63 under these hyperoxidizing conditions can be mimicked by providing in trans alleles of Kar2 with bulky substitutions at residue 63.</p><p>These rescuing alleles and the oxidized BiP share important biochemical features <italic>in vitro</italic> in that they are defective in ATP hydrolysis, are unable to cover the kar2Δ but retain constitutive substrate binding activity and serve as better holdases (i.e. hold unfolded proteins better) than the wildtype yeast BiP. The expression of these altered BiP forms results in a conspicuous translocation defect, which, the authors speculate may underlie part of their protective effect against hyperoxidizing conditions (by defending the organelle against excess unfolded protein load).</p><p>Beyond the wealth of details relating to a particular circumstance in the stressed ER, this study calls attention to the layers of regulation affecting chaperone function in the ER and highlights the fact that the protein folding machinery in the secretory pathway is responsive to modulation by important post-translational mechanisms. Therefore, while the basis for the benefit of C63 modification in the hyperoxidised ER remains a subject for (intelligent) speculation, the paper makes an important addition to our understanding of the ER as a protein folding compartment.</p><p>Specific issues:</p><p>It would be nice to round off the characterization of the oxidized BiP with an analysis of its response to ATP: If indeed the mutation uncouples BiP's two domains, one would expect that the addition of ATP would not lead to substrate release.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic></p><p>Oxidative protein folding in the ER is potentially a very significant source of damaging cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although enzymes have been identified in higher eukaryotes to aid in their neutralization, they do not appear to exist in lower eukarotes including yeast. In this study a novel mechanism for sensing and responding to hyper-oxidation of the ER is described, which involves oxidation of the single cysteine in Kar2 found in the nucleotide binding domain. Although direct detection of this modification was not possible, convincing data are obtained through employing a thiol-switch assay and a variety of Kar2 mutants. Oxidation of this cysteine dramatically reduces Kar2p ATPase activity as do several “bulky residue” substitutions at this site, which are argued to mimic cysteine modifications. Due to their defective ATPase activity, these mutants cannot substitute for loss of Kar2p but they complement yeast bearing a C63A mutant, which cannot be modified in response to hyper-oxidation of the ER by ERO1*, as well as wild-type Kar2. Similar to other Kar2 ATPase mutants reported previously, these mutants are defective in translocation of protein into the ER at non-permissive temperature, and additional data reveal they are even better at preventing the aggregation of denatured rhodanese that wild-type Kar2, which leads them to conclude that oxidation of Kar2 under hyper-oxidizing conditions results in Kar2 acting as a holdase to prevent aggregation of existing proteins and to inhibit new proteins from entering the ER thus serving a double beneficial role. The ability to modify Kar2 activity, as opposed to simply changing levels in response to a stress is a very intriguing finding and given the fact that the same cysteine in mammalian was recently shown to be reactive allows one to speculate that this mechanism may be conserved for other ER Hsp70s.</p><p>Specific points.</p><p>1) It is somewhat surprising that the translocation assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> was done using an elevated temperature, conditions under which wild-type Kar2 is not modified as opposed to using the hyper-oxidizing conditions where this model argues wild-type Kar2 would now be defective in translocation.</p><p>2) Studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> included a Kar2 ATPase mutant in an attempt to tie the enhanced suppression of rhodanese aggregation to an increased holdase activity in the cysteine substitution mutants. I am convinced this idea is likely to be correct, but the choice of the Kar2 ATPase mutant used might have prevented a clean link to this point. The T249G mutant that was used cannot hydrolyze ATP, which is included in the assay and thus doesn't lock onto the substrate, and the wild-type Kar2 would likely be continuously released. A better choice might be either the G246D or G247D mutants that do not bind nucleotide and thus remain in the substrate-locked position. Both of these have been reported to prevent translocation in yeast. Another choice would be a mutant corresponding to mammalian T37G, which does not undergo the requisite conformation change upon nucleotide binding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3</italic></p><p>Wang et al. investigate the role of a conserved cysteine residue (Cys63) in Bip/Kar2 that is hypothesized to serve as sensor for redox status in the lumen of the ER. When the ER environment was hyperoxidizing, the Cys63 residue in Kar2 was oxidized to sulfenic acid and cells harboring a Kar2 C63A mutation to block this modification were viable but more sensitive to oxidative stress. These results suggested that the sulfenic acid modification could play a protective role against oxidative stress and when bulky amino acids were substituted for this cysteine to mimic the modification, cells became more tolerate to oxidative stress when expressed in a Kar2 C63A background. Interestingly the bulky cysteine substitution alleles decrease Kar2 ATPase activity and produced thermosensitive translocation blocks <italic>in vivo</italic> when expressed as the sole source of Kar2. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments with purified proteins showed that rhodanese aggregation rates were markedly reduced by mutant versions of Kar2 containing bulky Cys63 substitutions compared to wild type Kar2 or an ATPase dead version. Moreover double mutants that contained bulky Cys63 substitutions and a mutation in the peptide-binding domain of Kar2 no longer protected cells to oxidative stress. Based on these findings the authors propose that Kar2 helps manage oxidative stress through redox conversion of Cys63 to a sulfenic acid modified form of Kar2 that binds folding intermediates to prevent protein aggregation but hydrolyzes ATP at reduced rates to slow polypeptide translocation, protein folding and ATP consumption until a favorable redox state returns.</p><p>Overall this is a strong study that has broad implications for understanding how cells can manage reactive oxygen species in the lumen of the early secretory pathway. While the experimental results are consistent with their proposal, there may be alternative explanations for some results and additional concerns are listed below.</p><p>1) An alternative explanation for the results could be that conversion of Cys63 in Kar2 to bulky constituents simply induces a UPR that helps manage oxidative stress. This could be due to an increase in unfolded proteins in the ER or less binding of the mutant Kar2 to Ire1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> shows that the C63D, C63F and C63Y versions activate the UPR when expressed as the sole copy, and produce a robust response when shifted to 37C. Do cells that express both Kar2 C63A and Kar2 C63F exhibit a higher level of UPR compared to the single Kar2 C63A? If so, this could suppress the increased ER oxidation levels caused by ERO1* observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>2) A prediction from the model is that GAL1 induced over-expression of ERO1* in the Kar2 C63A mutant would cause an accumulation of unfolded secretory proteins in the ER and/or translocation defects compared to the wild type Kar2 background. Have these phenotypes been examined in the CSY170 and CSY278 strains?</p><p>3) Please clarify the percentage of Kar2 that is oxidized at the Cys63 residue when ERO1* is over-expressed. From the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, there is a 1.8 fold increase in the level of BME-reducible modification on Kar2 under the hyper-oxidizing conditions. However in the Discussion it is mentioned that less than 1% of total isolated BiP is in an oxidized state. Does this mean that less than 2% of Kar2 is oxidized when ERO1* is over-expressed? Could this level of modification have a major impact on translocation and folding rates?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03496.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref> <italic>reveals a translocation defect at elevated temperature in cells in which the endogenous KAR2 has been deleted and its function substituted for by plasmids encoding mutant BiPs with modified-cysteine-mimetic-mutations (C63D, C63F and C63Y) but not the neutral (C63A) mutation.

In brief, we show that (modest) UPR induction does occur upon expression of the Kar2-C63D/F/Y/W alleles in a kar2-C63A mutant background. We also show that, although UPR induction occurs and may contribute to protection during oxidative stress, UPR induction is not sufficient for protection during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Our data show a Kar2-T249G mutant, which cannot protect cells during stress, exhibits the same (modest) UPR induction as the protective Kar2-C63D/F/Y/W mutants. These data are discussed in the Results section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
