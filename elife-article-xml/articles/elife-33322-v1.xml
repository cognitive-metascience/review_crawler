To understand the time-dependent scaling dynamics we treated cultured rat hippocampal cells with either TTX or bicucculline for 2 hr to induce the process of up- or down-scaling, respectively. During the activity manipulation we metabolically labeled newly synthesized proteins using BONCAT. We identified 168 newly synthesized proteins that exhibited significant changes in expression. To obtain a temporal trajectory of the response, we compared the proteins synthesized within 2 hr or 24 hr of the activity manipulation. Surprisingly, there was little overlap in the significantly regulated newly synthesized proteins identified in the early- and integrated late response datasets. There was, however, overlap in the functional categories that are modulated early and late. These data indicate that within protein function groups, different proteomic choices can be made to effect early and late homeostatic responses that detect the duration and polarity of the activity manipulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33322.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain can store information by changing the strength of connections between neurons, also known as synapses. When two neurons at a synapse are active at the same time, the synapse becomes stronger. This enables the first neuron to activate the second more easily. But it also means that the two neurons will now be active at the same time more often, which will tend to make the synapse even stronger. If this process continues unchecked, the synapse will keep getting stronger until no further changes in strength are possible. This will make it harder for the brain to form new memories.</p><p>To prevent this from happening, the brain responds to prolonged changes in the activity of neurons by adjusting the strength of synapses in the opposite direction. If neurons are too active for an extended period of time, the brain reduces the strength of synapses. If neurons show too little activity, the brain increases the strength of synapses. This process is known as homeostatic scaling, and the brain achieves it by adjusting the number and/or type of proteins present at synapses.</p><p>Schanzenbächer et al. now reveal the changes in synaptic proteins that occur in response to a two-hour increase or decrease in neuronal activity. These changes can be tracked in the laboratory by growing cells in a petri dish in the presence of modified amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Any new proteins the cells produce will contain the modified amino acids, making them easy to spot. Schanzenbächer et al. applied this technique to neurons obtained from the rat hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in learning and memory. Bathing the neurons for two hours in chemicals that either enhanced or reduced their activity, triggered changes in more than 150 proteins.</p><p>Schanzenbächer et al. compared these results to those of a previous experiment in which neuronal activity had been manipulated for 24 hours. Each set of conditions produced a characteristic profile of protein activity. The profiles indicated whether the activity in neurons had increased or decreased, and whether the changes had lasted for two hours or 24 hours. These findings may provide insights into disease states in which there is too much or too little brain activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>synaptic scaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolic labelling and quantitative proteomics reveal the temporal evolution of cellular and neuronal responses to global activity manipulations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title id="head_1">Introduction</title><p>In biological systems, many variables like pH, ion concentration and temperature are under homeostatic control. In the brain, changes in synaptic efficacy underlie at least some forms of information storage, potentially leading to runaway dynamics of synaptic weights and activity. Brain synapses also exhibit homeostasis. Synaptic scaling, a form of homeostatic plasticity, allows neurons to adjust globally the strengths of their synapses up or down to stabilize specific neuronal functions in response to an offset from a setpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis and Goodman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burrone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>). Synaptic scaling has been observed and studied at central nervous system synapses in the hippocampus and cortex as well as the neuromuscular junction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis, 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Turrigiano, 2008</xref> for review).</p><p>The cascade of mechanisms that underlie the homeostatic response are not well understood. Mechanistically speaking, there must exist molecules and signaling events that detect the offset from the activity set-point and implement cellular responses to maintain homeostasis. Several studies have suggested that activity-dependent changes in intracellular Ca2+ may serve as an early sensor for the offset from an activity threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thiagarajan et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2005</xref>). In homeostatic scaling at central mammalian synapses, there is emerging consensus that one end-point effector mediating both the enhanced and reduced response following a prolonged activity manipulation is the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cingolani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">O'Brien et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wierenga et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thiagarajan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sutton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gainey et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2015</xref>).</p><p>At the systems level, homeostatic scaling requires both transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibata et al., 2008</xref>) and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>).

For example, chronic activity suppression activated a calcium-dependent transcription program of 73 genes that includes AMPA receptors and transcription factors (SRF, ELK) and led to synaptic upscaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schaukowitch et al., 2017</xref>). After 24 hr of either enhanced or reduced activity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref> detected 307 differentially expressed proteins involved in neuronal functions such as calcium transport, synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release.</p><p>The earliest reports of homeostatic scaling at mammalian central synapses suggested that relatively long duration activity manipulations were required to elicit the homeostatic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">O'Brien et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>). However, local manipulations of activity can bring about more rapid scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sutton et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2006</xref>) and recent studies have also suggested that global scaling can occur within a few hours of an activity manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibata et al., 2008</xref>). Under physiological conditions that elicit synaptic scaling, it is likely that different durations of activity manipulation give rise to different responses that may differ both in the magnitude and nature of regulated proteins. However, the mechanisms that enable neurons to sense the duration and polarity of a stimulus remain poorly understood to date.</p><p>In order to understand the time-dependent dynamics of the response to an activity manipulation we treated cultured hippocampal cells with either TTX or bicuculline for 2 hr to induce the process of up- or down-scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>), respectively. During the 2 hr activity manipulation we metabolically labeled newly synthesized proteins using BONCAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dieterich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>). We analyzed the newly synthesized proteins and then to obtain a temporal trajectory of the cellular response, we compared the proteins synthesized within 2 hr of activity manipulation to those synthesized during a 24 hr manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>). Surprisingly, there was little overlap in the significantly regulated newly synthesized proteins identified in the early- and integrated late response datasets. Many significantly regulated at 24 hr, however, exhibited trends for intermediate levels of regulation at 2 hr. There was however, overlap in the functional categories that are modulated at the two time points, suggesting that within protein function groups, different choices are made to effect early and late homeostatic responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title id="head_2">Results</title><p>In order to determine the early cellular response to neural activity manipulations, we treated cultured hippocampal cells with either TTX or bicuculline for 2 hr to induce the process of up- or down-scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>) respectively, and during this time metabolically labeled newly synthesized proteins using azidohomoalanine (AHA) and BONCAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dieterich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>). We compared the newly synthesized proteome in the TTX- and bicuculline-treated samples to each other and to an untreated control group, analyzing five biological replicates. Proteins were identified and quantified using MaxQuant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>), with the following criteria: (i) at least one peptide per protein identified (ii) protein detected in at least 1/5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) or 2/5 (all subsequent Figures) experiments and (iii) protein not detected in the Met control group (see Materials and methods). The methionine content of our AHA-labeled proteins was not different compared to a global proteome (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, UniProtKB database) as, on average, 2.42 and 2.40 Met residues are present per 100 amino acids, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, we identified over 3000 proteins in each treatment group and over 5000 unique proteins altogether (summing proteins across groups, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The majority of proteins were identified in at least 3/5 replicates and the relative representation of proteins in different functional groups as well as the abundance of proteins was not different between conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). The protein intensities associated with replicates within each treatment group were well-correlated with one another as were the protein intensities for each 2 hr treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>).

We analyzed these unique proteins and found that the majority of them were detected in a single replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

We focused our analysis on these changes in the level of protein expression, using label-free quantification (LFQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 2014</xref>) to analyze the intensities of identified peptides in different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Altogether, we detected 168 proteins whose expression level was significantly regulated by either enhanced or reduced activity or by both manipulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, proteins significant up- or down-regulated by both enhanced and reduced activity are shown in the upper-right and lower-left quadrant, respectively. Note that the regulation of proteins in these two quadrants does not give information about the direction of the activity manipulation (e.g. up or down, the ‘polarity’) but rather could signal the absolute value of the deviation from an activity set-point. Other proteins exhibited significant increases in expression levels that were specific to either enhanced (upper-left quadrant) or reduced (lower-right quadrant) activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In principle, these classes of regulated proteins could detect or represent both the offset from the setpoint and the sign of the offset. We compared the regulated proteins to a curated list of 35 proteins previously implicated in homeostatic scaling by other groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>). We found six proteins regulated in our dataset that have been previously implicated in scaling, including two Ca2+ channel subunits (Cacnb3 and Cacna2d3), two protein phosphatases (Ppp1r7 and Ppp6r3), and two G-protein family members (Rheb and Rgs2).</p><p>Which functional protein classes exhibit significant differential regulation following 2 hr of enhanced or reduced activity? We conducted a gene annotation (GO) analysis of the 168 significantly regulated proteins and found that most (152/168) regulated proteins had a neuronal function and many were associated with synaptic functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), indicating that the majority of the significantly regulated proteins are not simply associated common cellular or metabolic functions. Using the newly synthesized proteins in untreated samples as a background, we examined which particular functional groups were regulated by the activity manipulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Amongst the top 20 terms that showed significant enrichment were many terms associated with the secretory pathway, including Golgi apparatus, ER to Golgi transport vesicle, and Golgi membrane. Within the synapse, we noted the regulation of many proteins including Neuroligin 2 (Nlgn2), Neurexin 2 (Nrxn2) Agrin (Agrn) and Slc32a1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33322.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Enriched function groups for proteins that exhibited significant regulation after 2 hr of enhanced or reduced activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gene Ontology enrichment categories for all 168 regulated proteins.

To address this, we compared the significantly regulated nascent proteins following 2 hr of activity manipulation (either bicuculline or TTX) to those regulated during a 24 hr manipulation (initially described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>). In the absence of activity manipulation, the newly synthesized proteomes identified at these two time points were largely (~94%) overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). There were 292 (2 hrs) and 1287 (24 hrs) proteins that were uniquely identified at one time point, but not the other. Using peptide intensities, we analyzed the relative abundance of these unique proteins compared to the total pool and found that they were less abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that the inability to detect them in one group might be due to insufficient sensitivity.

We noted with interest that the fraction of proteins that were uniquely regulated by either TTX or bicuculline was enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that as the duration of the treatment increases, the distinctiveness of the proteomic response, presumably more focused on the homeostatic effector mechanism, evolves.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33322.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A comparison of proteome remodeling in neurons after 2 hr and 24 hr of synaptic scaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagram showing the overlap of proteins expressed in untreated neurons for 2 hr and 24 hr.

We examined the significantly regulated proteins for each time point and then examined the same protein at the other (not significantly) regulated time point. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, the mauve dots represent the proteins regulated at 2 hr, with proteins up- and down-regulated following both enhanced (bicuculline-treated) or reduced (TTX-treated) activity shown in the upper-right and lower-left quadrants, respectively. The black dots in this plot show the regulation of these same proteins at 24 hr. The clustering of the black dots near the origin indicates that the newly synthesized proteins significantly regulated at 2 hr are largely unregulated at 24 hr. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, the grey dots represent the proteins regulated at 24 hr and the black dots represent these same proteins at 2 hr. Again, the cluster of black dots around the origin thus indicates the absence of significant regulation of these proteins at the 2 hr time point. Although there was little evidence that the same individual proteins were regulated at both 2 and 24 hr following either activity manipulation, we considered the possibility that a functional protein group might be regulated at both time points, with the individual regulated proteins within that group being different at 2 vs 24 hr. Indeed, we found several examples where there was significant regulation of a functional protein group at both time points, although the individual proteins within the group were different at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). For example, the group ‘voltage-gated calcium channels’ was significantly regulated at both 2 and 24 hr, but the individual subunits were different at the time points (e.g. Cacnb3 and Cacna2d3 at 2 hr and Cacnb4 at 24 hr). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, the protein groups that fall on the diagonal line are regulated in the same direction at both the 2 and 24 hr time points, including again, synaptic transmission, dendritic spine, synapse, postsynaptic density, axon and others. Only a few groups, including threonine kinase and Parkinson’s disease 20S proteasome were exclusively regulated at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). These data indicate that most of protein groups are hot-spots for regulation at both time points, even if the individual regulated proteins within the groups are different.</p><p>We next conducted a meta-analysis of all significantly regulated proteins considering, in addition to newly synthesized proteins that are different from untreated samples, proteins that are significantly different between the two time-points and/or the up- and down-scaling conditions. This master set of comparisons resulted in 711 significantly regulated proteins, which were significantly enriched for neuronal, rather than glial markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). We examined the regulation of each protein at 2 hr and 24 hr for both bicuculline- and TTX-treated samples to discover patterns of co-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). We used self-organizing maps (SOM) to sort and organize the various patterns of regulation of individual proteins into similar groups, calculated the average fold-change for each cluster, and then used hierarchical clustering to examine the relationships between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In order to extract repeated patterns of regulation, we plotted the individual regulated proteins as a deviation from untreated, including the response at both time points and in both conditions on a single axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). We first evaluated the optimal number of clusters to use, optimizing a minimization of within-cluster variance and a maximization of between-cluster variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Based on these considerations we chose a cluster size of 48 with each cluster containing between 4–53 proteins, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). The SOMs revealed several distinct patterns of regulation that, in principle, can serve as indicators of either the duration (early-2hrs or late-24hrs) or the polarity (enhanced or reduced) of the activity manipulation. We also analyzed whether particular regulatory patterns were enriched for particular functional classes of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). We found that most (11/12) of the regulatory patterns identified by the SOM algorithm were indicators of the time/duration of the manipulation. For example, proteins that were significantly regulated at 2 hr, but not at 24 hr for both up- and down-scaling fall into this category and their regulation pattern is represented by the ‘M’ or the ‘W’ profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>. There were also many examples of ‘sine wave’ shape regulated proteins in which the early (2 hr) and the late (24 hr) time point were regulated in an opposite manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). We also observed profiles in which there was regulation of proteins exclusively at the 24 hr time point in one or both conditions (‘upward or downward trapezoid shapes’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F,K</xref>). The trapezoid patterns were significantly enriched for a variety of channels and transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, some patterns of regulation that occurred indicate the polarity (sign) of the activity manipulation. Polarity indicators are clusters where regulation of proteins occurs only in response to one (TTX <italic>or</italic> bicuc) of the activity manipulations or where regulation occurs to both activity manipulations but is of an opposite sign (e.g. protein up regulated following TTX but down-regulated following bicuculline and vice versa). We found that many (7/12) of the regulatory patterns identified by the self-organizing map were indicators of the polarity of the manipulation. Examples of polarity-sensitive patterns include the ‘sun-seeking worm’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>; enriched for kinases, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the ‘sine wave’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>) or the ‘skewed W’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), ‘skewed M’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>) or ‘flattened trapezoid’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>) profiles. We noted with interest that some simple protein regulation patterns were also apparently absent from our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L,M</xref>). For example, the sign and magnitude of a single protein’s regulation could convey information about both the time and the direction of the activity manipulation, as shown in the ‘diagonal line’ pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>. This pattern was not, however, observed, although some sub-features of this pattern can be found in some of the other clusters. Alternatively, time- information, but not polarity information, could be conveyed by the ‘V’ or ‘inverted V’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>); this pattern was also not observed in our data. Taken together, these data indicate that there are patterns of individual protein regulation that can convey information about either the duration of the activity offset (time) or the polarity (up-scaling or down-scaling) of the offset.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33322.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Time-dependent protein regulation in synaptic scaling: patterns of time- and polarity-dependent regulation.</title><p>Heat-map showing the clustered patterns of time- and polarity-dependent regulation, for each type of treatment (TTX or bicucculine) and for both (2 and 24 hr) timepoints.

This analysis revealed several protein networks, again comprising functions associated with the cytoskeleton and vesicle-mediated transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>), neuronal systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>), cell-cell communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,D</xref>), the processing and transport of mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,E</xref>) and mitochondrial translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Within these networks signaling molecules, predominantly protein kinases and phosphatases emerged as hubs. Also, two catalytic subunits of the cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A (Prkaca and Prkacb) display highly correlated changes following both Bic and TTX stimulation with a pronounced abundance increase after 24 hr of TTX and decrease after 2 hr of Bic. Prkaca and Prkacb interact with multiple regulated proteins that often exhibit similar changes in abundance and are known to play essential roles in synaptic transmission and plasticity: The voltage-gated calcium channel auxiliary beta subunits 1, 3, and 4 (Cacnb1, 3, 4) and alpha subunit 2 delta 3 (Cacna2d3), Calmodulin (Calm1) and the calcium-dependent protein kinase 2 subunit delta (Camk2d). Similarly, Synaptojanin-1, a protein that affects synaptic transmission and membrane trafficking by regulating membrane levels of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate, shows an increase in abundance after 24 hr of TTX treatment. We also observed corresponding elevated levels of phosphatidyl-4- and -5-phosphate-kinase subunits (Pip4k2b and Pip5k1c) and the related phosphatase (Inpp4a), as well as the AP2 related kinase 1 (Aak1) which phosphorylates AP-2 to trigger clathrin assembly. Some of the patterns of regulation complicate simple linear interpretations of signaling pathways: some regulated proteins that were downstream targets of a regulated kinase/phosphatase were often potential interactors with more than one regulated kinase/phosphatase. For example, the regulated protein Pdpk1, itself a kinase, interacts with three other regulated kinases (Lyn, Src and Fyn) as well as a regulated phosphatase (Ppp2r5e), many of which also interact with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In addition, we observed that the abundance of a group of mitochondrial ribosomal protein subunits increased after both 2 hr of Bic and TTX treatment (Mrpl9, 19, 21 and 42; Mrps26) but then displayed different trends after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33322.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Network analysis of time- and polarity-dependent proteome regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A–G</bold>) Using the String database, we analyzed the patterns of regulation and interaction between regulated proteins, using all 711 regulated proteins.

In this String analysis we acknowledge that we can only capture those interactions that are documented (e.g. for well-studied proteins) and thus could miss highly interactive proteins that have not been studied in detail. With this caveat in mind, we used the String database and identified the top ~40 regulated proteins that have the highest number of protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). This group of proteins exhibits on average, 38.3 interactions with other proteins whereas a random sampling of 40 proteins exhibits on average 5.6 interactions. This difference is statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). Not surprisingly, several kinases emerge (e.g. Adrbk1, Prkaca, Prkacb, Lyn, Kit) as well as phosphatases (Ptpn1, Ptpn11). We also observed several proteins involved in synaptic vesicle cycling (the syntaxins, Stx1a, Stx5, Stx6) and interestingly, proteins associate with the nuclear pore complex (Nup98 and Ranbp2). The regulation of proteins that have many interaction partners obviously can exert a multiplicative effect on downstream signaling during synaptic scaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title id="head_3">Discussion</title><p>Here we examined the proteomic response of neuronal networks to a brief but global manipulation (2 hr) of neuronal activity- either enhanced or reduced- by the addition of TTX or bicuculline. Using BONCAT to metabolically label and identify the nascent proteome, we discovered 168 proteins whose expression levels were significantly regulated by treatments that lead to homeostatic up- or down-scaling. The proteins that we identified are largely associated with neuronal function, including ion channels, adhesion and guidance molecules, synaptic receptors, and synaptic vesicle-associated proteins. We also found that a large number of differentially regulated proteins are involved in post- translational modifications. Adjusting proteome composition and activity by modifying existing protein pools is an energy-efficient and rapid way to alter activity states. Following a 2 hr manipulation of activity, we observed elevated synthesis of several kinases such as Lyn, Aak1 and Src, and phosphatases such as protein tyrosine phosphatases (Ptprg, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We also observed the regulation of proteins involved with protein synthesis and degradation including Cullin3, an essential component of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes essential for poly-ubiquitination and protein degradation. The regulation of degradation-related proteins supports observations that protein degradation plays an important role to adjust the neuronal proteome to the desired composition and thus functionality (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bingol and Schuman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tai and Schuman, 2008</xref>). Lastly, while we identified several proteins (e.g. Rheb, Rgs2, Ppp1r7, and Cacnb3) that have been implicated in previous studies of homeostatic scaling, we did not observe significant regulation of AMPA receptors, which are known to be end-point effectors for both up- and down-scaling elicited after short-term manipulations of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibata et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that our measurements were not sensitive enough to detect changes in AMPAR after a short (2 hr) metabolic labeling and activity manipulation. We did, however, observe polarized regulation of some AMPAR after 24 hr of labeling and manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>). This indicates that synaptic scaling following short-term activity manipulations may be due to post-translational modifications rather than regulation of new AMPAR synthesis.</p><p>We compared the regulated nascent proteome after 2 hr of global activity manipulation to a previous data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>) in which the same activity manipulations were applied for 24 hr. Surprisingly, there was very little overlap (~10 proteins) between the two time points. We noted two additional interesting features. First, a prominent feature of both datasets is the regulation of the same protein population by both up- and down-scaling manipulations. In some cases, the regulation of this common protein pool is polarized (e.g. upregulated in one condition and downregulated in another; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) reflecting the sign of the manipulation. In other cases, the polarity of the regulation is similar for both manipulations. Second, we analyzed if the fraction of overlapping regulated proteins was similar at 2 and 24 hr and found that this overlap was reduced from 52% at 2 hr to 34% at 24 hr. These results suggest that the longer the neuronal system is in a state of offset from a threshold, the more distinct the proteomic response becomes to reflect whether up- or down-scaling must be implemented.</p><p>From a network perspective, the regulated proteins identified here and in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>) can function as different types of sensors and effectors during homeostatic scaling. The polarity (positive or negative) of the offset from an activity setpoint could be coded for by proteins uniquely synthesized in response to TTX or bicuculline treatment. In our experiments, the number of such unique proteins was low as was their expression level. Another means to represent the sign of the offset is the differential regulation (up- or down) of a single protein or multiple proteins. We detected several protein examples that fit this profile. Using self-organizing maps, we clustered the patterns of regulation observed over time and with each activity manipulation. Interestingly, we found that many patterns of regulation indicated the duration of the activity offset (2 vs 24 hr), but not the polarity (whether activity was enhanced or decreased). We also found several regulation patterns that indicate the polarity of the manipulation, showing changes in expression exclusively to one manipulation but not another. The proteins that do not show polarized regulation may represent general offset detectors whereas those that exhibit polarized responses may be effectors for the polarized homeostatic response. Taken together, these data indicate that there are patterns of individual protein regulation that can convey information about either the duration of the activity offset (time) or the polarity (up-scaling or down-scaling) of the offset, or in some cases, both.</p><p>Capitalizing on the sensitivity of BONCAT, we were able to monitor the regulation of the neuronal proteome following a relatively brief global activity manipulation. In contrast to other recent publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowling et al., 2016</xref>), we did not use SILAC-co-incorporation because the stringent biochemical purification method we have developed allows one to directly monitor newly-synthesized proteins. In addition, because of the high number of proteins identified, we did not need to make use of intensity-based thresholds for including proteins also detected at lower levels in control samples. We note, however, that AHA is incorporated into the proteomes of all cells present in the preparation, including glia cells, leading to a dilution of the measured neuronal proteome response analyzed in this study. We recently developed a technique that enables cell-type specific labeling and identification of nascent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>). Future studies can make use of this platform to monitor selectively the cell-type specific proteomes both in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title id="head_4">Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title id="head_5">Preparation of dissociated neuron cultures</title><p>Dissociated hippocampal neurons from postnatal day 0–2 rat pups (strain Sprague-Dawley) were prepared and maintained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aakalu et al., 2001</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko Goda (Reviewer #1)., is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>Schanzenbacher et al. have examined the proteomic changes associated with treatments that elicit homeostatic synaptic scaling in cultured hippocampal neurons, using BONCAT nascent peptide-labeling combined with MS and MaxQuant data analysis methods. Following their previous work describing differentially expressed proteins after 24 h of activity manipulation (Neuron 2016), the authors now add a 2 h time point and compare the dynamics of the proteome across time. They find that many of the regulated proteins are associated with neuronal and/or synaptic functions and show distinct behaviors with respect to time and polarity of activity manipulation. Curiously, there is very little overlap of the regulated expression of individual proteins between 2 h and 24 h of activity manipulation despite the involvement of common protein function categories across both time periods. The findings suggest a key role for these functional categories in homeostatic scaling and, potentially, a time-dependent specialization of the regulation of specific proteins belonging to the same categories. Altogether, the results appear robust and should of broad interest to the community while providing a valuable resource. However, some revisions not involving additional experiments are requested as appended below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is very low correlation between the untreated 2hrs data and the untreated 24hrs data. Is this due to the difference in the duration of the BONCAT labeling? The authors state &quot;In the absence of activity manipulation, the 170 newly synthesized proteomes identified at these two time points were largely (~94%) 171 overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4——figure supplement 1A</xref>)&quot;. But in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>, the correlation coefficient between 2h untreated and 24h untreated is 0.69, that is much lower than that of treated vs. untreated (&gt;0.95). This means the difference between 2h untreated and 24h untreated is much bigger than the difference between treated and untreated of same duration. Why are the proteins synthesized in neurons within 2h so different from those within 24h? This difference may severely bias their comparison of the early- and late-response to an activity manipulation and requires further explanation.</p><p>2) The authors use the term 'hippocampal neurons' throughout the manuscript (e.g. the Abstract), including the Materials and methods, without qualifying that the cultures are a mix of neurons and glia. It therefore comes as a surprise to learn at the end of the Discussion &quot;that AHA is incorporated into the proteomes of all cells present in the preparation, including glia cells, leading to a dilution of the measured neuronal proteome response analyzed in this study.&quot; The authors should discuss the implications of the presence of glia in their samples up-front and in more detail. What is the ratio of neurons to glia in the cultures? What different types of hippocampal neurons are present? Since it is not accurate to use the term 'hippocampal neurons' to describe the biological preparation, the authors should either change it to 'hippocampal cells' or qualify the use of the term early in the manuscript.</p><p>3) The manuscript would benefit from a more in-depth Discussion to expand the scope of the present findings with respect to current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of homeostatic scaling. In particular, the following points need clarifications.</p><p>a) Why the majority of proteomic changes with greater magnitudes show little polarity despite the fact that some do show opposing polarity with directional changes in network activity?</p><p>- Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref> is rather informative. At both 2h and 24h time points, more data points fall into the upper right or lower left quadrants, and that these data points have overall a bigger deviation from the origin, indicating greater changes. From this, one would conclude that most proteomic changes that occur doing scaling with greater magnitudes have no polarity, and reflect some basic cellular processes that are engaged when prolonged shift in neural network/synaptic activity occur. What is really surprising is that some of these protein groups (for example, dendritic spine, synapse, exocytosis etc., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) have a clear polarized response in scaling; they change in opposite directions during up and down scaling. What might be the significance for such behaviors?</p><p>b) Why AMPARs show no changes at 2h of activity manipulation while at 24 h, they show changes in the same direction irrespective of the direction of activity manipulation?</p><p>- Surprisingly AMPAR complex has no significant proteomic response at 2h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), while a previous report (Ibata et al., 2008) showed that TTX can rapidly induce scaling within 2h. Additionally, at 24h, AMPAR complex changes to the same direction with both up and down scaling treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), while the synaptic changes mediated by AMPAR during up and down scaling are clearly opposite.

The differences in the “control” (unstimulated) proteomes at 2 hr and 24 hr represent differences in metabolic labeling efficiency. Simply put, the presence of AHA for 24 hrs gives us a much greater opportunity to capture the synthesis of a given protein. The overlap is protein identity is indeed high (94%) but the correlation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> reflects the protein amount, not the identity, only for those proteins that are detected at both time points (e.g. the 171 overlapping proteins). It is important to note that, even though overall intensities went up in 24h, we can still track and quantify the same proteins and compare the plasticity effects at 24 h and 2h- this is because each time point is normalized to its own (same) time point control. We have expanded on our explanation of the Figure S1D legend in order to make this point more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use the term 'hippocampal neurons' throughout the manuscript (e.g. the Abstract), including the Materials and methods, without qualifying that the cultures are a mix of neurons and glia.

We estimate that in our mixed hippocampal cell cultures we have about 75% neurons and 25% glia. In addition, we have now examined a set of glial and neuronal cell marker proteins derived from a study from Matthias Mann’s lab (Sharma et al) and identified 644 and 290 neuronal and glial marker proteins, respectively. When we analyzed how many of the 711 regulated proteins we identified were neuronal or glial markers, we found 88 and 7, respectively. There is a clear statistically significant enrichment for neuronal markers.

We have expanded our discussion of this in the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Why AMPARs show no changes at 2h of activity manipulation while at 24 h, they show changes in the same direction irrespective of the direction of activity manipulation?</p><p>- Surprisingly AMPAR complex has no significant proteomic response at 2h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), while a previous report (Ibata et al., 2008) showed that TTX can rapidly induce scaling within 2h.

How do the authors explain such discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer(s) for bringing up this point so that we can clarify any uncertainty or misconceptions. The Ibata report of synaptic scaling does not require an increase in the basal levels of AMPAR synthesis. Changes in synaptic transmission that involve or require AMPA receptors can be due to differences in post-translation modifications that change the number, position, dwell-time at synapses, current, etc. Our detection of changes in AMPAR at 24 hrs could also be upstream of the posttranslational modifications that give polarity to the scaling. We have expanded our discussion of this topic in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
