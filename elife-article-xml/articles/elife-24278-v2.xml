neurotransmitter release. Munc18-1 binds to synaptobrevin, but the relevance of this interaction and its relation to Munc13 function are unclear. NMR experiments now show that Munc18-1 binds specifically and non-specifically to synaptobrevin. Specific binding is inhibited by a L348R mutation in Munc18-1 and enhanced by a D326K mutation designed to disrupt the ‘furled conformation’ of a Munc18-1 loop. Correspondingly, the activity of Munc18-1 in reconstitution assays that require Munc18-1 and Munc13-1 for membrane fusion is stimulated by the D326K mutation and inhibited by the L348R mutation. Moreover, the D326K mutation allows Munc13-1-independent fusion and leads to a gain-of-function in rescue experiments in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans unc-18</italic> nulls. Together with previous studies, our data support a model whereby Munc18-1 acts as a template for SNARE complex assembly, and autoinhibition of synaptobrevin binding contributes to enabling regulation of neurotransmitter release by Munc13-1.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24278.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24278.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24278.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells communicate with other nerve cells by releasing small molecules called neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitters are first packaged inside bubble-like structures called vesicles, which fuse with the membrane of the nerve cell when it is stimulated. Once the vesicle and membrane have fused, the neurotransmitters are released outside the nerve cell and are detected when they bind to proteins on the surface of other nearby nerve cells.</p><p>A machinery of different proteins controls membrane fusion. Amongst these proteins are five called Munc18-1, Munc13-1, syntaxin-1, synaptobrevin and SNAP-25. The last three form a tight bundle called SNARE complex that brings the vesicle and cell membrane together and is essential for the two to fuse. Munc18-1 and Munc13-1 orchestrate the assembly of the SNARE complex. Previous studies suggested that Munc18-1 binds to synaptobrevin, providing a template to bring syntaxin-1 and synaptobrevin together and thereby helping the SNARE complex to form. However, the importance of the interaction between Munc18-1 and synaptobrevin was not clearly established, and it was not known how Munc13-1 is involved.</p><p>Sitarska, Xu et al. have now measured how mutated versions of Munc18-1 bind to synaptobrevin and tested how the mutations affect membrane fusion. A mutation in Munc18-1 that increased binding to synaptobrevin increased membrane fusion too, while a mutation that decreased binding had the opposite effect and reduced fusion. The results support the idea that Munc18-1 provides a template for the SNARE complex to form. One mutation stimulated Munc18-1 so that Munc13-1 was no longer needed for fusion when the mutant Munc18-1 was tested in fusion assays with artificial membranes. This mutation was designed to perturb the structure of a region of Munc18-1 protein that normally inhibits the binding of synaptobrevin.</p><p>These results suggest that by adopting a state where it cannot bind synaptobrevin, Munc18-1 can only be stimulated to form the SNARE complex and trigger release of neurotransmitter when Munc13-1 is present. This provides a way for Munc13-1, which is regulated by many factors, to fine-tune the release of neurotransmitter. Future work will test whether these proteins work in the same way in living animals. This will help us understand how communication between neurons is finely controlled to enable the brain to carry out its many different tasks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24278.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24278.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Munc18-1</kwd><kwd>Munc13</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>autoinhibition</kwd><kwd>protein NMR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Training Grant T32 GM008297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quade</surname><given-names>Bradley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-130573</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sugita</surname><given-names>Shuzo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 NS097333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD018027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS037200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS049044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement> </funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biophysical and functional data strongly support the notion that Munc18-1 acts as a template to assemble the neuronal SNARE complex, and that inhibition of this activity underlies diverse forms of regulation of neurotransmitter release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurotransmitter release is crucial for interneuronal communication. This exquisitely regulated process involves the docking of synaptic vesicles at presynaptic active zones, priming of the vesicles to a readily-releasable state and very fast (&lt;1 ms) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion of the vesicle and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Südhof, 2013</xref>). The machinery that controls release contains core proteins that form part of a universal intracellular membrane fusion apparatus. These proteins include (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rizo and Xu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</xref>): (i) the synaptic vesicle SNAP receptor (SNARE) synaptobrevin and the plasma membrane SNAREs syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, which together form a tight four-helix bundle called the SNARE complex that brings the two membranes together and is key for membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poirier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>); (ii) N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs; no relation to SNAP-25), which disassemble the SNARE complex to recycle the SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mayer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 1996</xref>); and (iii) the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein Munc18-1/UNC-18, which (together with Munc13s/UNC13) orchestrates SNARE complex formation in an NSF-SNAP-resistant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2013</xref>). In addition, the neuronal exocytotic machinery contains multiple additional proteins, such as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Synaptotagmin-1, RIMs, Rab3s, CAPS and complexins, which confer the tight regulation of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rizo and Xu, 2015</xref>).</p><p>This tight regulation also arises in part from the core components themselves. Thus, Munc13s contain a MUN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2005</xref>) that has homology to tethering factors from diverse membrane compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2011</xref>) and hence provides a core function, but also multiple domains with key regulatory roles (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al. [2006</xref>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al. [2011</xref>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al. [2016</xref>]). Syntaxin-1 also modulates neurotransmitter release by forming a self-inhibited ‘closed conformation’ that involves intramolecular binding of its N-terminal H<sub>abc</sub> domain to its SNARE motif, and that binds tightly to Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Misura et al., 2000</xref>). Opening of syntaxin-1 to form the SNARE complex is mediated by the Munc13 MUN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). This transition constitutes a central step that can be regulated via Munc13s in presynaptic plasticity processes that mediate diverse forms of information processing in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rizo and Rosenmund, 2008</xref>). However, the mechanism of syntaxin-1 opening and the exact role of Munc18-1 in SNARE complex assembly have been enigmatic.</p><p>Some evidence suggested that the Munc13-1 MUN domain opens syntaxin-1 through a weak interaction with its SNARE motif, providing a template for SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). However, an alternative model postulated that Munc18-1 provides a template for the formation of the SNARE complex. This model is based in part on the findings that Munc18-1 binds to synaptobrevin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2010b</xref>) and that a Munc18-1 mutation that disrupts this interaction (L348R) impairs the stimulation of liposome lipid mixing by Munc18-1 in reconstitution assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parisotto et al., 2014</xref>). Tantalizing evidence supporting a general role for SM proteins as templates for SNARE complex assembly was provided by two crystal structures of Vps33, the SM protein involved in yeast vacuolar fusion, bound either to Vam3 or to Nyv1, the respective homologues of syntaxin-1 and synaptobrevin in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). Superposition of the two structures clearly shows that binding to the SM protein places the two SNARE motifs in close proximity and in the right register to form the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Munc18-1 is likely to template SNARE complex assembly through similar interactions: the crystal structure of closed syntaxin-1 bound to Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Misura et al., 2000</xref>) revealed an orientation of the SNARE motif similar to that observed for Vam3 bound to Vps33 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Furthermore, L348 side chain implicated in synaptobrevin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parisotto et al., 2014</xref>) is located in a groove between two helices of domains 3a of Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which is involved in the binding of Vps33 to Nyv1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24278.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Autoinhibition by a loop of Munc18-1 is likely to inhibit binding to synaptobrevin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon diagram of the structure of Vps33 (blue) bound to the Nyv1 SNARE motif (red) (PDB code 5BV0) superimposed with the structure of Vps33 (not shown) bound to the Vam3 SNARE motif (yellow) (PDB code 5BUZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>).

This C-terminal region includes the sequence KLKRKYWWK (residues 83–91), which contains five basic and three aromatic residues and is thus likely to be promiscuous, as shown by the finding that this region also binds to the Munc13-1 MUN domain (see below). Its homologous region in Nyv1 is not involved in Vps33 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). The weak affinity of Munc18-1 for synaptobrevin may arise because of autoinhibition by a loop that connects the two aforementioned helices of domain 3a of Munc18-1, which occludes the putative synaptobrevin binding site in the crystal structure of Munc18-1 bound to closed syntaxin-1, forming what is referred to as a 'furled loop conformation' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, this loops adopts an ‘unfurled conformation’ in the crystal structure of Munc18-1 bound to a syntaxin-4 N-terminal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2011</xref>), forming an extension of one of these helices that resembles the conformation observed for the homologous sequence in the Vps33-Nyv1 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, a conformational change in this loop may modulate synaptobrevin binding. Indeed, a P335A mutation designed to favor this helical extension enhanced Munc18-1 activity in lipid mixing assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parisotto et al., 2014</xref>) and caused a gain-of-function in secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Munch et al., 2016</xref>). However, the basis for these results is unclear because the mutation did not appear to affect synaptobrevin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parisotto et al., 2014</xref>), and this region does not form a continuous helix in Vps33 bound to Nyv1; rather, it forms a bent helix with a proline in the corner (P355, homologous to Munc18-1 P335; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we do not yet know how the Munc18-1-synaptobrevin interaction is related to the functional interplay between Munc18-1 and Munc13s in orchestrating SNARE complex assembly.</p><p>In the study presented here, we addressed these questions using biophysical approaches and genetic experiments in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. NMR data show that the synaptobrevin SNARE motif binds to Munc18-1 through two types of interactions, one that involves the C-terminal region of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif and is likely non-specific, and another involving more central synaptobrevin sequences that is specifically impaired by the L348R mutation and enhanced by a mutation (D326K) designed to disrupt the furled loop conformation of Munc18-1. Using reconstitution assays in which liposome fusion strictly requires Munc18-1 and a Munc13-1 C-terminal fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), thus mirroring the total abrogation of neurotransmitter release observed in the absence of Munc18-1 or Munc13s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aravamudan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>), we find that the L348R mutation strongly impairs membrane fusion whereas the D326K mutation leads to a dramatic gain-of-function that can partially overcome the requirement for Munc13-1 for membrane fusion. Furthermore, the Munc18-1 D326K mutant rescues physiological defects observed in <italic>C. elegans unc-18</italic> nulls much more efficiently than WT Munc18-1, thus demonstrating a gain-of-function in a live animal. Overall, our data support the proposal that Munc18-1 acts as a template for the assembly of the SNARE complex by binding not only to syntaxin-1 but also to synaptobrevin. Moreover, our results suggest that autoinhibition of Munc18-1 binding to synaptobrevin enables or facilitates the existence of Munc13-dependent modes of regulation of neurotransmitter release, adding to the notion that diverse intra- and intermolecular inhibitory interactions within the release machinery provide opportunities for multiple layers of regulation that are fundamental for brain function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NMR analysis of the Munc18-1 binding sites in synaptobrevin</title><p>In previous cross-linking experiments, we found that a sequence from the C-terminus of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif was cross-linked with a sequence from the loop in domain 3a of rat Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2010b</xref>). Because rat Munc18-1 tends to aggregate, we used NMR spectroscopy in that study to analyze the binding of synaptobrevin to squid Munc18-1, which is more soluble, and also found that binding was dominated by the C-terminus of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2010b</xref>). In subsequent studies of interactions of neuronal SNAREs with Munc13-1, we found that the C-terminus of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif also binds to the Munc13-1 MUN domain via its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings raised the possibility that this C-terminal region of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif is promiscuous, which is not surprising because it includes five basic and three aromatic residues. This sequence is close to the transmembrane region, and is therefore likely to interact with the synaptic vesicle membrane through its abundant basic and hydrophobic residues in vivo; however, in the absence of membranes, this sequence is expected to be prone to non-specific protein interactions.</p><p>These observations, and the finding that the homologous sequence at the C-terminus of the Nyv1 SNARE motif does not bind to Vps33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>), led us to examine the binding of synaptobrevin to Munc18-1 in more detail using NMR spectroscopy. For this purpose, we used a <sup>15</sup>N-labeled fragment that spans the cytoplasmic region of synaptobrevin [synaptobrevin(1-96)] and acquired <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra in the absence and presence of rat Munc18-1 at moderate concentrations (14.5 µM), which limited Munc18-1 aggregation while maintaining high sensitivity. Note that these spectra contain one cross-peak for each non-proline residue in a <sup>15</sup>N-labeled protein, and that the intensity of the cross-peaks should decrease strongly upon binding to another protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizo et al., 2012</xref>), particularly considering that the synaptobrevin cytoplasmic region is unstructured in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hazzard et al., 1999</xref>). Our <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra confirmed the binding of Munc18-1 to the C-terminus of synaptobrevin(1-96), but showed that additional sequences from the SNARE motif also bind to Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The finding that the cross-peaks do not disappear completely indicates that the interaction is weak but, interestingly, examination of the cross-peak intensity ratios in the presence and absence of Munc18-1 shows clear intensity decreases not only for the C-terminal region (beyond residue 82) but also for residues 60–80; even residues 42–55 exhibit some meaningful intensity decreases albeit smaller. Note that the absolute intensities and relative intensity patterns in these experiments are highly reproducible, as illustrated by comparison of absolute intensities from two <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra acquired for two different samples of <sup>15</sup>N-synaptobrevin(1-96) plus Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), and by the similarity of intensity ratio patterns observed in spectra acquired with WT and mutant Munc18-1s in regions where the mutations did not affect binding (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24278.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Munc18-1 binds to central sequences and the C-terminus of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra of 14.5 µM <sup>15</sup>N-synaptobrevin(1-96) in the absence (black contours) and presence (red contours) of 14.5 µM Munc18-1.

This prediction fits approximately with the decreases in cross-peak intensities observed in our <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra, particularly considering that the smaller intensity decreases observed for residues 42–55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) may arise because the binding of this region may be hindered by competition with the C-terminus, which interacts with the same region of Munc18-1 according to the cross-linking experiments (see above). In summary, these results suggest that the Vps33-Nyv1 binding mode is conserved for neuronal Munc18-1 and synaptobrevin, and that analysis of this interaction by methods that do not provide residue-specific information is complicated by the existence of non-specific binding involving the C-terminus of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif. We attempted to use <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra to analyze Munc18-1 binding to a <sup>15</sup>N-labeled synaptobrevin fragment spanning residues 1–82, which lacks the promiscuous C-terminal region, but no cross-peaks could be observed for the SNARE motif of this fragment because of aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Specific alteration of synaptobrevin binding by mutations in domain 3a of Munc18-1</title><p>Previous biochemical data suggested that the L348R mutation disrupts binding of Munc18-1 to synaptobrevin and impairs the activity of Munc18-1 in liposome lipid mixing assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parisotto et al., 2014</xref>). To design additional mutations that could potentially correlate synaptobrevin binding to Munc18-1 function, we examined which residues of Munc18-1 might be involved in binding based on homology with the Vps33-Nyv1 structure, and which side chains may stabilize the furled conformation of the loop in domain 3a of Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as destabilization of this conformation may enhance synaptobrevin binding. These analyses were hindered by the low sequence similarity between Munc18-1s and Vps33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and because the furled conformation of the Munc18-1 loop is not very well defined in the crystal structure of its complex with syntaxin-1. (Note that the conformation of the loop is different in the original published structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Misura et al., 2000</xref>) and that refined later with the same data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burkhardt et al., 2008</xref>]). Nevertheless, D326 appeared to be a good candidate that may stabilize the furled loop because it may participate in hydrogen-bonding interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and is highly conserved throughout evolution in Munc18-1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Conversely, M330 may contribute to synaptobrevin binding because it is in a conserved hydrophobic position and its homologous residue of Vps33 participates in binding to Nyv1.</p><p>We used <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra to assess whether a mutation that reverses the charge of D326 (D326K) in Munc18-1 or a mutation that disrupts the hydrophobicity of M330 (M330E) could alter binding to <sup>15</sup>N-synaptobrevin(1-96), and also analyzed the effects of the L348R mutation. Importantly, the D326K Munc18-1 mutant caused stronger decreases in the intensities of cross-peaks from residues 45–83 than those caused by WT Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These effects seem moderate, but they do reflect a clear increase in the specific binding of the D326K mutant to this region. By contrast, the patterns of intensity ratios resulting from the addition of the D326K mutant or WT Munc18-1 are very similar for other regions of synaptobrevin, including the 40 N-terminal residues that are not involved in binding and the C-terminal region, which does bind to Munc18-1 but through interactions that are not affected by the D326K mutation. The M330E Munc18-1 mutant caused very similar intensity changes on the synaptobrevin <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC cross-peaks to those caused by WT Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Hence, the M330 side chain does not contribute substantially to the affinity of Munc18-1 for synaptobrevin, but the M330E mutation provides a convenient negative control as a mutation in the loop region that is predicted to have no or very limited functional effects. Conversely, the L348R Munc18-1 mutant caused practically no decreases in the intensities of the synaptobrevin <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC cross-peaks except for those from the C-terminus, where the changes exhibited a similar pattern to those caused by WT Munc18-1. These data correlate with previous biochemical results showing impaired binding of the L348R Munc18-1 mutant to synaptobrevin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parisotto et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, these results provide an emphatic illustration of the power of this method of analysis of protein–protein interactions, showing that the L348R mutation specifically impairs binding of Munc18-1 to the sequences of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif that are expected to bind according to the crystal structure of the Vps33–Nyv1 complex, and that the mutation has a clearly less marked effect on the non-specific binding involving the C-terminus.</p><p>Overall, these results support the notion that there is a specific interaction between Munc18-1 and synaptobrevin that resembles that observed between Vps33 and Nyv1, and that this interaction is autoinhibited by the furled conformation of the loop in domain 3a of Munc18-1. We also analyzed whether the D326K, M330E and L348R mutations alter the binding of Munc18-1 to syntaxin-1 or to the SNARE complex using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>s measured for the binding of WT and mutant Munc18-1s to syntaxin-1 were all very low, refining to less than 2 nM. The differences in the <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>s calculated in duplicate experiments for each Munc18-1 protein and the confidence intervals derived from the fits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) indicate that none of the differences in <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>s measured for WT Munc18-1 and the mutants can be considered significant. Hence, these data show that the three Munc18-1 mutants retain very high affinity for syntaxin-1, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the mutations alter the affinity to some extent that is not measurable in these experiments. Similarly, there do not appear to be major differences in the affinities of WT and mutant Munc18-1s for the SNARE complex, although it is plausible that the D326K mutant has an increased affinity. Because Munc18-1 is relatively unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), we also measured the thermal denaturation curves of the three Munc18-1 mutants using circular dichroism. We observed no significant differences in the melting temperature compared to WT Munc18-1, indicating that the mutations do not destabilize the protein. Therefore, the functional consequences of the D326K, M330E and L348R mutations in Munc18-1 are not expected to arise from misfolding.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24278.009</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of the ITC data obtained to analyze the binding of WT and mutant Munc18-1s to syntaxin-1 and the SNARE complex<sup>*</sup>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24278.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24278.009</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Syringe</th><th valign="top">Cell</th><th valign="top">Cell concentration correct factor<sup>†</sup></th><th valign="top"><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> [nM]</th><th valign="top">ΔH[kcal/Mol]</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="12" valign="top">Syx2-253</td><td valign="top">WT-1</td><td valign="top">0.98 [0.97, 0.98]</td><td valign="top">0.10 [0, 0.15]</td><td valign="top">−22.80 [–23.13, –22.46]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">WT-2</td><td valign="top">0.92 [0.92, 0.93]</td><td valign="top">0.34 [0, 0.67]</td><td valign="top">−22.03 [–22.36, –21.71]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">D326K-1</td><td valign="top">0.89 [0.89, 0.89]</td><td valign="top">0.23 [0.11, 0.37]</td><td valign="top">−23.56 [–23.75, –23.37]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">D326K-2</td><td valign="top">0.86 [0.85, 0.87]</td><td valign="top">0.30 [0, 0.67]</td><td valign="top">−25.45 [–26.30, –24.61]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">M330E-1</td><td valign="top">0.92 [0.91, 0.94]</td><td valign="top">1.76 [0.82, 3.23]</td><td valign="top">−21.56 [–22.21, –20.92]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">M330E-2</td><td valign="top">0.97 [0.94, 1.00]</td><td valign="top">1.52 [0.49, 3.47]</td><td valign="top">−25.67 [–27.43, –24.04]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">L348R-1</td><td valign="top">0.86 [0.85, 0.87]</td><td valign="top">0.54 [0.23, 0.98]</td><td valign="top">−25.42 [–25.90, –24.95]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">L348R-2</td><td valign="top">0.85 [0.85, 0.85]</td><td valign="top">0.71 [0.51, 0.93]</td><td valign="top">−25.12 [–25.31, –24.92]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="12" valign="top">SNARE complex<sup>‡</sup></td><td valign="top">WT-1</td><td valign="top">1.07 [0.90, 1.18]</td><td valign="top">1,382 [952, 2172]</td><td valign="top">−5.21 [–7.31, –4.24]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">WT-2</td><td valign="top">1.01 [0.84, 1.11]</td><td valign="top">1,479 [1018, 2355]</td><td valign="top">−5.46 [–7.99, –4.38]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">D326K-1</td><td valign="top">1.05 [0.98, 1.12]</td><td valign="top">442 [296, 681]</td><td valign="top">−4.29 [–4.94, –3.84]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">D326K-2</td><td valign="top">0.98 [0.81, 1.11]</td><td valign="top">361 [179, 834]</td><td valign="top">−3.13 [–4.66, –2.51]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">M330E-1</td><td valign="top">0.96 [0.79, 1.08]</td><td valign="top">730 [414, 1459]</td><td valign="top">−2.48 [–3.72, –1.99]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">M330E-2</td><td valign="top">0.95 [0.82, 1.12]</td><td valign="top">1,205 [993, 1462]</td><td valign="top">−3.69 [–4.30, –3.25]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">L348R-1</td><td valign="top">0.95 [0.89, 1.00]</td><td valign="top">677 [521, 895]</td><td valign="top">−5.06 [–5.74, –4.56]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">L348R-2</td><td valign="top">0.89 [0.77, 0.98]</td><td valign="top">781 [527, 1245]</td><td valign="top">−5.20 [–7.00, –4.30]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p><sup>*</sup>Two independent experiments were performed for WT Munc18-1 and for each mutant.

As the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment bridges V- and T-liposomes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and because this activity is key for its role in supporting membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain probably helps to overcome an energy barrier to membrane fusion in these experiments. The finding that the D326K mutation designed to unfurl the Munc18-1 loop can support efficient fusion before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition suggests that the furled loop conformation imposes another energy barrier in WT Munc18-1 that is tightly coupled to the barrier associated with Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C; thus, when the D326K mutation decreases the energy barrier to unfurl the Munc18-1 loop, the requirement for Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain is relaxed.</p><p>These observations led us to test the possibility that the D326K mutation may overcome, at least partially, the overall requirement for Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C for membrane fusion. In experiments performed in the presence of NSF-αSNAP and in the absence of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, neither the WT nor the Munc18-1 mutants were able to support fusion between V- and T-liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). However, when we performed analogous experiments in the presence of the Synaptotagmin-1 C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment, the D326K Munc18-1 mutant was able to stimulate fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This fusion was slow but was dramatically more efficient than that observed with WT Munc18-1 or the M330E and L348R mutants. These results suggest that Munc13-1 is normally critical for membrane fusion because it is needed to overcome the energy barriers, imposed by the closed conformation of syntaxin-1 and by the furled conformation of the Munc18-1 loop, to SNARE complex assembly templated by Munc18-1. Thus, the D326K mutation in Munc18-1 probably helps to overcome the need for Munc13-1 in these assays, much as a so-called LE mutation that disrupts the closed conformation of syntaxin-1 helps to overcome the requirement of Unc13 for neurotransmitter release in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The gain-of-function associated with the D326K mutation is expected to reflect an enhanced ability to mediate SNARE complex formation. To test this notion, we used an assay that monitors SNARE complex assembly using native PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Binary complexes of syntaxin-1 and WT or mutant Munc18-1s containing the M330E, D326K or L348R substitutions were formed and then incubated with synaptobrevin and SNAP-25; they were then analyzed by native PAGE. SNARE complex assembly was reflected in the appearance of a characteristic band in the middle of the gel, which was concomitant with the depletion of the band corresponding to the syntaxin-1–Munc18-1 complex at the top of the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Only a small amount of SNARE complex was observed when WT Munc18-1 or the M330E mutant was used, and practically no SNARE complex assembly was observed for the L348R mutant. Conversely, the D326K mutation led to a clear increase in SNARE complex formation compared to that observed with WT Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results show a clear correlation between SNARE complex assembly and the activities of the mutants in the reconstitutions assays, supporting the notion that these activities are a consequence of their ability to template SNARE complex assembly.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24278.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Effects of Munc18-1 mutations on SNARE complex assembly starting with the binary syntaxin-1–Munc18-1 complex.</title><p>Complexes of syntaxin-1 (2–253) with WT or mutant Munc18-1 were incubated with SNAP-25 and the synaptobrevin SNARE motif, and analyzed by native PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining (five lanes on the right).

Using static light scattering (SLS), we measured the following weight-average molecular mass (presented as the average of 30 determinations ± the standard deviation in kDa) at 15 µM concentration: WT Munc18-1 77.2 ± 0.1; D326K Munc18-1 78.7 ± 0.9; WT Munc18-1 bound to an unlabeled fragment spanning most of the cytoplasmic region of syntaxin-1 [syntaxin-1 (2–253)] 97.1 ± 0.6; D326K Munc18-1-syntaxin-1 (2–253) 102.1 ± 0.9. The expected molecular weights are 68.6 and 98.0 for free and syntaxin-1 (2–253)-bound Munc18-1, respectively. Hence, these data show that the free and syntaxin-1 (2–253)-bound Munc18-1 are largely monomeric under these conditions, and that the D326K mutation does not alter this behavior substantially.</p><p>We next turned to NMR spectroscopy. Clearly, it is very difficult to obtain detailed structural information on a small region of a 68-kDa protein such as Munc18-1 by any available technique in solution, but methyl TROSY-based heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) spectra of perdeuterated proteins that are specifically <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C-labeled at Ile, Leu, Met and Val methyl groups (<sup>2</sup>H-ILMV-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-labeling) offers the possibility of observing cross-peaks from methyl groups of very large proteins with high sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ruschak and Kay, 2010</xref>), thus providing a powerful tool to investigate structural perturbations around these methyl groups. Application of this approach to Munc18-1 was hindered by its limited solubility and stability, and attempts to obtain <sup>2</sup>H-ILMV-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-labeled Munc18-1 yielded very low amounts of soluble protein. We circumvented this problem by preparing ILMV-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-labeled Munc18-1 with only 50% perdeuteration (50%-<sup>2</sup>H-ILMV-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-Munc18-1), which we could obtain with reasonable yields in stable form. The quality of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectra obtained for 15 µM 50%-<sup>2</sup>H-ILMV-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-Munc18-1 in isolation or bound to syntaxin-1 (2–253) was rather limited in the Ile and Leu-Val methyl regions but, fortunately, multiple well-resolved cross-peaks could be observed with sufficient sensitivity in the Met methyl region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and the domain 3a loop contains four methionines (M316, M324, M330 and M334; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Hence, the methyl cross-peaks from these methionines might provide information on the structural perturbations caused by the D326K mutation.</p><p>Comparison of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectra of 50%-<sup>2</sup>H-ILMV-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-Munc18-1 in a free state and bound to syntaxin-1 (2–253) shows that syntaxin-1 binding induces shifts in many methionine methyl cross-peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), consistent with the extensive surface involved in the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Misura et al., 2000</xref>). The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectra acquired for D326K mutant 50%-<sup>2</sup>H-ILMV-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-Munc18-1 free and bound to syntaxin-1 (2–253) revealed similar changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) to those observed for WT, as expected because this mutant retains very high affinity for syntaxin-1 (2–253) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and the mutation is not in the binding interface. Attempts to assign the cross-peaks from the four methionines in the loop by acquiring <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectra of three mutants containing single methionine substitutions (M316L, M330E and M334L) did not yield unambiguous assignments because the mutations perturbed several cross-peaks for both free and syntaxin-1 (2–253)-bound 50%-<sup>2</sup>H-ILMV-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nevertheless, the perturbations did identify four cross-peaks that are most perturbed by the mutations and hence are most likely to correspond to the M316, M324, M330 and M334 methyl groups for both the free and the syntaxin-1 (2–253)-bound 50%-<sup>2</sup>H-ILMV-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The perturbations are not compatible with unfurled conformations such as that observed in the crystal structure of Munc18-1 bound to the syntaxin-4 N-terminal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) because the D326, M316, M324 and M330 side chains are not well packed and the loop region is rather flexible in this dimeric structure (residues 315–323, were not observable, and the side chains of M324, D326 and M330 were also not observable). As Munc18-1 and its complex with syntaxin-1 (2–253) are largely monomeric under our conditions, additional flexibility would be expected if an unfurled loop structure were present. Conversely, the observed cross-peak perturbations are compatible with the furled loop structure observed in the crystals of Mun18-1 bound to closed syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Nevertheless, the extent to which the observed structure was influenced by crystal contacts is still unclear, and the large changes caused by syntaxin-1 (2–253) binding on the cross-peaks tentatively assigned to the M330 and M334 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) indicate that binding may substantially alter the structure of the loop. The shifts of the tentatively assigned Met cross-peaks caused by the D326K mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>) show that the mutation causes some structural perturbations in the region, but these perturbations are unlikely to underlie the functional effects of the mutation because the M330E mutation induces more substantial cross-peak shifts without having functional effects.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the D326K mutation caused not only shifts but also decreased intensities in the cross-peaks from the four methionines of the Munc18-1 loop in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectra of the syntaxin-1 (2–253)-bound form, whereas other methionine cross-peaks generally had similar intensities in the WT and D326K spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, right panel). Moreover, two new cross-peaks were observed in the spectrum of D326K 50%-<sup>2</sup>H-ILMV-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-Munc18-1 bound to syntaxin-1 (2–253) that were not present in the spectrum of the WT complex (indicated by ** in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). These observations suggest that the D326K mutation destabilizes the furled loop structure, inducing the formation of an alternative (perhaps unfurled) structure in a population of the Munc18-1-syntaxin-1 (2–253) complexes, and resulting in an equilibrium between the two structures that is relatively slow in the NMR time scale. The observation of only two new cross-peaks for the alternative structure might arise because its population is low, because of overlap with other cross-peaks and/or because exchange broadening renders some new cross-peaks unobservable. Note that exchange broadening may also contribute to the decreased intensities of the cross-peaks from the four methionines in the furled loop structure. For isolated Munc18-1, the D326K mutation also caused decreases in the intensities of the four methionine cross-peaks from the furled loop, but the decreases were less marked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, left panel), and only one of the new cross-peaks was observed (** in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), but with lower intensity than for the syntaxin-1 (2–253)-bound form. Thus, the D326K mutation also appears to induce the formation of an alternative structure in isolated Munc18-1 but with a lower population than in the complex with syntaxin-1 (2–253). It is tempting to speculate from these findings that formation of the alternative structure underlies the increased activity of the Munc18-1 D326K mutant in the membrane-fusion and SNARE-complex-assembly assays, as well as its increased binding to synaptobrevin, and that this increased binding is less pronounced than the increases in activity because formation of the alternative structure is less favored in isolated Munc18-1 than in the Munc18-1–syntaxin-1 complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The Munc18-1 D326K mutant rescues <italic>unc-18</italic> nulls more efficiently than WT Munc18-1</title><p>Mammalian Munc18-1 rescues the paralysis phenotype of <italic>unc-18</italic> nulls in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but the rescue is only partial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gengyo-Ando et al., 1996</xref>) and rat Munc18-1 bearing a P335A mutation yields a much more efficient rescue than the WT protein (S.

Immunoblots showed comparable levels of expression for the WT and D326K mutant Munc18-1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the observed functional differences do not arise from differential expression levels.

The function of these proteins has proven enigmatic, in part because of the diversity of their interactions with SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rizo and Südhof, 2012</xref>), but recent progress has brought key insights to help solve the mystery. Research on yeast vacuolar fusion showed that the HOPS tethering complex containing the SM protein Vps33 is required for SNARE complex assembly in the presence of Sec17 and Sec18, the yeast homologues of αSNAP and NSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2010a</xref>), and Munc18-1 (together with Munc13s) was later shown to orchestrate SNARE complex assembly in an NSF-αSNAP-resistant manner(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). The findings that a loop in domain 3a of Munc18-1 adopts distinct conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2011</xref>), that Munc18-1 binds to synaptobrevin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2010b</xref>), and that the L348R mutation that disrupts this interaction impairs Munc18-1 function, led to the notion that Munc18-1 provides a template for the formation of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parisotto et al., 2014</xref>). This proposal and its generality for SM protein function were emphatically supported by the crystal structures of Vps33 with Vam3 and Nyv1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). However, the dependence of Munc18-1 function on synaptobrevin binding was not clearly established, and the relation of this role of Munc18-1 to its tight functional interplay with Munc13s was unknown. Our results now reveal a clear correlation between Munc18-1 binding to synaptobrevin and its activity in stimulating membrane fusion in reconstitution assays that depend critically on both Munc18-1 and Munc13-1. Moreover, the gain-of-function observed in these assays for the D326K mutation, which was designed to unfurl the Munc18-1 loop, is mirrored in a gain-of-function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. These results strongly support the template model of SM-protein function and the notion that synaptobrevin binding is autoinhibited by the furled loop conformation in domain 3a. Our data also suggest that this autoinhibition of Munc18-1 function is important to enable control of release by Munc13s, thus allowing a wide range of Munc13-dependent regulatory processes that are vital for brain function.</p><p>It may seem surprising that, although the molecular mechanism of neurotransmitter release has been studied intensely for 30 years, the importance of Munc18-1 binding to synaptobrevin has been recognized only recently. This delay arose in part because much attention was paid to the tight interaction of Munc18-1 with syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hata et al., 1993</xref>) and its implications in inhibiting or perhaps assisting in SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Misura et al., 2000</xref>). Munc18-1 was later found to bind to the SNARE complex and synaptobrevin binding was proposed to be important in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dulubova et al., 2007</xref>). Binding of Munc18-1 to isolated synaptobrevin was probably missed in some early studies because it is weak and difficult to detect with the pulldown assays commonly used to identify protein–protein interactions. Recent pulldown assays did detect the interaction, but using a large synaptobrevin excess and antibody detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parisotto et al., 2014</xref>). Munc18-1–synaptobrevin binding washas been readily observed by NMR spectroscopy, which is well suited to the analysis of weak interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizo et al., 2012</xref>), but the interaction was dominated by the promiscuous C-terminus of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2010b</xref>). Our NMR analyses now provide crucial clarification in this area.</p><p>On one hand, the findings that the C-terminus of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif also binds to the Munc13-1 MUN domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and that its interaction with Munc18-1 is largely unaffected by the D326K or L348R mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) strongly supports the conclusion that this interaction is not specific, although we cannot rule out its physiological relevance. On the other hand, our NMR results reveal an interaction of Munc18-1 with more central sequences of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that are not involved in binding to the Munc13-1 MUN domain and that, on the basis of the Vps33-Nyv1 crystal structure, are expected to be involved in binding to Munc18-1. Moreover, Munc18-1 binding to these sequences is specifically altered by the D326K and L348R mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The D326K mutation designed to destabilize the furled loop conformation of domain 3a of Munc18-1 increases binding, whereas the L348R mutation impairs binding as shown earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parisotto et al., 2014</xref>) and in agreement with the Vps33-Nyv1 binding mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). In correlation with these findings, the L348R mutation impairs Munc18-1 function in reconstitution assays and the D326K mutation stimulates Munc18-1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), results that also correlate with the ability of these mutants to support SNARE complex assembly starting from their binary complex with syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, the D326K mutation leads to a dramatic gain-of-function in rescue experiments in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Together with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parisotto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>), these results strongly support the notion that Munc18-1 templates SNARE complex assembly via interactions with synaptobrevin and syntaxin-1 that resemble those of Vps33 with Nyv1 and Vam3, and that are likely to be conserved across the SM protein and SNARE families.</p><p>Establishing definitively whether and how the D326K mutation in Munc18-1 alters the structure of the domain 3a loop is challenging, but our NMR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) do show that the loop adopts defined structures that do not appear to be unfurled in both isolated and syntaxin-1 (2–253)-bound Munc18-1. The data are consistent with the furled loop structure observed in the crystal structure of the Munc18-1-syntaxin-1 complex, but indicate that the structure differs considerably in the free and syntaxin-1-bound Munc18-1. The decreases in the intensities of the methionine methyl cross-peaks from the loop region observed in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) and the appearance of new cross-peaks caused by the D326K mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>) suggest that the mutation destabilizes the structure of the loop both in the isolated Munc18-1 and in the Munc18-1-syntaxin-1 (2–253) complex, but more markedly in the latter. Thus, although these results are not definitive, they support the notion that the effects of the D326K mutation on synaptobrevin binding and on the activity of Munc18-1 in the membrane fusion and SNARE complex assembly assays arise from structural destabilization, and hence that Munc18-1 is autoinhibited both in isolation and when bound to syntaxin-1.</p><p>Such autoinhibition may underlie in part the weak affinity of the Munc18-1–synaptobrevin interaction, but it appears that the interaction is intrinsically weak, as binding is not saturated at 14.5 µM protein concentration even for the D326K mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, when a synaptic vesicle docks at the active zone, or when V- and T-liposomes dock in our reconstitution assays, binding should be favored by the high local concentrations of not only synaptobrevin but also Munc18-1, which initially is most likely to be bound to syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). Note also that weak interactions can have dramatic effects in catalyzing the assembly of a protein complex, as a ten-fold acceleration in assembly rate requires a decrease in the energy barrier of just 1.4 kcal/mol, which can be provided by a single hydrogen bond. Hence, the Munc18-1–synaptobrevin interaction might play a catalytic role in promoting SNARE complex assembly by placing the synaptobrevin and syntaxin-1 SNARE motifs near each other, in the correct register and orientation (as suggested by the Vps33 crystal structures with Nyv1 and Vam3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>]). At the same time, these interactions may prevent antiparallel interactions of synaptobrevin with syntaxin-1 (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weninger et al., 2003</xref>]) that could inhibit synaptic vesicle fusion. This model does not rule out the notion that Munc18-1 may remain bound to the SNARE complex after assembly and might participate in downstream events that lead to membrane fusion. In this context, it is worth noting that the D326K mutation may increase the binding of Munc18-1 to the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), which might also underlie in part the gain-of-function caused by the mutation.</p><p>The tight Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of membrane fusion in our reconstitution assays depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain by a mechanism that is not understood but that may be related to a Ca<sup>2+-</sup>sensing role in release or promotion of an activated state of Munc13-1 during repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). Regardless of which of these two possibilities is correct, the facts that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C can dock V-liposomes to T-liposomes and that there can be efficient lipid mixing with little content mixing before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition in our fusion assays indicate that Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C helps in the fusion reaction by promoting such docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), but also imposes an energy barrier that is overcome by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to its C<sub>2</sub>B domain. In reconstitution experiments with WT Munc18-1, the additional energy barriers caused by the closed conformation of syntaxin-1 and the furled loop conformation of Munc18-1 probably hinder SNARE complex assembly to such an extent that full assembly and membrane fusion can only occur when Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain lowers one of the existing energy barriers. Our reconstitution data show that this Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding event becomes less critical when Munc18-1 bears the D326K mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>), probably because this mutation decreases the energy barrier caused by the furled loop conformation. In fact, some fusion can occur even in the absence of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C when using the Munc18-1 D326K mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>), suggesting that, without a furled loop conformation in Munc18-1, SNARE complex formation can occur without an absolute requirement for the membrane bridging and syntaxin-1 opening activities of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C.</p><p>This notion is reminiscent of the finding that syntaxin-1 bearing an LE mutation that disrupts its closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>) can partially rescue neurotransmitter release in <italic>unc-13</italic> nulls in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>), and suggests that there are at least two energy barriers within the Munc18-1–syntaxin-1 complex that hinder SNARE complex assembly and thus contribute to make Munc13-1 critical for release: one arises from autoinhibition of syntaxin-1 and the other from autoinhibition of Munc18-1. Without these autoinibitory interactions, Munc13-1 would not be essential, but then the varied modes of regulation of release during presynaptic plasticity that depend on Munc13-1 would be lost. These ideas emphasize the importance of autoinhibitory interactions in achieving the exquisite regulation of neurotransmitter release and need to be explored with further research in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>We previously described expression in BL21 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells and purification of the following proteins: rat syntaxin 1A (residues 2–253); rat synaptobrevin 2 (residues 1–96 or 29–93); rat SNAP-25A full length (with the four cysteines mutated to serines); and fragments corresponding its SNARE motifs (residues 11–82 and residues 141–203); full-length rat Munc18-1; rat synaptotagmin-1 C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment (residues 131–421); full length <italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic> NSF V155M mutant; and full-length <italic>Bos taurus</italic> αSNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2013</xref>).

Syntaxin-1 (2–253) (8–24 μM) was titrated into the cell containing Munc18-1 or mutants (0.5–2 μM) in buffer A (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 120 mM KCl and 1 mM TCEP). SNARE complex (30–50 μM) was titrated into Munc18-1 or mutants (1.5–2.5 uM) in buffer B (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl and 1 mM TCEP). SNARE complexes were formed with SNAP-25 (11–82), SNAP-25 (141–203), syntaxin-1(2–253) and synaptobrevin (1–96). Complex assembly was accomplished by incubating a mixture of the purified fragments overnight and then removing remaining unassembled fragments by repeated rounds of size-exclusion gel filtration to efficiently eliminate unassembled syntaxin-1 (2–253), which binds very tightly to Munc18-1 and could thus perturb the measurements of SNARE complex binding. All proteins and the SNARE complex were purified by gel filtration and dialyzed in the same buffer before the experiments. The data were baseline corrected with NITPIC, fitted with a nonlinear least squares routine using a single-site binding model with ITCsy, and plotted with GUSSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brautigam et al., 2016</xref>). The ‘A + B &lt;-&gt; AB’ model was used for the fitting, and apparent concentration errors for the cell contents were compensated for by refining a single correction factor for this parameter. The 68.3% confidence intervals were obtained using the error surface projection method.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>A recent paper (Baker 2015) proposed, based on X-ray crystallographic studies of vacuolar proteins, that SM proteins function as templates that orient and align R- and Qa-SNAREs for assembly. This model was not, however, compatible with a previous study from the author's lab (Xu 2010) of the C terminus of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif binding to Munc18.</p><p>Here, the discrepancy is satisfyingly resolved, with new NMR data that strongly suggest that vacuolar and synaptic SM proteins bind R-SNAREs in similar ways after all. A new Munc18 mutant, D326K, is designed with the hope of destabilizing the 'closed' (previously 'furled') conformation of domain 3a relative to the 'open' conformation. [Other studies have used P335A to stabilize the open conformation relative to the closed.] This mutant binds a bit more tightly to synaptobrevin, and perhaps also to the SNARE complex, and displays strong gain-of-function features in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>The studies are impressive in both technical range and quality, and establish the importance of SM association with the SNARE domains of R-SNAREs, establishing this interaction's generality.</p><p>While this manuscript was favorably reviewed, the accompanying manuscript by Park et al. was rejected. The authors may optionally consider to incorporate some of the results from Park et al. that are most relevant for the paper by Sitarska.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Like previous studies (and also the accompanying manuscript), this study lacks direct evidence for the impact of the mutations (either D326K or P335A) on the conformation and/or dynamics of domain 3a. The story would be stronger if the authors could provide such evidence.</p><p>2) Do the ITC data convincingly rule out a reduction in Munc18-syntaxin affinity caused by the D326K mutation?</p><p>3) It is not convincing that the domain 3a closed conformation by itself represents a major barrier to SNARE complex assembly – the available SM structures would appear to suggest that domain 3a is flexible, although generally 'open' or 'closed' conformations are observed frequently (the latter often stabilized by crystal contacts). Might it instead be that the importance of the mutation only manifests itself within complexes that have not heretofore been defined in detail?</p><p>4) The data in <italic>C. elegans</italic> compare worms expressing a variable (and presumably unknown) copy number of Munc18-1 WT and D326K mutant. It would be necessary to compare the expression levels directly using Western blot or similar. If the expression levels are not similar, the data are hard to interpret. Why are none of the worms as sensitive as the N2 (wildtype) worms? Is this because the Munc18-1 expression levels are lower than in the WT case?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24278.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Like previous studies (and also the accompanying manuscript), this study lacks direct evidence for the impact of the mutations (either D326K or P335A) on the conformation and/or dynamics of domain 3a. The story would be stronger if the authors could provide such evidence.</italic> </p><p>We fully agree with this concern. Unfortunately, it is difficult to address it in a definitive manner because determining the structure in solution of a 70 kDa protein with a high tendency to aggregate is very challenging if not impossible, and the loop region is involved in crystal contacts in all the crystal structures of Munc18-1 described so far, leaving an uncertainty as to what is the structure of the loop even for the WT protein. Nevertheless, this is an important point and we have devoted a strong effort to perform NMR studies that could shed some light into this issue, which has caused the delay in submitting the revised manuscript. We have obtained NMR data that are presented in a new section (subsection “The D326K mutation destabilizes the structure of the Munc18-1 loop”) as well as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>. The data are not definitive because of the intrinsic difficulty of the problem and hence we have been cautious when drawing conclusions. However, the results do show that the loop is structured in both isolated Munc18-1 and Munc18-1 bound to syntaxin-1, and suggest that the D326K mutation destabilizes the loop structure in both cases, particularly in the Munc18-1-syntaxin-1 complex. Hence, the new data provide an explanation for the finding that the D326K mutation increases binding to synaptobrevin, albeit moderately, while it has strong effects on the activity of Munc18-1 in the membrane fusion and SNARE complex assembly assays, which rely on the formation of the Munc18-1-syntaxin-1 complex.</p><p><italic>2) Do the ITC data convincingly rule out a reduction in Munc18-syntaxin affinity caused by the D326K mutation?</italic> </p><p>The ITC data does not rule out this possibility. In the revised manuscript, we have changed the corresponding sentence, which now reads: ‘Hence, these data show that the three Munc18-1 mutants retain very high affinity for syntaxin-1, although we cannot rule out that the mutations alter the affinity to some extent that is not measurable in these experiments.’ Nevertheless, given the consistency of all the data presented in the paper and the very high affinity that the D326K mutant has for syntaxin-1, it seems rather unlikely that the effects of the D326K mutation arise because from a reduction in the affinity for syntaxin-1.</p><p><italic>3) It is not convincing that the domain 3a closed conformation by itself represents a major barrier to SNARE complex assembly – the available SM structures would appear to suggest that domain 3a is flexible, although generally 'open' or 'closed' conformations are observed frequently (the latter often stabilized by crystal contacts). Might it instead be that the importance of the mutation only manifests itself within complexes that have not heretofore been defined in detail?</italic> </p><p>This is again a very good point. However, as we discuss now in the section presenting the new NMR data, the unfurled conformations of the loop observed in two crystal structures of Munc18-1 may have been induced by crystal contacts. Moreover, the effects of methionine mutations that we made in the loop to assign 1 H- 13C HMQC cross-peaks, as well as the effects of the D326K mutation itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), are incompatible with the unfurled structures observed in those crystal structures. Overall, the NMR data indicate that there is a defined, well-packed loop structure (hence not unfurled) in Munc18-1 that changes but remains furled upon syntaxin-1 binding.</p><p><italic>4) The data in C. elegans compare worms expressing a variable (and presumably unknown) copy number of Munc18-1 WT and D326K mutant. It would be necessary to compare the expression levels directly using Western blot or similar. If the expression levels are not similar, the data are hard to interpret. Why are none of the worms as sensitive as the N2 (wildtype) worms? Is this because the Munc18-1 expression levels are lower than in the WT case?</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, we now present a Western blot showing similar expression of WT and D326K mutant Munc18-1. The observation that mammalian Munc18-1 can partially, but not completely, rescue phenotypes of invertebrate Unc18 nulls in <italic>C. elegans</italic> was reported in 1996 (Gengyo-Ando et al. 1996). It is not surprising that the rescue is not complete given the evolutionary distance between worms and mammals. Note that we cannot directly compare the expression of mammalian Munc18-1 with that of Unc18 in N2 animals because the antibody used to recognize the mammalian protein does not recognize <italic>C. elegans</italic> Unc18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
