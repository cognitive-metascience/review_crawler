single RuvC active site to make RNA-guided breaks in double-stranded DNA substrates, an activity essential for both bacterial immunity and genome editing. The best-studied of these enzymes, Cas12a, initiates DNA cutting by forming a 20-nucleotide R-loop in which the guide RNA displaces one strand of a double-helical DNA substrate, positioning the DNase active site for first-strand cleavage. However, crystal structures and biochemical data have not explained how the second strand is cut to complete the double-strand break. Here, we detect intrinsic instability in DNA flanking the RNA-3′ side of R-loops, which Cas12a can exploit to expose second-strand DNA for cutting. Interestingly, DNA flanking the RNA-5′ side of R-loops is not intrinsically unstable. This asymmetry in R-loop structure may explain the uniformity of guide RNA architecture and the single-active-site cleavage mechanism that are fundamental features of all type V CRISPR-Cas systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>genome editing</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>deoxyribonuclease</kwd><kwd>R-loop</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doudna Lab</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doudna</surname><given-names>Jennifer A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1817593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doudna</surname><given-names>Jennifer A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Kuriyan Lab</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuriyan</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cofsky</surname><given-names>Joshua C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The DNA flanks on either side of an R-loop differ in stability, and CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes form double-strand breaks by targeting the more unstable flank with their single DNase active site.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CRISPR-Cas systems (<underline>c</underline>lustered <underline>r</underline>egularly <underline>i</underline>nterspaced <underline>s</underline>hort <underline>p</underline>alindromic <underline>r</underline>epeats, <underline>C</underline>RISPR-<underline>as</underline>sociated proteins) provide antiviral immunity to prokaryotes through the RNA-guided nuclease activity of enzymes including Cas9 and Cas12a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>), which are widely used for programmable genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pickar-Oliver and Gersbach, 2019</xref>). Both Cas9 and Cas12a use CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to recognize matching double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sequences by forming an R-loop structure in which 20 nucleotides (nts) of the crRNA (the crRNA ‘spacer’) base pair with one strand of the target DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swarts et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, both protein families must bind to a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), a short DNA sequence next to the crRNA-complementary sequence, to initiate R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolotin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mojica et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sternberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of Cas12a and comparison of its DNA cleavage pathway to that of Cas9.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crystal structure of the DNA-bound Cas12a interference complex from <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> (FnCas12a, PDB 61IK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swarts and Jinek, 2019</xref>). While the protein ortholog used for most experiments in this manuscript is from <italic>Acidaminoccus species</italic> (AsCas12a,~40% identity to FnCas12a), the FnCas12a crystal structure shown here represents the most complete structure of such a complex to date, most notably with respect to the DNA at the target-strand cleavage sites. We did not perform any experiments with the particular DNA sequence used by Swarts and Jinek in crystallization, so the scissile phosphodiesters indicated were determined for a different sequence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1s6">Appendix 2—figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>) and superimposed onto the structural model according to their distance from the PAM (in terms of number of nucleotides). The discontinuity modeled into the non-target strand corresponds to positions of weak electron density in the crystal structure, which could have been due to some combination of disorder of the (intact) intervening tract and/or <italic>in crystallo</italic> hydrolysis and dissociation of the intervening tract. (<bold>B</bold>) For Cas12a, successful R-loop formation results in activation of the RuvC DNase active site to cleave three classes of DNA substrates (yellow scissors): the non-target strand (in <italic>cis</italic>), the target strand (in <italic>cis</italic>), and non-specific ssDNA (in <italic>trans</italic>).

Cas9 contains two DNase domains: the RuvC domain cleaves the non-target strand, and the HNH domain cleaves the target strand.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55143-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Despite their functional similarities, Cas9 and Cas12a evolved independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koonin et al., 2017</xref>) and use distinct mechanisms of DNA cleavage. Cas9 employs two active sites to generate a blunt DNA double-strand break near the PAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gasiunas et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, Cas12a uses a single active site to make staggered cuts distant from the PAM, and the same active site can cleave free single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) non-specifically once the enzyme has been activated by specific target binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swarts et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the position of the 20-nucleotide spacer sequence in Cas12a crRNAs is opposite to that in Cas9 crRNAs (3′ end versus 5′ end, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deltcheva et al., 2011</xref>), and consequently, R-loop formation by each enzyme family occurs with opposing directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Cas12a belongs to the type V family of CRISPR effector proteins (whose names each begin with ‘Cas12’), a classification defined by the presence of a single RuvC DNase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koonin et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, although this classification is not strictly phylogenetic—the ‘family’ is actually a paraphyletic assembly of several evolutionarily independent protein lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koonin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makarova et al., 2020</xref>)—a second shared feature of all Cas12 interference complexes is the previously mentioned spacer-3′ crRNA architecture. However, the reason for this evolutionary convergence is unknown. Furthermore, while structures of DNA-bound Cas12a are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swarts et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stella et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stella et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swarts and Jinek, 2019</xref>) and an obligatory order of strand cleavage has been suggested biochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swarts and Jinek, 2019</xref>), the mechanism by which type V CRISPR enzymes form double-strand breaks using one active site remains unclear.</p><p>The RuvC domain of Cas12a exhibits stringent specificity for single-stranded substrates when activated for cleavage of free DNA in <italic>trans</italic> (Appendix 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that substrates cleaved in <italic>cis</italic> (i.e., the two DNA strands of a protein-bound R-loop) are also single-stranded during each of their respective cleavage events. Consistent with this substrate preference, in the most complete crystal structures of the Cas12a-bound R-loop, displacement of the non-target strand (NTS) of the DNA allows its association with the RuvC active site as a single strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swarts et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swarts and Jinek, 2019</xref>). This conformation likely permits initial non-target-strand cleavage, which is a prerequisite of DNA target-strand (TS) cutting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swarts and Jinek, 2019</xref>).</p><p>However, in these same crystal structures, the target-strand cleavage site is located within an ordered DNA duplex outside the R-loop,~25 Å away from the RuvC active site and inverted with respect to the most probable catalytic orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swarts et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swarts and Jinek, 2019</xref>). To satisfy these geometric constraints and the RuvC substrate preference, the target strand likely needs to separate from the non-target strand and bend, accessing a conformation evoked by some structures of the type V CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas12b (C2c1) and Cas12e (CasX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). It has been hypothesized that contortion of the DNA substrate enables Cas12a (and other Cas12 family members) to cleave the target strand and complete its double-strand break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), but it is unknown what enables this contortion.</p><p>We show here that Cas12a cleaves the target strand within a tract of DNA that is destabilized by the adjacent R-loop. Using chemical and fluorescent probes to investigate DNA conformation in protein-bound and protein-free R-loops in solution, we find that DNA flanking the RNA-3′ side of the R-loop exhibits signatures of single-strandedness, despite this region’s potential for complete base pairing. The location of this DNA distortion controls the location of RuvC-catalyzed target-strand cleavage, suggesting that Cas12a exploits local duplex instability to complete its double-strand break. This cleavage mechanism is likely shared by other DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas12 systems, which all use a single RuvC active site to cut the target strand within the DNA tract flanking the RNA-3′ side of the R-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karvelis et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, we find that nucleotides flanking the RNA-5′ side of protein-free R-loops remain stably paired and stacked in solution. This fundamental asymmetry in nucleic acid structure offers a functional explanation for the puzzling convergence of type V CRISPR-Cas systems on the 5′-repeat-spacer-3′ crRNA orientation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cas12a binding to DNA distorts the target-strand cleavage site</title><p>We suspected that dsDNA substrates of Cas12a would need to access a bent conformation to undergo target-strand cleavage. To chemically probe the structure of a Cas12a substrate in solution, we performed DNA permanganate footprinting on interference complexes containing a RuvC-inactivated mutant of a Cas12a ortholog from <italic>Acidaminococcus species</italic> (AsCas12a), hereafter called dCas12a. In this assay, permanganate selectively oxidizes thymines in non-B-form (e.g., locally melted or otherwise distorted) DNA structures, and oxidized positions are subsequently identified through piperidine-catalyzed strand cleavage (which occurs specifically at thymidine glycols) and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bui et al., 2003</xref>).

Consistent with previous applications of the permanganate assay to CRISPR-Cas-generated R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>), thymines within the portion of the non-target strand displaced by the crRNA were heavily oxidized, reflecting the single-strandedness of this DNA tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The target-strand cleavage site becomes distorted upon R-loop formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Denaturing PAGE phosphorimages of piperidine-treated permanganate oxidation products, demonstrating the assay’s ability to detect non-B-form DNA conformations within and adjacent to a dCas12a-generated R-loop.

To probe the region around the target-strand cleavage site more thoroughly, we adjusted the sequence of the DNA substrate to contain a stretch of A/T base pairs in the tract immediately adjacent to the R-loop, which we denote the R-loop flank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We assessed the permanganate reactivity of the R-loop flank in three states of the Cas12a cleavage pathway: prior to Cas12a binding (apo DNA), after R-loop formation, and after the first set of cleavage events, which yield a 5-nt gap in the non-target strand (see Appendix 2 for details of the NTS gap). At each step, we observed an increase in permanganate reactivity on both strands of the DNA that persisted seven base pairs past the end of the crRNA, suggesting that Cas12a binding promotes distortion of DNA in the PAM-distal flank of the R-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, see Materials and methods).</p><p>In general, enhanced permanganate reactivity could reflect any of a variety of departures from B-form DNA duplex geometry, ranging from slight helical distortion to complete strand separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bui et al., 2003</xref>). As a result, the precise conformational ensemble of the R-loop flank cannot be absolutely determined from permanganate reactivity measurements. However, reactivity in the probed region was on the same order of magnitude as that of a fully single-stranded control, suggesting that the detected distortion involves substantial nucleobase unpairing and unstacking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, see Materials and methods). Additionally, permanganate reactivity decreased with distance from the R-loop edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), consistent with NTS:TS fraying events that initiate from the R-loop edge (see Materials and methods). The increase in bulk permanganate reactivity in response to NTS cleavage may be due, at least in part, to increased binding occupancy of dCas12a/crRNA on the DNA substrate, as the NTS gap creates a high-energy interruption in the DNA rewinding pathway that boosts the stability of the ribonucleoprotein:DNA interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knott et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, while the R-loop flank has the potential for complete base pairing, this DNA tract populates highly distorted, and probably unpaired, conformations when bound to Cas12a in solution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Distortion of the R-loop flank facilitates target-strand cleavage</title><p>DNA discontinuities as small as a nick or a single unpaired nucleotide are known to produce a ‘swivel-like’ point of flexibility within a duplex structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mills et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Cam et al., 1994</xref>). We wondered whether the DNA distortion detected in the Cas12a R-loop flank may permit the global substrate bending and repositioning that is likely required for target-strand cleavage. A prediction of this model is that a change in the location of duplex instability should also change which phosphodiester bonds in the target strand are cleaved by the RuvC DNase. To test this prediction, we investigated the effect of R-loop size on the target-strand cut-site distribution. We reasoned that if DNA strand separation occurs at the R-loop edge, the location of the R-loop edge must define which nucleotides become unpaired and, consequently, which bonds can be accessed by the RuvC active site.</p><p>We first assessed our ability to shift the site of duplex instability by measuring permanganate reactivity in a truncated R-loop. To create a truncated R-loop, we mutated the DNA base pairs at positions 19 and 20, allowing crRNA strand invasion to progress only to the 18<sup>th</sup> nucleotide of the target sequence (position numbers indicate distance from the PAM). Additionally, we used a pre-cleaved non-target strand to lock the substrate in the chemical state that exists immediately before target-strand cleavage (Appendix 2). Finally, we prevented NTS:TS base pairing in the PAM-proximal part of the DNA target sequence by mutating the non-target strand at positions 1–12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This modification eliminated the branch-migration-catalyzed DNA dissociation pathway, allowing for the formation of uniformly stable complexes irrespective of PAM-distal crRNA:TS mismatches that would otherwise modulate affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strohkendl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For each combination of crRNA/DNA target, crRNA was titrated in a solution with fixed [dAsCas12a] (400 nM), [DNA probe] (100 pM), and [non-specific DNA competitor] (500 nM). The identities of the titrant/fixed component were inverted in this experiment (as compared to all other binding experiments) because crRNA can form a stable complex with pre-unwound DNA targets in the absence of protein. Keeping [dAsCas12a] at 400 nM favored the formation of (dAsCas12a/crRNA):DNA complexes over crRNA:DNA complexes (which would be indistinguishable from free DNA in the filter binding assay). In the presence of high [apo protein], 500 nM non-specific DNA competitor (a duplex with a short ssDNA overhang) was also included to disfavor non-specific interactions between radiolabeled DNA and apo protein. The value of ‘fraction bound’ was 0 at [crRNA]=0 for all substrates (not shown due to the logarithmic x-axis). For all pre-unwound DNA targets, the fraction bound was essentially concentration-independent across all nonzero concentrations tested, suggesting that the lowest concentration tested had already saturated the specific binding interaction being probed.

We also observed this effect for a second set of crRNA/DNA sequences with equivalent base-pairing topology, demonstrating that this result is not unique to the originally tested sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Positions 19 and 20 of the DNA substrates were G/C base pairs, so DNA conformation at these nucleotides could not be assessed by permanganate reactivity. Nonetheless, these results show that nucleotide unpairing near the target-strand cleavage site depends not only on Cas12a binding and stable R-loop formation, but also on the extent of crRNA strand invasion (i.e., the size of the R-loop). Thus, by altering R-loop size, we can manipulate which nucleotides become unpaired upon Cas12a binding.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that distortion in the R-loop flank is linked to RuvC-mediated target-strand cleavage, we assembled wild type (WT) Cas12a with R-loops of various sizes and determined the distribution of target-strand cut sites. For these experiments, we used DNA substrates with an intact non-target strand that was mismatched with respect to the target strand throughout the region of crRNA complementarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; DNA constructs containing such a mismatched tract are indicated with an asterisk—for example, 1–18* indicates a DNA construct whose target-strand sequence matches the crRNA sequence at positions 1–18 and whose non-target-strand is mismatched with respect to the target strand at the same positions). Preventing NTS:TS base pairing in this region allowed observation of DNA cleavage in enzyme-substrate complexes that would otherwise be too unstable to yield detectable rates of catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strohkendl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>As the R-loop edge was shifted toward the PAM, the target-strand cut-site distribution shifted toward the new R-loop edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). When compensatory mutations were made in the crRNA to restore the original R-loop size, the target-strand cut sites moved back toward their original distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). The observed shifts in the cut sites were not due to general destabilization of the R-loop, as a single crRNA:TS mismatch at an internal position of the target sequence (position 9) slowed cleavage without affecting cut-site distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). The cut-site distribution shared by the 1–17*, 1–16*, and 1–15* substrates, along with the lack of cleavage of the 1–14* substrate, may reveal a geometric limit on bent DNA conformations that still permit active site association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, the broader target-strand cut-site distribution in the DNA target lacking NTS:TS mismatches (labeled ‘1–20’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) could reflect bending events that initiated from partially rewound R-loop conformations. Notably, the non-target-strand cut-site distribution did not change markedly as the R-loop was truncated, suggesting that non-target-strand cleavage is unrelated to nucleotide unpairing in the R-loop flank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). These results imply that the site of Cas12a-mediated target-strand cleavage is tied to, and perhaps dictated by, the location of weakened base pairing. Consistent with this idea, a previous study found a linkage between Cas12a cut-site distribution and nucleic acid conformation as measured by Förster resonance energy transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>These principles predict that R-loop flank sequences with greater nucleobase stacking energy should limit the depth of fraying and, consequently, favor target-strand cleavage events that are closer to the PAM. In agreement with this prediction, of three DNA targets that differed only in the sequence of their R-loop flank—native protospacer, AT-rich, or GC-rich—the GC-rich substrate was cleaved most PAM-proximally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additionally, eliminating NTS:TS base pairing at positions 21–23 led to fast and PAM-distally shifted cleavage of the target strand in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>).

We therefore asked whether the adjacent RNA:DNA hybrid protects or sensitizes the DNA:DNA terminus as compared to the RNA-free control. The naïve prediction is that a DNA duplex terminus should become more stable (i.e., less prone to end fraying) when another duplex is stacked on top of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Häse and Zacharias, 2016</xref>). It is thus surprising that the RNA oligonucleotide in this experiment sensitizes the DNA:DNA terminus to oxidation by permanganate. This result indicates that distortion of the R-loop flank is a phenomenon intrinsic to the R-loop boundary itself and that the protein only needs to hold the R-loop open to promote flexibility in the adjacent DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Duplex instability is not a feature of DNA in the RNA-5′ flank of R-loops</title><p>While Cas9 also conducts R-loop-dependent DNA cleavage, its R-loop topology is inverted with respect to that of Cas12a as a result of their opposing crRNA architectures—Cas12a crRNAs occur as 5′-repeat-spacer-3′, whereas Cas9 crRNAs occur as 5′-spacer-repeat-3′ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Given the instability of the Cas12a R-loop flank (referred to as a 3′ R-loop flank because it contains a 3′ RNA terminus), we wondered whether the PAM-distal flank of the Cas9 R-loop (a 5′ R-loop flank) would also be unstable.</p><p>To test this question, we assayed flank distortion in an R-loop created by a catalytically inactive mutant of Cas9 from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (dCas9) and in the corresponding protein-free mimic (the non-target strand was pre-cleaved analogously to a Cas12a substrate). Remarkably, we found that the flank experienced nearly background oxidation levels both in the protein-bound R-loop (with dCas9 at a saturating concentration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and in the protein-free mimic, suggesting that unlike 3′ R-loop flanks, 5′ R-loop flanks are not naturally unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The 5′ R-loop flank behaved consistently with expectations about coaxial duplex stacking, as the RNA oligonucleotide protected the DNA:DNA duplex terminus as compared to the bubbled control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, an RNA:DNA hybrid can either stabilize or destabilize a juxtaposed DNA:DNA duplex terminus, depending on whether the hybrid terminus contains a 5′ RNA end or a 3′ RNA end, respectively. These results suggest a fundamental energetic difference in the conformational landscapes of 3′ versus 5′ R-loop flanks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>The conformational difference between 3′ and 5′ R-loop flanks is intrinsic to strand polarity, as the trends in permanganate reactivity were robust to changes in nucleic acid sequence, end chemistry, and non-target-strand cleavage state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>). Additionally, we detected the same polarity dependence when we measured fluorescence intensity of a single 2-aminopurine nucleotide present at position 21 of the original protospacer sequence, indicating that the conformational difference is not an artifact of the permanganate reactivity assay or of the AT-rich sequence of the modified protospacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>).

Observation of large-scale conformational transitions relevant to Cas12a-mediated DNA cleavage, such as fraying or bending events, would likely require much longer simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leroy et al., 1988</xref>), but these short simulations suggest that the experimentally observed instability of 3′ R-loop flanks may arise from frequent unstacking events that comprise an early step in the DNA bending pathway. We speculate that different levels of interhelical stacking energy may emerge from certain sequence-independent features of the two duplexes juxtaposed in each type of R-loop boundary, such as helical geometry. The difference in the stacking equilibrium then leads to an unequal propensity for base pairing in the flanking DNA homoduplex.

Specifically, the ability of the Cas12a RuvC active site to capture the target strand may rely on the active site’s proximity to the uniquely malleable 3′ R-loop flank, which relies in turn upon the topology of the Cas12a R-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for the double-strand-break formation pathway of Cas12a and that of an analogous (hypothetical) enzyme with inverted R-loop topology.</title><p>Scissile DNA tracts are shown in yellow.

R-loops are common byproducts of transcription in eukaryotic genomes, and their dysregulation has been linked to a number of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crossley et al., 2019</xref>). It has been proposed that the mode of pathogenesis, in some cases, may emerge from the aberrant activity of general DNA repair nucleases on R-loop boundaries, whose scission leads to the formation of toxic double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sollier et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, in the earliest biochemical exploration of this process, purified XPG (a human DNA repair nuclease) and nuclease P1 (a secreted fungal nuclease commonly used to selectively degrade single-stranded nucleic acid structures) robustly cleaved a 3′ R-loop flank but left the 5′ R-loop flank largely untouched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tian and Alt, 2000</xref>). While this result was originally attributed to an idiosyncrasy of the tested sequence, our results suggest that the flank preference may have been polarity-dependent, not sequence-dependent. The experiments of Tian and Alt could represent an independent observation of the phenomenon dissected in the present work, implying that the asymmetric structure of R-loop boundaries may affect DNase sensitivity and genome stability in multiple domains of life.</p><p>Cas12a’s mode of dsDNA targeting contrasts with the established DNA cleavage mechanisms of other CRISPR interference complexes, which do not rely on instability in DNA flanking the R-loop. Cas9 forms R-loops with the topology that yields a stably base-paired PAM-distal R-loop flank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), but its second nuclease domain obviates the need to cleave outside the R-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In type I CRISPR interference complexes, which have the same R-loop topology as Cas12a, the single-strand-specific DNase Cas3 is used to nick the displaced portion of the non-target strand after R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Westra et al., 2012</xref>), similar to the initial non-target-strand nicking event in Cas12a. Cas3 eventually gains access to the PAM-proximal R-loop flank for processive DNA degradation, but, importantly, it uses an ATP-driven helicase to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mulepati and Bailey, 2013</xref>). Thus, DNA cleavage in the 3′ R-loop flank of the Cas12a interference complex seems to be a solution that maximizes the utility of its minimal enzymatic machinery.</p><p>Intriguingly, all known DNA-targeting Cas12 enzymes, which are taxonomically defined by their minimal enzymatic machinery (a single RuvC DNase domain), form R-loops of the topology that allows target-strand cleavage within a PAM-distal 3′ R-loop flank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karvelis et al., 2020</xref>) (for target-strand cleavage properties of Cas12i, see Appendix 2). Given the importance of DNA bending in enabling a single RuvC active site to form double-strand breaks, we propose that the universal type V R-loop topology may be the product of biophysically imposed selective pressures. If a single-DNase Cas enzyme were to form R-loops of the Cas9-like topology, the target strand would be cut, by analogy, within a 5′ R-loop flank. Our results indicate that 5′ R-loop flanks resist fraying and bending, which may lead to slower target-strand cleavage in the hypothetical topology-inverted enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We hypothesize that, under the strong evolutionary pressure for immune responses that efficiently produce double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heitman et al., 1999</xref>), ancestral enzymes with PAM-distal 3′ R-loop flanks outperformed topology-inverted variants, perhaps leading to the modern ubiquity of the Cas12a-like R-loop architecture in type V enzymes. Importantly, the extant diversity of Cas12 proteins likely did not emerge from a single CRISPR-associated ancestor but rather from many distinct transposon-encoded TnpB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koonin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makarova et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that several independent evolutionary trajectories have converged on the same R-loop topology.</p><p>While these evolutionary speculations cannot be experimentally verified at present, our findings also provide valuable mechanistic information that will support the development of Cas12-based genome manipulation technologies. For instance, it has been proposed that Cas12-family proteins could be used as RNA-guided DNA ‘nickases’ through selective removal of target-strand cleavage activity, but those nickases reported so far are catalytically inefficient and do not totally eliminate target-strand cutting (Appendix 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). Our permanganate reactivity results revealed that target-strand distortion in Cas12a-generated R-loops, as probed by our experimental techniques, can be explained by conformational dynamics intrinsic to the nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, engineering a type V CRISPR nickase that performs fast non-target-strand cleavage but undetectable target-strand cleavage will likely require modifications that shield or distance the RuvC active site from the intrinsically labile 3′ R-loop flank. Looking further ahead, if <italic>de novo</italic> design of Cas-like RNA-guided nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rauch et al., 2019</xref>) someday enters the realm of dsDNA-targeting, knowledge of the asymmetry in R-loop flank stability may be useful in tailoring the architecture of a designed enzyme to a specific application. Our results suggest that placing a DNase domain near a 3′ R-loop flank would encourage fast target-strand cleavage (for applications requiring double-strand breaks), while placing one near a 5′ R-loop flank would likely inhibit target-strand cleavage (for nickase applications). Complex engineering feats will become more attainable through continued investigation into the functional, structural, and evolutionary features of natural dsDNA-targeting CRISPR systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pMBP-AsCas12a expression plasmid</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al.

Double-stranded DNA templates for T7 RNA polymerase transcription were assembled from several overlapping DNA oligonucleotides (synthesized by IDT) by PCR. Transcription occurred in 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.9 at 25°C), 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 2 mM spermidine, with 5 mM of each NTP and 100 µg/mL T7 RNA polymerase. Transcription was allowed to proceed for 2.5 hr at 37°C. Cas9 sgRNAs were transcribed with a hammerhead ribozyme on the 5′ end to allow an arbitrary sequence on the 5′ end of the final sgRNA. Cas12a and Cas12i crRNAs were transcribed with a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme on the 3′ end to avoid the impurities associated with non-templated nucleotide addition in the final crRNA. 20-nt spacers used in R-loop mimics were transcribed with both a 5′-HHrz and a 3′-HDVrz. For those RNA transcripts that contained hammerhead ribozyme, which is prone to misfolding, an additional 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was added to the transcription products, and the reaction was placed on a thermocycler for iterative annealing ({80°C for 2 min, 37°C for 10 min} x 8, hold at 10°C). DNA in all transcription reactions was then digested with DNase I (RQ1 RNase-Free DNase, Promega) (0.05 U/µL, manufacturer’s units) for 30 min at 37°C. RNA fragments released by the ribozymes were then purified by denaturing PAGE (10% acrylamide:bis-acrylamide 29:1, 7 M urea, 0.5X TBE), ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in RNA storage buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.4).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Nucleic acid and interference complex preparation</title><p>All DNA oligonucleotides and some RNA oligonucleotides (as indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies.

A<sub>260</sub> was measured on a NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific), and concentration was estimated according to extinction coefficients determined by OligoCalc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kibbe, 2007</xref>). DNA substrates were annealed in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9 at 25°C, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA) by heating to 95°C and cooling to 25°C over the course of 40 min on a thermocycler. This annealing reaction was always performed with 40 nM radiolabeled DNA strand. When the DNA substrate comprised just two complementary strands, the unlabeled (complementary) strand was included in the annealing reaction at 80 nM. When the DNA substrate comprised more than two distinct strands, strands with the same sense as the radiolabeled strand were included at 80 nM, and strands complementary to the radiolabeled strand were included at 60 nM. For protein-free R-loop mimics, the RNA (or other spacer mimic) was included in the annealing reaction at 400 nM, to match the guide RNA concentration of a protein-containing experiment. The substrate concentrations reported in figure legends refer to the concentration of the radiolabeled strand. All crRNA and sgRNA molecules were annealed in RNA storage buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.4) prior to use (80°C for 1 min, then moved directly to ice). To form CRISPR surveillance complexes (Cas protein + guide RNA), crRNA or sgRNA was combined with Cas protein (both at 2X final concentration in 1X reaction buffer) and allowed to equilibrate for 5 min at 37°C. To form complete interference complexes (Cas protein + guide RNA + DNA target), 1 vol of 2X surveillance complex (in 1X reaction buffer) was combined with 1 vol of 2X DNA substrate (in 1X reaction buffer) and allowed to equilibrate for 5 min at 37°C (if applicable).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>DNA oligonucleotide radiolabeling</title><p>Standard 5′ radiolabeling was performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) at 0.2 U/µL (manufacturer’s units), 1X T4 PNK buffer (New England Biolabs), 400 nM DNA oligonucleotide, and 200 nM [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP (PerkinElmer) for 30 min at 37°C, followed by a 20-min heat-killing incubation at 65°C. Radiolabeled oligos were then buffer exchanged into water using a Microspin G-25 spin column (GE Healthcare). For 3′ radiolabeling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which was based on the mechanistic work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nandakumar and Shuman (2004)</xref>, the DNA oligonucleotide to be radiolabeled was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies with two modifications: the sugar moiety of the 3′-most nucleotide was a ribose, and the sugar moiety of the penultimate nucleotide was a 2′-O-methyl ribose. A ‘phosphate shuttle’ RNA oligonucleotide underwent a high-yield 5′-radiolabeling procedure (0.5 U/µL T4 PNK, 1X T4 PNK buffer, 1 µM RNA oligonucleotide, 500 nM [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP, 2 hr at 37°C, 20 min at 65°C, buffer exchanged into water). A T4 RNA ligase 2 substrate was then formed by hybridizing the phosphate shuttle (363 nM) and the DNA oligo to be radiolabeled (303 nM) to a ‘splint’ RNA (333 nM) in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9 at 25°C, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA) by heating to 95°C and cooling to 25°C over the course of 40 min on a thermocycler. T4 RNA ligase 2 (New England Biolabs) at 0.5 U/µL (manufacturer’s units), 1X T4 RNA ligase 2 reaction buffer, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> were added to this annealed structure. Ligation was allowed to proceed overnight at 37°C. The phosphate shuttle and splint RNA oligonucleotides were degraded by adding 150 mM NaOH and incubating at 95°C for 10 min. The degradation reaction was stopped by adding a stoichiometric amount of HCl and placing on ice. The 3′-radiolabeled DNA oligonucleotide was then buffer-exchanged into 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.9 at 25°C) using a Microspin G-25 spin column. This protocol has ~75% yield in terms of transfer of radioactivity from the phosphate shuttle RNA to the DNA oligonucleotide 3′ end.

DNase I (RQ1 RNase-Free DNase, Promega) digests were performed with radiolabeled DNA duplex and 0.01 U/µL enzyme (manufacturer’s units) in DNase buffer for 3 min at 37°C. AsCas12a digests were performed with single-stranded radiolabeled DNA oligonucleotide, 100 nM AsCas12a, 120 nM crRNA, and 50 nM pre-cleaved DNA activator in DNase buffer for 5 min at 37°C. T5 exonuclease (New England Biolabs) digests were performed with radiolabeled DNA duplex and 0.01 U/µL enzyme (manufacturer’s units) in DNase buffer for 10 min at 37°C. All reactions were stopped by addition of 1 vol 2X quench buffer (94% formamide, 30 mM EDTA, 0.025% w/v bromophenol blue).</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Steady-state Cas12a <italic>trans</italic> DNA cleavage kinetic analysis</title><p>Kinetics of ssDNA cleavage were assessed by monitoring the rate of dequenching of a fluorophore-DNA-quencher substrate, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al.

This metric is determined from the raw phosphorimages. It is an approximation of the absolute rate of oxidation at a given thymine, linearly normalized such that PRI = 1 describes a thymine that is fully single-stranded. Thus, a thymine with PRI = 0.4 is estimated to have been oxidized twice as fast as a thymine with PRI = 0.2.</p></list-item><list-item><p>‘Fraction oxidized in A/T tract’ (FO). This metric is a mathematical transformation/combination of the PRI of all thymines in the R-loop flank of a given DNA substrate. It is an approximation of the total fraction of DNA molecules (the two strands of DNA forming the R-loop flank are referred to here as a single ‘molecule’) that, at the moment of quenching, have been oxidized on at least one of the nine thymines within the R-loop flank.</p></list-item></list><p>While visually inspecting phosphorimages from permanganate experiments, note that there are occasionally faint bands corresponding to strand cleavage at cytosines (permanganate oxidizes cytosines, albeit much more slowly than thymines) and at purines (which occurs during hydroxide treatment in the 3′-radiolabeling protocol). Such bands constituted a trivial fraction of the total lane volume and did not meaningfully affect analysis.</p><p>Additionally, visual inspection of the raw phosphorimages can be informative but should be approached with caution because the absolute volume of a given band is meaningless without considering other bands that may have detracted from its signal. For example, a strongly oxidized thymine (thymine 1) may yield only a faint band if another strongly oxidized thymine (thymine 2) lies between thymine 1 and the radiolabeled terminus of the DNA oligonucleotide. If all thymine oxidation events are independent of each other (i.e., thymine 1 has the same oxidation probability irrespective of whether thymine 2, or any other thymine, has been oxidized or not), the oxidation probability of thymine 1 can be reconstructed by considering the thymine-1 band only as a subpopulation of the bands above it on the gel. In other words, out of all the DNA molecules on the gel for which oxidation of thymine 1 would have been observable (i.e., cleavage fragments <italic>at or above</italic> the thymine-1 fragment on the gel), what fraction of those molecules <italic>were</italic> in fact oxidized at thymine 1? In reality, clusters of thymines have been observed to mutually enhance oxidation probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nomura and Okamoto, 2008</xref>), so perfect independence <italic>cannot</italic> be assumed. Thus, the parameters described below are imperfect measures of the true rate of oxidation at each thymine.</p><p>Beyond uncertainty in the measurement, it is also unknown to what extent the probing technique is changing the fundamental biophysical features of the DNA structures. Notably, thymine’s reaction with permanganate breaks the planarity of the nucleobase and, consequently, its capacity to stack normally. In an A/T-rich sequence like our R-loop flank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), an oxidation event at thymine 1 could, in principle, begin a chain reaction of oxidation events as each adjacent thymine successively loses planarity and unstacks, exposing its neighbor to the oxidant. If such chain reactions occurred quickly as compared to the timescale of the assay (2 min), the distribution of band volumes would be skewed toward thymine 9. In reality, the band volume distributions are skewed sharply toward thymine 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that, on the assayed timescale, the majority of oxidation events do <italic>not</italic> lead to additional oxidation events. Still, the possibility of chain reactions should be kept in mind when interpreting the observed permanganate reactivity patterns, in which reactivity decreases with distance from the R-loop edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). While these patterns are consistent with fraying duplex termini, the apparent ‘depth’ of the fraying events should be interpreted as an upper limit on what would occur in a substrate unexposed to permanganate.</p><p>Finally, the structural determinants of permanganate reactivity should be considered carefully when using these data to draw conclusions about DNA conformation. While high permanganate reactivity is often associated with ‘single-strandedness’ or ‘lack of base pairing,’ the reaction is more precisely dependent upon the ability of a permanganate molecule to approach the C5=C6 bond of the thymine nucleobase. This approach could be facilitated by assumption of a non-B-form helical geometry, global melting of the DNA duplex, or ‘flipping’ of a thymine out of the duplex without dramatically affecting the helical geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bui et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, a thymine lying on a duplex terminus could, in principle, be approached and attacked while base paired, albeit from a restricted angle. This possibility is especially important to consider for thymine 1 of our A/T-rich R-loop flank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The reactivity of this thymine varies in RNA-free DNA bubble controls that have different bubble sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), perhaps reflecting differences in the propensities of individual (unpaired) neighboring bases to stack on the duplex-terminal thymine. Finally, because thymines within the RNA:DNA hybrid of R-loop structures have two possible base pairing partners (DNA versus crRNA), the conformational ensemble at these positions is highly complex, and we did not attempt to draw any structural conclusions from their oxidation rates.</p><p>Given the aforementioned caveats, the PRI and FO metrics described below should be interpreted as estimates rather than accurate measurements of rate and extent of reaction. Additionally, permanganate reactivity data should be considered alongside the orthogonal techniques used in this work to assess the structure, energetics, and conformational dynamics of interhelical junctions. The definitions of permanganate reactivity index (PRI) and fraction oxidized (FO) are as follows:</p><p>Let <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> denote the volume of band <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> in a lane with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> total bands (band 1 is the shortest cleavage fragment, band <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the topmost band corresponding to the starting/uncleaved DNA oligonucleotide).

rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), we wanted to probe the strength and mechanism of this specificity, which could lend insight into the enzyme-substrate conformations that permit <italic>cis</italic> cleavage. For example, does <italic>trans</italic>-active Cas12a only cut DNA substrates that are completely single-stranded, or will it also cut small distortions in dsDNA, as has been observed for S1 nuclease, an unrelated DNase with reported specificity for single-stranded substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiegand et al., 1975</xref>)? To compare the substrate range of Cas12a RuvC to that of S1 nuclease, we tested the susceptibility of various radiolabeled DNA structures (including a single strand, a duplex, a nicked duplex, and duplexes with gaps, bubbles, and bulges) to cleavage by the two enzymes, used at concentrations with comparable activity. In contrast to S1 nuclease, which exhibited minimal discrimination against even the fully duplex substrate, Cas12a discriminated strongly against substrates with up to 8-nt tracts of non-duplex DNA. This stringent substrate preference suggests that non-ssDNA structures are either sterically excluded from the RuvC active site or unable to assume catalytic geometry once bound. However, strand discontinuities as small as a nick were sufficient to permit low levels of internal strand cleavage by Cas12a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1s1">Appendix 1—figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To precisely determine the location of Cas12a-catalyzed NTS cleavage, we monitored the formation of DNA cleavage products over time by denaturing PAGE, and we distinguished between different DNA fragments by placing radiolabels on the 5′ or 3′ end of each strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1s1">Appendix 2—figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Data were fit to an exponential decay (y = (y<sub>0</sub>-plateau)*exp(-k*x)+plateau), with y<sub>0</sub> constrained to 0. At the lower values of [AsCas12a], an early plateau indicates an underestimation of the true enzyme concentration, due to loss of enzyme across extensive serial dilution. Despite this experimental deficiency, these data show that enzyme-substrate association is not rate-limiting when [AsCas12a] is 100 nM—that is, when [AsCas12a] is 100 nM, association can be approximated as instantaneous, and cleavage rate constants reflect unimolecular processes that follow binding.

This <italic>trans</italic> cleavage rate estimate is an upper limit because radiolabeled DNA is mostly duplex and likely protected by the protein in non-duplex regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swarts et al., 2017</xref>).

Substitution of calcium for magnesium in the reaction buffer produced a 13-fold increase in the RuvC DNase’s selectivity for phosphodiester over phosphorothioate linkages, allowing us to effectively halt expansion of a defined gap size in the NTS while simultaneously measuring cleavage of a fully phosphodiester-linked TS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2s2">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Importantly, slow TS cleavage activity was coupled to slow NTS cleavage activity for both AsCas12a R1226A and Cas12i1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2s8">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>), suggesting that slow TS cleavage emerges mostly from low overall catalytic efficiency. While this low efficiency could be explained by weak target association for Cas12i1, which exhibited no detectable DNA binding activity in our filter-binding assay, the affinity of AsCas12a R1226A for DNA was unimpaired as compared to WT AsCas12a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2s9">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>). Still, both enzymes exhibited k<sub>TS</sub>:k<sub>NTS</sub> ratios lower than that of WT AsCas12a, suggesting that there may also be more fundamental differences in their DNA cleavage pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Specifically, we wondered whether these enzymes were able to form non-target-strand gaps. To test this question, we began by performing cleavage site mapping on the NTS of AsCas12a R1226A. At the 1-hr timepoint, the 5′- and 3′-mapped cut-site distributions contained significant overlap, suggestive of a population of DNA strands containing either a single nick or a small gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2s10">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>). In contrast, at the 5-s timepoint of the NTS mapping experiments for WT AsCas12a, the two distributions were almost completely non-overlapping, having already developed peaks at the major cut sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2s10">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>). Because the 1-hr timepoint for AsCas12a R1226A and the 5-s timepoint for WT AsCas12a have similar values (~70%) of total NTS cleavage (an unambiguous measure of the fraction of molecules that have experienced at least one cut), the difference in distributions implies a fundamental difference across the two enzymes in terms of their relative rates of NTS nicking and trimming (i.e., R1226A has a lower ratio of k<sub>trim</sub>:k<sub>nick</sub> than WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2s10">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>).</p><p>To more directly probe the kinetic contribution of NTS trimming activity, we measured the rate of AsCas12a R1226A TS cleavage in an interference complex with a pre-gapped NTS. The observed TS cleavage rate in this complex was 40-fold higher than in the one with an intact NTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that the physical basis for the disproportionately slow TS cleavage kinetics of AsCas12a R1226A actually lies in disproportionate slowing of a step prior to TS cleavage (i.e., NTS gap formation). Gap-widening cleavage events may be slower than the initial nicking event in this mutant due to the high entropic cost of associating a severed strand with the active site, as nicking of the NTS is expected to boost its conformational freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Similarly to Cas12a, Cas12i1-mediated TS cleavage depends upon NTS cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2s1">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, cleavage-site mapping for Cas12i1 revealed that a NTS gap had already formed at the earliest timepoints for which cleavage was detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2s11">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 11</xref>). Additionally, Cas12i1-mediated TS cleavage could be only slightly accelerated by pre-gapping the NTS, indicating that NTS trimming is not rate-limiting for TS cleavage in Cas12i1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2s8">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). These results suggest that across diverse families of type V interference complexes, the microscopic steps of double-strand break formation can vary in absolute rate and relative kinetic breakdown.</p><p>Still, while both AsCas12a R1226A and Cas12i1 exhibit k<sub>NTS</sub>:k<sub>TS</sub> ratios favorable for ‘nickase’ applications, their use may be limited by their low NTS cleavage rate, which is 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>3</sup> times slower than that of WT AsCas12a under the tested conditions. Thus, Cas9 remains the tool of choice for generating RNA-guided nicks in either DNA strand because each of its DNase domains can be independently inactivated by point mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55143.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Bailey</surname><given-names>Scott</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Ke</surname><given-names>Ailong</given-names> </name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Malcolm F</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of St Andrews</institution><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper answers the puzzling question of how does a RNA guided CRISPR nuclease with a single active site (Cas12a) efficiently cleave both strands of its substrate DNA, an important question given Cas12a's use in gene editing? When Cas12a binds DNA the target strand base pairs with the guide RNA and the non-target strand is displaced forming an R-loop structure. It was found that this R-loop structure specifically destabilizes the double-stranded DNA 3' of the R-loop and that Cas12a the exploits this destabilized DNA to cut the second strand.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CRISPR-Cas12a exploits R-loop asymmetry to form double-strand breaks&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ailong Ke (Reviewer #1); Malcolm F White (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Cofsky et al. explores the mechanistic details underlying the poorly understood second strand cleavage catalysed by Cas12a – a type V CRISPR effector complex with a single RuvC active site. The crux of the question is to gain a molecular understanding for the observed activity of Cas12a, which cleaves the non-target strand and then the distorted target strand in the same active site. This question lies at the heart of the utility of Cas12a for genome engineering by targeted DSB formation.</p><p>The authors first use the classical method of Permanganate probing to assess the propensity of DNA bound by dCas12a to adopt a single stranded structure, identifying a region 3' of the R-loop that has a ss nature – an area coincident with the target site for Cas12a cleavage (Figure 2). They go on to demonstrate that the position of the R-loop junction dictates the site of target strand cleavage by Cas12a (Figure 3), and that R-loops specifically destabilise 3' R-loop flanks in a protein independent manner (Figure 4). This remarkable observation is confirmed using model nucleic acid structures (dumbbells), and appears to be due to differences in interhelical stacking (Figure 5).</p><p>Overall, this study reveals significant differences in the stability of R-loop:DNA junctions, irrespective of protein. On the one hand, this is a very interesting observation that could have widespread implications in nucleic acid biology. On the other, it remains unproven that the fundamental stability differences observed here have strong implications for the mechanism of Cas12a, as the data shown correlation but not necessarily a causative link between DNA junction stability and target strand cleavage. After all, nucleases such as Cas12a are quite capable of using binding energy to manipulate nucleic acid substrates to a remarkable degree, and the Cas12a second strand cleavage reaction requires considerable more than merely fraying of the R-loop junction.</p><p>That said, this is an interesting manuscript presenting a number of carefully designed experiments that yield some important new data with potentially wide relevance. The significance of the work is discussed in a thoughtful way and the paper will represent an impactful contribution to the field. We propose an essential revision that does not require new experiments.</p><p>Essential revision:</p><p>Section about &quot;difference in interhelical stacking energy may underlie asymmetric R-loop flank stability&quot;: Here the authors &quot;hypothesize that the asymmetry may emerge from energetic differences in the coaxial stacking of a DNA homoduplex on either end of an RNA:DNA hybrid&quot;, which got me lost. The authors refer to crystal structures of the Cas12a/R-loop structure in the 2019 Swarts and Jinek paper (PDB 6I1K and 6I1L). 6I1K best depicts the Cas12a/R-loop, however, the PAM-distal DNA duplex is not coaxially stacked underneath the DNA/RNA hybrid in the structure, it is rotated 180° to the side. I am not sure whether the discussion in this section and the molecular dynamics simulations in Figure 5 can directly explain the fraying propensity in PAM-distal DNA. Perhaps the authors should consider the possibility that the twisting of the backbone at the R-loop junction drives the DNA unwinding, which involves base-flipping in a sequential fashion from the junction of the R-loop. This rotation may be easier from the 3'-end of the R-loop because the backbone has a higher degree of rotation freedom, which means lower energetic barrier.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55143.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Overall, this study reveals significant differences in the stability of R-loop:DNA junctions, irrespective of protein.

To clarify the main point of this section, we have removed the discussion of the crystal structures flagged by the reviewer. We have also removed some of the more detailed discussion at the end of this section that, retrospectively, seems extraneous to the main point. We thank the reviewer for identifying the weaknesses in this section, and we hope our changes have clarified our point.</p><p>Relationship of fraying propensity and stacking energy:</p><p>– Fraying is expected to occur more readily from a duplex terminus that is not stacked on top of another duplex (Häse and Zacharias, 2016). Therefore, interhelical junctions that spend less time in a stacked conformation (i.e., those with weaker stacking energy) are likely to exhibit a greater degree of fraying from each constituent duplex.</p><p>Alternative explanations for the observed DNA fraying behavior:</p><p>– There could be several explanations for the difference in fraying propensity at the two boundary types, and the “stacking energy hypothesis” presented in this manuscript is just one hypothesis that is supported by our experiments and simulations. We have added a sentence to the end of this section to indicate to the reader the level of certainty that we can currently attribute to our hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
