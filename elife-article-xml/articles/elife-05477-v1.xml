process that may lead to diseases like necrotizing enterocolitis. Thus, spread of potential pathogens among hospitalized infants is of great concern. Here, we reconstructed hundreds of high-quality genomes of microorganisms that colonized co-hospitalized premature infants, assessed their metabolic potential, and tracked them over time to evaluate bacterial strain dispersal among infants. We compared microbial communities in infants who did and did not develop necrotizing enterocolitis. Surprisingly, while potentially pathogenic bacteria of the same species colonized many infants, our genome-resolved analysis revealed that strains colonizing each baby were typically distinct. In particular, no strain was common to all infants who developed necrotizing enterocolitis. The paucity of shared gut colonizers suggests the existence of significant barriers to the spread of bacteria among infants. Importantly, we demonstrate that strain-resolved comprehensive community analysis can be accomplished on potentially medically relevant time scales.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05477.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05477.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05477.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The spread of potentially harmful bacteria is a major source of disease in patients staying in hospitals. Premature babies—born before 37 weeks of pregnancy—can be particularly vulnerable to these infections because their organs may not yet be fully developed. Also, young babies do not have the fully established populations of beneficial microbes that help to protect us from dangerous bacteria.</p><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis—a life-threatening disease that can cause portions of the bowel to die—is mostly seen in extremely premature babies. Although it is not known what causes this serious condition, research has suggested that a contagious microbe may be responsible.</p><p>The development of methods that can sequence DNA from whole communities of microbes, known as metagenomics, allows researchers to identify the presence of individual strains of bacteria within these communities. This makes it possible to compare and contrast the strains of bacteria present in both diseased and healthy individuals, to help identify the bacteria responsible for a disease.</p><p>Here, Raveh-Sadka et al. used a metagenomics approach to study the communities of microbes present in premature babies in a hospital unit during an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis. The study found that very few bacterial strains were present in more than one baby, suggesting that bacterial strains are not readily transferred between the babies while they are in the hospital. Furthermore, Raveh-Sadka et al. reveal that no single bacterial strain was shared among all the babies who developed necrotizing enterocolitis.</p><p>These findings indicate that necrotizing enterocolitis is not caused by a single strain of bacterium. Instead, if bacteria do contribute to the disease, it maybe that it is caused by a variety of potentially harmful bacteria colonizing the gut at the cost of beneficial bacteria.

However, the spread of bacteria among patients is hard to track because most methods cannot distinguish between closely related strains. Strain transmission is especially important during colonization of newborns, a process that is critical for proper development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrieta et al., 2014</xref>). Premature infants, in particular, are highly susceptible to aberrant colonization, as their microbiome is often disrupted by antibiotic treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenwood et al., 2014</xref>) and since the source of colonists likely includes the hospital environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taft et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a common and life-threatening gastrointestinal disease that primarily affects hospitalized premature infants. Recent data indicate that ∼7% of infants born weighing &lt;1.5 kg develop NEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neu and Walker, 2011</xref>). Various observations support a microbial role in NEC, including the high incidence of pneumatosis intestinalis (gas in the bowel wall) in affected infants and resolution of symptoms in a majority of patients after antibiotic therapy and bowel rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grave et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morowitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlisle and Morowitz, 2013</xref>). NEC is characterized by intestinal inflammation and commonly progresses to necrosis, sepsis, and death. Risk factors may include feeding with artificial infant formula, blood transfusion, infant genetics, and overall health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mally et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schnabl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neu and Walker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan-Huen et al., 2013</xref>). Such factors might be expected to give rise to a fairly constant disease incidence rate. However, NEC is commonly reported to occur in outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boccia et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meinzen-Derr et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting involvement of a contagious microorganism. A review of 17 published outbreaks of NEC did not identify a reproducible pattern of bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boccia et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Cultivation-based approaches to identify and track medically relevant organisms can be labor intensive, biased, and inefficient. Yet, sequencing of the genomes of these cultured organisms can distinguish between strains with divergent phenotypes such as antibiotic susceptibility and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Didelot et al., 2012</xref>), and has enabled analysis of pathogen dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Köser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Snitkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2013</xref>). An alternative approach uses 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify organisms without cultivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taft et al., 2014</xref>), but the taxonomic resolution is limited, and distinct strains cannot be differentiated or tracked. Nonetheless, the method has been used to compare gut bacterial populations in fecal samples from infants with and without NEC. The results have been inconclusive. Some studies have identified no differences between cases and controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Normann et al., 2013</xref>), while others have reported positive, but divergent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mshvildadze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morrow et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, whole community DNA sequencing methods (metagenomics) can profile microbial communities with strain resolution and probe the metabolic potential of community members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tyson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuczynski et al., 2012</xref>). Applied to series of samples, the approach can document shifts in community structure and identify responses to medical treatments, increasing age, altered diet, and changing health status. Unlike 16S rRNA gene surveys, metagenomics does not rely on previously established information (e.g. conserved sequences that guide PCR-based rRNA-based detection) and is less likely to miss community members (e.g. organisms with unusual rRNA sequences, phage, and plasmids). Compared to cultivation-based methods, the metagenomic approach provides a relatively unbiased view of community composition and thus may be particularly helpful when an unknown microorganism is the cause of a disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Relman, 2011</xref>). A year ago, the power of such an approach was demonstrated in a retrospective analysis of banked samples from patients affected during a 2011 outbreak of a severe diarrheal illness caused by Shiga-toxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loman et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, shotgun sequencing of bacterial DNA present within cerebrospinal fluid enabled the diagnosis and treatment of leptospirosis in a critically ill child with meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Among gastrointestinal diseases with a possible microbial origin, NEC is somewhat unique as it is relatively common and because samples that provide information about gut consortia can be collected prior to the development of symptoms. This is because infants at risk for NEC are typically hospitalized for weeks to months in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and onset of the disease occurs over a defined time period. Only one small study that we are aware of has analyzed metagenomic sequence data from infants with and without NEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claud et al., 2013</xref>), but assembly of the sequences was not attempted.</p><p>Recently, a group of infants developed NEC over a short time period in the NICU of Magee-Womens Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Here, we investigated the degree to which specific microbial strains were shared among co-hospitalized infants and whether the disease could be attributed to a single infectious agent. Because the analysis required confirmation that the same strain was present in multiple infants, we deployed a genome-resolved sequencing-based approach. Our analyses included consideration of the fastest evolving features of genomes (e.g. prophage and the CRISPR/Cas loci) to maximize strain resolution. We also investigated strain-level metabolic potential and evaluated population heterogeneity for one abundant and widespread species. Genome-resolved approaches are typically slow and bioinformatics intensive because the data sizes are massive, simultaneous reconstruction of genomes for multiple community members is complex, and comparative and metabolic analyses for hundreds of genomes are challenging. We applied a new analysis system to resolve data into genomes and analyze the metabolic potential. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to provide comprehensive, genome-resolved analysis of gut bacterial communities in co-hospitalized patients. The core methods are fast enough to make them useful in some clinical settings, and we anticipate that analysis time can be substantially decreased with future developments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clinical information regarding study subjects and the NEC cluster</title><p>When it became apparent that the incidence of NEC was increasing, we selected five infants who had developed NEC and five controls for comprehensive microbial community analysis. Ultimately, during the summer of 2014, nine infants were diagnosed with NEC (Bell's stage II or III). The total number of NEC cases was 10, as one of the affected infants developed recurrent NEC. This incidence rate was 2.5 times higher than average for this NICU.</p><p>For affected infants #2 (who developed NEC twice), #3, and #8, multiple fecal samples collected prior to the onset of symptoms were available. Two additional infants, #9 (not premature) and #10, were enrolled after diagnosis and treatment. The other infants who developed NEC were not enrolled in our study. Four infants (#1, #4, #6, and #7) did not develop NEC. Infant #5 was not diagnosed with NEC but had a single bloody stool on day of life (DOL) 20 and was treated with antibiotics for a suspected urinary tract infection. All infants were hospitalized concurrently within the same NICU (i.e. synchronous controls), and several were matched also according to gestational age. The selection of samples for sequencing was aimed to provide dense sampling around diagnosed NEC cases, from both the diagnosed infants as well as co-hospitalized infants who did not develop NEC (see sampling schedule in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and additional medical details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Bacterial load in each sample was quantified by ddPCR (see ‘Materials and methods’ section). The estimated load was in general agreement with previous measurements in full-term infants of similar postnatal ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Leoz et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, the variation in the number of microbes per gram feces did not exceed a 100-fold across all samples. Infants who developed NEC did not show a consistent trend of change in bacterial load prior to or following diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05477.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the sampling of infants affected by necrotizing enterocolitis (red) and controls (blue) and microbial cell loads based on droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) quantification of fecal samples.</title><p>For ddPCR, standard deviations for triplicates are plotted within each data point.

Genome completeness and purity were evaluated based on the inventory of ribosomal proteins and 51 genes expected to be in single copy in any genome (see ‘Materials and methods’ section for details).</p><p>A total of 509 bacterial genomes (including multiple genomes for the same organism in different samples) were recovered, with average read coverage of between 2 and 1148. Between 1 and 23 bacterial genome bins were detected per sample, and overall 260 near-complete genomes were reconstructed (see ‘Materials and methods’ section). Scaffolds identified as putative phage or plasmids based on their encoded genes were assigned to 328 bins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Both of these regions were missing from the genome recovered from infant #9, sample 1 and thus could not be discovered by read mapping to that genome.

However, investigation of population-level sequence variation revealed some reads with shared polymorphisms that are not characteristic of the strains in the other infants. This, and the detection of the dominant strain from infants #2 and #7 in other infants indicate that multiple <italic>E. faecalis</italic> inoculation events occur during colonization.</p><p>The lack of overlap in strain genotype could indicate the existence of infant-specific strain sources (e.g. mothers), and barriers that prevent spread of those populations to other infants in the NICU. Even if dispersal occurs, the founding population may preclude establishment of later introduced populations. Alternatively, strains could be dispersing freely, and strain dominance could reflect strong selection in the gastrointestinal tract (possibly imposed by microbial community context and/or human genetics) leading to the establishment of a single, most adapted strain. Another model worth considering would involve stochastic acquisition of a strain from a set of populations that is so large that it is improbable that any two infants would initially acquire the same strain. As there is ongoing input of strains over the colonization period, the observation of one (usually) highly dominant population still suggests some barrier to establishment of other populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Phylum-level community composition does not distinguish NEC cases from other infants</title><p>Previous studies that were done at lower resolution than achieved in the current study have pointed to a high abundance of Proteobacteria as a factor in NEC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Torrazza et al., 2013</xref>).

Infants who were not diagnosed with NEC were likewise colonized by a wide variety of potentially pathogenic bacteria and some strains were even shared by NEC cases and controls. If gut colonization by pathogenic bacteria is a significant factor in the development of NEC, other health and/or environmental attributes may ultimately determine which infants become sick. Due to the small number of cases studied to date and the large number of potentially important variables, a reliable model that predicts NEC development without over-fitting cannot be constructed at this point.

To consider the possibility that a mobile element, moving around the NICU (potentially independently of the host bacterium), was the common factor leading to NEC, we compared all sequences from all samples that were binned as plasmid-like, phage or phage-like, or of unknown origin. We commonly found essentially identical sequences in different samples from the same infant and a few identical plasmids and phage were detected in different infants (e.g. one complete, circular plasmid from infant #6 that is affiliated with a <italic>Clostridium</italic> species, based on sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), also occurs in infants #5 and #8). However, no mobile elements were shared by all sick infants, or by all infants diagnosed with NEC (see ‘Materials and methods’ section).</p><p>We leveraged the fact that some bacteria have CRISPR loci to determine whether bacteria colonizing the gastrointestinal tract of newborns have CRISPR-Cas-conferred immunity to co-occurring phage. This is important because phage sensitivity could explain rapid shifts in organism abundance. Our analyses focused on <italic>E. faecalis</italic> because it was abundant and widely distributed over the infant cohort.

Sequence assembly, annotation, and data import into our metagenomics analysis system required 6–8 hr/sample and the time required for a first round binning that largely defined community composition and metabolic potential (generated automatically) was ∼10 to ∼60 min/sample. ESOM-based bin confirmation (which may not be needed for some applications) requires 1–2 hr/sample. Thus, new bioinformatics approaches tested here enable comprehensive genome-based analyses on a timescale that approaches that required for some clinical applications, for example involving patients with long-term health issues. The analysis time will decrease as sequencing technologies continue to improve and with automation of binning steps. This will make strain-resolved analysis clinically relevant for a wider range of applications, potentially including acute illnesses like NEC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We applied newly developed methods to rapidly and extensively resolve into genomes, sequence data from gastrointestinal tract-associated microbial communities from premature infants. All microbial communities in all infants sampled prior to onset of NEC harbored organisms with significant pathogenicity potential. However, we found no evidence for one common, abundant (or even minor) genomically distinct infective agent. If bacteria contribute to NEC, the effect more likely is due to exposure to a variety of potentially dangerous hospital-associated bacteria. A major finding is that the dominant population of each bacterium acquired by each infant was generally genotypically distinct. Extremely closely related organisms were only identified in a handful of cases, and occurred in both sick and healthy infants. Yet, the fact that they were identified at all, and the detection of shared minor strains of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in a few cases, confirms that dispersal can occur among infants in the NICU. Overall, we suspect the existence of significant barriers that limit establishment of strains during the early stages of colonization of the premature infant gastrointestinal tract.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Medical information</title><p>Fecal samples for enrolled infants were collected as available.

The rRNA genes were predicted using Infernal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nawrocki and Eddy, 2013</xref>) and tRNAs using tRNAscan_SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lowe and Eddy, 1997</xref>) (v1.23-r2; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/">http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/</ext-link>). Scaffolds, gene predictions, and all associated annotations were uploaded to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ggKbase.berkeley.edu">ggKbase.berkeley.edu</ext-link> for binning and analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ggkbase.berkeley.edu/project_groups/necevent_samples">http://ggkbase.berkeley.edu/project_groups/necevent_samples</ext-link>).</p><p>We estimated detection sensitivity for bacterial populations using the data size per sample and assuming a genome size of ∼3 Mbp. For example, the sample with the least amount of data was from infant #4, sample 4 (2 Gbp). This amount of data would allow detection (4× coverage) of an organism with a 3 Mbp genome that comprised 0.6% of the sample.</p><p>Evaluation of genome completeness relied in part on the number of expected single copy genes that were identified per bin. A bin was classified as very good if the genome size was not vastly different from that of genomes of closely related organisms and most single copy genes were present in one, and only one copy. The accuracy of our genome completeness statistics was somewhat affected by genes that were split by scaffold ends. Partial genes (&lt;50% of the gene) were not counted.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Phylogenetic profile</title><p>As the accuracy of binning depended in part on the quality of the phylogenetic profile, we tested two approaches. First, we inventoried the best matches of proteins on each scaffold by comparison to the UniRef100 database. As this did not provide sufficient taxonomic resolution, we adopted a second approach in which the profiles were established by comparison to the much larger UniProt database. In both cases, the phylogenic classification required that ≥50% of predicted proteins on a fragment had shared affiliation at some taxonomic level. If ≥50% of predicted proteins had best matches to the same species in the database, that scaffold was profiled as that species. If ≥50% had best matches to the same genus (but not the same species), the profile assigned was of that genus. This process continued, until each scaffold had been assigned a profile at some taxonomic level. Some scaffolds were assigned the profile ‘unknown’ because ≤50% of predicted proteins had hits to the same domain (these scaffolds were often from viruses and plasmids).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Binning</title><p>Binning was carried out via an online interface within ggKbase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ggkbase.berkeley.edu/">http://ggkbase.berkeley.edu/</ext-link>). When using this interface, the user selects a group of genome fragments (scaffolds) based on a specific phylogenetic profile, and/or scaffold coverage and/or GC information. The amount of sequence information, the number of expected single copy genes, the number of ribosomal proteins, and bin coverage statistics are displayed for the selection. For human microbiome research, usually the choice of scaffolds is first based on phylogenetic profile and is then fine-tuned by selection of a specific subset of scaffolds based on their coverage and/or GC content. If the bin size and single copy gene inventory are appropriate, the group of scaffolds is then binned. Following one round of binning (10–60 min/sample), typically ∼1 Mb of sequence information per sample was left unassigned to any organism or phage/plasmid.</p><p>Typically, the identity of genomically sampled organisms was determined based on overall sequence similarity to previously known genomes. In many cases we reconstructed partial or complete 16S rRNA genes and used this sequence information to inform organism classifications, although the presence of these genes in multiple copies often resulted in misbinning of small scaffolds encoding this gene (see notes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). An advantage of the presence of multiple copies of the 16S rRNA gene per genome is that it can allow us to detect populations that are otherwise at such low abundance that they would be invisible based on their overall genome coverage. The 16S rRNA scaffolds were the only parts of some very low abundance genomes detected for this reason.</p><p>The correctness of the assignment of scaffolds to genomes was verified with emergent self organizing maps (ESOMs), a clustering tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ultsch and Moerchen, 2005</xref>) that was applied to scaffold tetranucleotide frequency information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dick et al., 2009</xref>). In most cases, data points assigned to the same bin clustered into clearly defined and generally strongly bounded regions of ESOMs, supporting the accuracy of the binning method. Some bin adjustments were made based on the ESOM analyses.</p><p>When the approach described above was insufficient to resolve bins for closely related species/strains (e.g. Enterobacteriales in infant #8), we constructed ESOMs using patterns of abundance of the organisms over the time series of samples from an infant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharon et al., 2013</xref>), in combination with GC content. This led from minor to substantial improvements in bin purity and completeness.</p><p>Up to eight near-complete genomes (≥94% of expected single copy genes identified) were reconstructed per sample, and 221 near-complete genomes were reconstructed over the study. This accounting under-represents the completeness of the analysis because the presence of multiple highly related Enterobacteriales genotypes in many samples resulted in partial and fragmented recovery of specific conserved ribosomal proteins. When including Enterobacteriales genomes of the expected size but lacking these specific ribosomal proteins, 260 near-complete genomes were reconstructed.</p><p>Rank abundance curves were constructed based on coverage. For this analysis, coverage values were normalized to account for differences in data size per sample.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Comparative genomic analysis</title><p>Strain comparison was done for genomes with &gt;0.5 Mbp of recovered sequences, and was mostly based on alignment of sequences for 51 predicted single copy genes, many of which were ribosomal proteins. For cases with inconclusive results, mostly due to highly fragmented or very partial genomes in which many of these genes were missing, entire genome bins were aligned. In a few cases, mostly when verification of very small differences was required, manual curation of results based on inspection of read mapping to the regions in question was performed to detect local mis-assemblies.</p><sec id="s3-6-1"><title>Alignment of single copy genes</title><p>To avoid detection of false differences based on local scaffolding errors, predicted single copy genes with one or more base pairs that were not covered by at least one perfectly matching read, or, in which &gt;50% of mapped reads did not agree with the assembled sequence, were removed from analysis. Split genes were also removed from analysis, to avoid errors introduced at the scaffolding step.</p><p>Pairs of genomes with the same species assignment, and with at least 20 single copy genes that passed filtering were compared to each other by aligning the assembled gene sequences using nucmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delcher et al., 2002</xref>). Genome pairs that shared at least five single copy genes that passed filtering and for which all shared single copy genes were identical across their length were considered to be the same strain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-2"><title>Alignment of genome bins</title><p>Genome bins were aligned using nucmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delcher et al., 2002</xref>). The number of base pairs in alignments with over 98% identity was tallied (a higher identity threshold was not used in order to take into account occasional local scaffolding errors). If over 90% of bin length (for the shorter genome bin) was aligned using this threshold, the genomes were considered indistinguishable.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-3"><title>Strain comparison via read mapping</title><p>For <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and <italic>C. paraputrificum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), strains were compared by mapping reads from different samples to specific scaffolds. Multiple alignment of the consensus sequences resulting from each mapping provided a detailed view of SNPs and indel regions while avoiding false differences resulting from partial assemblies or from assembly and scaffolding errors. Mapping was done using bowtie2 and multiple alignment was done using default parameters for the MAFFT algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katoh et al., 2002</xref>) implemented in Geneious v7.1.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kearse et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-4"><title>Detailed whole genome comparisons</title><p>In a few cases (comparison of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> genomes in infants #3 and #5, and in infants #2 and #7 as well as comparison of <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> to the CDC317 isolate), a more detailed whole genome comparison was performed in order to locate sequence regions that were not shared between strains.</p><p>Mauve genome alignment software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darling et al., 2010</xref>) was used to perform pairwise comparisons of strains of the same species assembled from different babies.

Stretches of DNA in one of the genomes that could not be aligned to the other genome (termed ‘islands’) were extracted. Stringent post-processing steps were taken to filter out islands that could have resulted from missing or problematic segments in the assembly rather than actual differences in genomic sequence. Islands whose sequence was dominated by Ns (assembly gaps) were removed from further analysis. Islands that were very close (&lt;100 bp) to scaffold edges or islands whose flanking regions mapped to two different scaffolds in the other genome, could have resulted from missing assemblies, and were therefore disregarded. To verify suspected islands, reads from samples of both babies were mapped to the island sequence and manually inspected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Single copy gene and CRISPR locus analyses</title><p>Geneious software v7.1.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kearse et al., 2012</xref>) was used to align individual single copy gene sequences and for manual curation of the CRISPR loci.

The curation used programs for correcting mis-assemblies and improving assemblies (Sharon et al., in preparation), which were identified through read mapping as follows. First, all reads were mapped to the genomes using bowtie2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v9/n4/full/nmeth.1923.html">http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v9/n4/full/nmeth.1923.html</ext-link>) with the --sensitive option. Next, short deletions (which we found to be common in idba-ud assemblies) in the assembled sequences were identified based on the read mappings. Last, all regions on the genomes with exceptionally low coverage were checked by collecting reads that map to those regions and their mate pairs and re-assembling them. Improvement of assemblies was achieved through read-mapping based identification of scaffolds that could be elongated or connected to other scaffolds. Both elongations and connections were achieved through local assembly of reads that were mapped to the analyzed regions and their mate pairs. For the <italic>Candida</italic> genome, our pipeline corrected 106 mis-assemblies (about one mis-assembly for every 120 Kbp) and reduced the number of scaffolds from 401 to 348.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Droplet digital PCR methods</title><p>To quantify bacterial load in infant fecal samples, ddPCR was performed on the Bio-Rad QX200 platform using EvaGreen-based chemistry (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). A conserved, approximately 150 bp region flanking the V7 region of the 16S rRNA gene was targeted, as it has been successfully used in other probe-based qPCR assays in the past (1048f: GTGSTGCAYGGYYGTCGTCA, 1194r: ACGTCRTCCMCNCCTTCCTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ramirez-Farias et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>]). Sample gDNA was diluted to 1:1000 and used as template in a PCR reaction consisting of 0.25 µl of 10 µM forward and reverse primer, 12.5 µl of 2× ddPCR EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad), and 12 µl of template, totaling 25 µl. This PCR mix was used to create droplets following the manufacture's instructions. Thermocycling parameters were: (1) 95°C for 10 min, (2) 95°C for 30 s, (3) 61°C for 30 s, (4) 72°C for 30 s, (5) 40 cycles (go to steps 2–4 ×39), (6) 98°C for 10 min, and (7) 12°C forever. All ramp rates were at 2.5°C/s. Each reaction was done in triplicate. Analysis of the ddPCR data was conducted with the QuantaSoft software package (Bio-Rad) and negative/positive thresholds set manually (just above the negative population). To calculate cell density, the copies/µl output from QuantaSoft was normalized by grams of fecal mass used for each gDNA extraction reaction. To broadly correct for copy number, the assumption of four copies per bacteria was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hospodsky et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Data dissemination</title><p>The sequence information can be accessed via NCBI, accession # SRP052967.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor), Roberto Kolter (Reviewing editor), and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>You present your work detailing the microbiota of the feces in premature infants with and without necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) using metagenomic methods. Overall we found that the findings presented are a very important contribution to the field. While the fact that the authors did not find of any commonality of microorganisms that contribute to NEC is somewhat disappointing, the finding of the unique microbiota at a strain level for most infants in this study will shape the way scientists and physicians will think about disease pathogenesis and gut colonization in these infants.</p><p>The manuscript presents a large amount of important work, but they are currently presented as a loose compilation of findings. As it stands, one comes away feeling that less has been accomplished than is actually the case. Thus, the authors should make every effort to revise the written presentation so as to generate a text that flows better and makes a compelling case for the importance of the findings, despite the current lack of a common thread leading to NEC. In revising the text, the authors should pay particular attention to responding the following major concerns, some of which ask for analyses that may indeed provide interesting insights:</p><p>1) What were the strain level differences between closely related taxa? The suggested reasons for the high level of unique diversity between infants are compelling, but we would like to understand how different these strains are? Are we talking major rearrangements, or SNP variance? Even with partial to near-complete fragments the authors should be able to start to think about this. This would help to narrow down which of the several possibilities provided by the team are likely. Do any of the differences seem likely to have occurred due to local niche differentiation as a result of host genetics? Might it be possible to generate a figure that shows, perhaps by alignment, the degree of similarity between the different strains of the same species between different infant guts?</p><p>2) While there is no particular suite of taxa that are always present with NEC, is it possible that Random Forest could be used to determine the predictive potential of a subset of genomic strains for NEC, or other health statistics that were also collected?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not well explained in the manuscript. While it is useful to see an actual timeline with the dates of the samples, the authors don't really make a correlation between bacteria per gram of feces and anything else in the manuscript. Also, there should be some text in the manuscript detailing the time points sampled for these infants.</p><p>4) The authors’ method is presented as a two-week protocol and authors claim that this is 'clinically relevant time scale.' However, in the case of NEC, 12-14 days is in fact not clinically relevant. Neither the time frame nor the amount of labor involved in producing these types of results can be considered clinically relevant. There is the possibility of the current analyses to be eventually modified to become useful in clinical practice, but that would require considerable modifications. The authors do not provide any description as to how the protocols would have to be modified to actually make them clinically relevant, as two weeks for a diagnostic test for NEC would be of no utility in the diagnosis or treatment of these patients. Thus, the authors should revise the manuscript to indicate that their current protocols are in fact not really clinically relevant and that modifications would have to be developed to be useful in diagnostics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05477.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) What were the strain level differences between closely related taxa?

We have added a new figure and figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>) that provide a visualization of differences between strains for <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (a highly prevalent species) and <italic>Clostridium paraputrificum</italic> (one of the rare species in which one genotype was shared among some of the infants). Differences were visualized by mapping reads from various samples from which different strains were recovered to a specific scaffold from one of these assemblies, and constructing a multiple alignment of the consensus sequences derived from each mapping. In the case of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> we selected a 1 Mbp scaffold recovered from infant 9 and constituting a third of the genome. This view shows that most differences can be attributed to SNP and small indels, but that those are present throughout the sequence (∼90% identity for most strain pairs in the multiple alignment), suggesting that most sequence pairs did not diverge very recently. A few larger indel regions (20-30 Kbp) were detected and contained among other things a sucrose metabolism operon, mobile elements and genes related to Fe-S protein biogenesis. However, some strains (specifically two pairs of strains, the one in infants #3 and early samples of infant #5, and the one in infants #2 and #7) were much more similar to each other, with very few detected differences across the compared sequence. Judging by the small extent of differences and their type (e.g., a prophage insertion in infants #2 and #7), it is possible that differentiation between those closely related strains occurred very recently, perhaps even within the host, though not necessarily due to host genetics.</p><p><italic>2) While there is no particular suite of taxa that are always present with NEC, is it possible that Random Forest could be used to determine the predictive potential of a subset of genomic strains for NEC</italic>, <italic>or other health statistics that were also collected?</italic></p><p>While a predictive model is definitely a holy grail in the study of NEC, given the small number of studied cases so far and the large number of potentially contributing factors, a reliable model that predicts NEC development without over-fitting cannot be constructed at this point. However, accumulation of similar data may ultimately enable the construction of such models. We are in the process of acquiring additional data, and hope that we will be able to present such models in the future. Presently however, we would like to note that current data does not show any strong correlation between NEC and any of the health statistics collected. We now discuss this issue in the main text.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>is not well explained in the manuscript.

Discussion of these results was inadvertently left out. We now discuss the strategy for the sampling schedule shown in this figure. In addition, we note that quantification of the bacterial load in each sample was in general agreement with previous measurements in full-term infants of similar postnatal ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Leoz et al. 2014</xref>), and that the measured variation in the number of microbes per gram feces did not exceed a 100 fold across all samples. Finally, we state that we did not observe a consistent trend of change in bacterial load prior to or following diagnosis of NEC.</p><p><italic>4) The authors’ method is presented as a two-week protocol and authors claim that this is 'clinically relevant time scale.'

When we referred to clinical relevance, we meant to suggest that this timescale could be relevant in other, less acute, clinical situations where long-term health problems are involved. In the future, as technology and algorithm improvement significantly reduce these timescales, this type of analyses could be made possible also for real-time management of acute illnesses like NEC. We have now clarified this in the text, and we hope that the reviewers will find our re-phrasing of this section satisfactory.</p></body></sub-article></article>
