transport to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). CRISPRi genetic interaction analysis revealed Retro-2 activity resembles disruption of the transmembrane domain recognition complex (TRC) pathway, which mediates post-translational ER-targeting and insertion of tail-anchored (TA) proteins, including SNAREs required for retrograde transport. Cell-based and in vitro assays show that Retro-2 blocks delivery of newly-synthesized TA-proteins to the ER-targeting factor ASNA1 (TRC40). An ASNA1 point mutant identified using CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis abolishes both the cytoprotective effect of Retro-2 against ricin and its inhibitory effect on ASNA1-mediated ER-targeting. Together, our work explains how Retro-2 prevents retrograde trafficking of toxins by inhibiting TA-protein targeting, describes a general CRISPR strategy for predicting the MOA of small molecules, and paves the way for drugging the TRC pathway to treat broad classes of viruses known to be inhibited by Retro-2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>Retro-2</kwd><kwd>TRC pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2HD084069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassik</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HG000044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgens</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM127136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denic</surname><given-names>Vladimir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-114747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgens</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name><name><surname>Handy</surname><given-names>Emma L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1656518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavertu</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using a suite of CRISPR technologies, unique chemical tools, and carefully designed biochemical and cell biological assays, we define the mechanism of action of Retro-2, an inhibitor of retrograde toxins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells destroy many endocytosed pathogens by targeting them to the lysosome. The plant toxin ricin, however, evades this fate by being sorted into early endosome-derived vesicles destined for fusion with the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Following further retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ricin retrotranslocates into the cytosol where it catalytically disables ribosomes, halting translation and killing the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crispin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sandvig and van Deurs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lord et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johannes and Popoff, 2008</xref>). A high-throughput screen of small molecules first identified Retro-2 as an inhibitor of ricin and Shiga-like toxins that halts their retrograde progression to the ER by trapping them in the early endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stechmann et al., 2010</xref>). Remarkably, Retro-2 was able to rescue mice from lethal doses of ricin and was tolerated at high doses. Subsequent studies of the bioactive cyclic derivative of Retro-2 (hereafter Retro-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>) and its analogs have also revealed the ability of these compounds to interfere with infection of papillomaviruses (such as HPV16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lipovsky et al., 2013</xref>) and polyomaviruses (such as JCPyV, BKPyV, and simian virus 40) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>), which are known to rely on retrograde transport during infection.</p><p>While the mechanism of action (MOA) of Retro-2 is not well understood, Retro-2 has been shown to affect the localization of Syntaxin 5 (STX5) and less acutely Syntaxin 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stechmann et al., 2010</xref>). STX5 – a target-SNARE – is required for fusion of retrograde vesicles with the TGN, and knockdown of its expression is sufficient to trap ricin in the early endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amessou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dascher and Balch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suga et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Norlin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 1993</xref>). Most SNAREs like STX5 are tail-anchored (TA) proteins – a class of membrane proteins with a single, C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) that are post-translationally targeted to the ER for insertion by the transmembrane domain recognition complex (TRC) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hegde and Keenan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denic, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, our previous genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 deletions screens have identified STX5 and its ER targeting factor, ASNA1 (also known as TRC40) among the top hits that confer resistance to ricin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morgens et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A variety of genetic approaches have been used in mammalian cells to successfully define the MOA of novel small molecules with therapeutic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Alvear et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matheny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jost and Weissman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deans et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pabon et al., 2018</xref>). In yeast, novel small molecules have been studied by measuring the extent to which the small molecule phenotypes are modified by the presence of a defined, single mutation across the yeast genome. The resulting compound’s genetic profile is analogous to a gene’s genetic profile, obtained by measuring a particular gene’s mutant phenotype in the presence of many second mutations. Remarkably, the genetic profile of the compound often resembles the genetic profile of the compound’s target, allowing for target identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giaever et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parsons et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parsons et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hillenmeyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costanzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoepfner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wildenhain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simpkins et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we developed a conceptually analogous genetic profiling approach in mammalian cells and applied it to Retro-2. Analysis of single and paired-gene CRISPRi screens revealed a robust link between Retro-2 and TA protein biogenesis mediated by the TRC pathway. Flow cytometry and quantitative cell microscopy showed that both <italic>ASNA1</italic> gene deletion and Retro-2 treatment resulted in destabilization of a fluorescent TA protein reporter and decreased abundance of endogenous STX5 at the Golgi. Targeted mutagenesis of the ASNA1 genomic locus using a dCas9-AID*Δ fusion (CRISPR-X) identified a point mutation that conferred resistance to Retro-2 in both ricin cytoprotection and fluorescent reporter assays. Finally, using biochemical reconstitution approaches, we demonstrated that Retro-2 obstructed TA protein delivery to the ER targeting factor ASNA1 (TRC40), and this activity was blocked by the resistant mutation in ASNA1. Collectively, these findings support a model in which Retro-2 directly inhibits ASNA1, leading to inefficient ER targeting of TRC pathway clients such as STX5, which ultimately prevents retrograde trafficking of ricin and protects the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic profiling reveals that Retro-2 treatment resembles TRC pathway inhibition</title><p>Previously, potential drug targets have been defined in yeast by looking for correlations between the chemical-genetic profile of a drug and that of its target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giaever et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parsons et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parsons et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hillenmeyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costanzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoepfner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wildenhain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simpkins et al., 2018</xref>).

Using our previously established paired-guide platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2017</xref>), we constructed a library containing CRISPRi guides targeting 105 × 105 pairs of genes with three guides per gene. We chose 100 of these genes based on having the strongest effect on the activity of Retro-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Since ASNA1 was one of the top genes in this unbiased group, we also included an additional five genes comprising four additional TRC pathway components (GET4, WRB, CAMLG, and SGTA) and STX5, a TRC pathway substrate that has been shown to relocalize following Retro-2 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stechmann et al., 2010</xref>). Following installation of this library into K562 cells expressing dCas9-KRAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>), we grew the pool of infected cells in replicate in the presence or absence of ricin and monitored the phenotype of the double knockdowns by comparing the enrichment of paired guides between conditions using casTLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morgens et al., 2016</xref>). For each of the 105 genes included, these double phenotypes represent a genetic profile that we compared to the genetic profile of Retro-2 measured in the single-guide CRISPRi screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>); this allowed us to identify genes whose knockdown most closely resemble Retro-2 treatment.</p><p>The genes whose genetic profile correlated most strongly with the profile of Retro-2 were WRB, STX5, SGTA, and GET4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source datas 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">4</xref>). Notably, the genetic profiles of ASNA1 and CAMLG were uninformative (and did not correlate with Retro-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>); this is likely because the guides targeting these genes individually had extremely protective ricin phenotypes (independent of the second guide), suggesting either that their phenotypes cannot be modified or the variance is outside the dynamic range of this experiment. Regardless, our analysis revealed that Retro-2 treatment closely resembles genetic perturbation of the TRC pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). On the basis of this finding, we hypothesized that Retro-2 protects cells against ricin by inhibiting the TRC pathway, thus interfering with ER targeting and insertion of TA proteins, including the SNARE STX5. This would lead to protection against ricin by disrupting the toxin’s retrograde transport to the ER. We proceeded to test three predictions of this model: 1) Retro-2 treatment should disrupt biogenesis of TRC pathway substrates, 2) mutations in the relevant TRC pathway component should confer resistance to Retro-2, and 3) Retro-2 should disrupt a specific step along the TRC pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Retro-2 inhibits targeting of newly-synthesized TRC pathway substrates</title><p>To test whether Retro-2 disrupts the biogenesis of TRC pathway substrates, we exploited the molecular triage decision that channels newly-synthesized TA proteins that are not efficiently delivered to ASNA1 to degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shao et al., 2017</xref>). To examine if Retro-2 induces this form of TA protein instability, we adapted an established approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>) by constructing a doxycycline (dox)-inducible cassette expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) linked by a self-cleaving P2A peptide to a red fluorescent protein (RFP) fused to the C-terminal SEC61B TMD sequence (GFP-2A-RFP-SEC61B<sub>TMD</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We focused on ASNA1 for several reasons. First, ASNA1 is the only TRC pathway component known to interact with small molecules as an ATPase enzyme. Second, we noted that ASNA1 knockdown sensitizes cells to growth inhibition by high concentrations of Retro-2 even in the absence of ricin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and that high doses of DHQZ36.1 are toxic to cell growth even in wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Along with our previous result that ASNA1 is an essential gene for cell growth in CRISPR/Cas9 screens in K562 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morgens et al., 2017</xref>), these observations suggested that the toxicity of Retro-2 and DHQZ36.1 may be mediated by strong inhibition of ASNA1. We used this toxicity to select for ASNA1 alleles resistant to growth inhibition by DHQZ36.1 by first randomly mutagenizing the ASNA1 coding region with CRISPR-directed diversification. Here, a library of sgRNAs tiling the ASNA1 coding region was lentivirally infected into a K562 cell line stably expressing an N-terminal, dCas9-AID*Δ fusion (CRISPR-X) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hess et al., 2016</xref>), which results in a high frequency of diverse point mutations at the genomic locus being targeted.

We thus hypothesized that DHQZ36.1 interferes with TA protein delivery to ASNA1 from SGTA. This could explain our in vitro observation of the accumulation of another crosslinked adduct in the presence of DHQZ36.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C,D</xref>) that based on its molecular weight and native interaction with BAG6, could result from enhanced substrate crosslinking to GET4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mariappan et al., 2010</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we used an established in vitro assay with entirely purified components, including the close zebrafish homolog of ASNA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shao et al., 2017</xref>). Following in vitro translation of STX5<sub>TMD</sub> in the presence of recombinant SGTA in the <italic>E. coli</italic> PURE system, we isolated SGTA-bound to STX5<sub>TMD</sub> by sucrose fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Crosslinking analysis revealed robust formation of ASNA1×STX5<sub>TMD</sub> adducts that were dependent on addition of the scaffold complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, the presence of DHQZ36.1 but not its biologically inactive derivative DHQZ5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carney et al., 2014</xref>) obstructed STX5<sub>TMD</sub>, as well as SEC61Β, delivery to ASNA1 under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Finally, we analyzed the effect of the zebrafish ASNA1 A143V mutation, which corresponds to the human ASNA1 A149V mutation that confers Retro-2 resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). While SEC61B was transferred efficiently to ASNA1 A143V, we no longer observed inhibition of ASNA1×TA protein adducts by addition of DHQZ36.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Based on similarities between their genetic profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we hypothesized that Retro-2 acts via inhibition of TRC pathway members. Our subsequent findings provide three supporting lines of evidence for this model. First, DHQZ36.1 inhibits transfer of TA proteins from SGTA to ASNA1 in a biochemically defined system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Second, Retro-2 and DHQZ36.1 prevent the insertion of newly-synthesized TA protein reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Third, an ASNA1 mutation prevents four distinct forms of Retro-2/DHQZ36.1 activity: cytoprotection against ricin, inhibition of growth, ASNA1 substrate destabilization associated with ER targeting disruption, and inhibition of assisted substrate transfer from SGTA to ASNA1.</p><p>Our Retro-2 mechanism of action model also provides a satisfying explanation for two previous observations. First, Retro-2 treatment interferes with STX5 localization to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stechmann et al., 2010</xref>), which can now be understood as an expected consequence of ASNA1 inhibition. Second, both Retro-2 treatment and ASNA1 knockout reduce insulin content and induce ER stress in isolated mouse islet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Norlin et al., 2016</xref>). Our work lends a unifying mechanistic explanation for this phenotypic commonality. Beyond this, determining in greater detail how Retro-2 blocks the pre-targeting step of the TRC pathway is an important future goal. Intriguingly, mapping of our top ASNA1 resistance allele onto the structure of yeast Get3 revealed its location within Helix 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). These structural elements appear to have an allosteric role in stimulating ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mateja et al., 2009</xref>) and warrant an enzymatic analysis of the effects of Retro-2 on ASNA1 during the pre-targeting step.</p><p>The ability of Retro-2 to inhibit the TRC pathway and disrupt STX5 may be sufficient to explain its protective activity against ricin and other toxins and viruses that similarly rely on retrograde trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lipovsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maru et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nonnenmacher et al., 2015</xref>). However, retrograde trafficking has not been implicated in the life cycles of many Retro-2-sensitive viruses and endocytic pathogens such as human cytomegalovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruz et al., 2017</xref>), filoviruses such as Marburg and Ebola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shtanko et al., 2018</xref>), Vaccinia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sivan et al., 2016</xref>), chlamydia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herweg et al., 2016</xref>), leishmania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Craig et al., 2017</xref>), and enteroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2017</xref>). In those instances, we speculate that either functions of STX5 beyond retrograde trafficking or other clients of the TRC pathway are responsible for the protective activity of Retro-2. In addition, our work provides impetus to examine the efficacy of Retro-2 against viruses such as Herpes simplex virus 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ott et al., 2016</xref>), Epstein-Barr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horst et al., 2011</xref>), and human papillomavirus 6 and 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sullivan and Coscoy, 2010</xref>), which are known to depend on the TRC pathway.</p><p>In our paired-gene CRISPRi strategy, the top four genes were all members of the TRC pathway. The fifth gene was SRP54, a factor that plays an analogous role to ASNA1 in the co-translational ER protein targeting pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We have found no evidence, however, that Retro-2 affects co-translational ER protein targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). While very low levels of interaction between TA proteins and SRP54 have been detected in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007</xref>), a wealth of evidence demonstrates that the SRP pathway does not mediate TA protein insertion under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kutay et al., 1995</xref>). Nonetheless, SRP54 is capable of efficiently recognizing a TA protein TMD sequence when the latter is artificially presented to it during protein translation by the ribosome. Thus, the genetic profile of SRP54 possibly reflects disruption of the TRC pathway by post-translational engagement with TMD regions of orphaned SRP clients in SRP54 knockdown cells.</p><p>Together, our work demonstrates the use of paired-gene CRISPR screening technology in mammalian cells to translate the chemical-genetic signature of Retro-2 into a testable model for its MOA that explains its ability to protect cells against ricin. Additionally, it illustrates a powerful and generalizable approach for model validation by targeted genomic mutagenesis of an MOA candidate using dCas9-targeted AID (CRISPR-X). Together, this combination of technologies charters a new path for direct mechanistic dissection of novel compounds in human cells. Finally, this study defines the first known chemical inhibitor of the TRC pathway and could be an impetus for pharmaceutical efforts to drug this pathway as a therapy against diverse viruses and pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and cell lines</title><p>Cell culture was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deans et al., 2016</xref>).

By comparing the genetic interaction profiles of Retro-2 to paired shRNA knockdowns, the authors find that Retro-2 action most resembles impairment of the TRC pathway for tail-anchored protein insertion. They use a focused mutagenesis strategy to identify and validate a resistance allele in ASNA1 (TRC40), further implicating the TRC pathway.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study has investigated the mechanism of action of the small molecule Retro-2 (and a related analog) in protecting cells from intoxication by ricin and shiga toxins by inhibiting retrograde trafficking from the early endosome to the ER (Stechmann et al., 2010). By comparing the genetic interaction profiles of Retro-2 to paired shRNA knockdowns, the authors find that the Retro-2 genetic profile resembles the profiles seen with impairment of the TRC pathway for tail-anchored protein insertion. They use a focused mutagenesis strategy to identify a resistance allele in ASNA1 (TRC40), further implicating the TRC pathway. Finally, reconstitution of the early steps of the TRC pathway shows that Retro-2 directly impairs substrate loading onto ASNA1/TRC40. Because trafficking pathways are indirectly impacted by TRC pathway impairment, and trafficking is a key requirement for Ricin toxicity, the authors suggest that Retro-2 acts by altering the levels of TA proteins (most notably STX5) needed for ricin trafficking. The methods are of potential general use in identifying the mechanism and/or target of small molecules, and the biochemical data showing that the TRC pathway can be inhibited by Retro-2 is well supported. However, the study does not yet make a sufficiently strong argument for the more important conclusion that TRC pathway inhibition (and particularly ASNA1/TRC40) is the decisive target by which Retro-2 protects from ricin toxicity. While the identification of Retro-2 as an inhibitor of the TRC pathway is a noteworthy advance, the study would need to provide stronger evidence for two of the study's key conclusions before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>: (i) that the effect on the TRC pathway is the primary basis for ricin protection; (ii) that ASNA1/TRC40 is likely to be the direct target. The following suggestions are offered to achieve this goal, in addition to a number of less central but potentially helpful suggestions for improvement.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Stechmann et al. previously showed that Retro-2 acts rapidly (within 30-60 minutes) to promote STX5 delocalization (and protection of cells from ricin), without inducing STX5 degradation. The speed of this effect and the absence of STX5 degradation would seem to be at odds with the proposed mechanism of action in the current study, which requires pre-existing STX5 to turn over concurrently with a biogenesis defect in STX5. Given that STX5 is a top hit in the chemical genetic screen, it seems that a major part of the effect of Retro-2 operates via STX5, so it is important to resolve the above discrepancy. The authors should test whether Retro-2 can delocalize a pre-existing pool of STX5, which might suggest an alternative (or additional) mechanism of action. Furthermore, the authors should directly determine whether endogenous STX5 is degraded upon treatment with Retro-2 (as predicted from their reporter assays) and whether this degradation occurs with a time course consistent with the observed time course of protection from ricin. These analyses are important in establishing a tighter correlation between the effect of Retro-2 on the TRC pathway and the effect on retrograde trafficking that is thought to underlie its protection from ricin. Finally, although it might not work for many reasons, the authors' case would be very strong if a Retro-2 resistant version of STX5 (e.g., by converting it into an ASNA1-independent substrate as in Figure 2B) could reverse the protective effect of Retro-2. This would effectively show that the key effect of Retro-2 is to inhibit ASNA1-dependent insertion of STX5.</p><p>2) A key part of the argument that the TRC pathway, and particularly ASNA1, is the functional target for Retro-2 is the discovery of a resistance allele of ASNA1. However, the cells with this resistance allele are not well characterized and the resistance phenotype is only cursorily examined. To rectify this problem, the authors should provide the following information: (i) whether the knock-in cells are clonal, whether they are heterozygous or homozygous with respect to the mutant allele, and whether resistance is observed in both cases; (ii) the steady-state expression level of A149V relative to WT ASNA1 in their cell lines; (iii) dose-response curves of Retro-2, DHQZ5, and DHQZ36.1 in assays of proliferation, ricin protection, and effect on the TA reporter(s) to more quantitatively characterize the extent to which the A149V ASNA1 mutation confers resistance. The concern here is that the resistance seen with A149V is due to a relatively trivial consequence of this mutant protein being mostly non-functional.</p><p>3) Related to the concern raised in point 2, the authors need to better characterize how the A149V mutation confers resistance to Retro-2. Ideally, the authors would measure the binding affinity of Retro-2, DHQZ5, and DHQZ36.1 for WT and A149V ASNA1. In the absence of a direct binding assay (which is acknowledged to be challenging and possibly not feasible in the context of this study), the authors should test whether A149V ASNA1 is resistant to DHQZ36.1 in the biochemical assay used in Figure 5D, E. In particular, it is critical to determine whether A149V ASNA1 is functional with respect to substrate binding, whether it promotes TA insertion, and whether its capacity to mediate ATP hydrolysis is retained. Demonstration that A149V mutant ASNA1 is functional but resistant to the effects of Retro-2 would help to strengthen the authors' case that this mutation is a true resistance allele.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48434.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Stechmann et al. previously showed that Retro-2 acts rapidly (within 30-60 minutes) to promote STX5 delocalization (and protection of cells from ricin), without inducing STX5 degradation.

We find that at relevant timepoints and doses, we observe no significant protective activity of Retro-2 in the presence of the A149V allele (Figure 4—figure supplement 2D). We think this is the most convincing demonstration that Retro-2 activity goes through ASNA1. While we cannot definitively comment on the acute effects of Retro-2 observed by Stechmann et al. within 30 minutes, we think the fact that our ASNA1 mutant prevents the growth effects and ricin protection of Retro-2 suggests that either (1) the acute phenotypes previously observed should also be dependent on ASNA1 activity (for example, through an acute stress response) or (2) if there is an additional STX5-dependent, ASNA1-independent activity, it is likely not relevant to for ricin protection.</p><p>We also note that since we observe effects of the Retro-2 analog DHQZ36.1 in a defined in vitro system using SEC61B as a substrate in the absence of STX5 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F), we have established that there is a STX5-independent activity of Retro-2 analogs. In sum, we believe that Retro-2 is very unlikely to act directly on STX5 (i.e. outside of its time as a TRC pathway client) as part of its ricin protection mechanism.</p><p>The reviewers also request to see the effects of Retro-2 on endogenous STX5 to complement our reporter assays. As noted, the original publication of Retro-2 reported no changes in total STX5 levels upon Retro-2 treatment, and our preliminary results also indicate no changes as measured by Western blot to total STX5 upon Retro-2 treatment or knockdown of ASNA1 in the timeframes examined here (data not included). Our microscopy staining for endogenous STX5 (Figure 3), in contrast, shows a dramatic loss of endogenous STX5 staining with either Retro-2 treatment or ASNA1 knockdown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A key part of the argument that the TRC pathway, and particularly ASNA1, is the functional target for Retro-2 is the discovery of a resistance allele of ASNA1.

The concern here is that the resistance seen with A149V is due to a relatively trivial consequence of this mutant protein being mostly non-functional.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising these concerns about the resistance allele of ASNA1. We now present additional experiments both in cells and in the reconstituted system to further establish that the A149V allele remains functional.</p><p>Our original manuscript demonstrated the activity of the A149V mutant in a mixed population (Figure 4D), which contained wildtype, A149V, and knockout copies of ASNA1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). As the ASNA1 locus in K562 cells is triploid, this pool contained many different genotypes. Our results indicated that the pool as a whole was resistant to Retro-2 activity, which could be attributed to any of these genotypes.</p><p>Thus, to directly address the reviewer’s question, we isolated single-cell clones and selected homozygous mutant lines with defined genotypes (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). When compared to a wildtype ASNA1 clonal line (created using a safe-targeting guide) and a synonymous, homozygous A149A ASNA1 clonal line, we observe that the homozygous A149V ASNA1 clonal line does not affect protein abundance (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B) but is highly resistant to both the protective activity of Retro-2 and the toxicity of DHQZ36.1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D). Note that we also observe no growth phenotype or resistance to ricin in the absence of Retro-2 analogs, suggesting that the A149V allele can fully complement these phenotypes.</p><p>Additionally, we transduced these clonal cell lines with the GFP-2A-RFP-SEC61B<sub>TMD</sub> reporter. This more sensitive measure of ASNA1 function revealed that ASNA1 A149V caused a partial loss of function under basal conditions but still conferred about a ten-fold increase in EC<sub>50</sub> for Retro-2 and DHQZ36.1 (Figure 4E; Figure 4—figure supplement 2E, F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the concern raised in point 2, the authors need to better characterize how the A149V mutation confers resistance to Retro-2.

We agree that direct binding assays of Retro-2 to ASNA1 are beyond the scope of the current study, but as suggested, we pursued the functional experiments in our purified biochemical system.</p><p>We first created and purified the homologous ASNA1 mutation (A143V) in zebrafish protein (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A). In our biochemical experiments, mutant ASNA1 was able to accept substrate transfer from SGTA, demonstrating that the mutant remains functional in this reconstituted reaction (Figure 5F). While the presence of DHQZ36.1 in this experiment inhibits substrate transfer of the wildtype ASNA1, we observed a reduced inhibition for the mutant ASNA1 (Figure 5F).</p><p>These results in a reconstituted pathway with five components demonstrate conclusively that the A149V ASNA1 mutant is functional and resistant to DHQZ36.1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
