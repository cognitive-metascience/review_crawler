However, the functional importance of these intricate inter-connections, and how they are established is currently unclear. Here, we reveal that a conserved ATPase, Fap7, organizes interactions between neighboring r-proteins uS11 and eS26 prior to their delivery to the earliest ribosome precursor, the 90S. In vitro, uS11 only when bound to Fap7 becomes competent to recruit eS26 through tertiary contacts found between these r-proteins on the mature ribosome. Subsequently, Fap7 ATPase activity unloads the uS11:eS26 subcomplex onto its rRNA binding site, and therefore ensures stoichiometric integration of these r-proteins into the 90S. Fap7-depletion in vivo renders uS11 susceptible to proteolysis, and precludes eS26 incorporation into the 90S. Thus, prefabrication of a native-like r-protein subcomplex drives efficient and accurate construction of the eukaryotic ribosome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21755.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21755.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ribosome assembly</kwd><kwd>eukaryotic ribosomal proteins</kwd><kwd>protein complexes</kwd><kwd>ATPases</kwd><kwd>Fap7</kwd><kwd>Tsr2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003006</institution-id><institution>Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Ute</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Yiming</given-names></name><name><surname>Panse</surname><given-names>Vikram G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panse</surname><given-names>Vikram G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panse</surname><given-names>Vikram G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008273</institution-id><institution>Novartis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panse</surname><given-names>Vikram G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NCCR RNA &amp; Disease</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panse</surname><given-names>Vikram G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Olga Mayenfisch Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panse</surname><given-names>Vikram G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EURIBIO260676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panse</surname><given-names>Vikram G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ATPase Fap7 prefabricates a uS11:eS26 ribosomal protein complex for ribosome assembly.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribosomes are the universal molecular machines responsible for the final step of translating genetic information into proteins. In eukaryotes, the large 60S subunit contains three rRNAs (25S, 5.8S, 5S) and 46 r-proteins. The small 40S subunit contains a single rRNA (18S) and 33 r-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klinge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rabl et al., 2011</xref>). A coordinated effort of all three transcriptional machineries (RNA polymerases I, II and III) and &gt;200 conserved assembly factors drives eukaryotic ribosome production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de la Cruz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</xref>).</p><p>RNA polymerase I driven production of 35S pre-rRNA initiates eukaryotic ribosome assembly in the nucleolus. The emerging pre-rRNA associates with small subunit r-proteins, and ~100 assembly factors to form the earliest precursor, the 90S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dragon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kos and Tollervey, 2010</xref>). Cleavage within the 35S pre-rRNA releases the small subunit precursor, the 40S pre-ribosome and permits the remaining pre-rRNA to associate with 60S-r-proteins and assembly factors to form the 60S pre-ribosome. A 40S pre-ribosome undergoes few compositional changes as it travels through the nucleoplasm and is rapidly exported into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schäfer et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, a 60S pre-ribosome transiently interacts with ~80 assembly factors, as it travels towards the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fatica et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harnpicharnchai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nissan et al., 2002</xref>). At distinct stages, assembly factors are released from ribosome precursors possibly through the action of &gt;50 energy-consuming RNA helicases, AAA-ATPases, ABC-ATPases and GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kressler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Panse and Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Strunk and Karbstein, 2009</xref>). The precise targets for many of these diverse energy-consuming enzymes remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Pre-ribosomal particles are transported by multiple transport receptors through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) into the cytoplasm where they undergo final maturation before initiating translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sloan et al., 2016</xref>). Cytoplasmic maturation of the 40S pre-ribosome requires endonucleolytic cleavage of the 20S pre-rRNA at site D to generate the 3’ end of mature 18S rRNA. This step is catalyzed by the endonuclease Nob1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fatica et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lamanna and Karbstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pertschy et al., 2009</xref>) and is thought to occur within an 80S-like particle formed upon the interaction of a 40S pre-ribosome with a mature 60S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lebaron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>). Functional studies have identified additional factors that influence the processing of immature 20S pre-rRNA. These include the Nob1-interacting protein Pno1, the methyltransferase Dim1, the GTPase mimic Tsr1, atypical ATPases Rio1 and Rio2, the DEAH ATPase Prp43 and its cofactor Pfa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferreira-Cerca et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geerlings et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McCaughan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pertschy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Strunk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Turowski et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, r-proteins uS11 and eS26 (yeast Rps14a/b and Rps26a/b; nomenclature according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ban et al., 2014</xref>) are essential for endonucleolytic cleavage of 20S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jakovljevic et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schütz et al., 2014</xref>). eS26 clamps the 3’ end of 18S rRNA and directly contacts its neighboring r-protein uS11. Depletion of Tsr2 or the ATPase Fap7, the binding partners of eS26 and uS11, respectively, also impairs cytoplasmic processing of 20S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Granneman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schütz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that these r-proteins play a role to correctly position the D site for Nob1-mediated 20S pre-rRNA cleavage.</p><p>Eukaryotic ribosome assembly relies on rapid nucleocytoplasmic transport. In yeast, within 90 min, the majority of ~14 million newly synthesized r-proteins are targeted to the nuclear compartment by the import machinery for incorporation into pre-ribosomal particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Warner, 1999</xref>). r-proteins contain large unstructured regions that are prone to non-specific interactions with nucleic acids and proteolytic degradation in their non-assembled state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jäkel and Görlich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jäkel et al., 2002</xref>). To overcome this logistical challenge, a subset of newly synthesized r-proteins employ dedicated chaperones that bind them in the cytoplasm and co-coordinate their nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitterer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pausch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pillet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stelter et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, we reported a different mechanism by which the r-protein eS26 is safely transferred to the 90S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schütz et al., 2014</xref>). In this case, eS26, like a typical import cargo, directly recruits multiple importins for its transport to the nucleus. However, unlike a typical import cargo, after reaching the nuclear compartment, eS26 is extracted from the importin by an unloading factor, the escortin Tsr2, without the aid of RanGTP. Once bound to Tsr2, eS26 is shielded from proteolysis, enabling its safe transfer to the 90S.</p><p>Another challenge for the assembly machinery is to ensure that those r-proteins, imported into the nucleus, are correctly integrated into each pre-ribosome, before the irreversible export step. How the assembly machinery co-ordinates incorporation of different r-proteins into their rRNA binding site(s), and thereby prevents wasteful production of incompletely assembled ribosomes is currently unclear. In this study, we unveil an essential energy-dependent mechanism that enables stoichiometric integration of r-proteins into an assembling 90S. We demonstrate that Fap7, a conserved ATPase, pre-organizes interactions between neighboring r-proteins uS11 and eS26 through native-like tertiary contacts prior to their delivery to the 90S. Subsequently, Fap7 ATPase activity concurrently integrates the uS11:eS26 subcomplex into the 90S. Thus, prefabrication of an uS11:eS26 subcomplex guarantees stoichiometric levels of these r-proteins are incorporated into the 90S.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Co-overexpression of Fap7 and the r-protein uS11 bypasses in vivo requirement for Tsr2</title><p>Tsr2 is an evolutionarily conserved 23.7 kDa escortin that unloads the r-protein eS26 from its import receptor after entering the nucleus in a RanGTP-independent manner.

A high-copy suppressor screen was performed in the model organism yeast, to identify genes, which, upon overexpression, suppressed the severe growth defect of a <italic>TSR2</italic> conditional mutant (P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<italic>TSR2</italic>). To this end, the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<italic>TSR2</italic> mutant strain was transformed with a high-copy (2µ) plasmid library and grown on repressive glucose-containing media at 25°C. Plasmids were recovered from fast-growing suppressor colonies. Sequence analyses identified <italic>RPS14a</italic> (hereafter termed <italic>uS11</italic>), a gene encoding the 40S subunit r-protein uS11 (yeast Rps14), and another gene <italic>YDL166C</italic> encoding the essential ATPase Fap7 as candidate suppressors. To directly test this possibility, <italic>FAP7</italic> and <italic>uS11</italic> were subcloned into high-copy plasmids and then tested for their ability to suppress the impaired growth of the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<italic>TSR2</italic> mutant. These analyses revealed that overexpression of <italic>FAP7</italic> and <italic>uS11</italic> weakly rescued the growth defect of the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<italic>TSR2</italic> mutant, as determined by the size of single colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, uS11 forms a stable complex with the ATPase Fap7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Granneman et al., 2005</xref>). Structural studies of the Fap7:uS11 complex revealed that Fap7 functions as a RNA mimic suggesting that it stabilizes uS11 before being incorporated into 40S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hellmich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loc'h et al., 2014</xref>). Co-overexpression of <italic>FAP7</italic> and <italic>uS11</italic> together restored impaired growth of the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<italic>TSR2</italic> mutant to nearly WT rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated whether co-overexpression of <italic>FAP7</italic> and <italic>uS11</italic> rescued different phenotypes exhibited by Tsr2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schütz et al., 2014</xref>). First, we assessed whether impaired cytoplasmic processing of 20S pre-rRNA seen in the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<italic>TSR2</italic> mutant was rescued upon <italic>FAP7</italic> and <italic>uS11</italic> co-overexpression. For this, we localized the 5′ portion of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). ITS1 is present within immature 20S pre-rRNA, but not in mature 18S rRNA. In a WT strain, due to efficient nuclear export of 40S pre-ribosomes, Cy3-ITS1 (red) is detectable only in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After nuclear export, ITS1 is rapidly cleaved from 20S pre-rRNA by the endonuclease Nob1 and degraded by the exonuclease Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moy and Silver, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stevens et al., 1991</xref>). As previously reported, Tsr2-depleted cells accumulate Cy3-ITS1 in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schütz et al., 2014</xref>), indicating impairment in cytoplasmic 20S pre-rRNA processing. However, these cells co-overexpressing <italic>FAP7</italic> and <italic>uS11</italic> did not show this phenotype as judged by the absence of cytoplasmic fluorescence signal of Cy3-ITS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, we assessed 20S pre-rRNA levels by Northern blotting using an oligonucleotide complementary to ITS1. Consistent with previous studies, P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<italic>TSR2</italic> mutant cells showed high levels of immature 20S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> lane 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schütz et al., 2014</xref>). Co-overexpressing <italic>FAP7</italic> and <italic>uS11</italic> significantly reduced 20S pre-RNA levels in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 3).

Since co-overexpression of Fap7 and uS11 compensated Tsr2-requirement in vivo, we wondered whether the Fap7:uS11 complex is able to release eS26 from a preformed Pse1:eS26 complex. To test this, we incubated a GST-Pse1:eS26 complex with the Fap7:uS11 complex, and evaluated eS26 release by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These analyses revealed that Fap7:uS11 did not release eS26 from Pse1. Instead, Fap7:uS11 was recruited to the GST-Pse1:eS26 resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lane 3).

The majority of these r-proteins need to be imported into the nucleus and then safely delivered to the ribosome assembly site in nucleolus. A challenge for the assembly machinery is to ensure that stoichiometric levels of r-proteins are incorporated into every pre-ribosome, prior to the irreversible nuclear export step. Here, a genetic screen unveiled an essential energy-dependent mechanism that delivers neighboring r-proteins eS26 and uS11 to the 90S. We show that the ATPase Fap7 promotes tertiary interactions between eS26 and uS11 and then concurrently assembles the eS26:uS11 subcomplex into the pre-ribosome. In this way, prefabrication of an r-protein subcomplex guarantees that stoichiometric levels of uS11 and eS26 are integrated into the 90S.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fap7 prefabricates an uS11:eS26 subcomplex for ribosome assembly</title><p>We found that r-proteins eS26 and uS11 depend upon each other for their incorporation into the 90S. Fap7-depletion compromises uS11 stability in vivo, and precludes eS26 recruitment to the 90S. Similarly, Tsr2-depletion compromises eS26 stability in vivo and precludes uS11 recruitment to the 90S. 40S pre-ribosomes assembled in Fap7- and Tsr2-depleted cells that lack both uS11 and eS26 efficiently escape nuclear proofreading, and are transported to the cytoplasm. These incompletely assembled subunits engage with mature 60S subunits to form 80S-like particles, but fail to undergo final 20S pre-rRNA processing and accumulate in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schütz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings are consistent with proteomic analyses that revealed an underrepresentation of eS26 and uS11 in these 80S-like particles that accumulate upon Fap7-depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The Fap7:uS11 complex with the assistance of RanGTP bypasses Tsr2-requirement in extracting eS26 from its importin in vitro. Further, co-overexpression of FAP7 and uS11 bypasses the functional requirement of Tsr2 to safely transfer the r-protein to the 90S in vivo. These two findings provided critical clues to unveil the mechanistic interdependency of eS26 and uS11 incorporation into the 90S. uS11, only when bound to Fap7, recruits eS26 suggesting that Fap7 renders uS11 competent to load eS26. This interaction requires conserved tertiary contacts between uS11 and eS26 found on the mature 40S subunit and is critical for bypassing Tsr2-requirement. The mechanism of Fap7-mediated pre-organization of an uS11:eS26 r-protein subcomplex for ribosome assembly is essential and distinct from the non-essential symportin Syo1. Syo1 does not promote tertiary contacts between r-proteins uL5 and uL11. Instead, it directly binds to both the r-proteins at two distinct sites and then mediates their co-import into the nucleus for 5S rRNP assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calviño et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kressler et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>eS26, when bound to Tsr2, was not recruited to the Fap7:uS11 complex, suggesting that eS26 needs to be released from Tsr2 before engaging with the Fap7:uS11 complex. How eS26 dissociates from Tsr2 remains unclear. While Fap7 ATPase activity is not required to form a Fap7:uS11:eS26 complex, ATP hydrolysis is critical to load uS11:eS26 onto H23 rRNA. We therefore suggest that Fap7 scaffolds the uS11:eS26 complex formation and its ATPase activity regulates integration of this r-protein subcomplex into the 90S. Our findings are consistent with in vitro studies that showed that Fap7 could efficiently load uS11 onto H23 rRNA in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loc'h et al., 2014</xref>). However, in that study, the cellular compartment in which uS11 loading onto the pre-ribosome occurs was not investigated. Our data support a model in which Fap7 loads the pre-formed uS11:eS26 complex during early nucleolar assembly of the 90S pre-ribosome. The essential nature and enzymatic activity requirement for its function distinguishes Fap7 from another dedicated chaperones such as Acl4. The Acl4 chaperone system captures the r-protein uL4 in the cytoplasm for Kap104-mediated import. Subsequently, the interaction of the eukaryotic-specific uL4 extension with the pre-ribosomal surface is thought to trigger energy-independent disassembly of the Acl4:RpL4 complex and allow for incorporation of uL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pillet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stelter et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Two distinct mechanisms extract eS26 from the import machinery</title><p>Given that the <italic>RPS26</italic> knockout is lethal in yeast, whereas Tsr2-depleted cells are viable but severely growth impaired, implicates another mechanism that unloads eS26 from the import machinery and safely delivers the r-protein to the 90S. Our data demonstrate that the Fap7:uS11 complex and RanGTP are components of this alternative mechanism that sustains viability of the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<italic>TSR2</italic> mutant. In vitro, Fap7:uS11 interacts with the importin:eS26 complex and renders the importin:eS26 complex sensitive to RanGTP-dependent disassembly. This pathway involves tertiary contacts between uS11 and eS26, since mutations that disturb interactions between Fap7:uS11 and eS26 are unable to release eS26 from its importin and to compensate Tsr2-requirement in vivo. How Fap7:uS11 recruitment renders the importin:eS26 complex sensitive to RanGTP is unclear. It is tempting to speculate that an element within eS26 may be responsible to prevent its premature RanGTP-dependent release from its importin. Recruitment of Fap7:uS11 might relieve this negative regulation and permit RanGTP-dependent release. In general, such a mechanism could couple cargo release from importins with its transfer to an interaction partner and/or final functional destination in the nucleus.</p><p>Based on the observation that co-overexpression of Fap7 and uS11 efficiently suppresses Tsr2-depletion phenotypes, we suggest that, in wild-type cells, there are two pools of the Fap7:uS11 complex. The major pool seems to perform the essential duty of organizing a Fap7:uS11:eS26 subcomplex and incorporating it into the 90S. Only a small pool of the Fap7:uS11 complex is available for its adjunct role in RanGTP-dependent unloading of eS26 directly from the importin and is therefore limiting in Tsr2-depleted cells. Overexpression of Fap7 and uS11 would increase free Fap7:uS11 complex levels to perform the adjunct duty of extracting eS26 from its importin and compensating the absence of Tsr2. We propose two mechanisms that operate to extract eS26 from the import machinery. The major RanGTP insensitive mechanism involves Tsr2 that extracts eS26 from the importin:eS26 complex, and forms a stable Tsr2:eS26 complex. Subsequently, eS26 is released from Tsr2, and then recruited to the preformed Fap7:uS11 complex. The alternative mechanism employs the preformed Fap7:uS11 complex for eS26 extraction from its importin. In this case, the Fap7:uS11 interacts with eS26 when bound to its importin, and renders eS26 release RanGTP-sensitive. Importantly, both mechanisms converge to form a Fap7:uS11:eS26 complex for incorporation into the 90S.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Prefabricating r-protein subcomplexes for correct ribosome assembly?</title><p>A major task for the assembly machinery is to precisely target thousands of r-proteins every second to developing pre-ribosomes. It is apparent that mechanisms must exist that rapidly and, at the same time, correctly incorporate different r-proteins into their cognate rRNA binding sites, and thereby prevent production of a non-functional ribosome. A striking structural feature of eukaryotic r-proteins is that they cluster on the surface of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) through a network of ~140 tertiary contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poirot and Timsit, 2016</xref>). The function(s) of these intricate conserved inter-connections, how and when they are established has remained unclear. Prefabricating r-protein subcomplexes through these tertiary contacts prior to their assembly provides one mechanism to reduce the molecularity of the incorporation process and ensure stoichiometric levels of r-proteins reach their rRNA binding sites. Thus, Fap7 may represent a family of factors that pre-organize native-like r-protein subcomplexes and minimize production errors during eukaryotic ribosome formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>.

They began by isolating Fap7 and uS11 as overexpression suppressors of the lethality and assembly defect of eS26 conferred by depletion of Tsr1, the escortin that unloads eS26 from its import receptor in the nucleus by a Ran-GTP-independent mechanism. They showed that efficient suppression occurs only when Fap7 and uS11 are co-overexpressed, and obtained evidence that Fap7 and uS11 function in concert with eS26 and Tsr1 in proper assembly of uS11 and eS26 into ribosomes. They reconstituted in vitro a GST-Fap7:uS11:eS26 complex and showed that it requires amino acid contacts between uS11 and eS26 found in the mature ribosome, as well as the ATPase activity of Fap7, and then demonstrated that this complex could be loaded onto rRNA helix 23, again dependent on ATPase activity, thus providing strong evidence that Fap7 orchestrates formation of an uS11:eS26 complex, and that its ATPase activity facilitates loading of this prefabricated r-protein subcomplex onto h23 rRNA during ribosome biogenesis. (How eS26 dissociates from Tsr2 to enable this process remains unclear, as this does not appear to be an activity of the uS11:eS26 complex.) Other results demonstrate that the Fap7:uS11 complex and RanGTP are components of an alternative mechanism that can operate in cells lacking Tsr1 to unload eS26 from the nuclear import machinery. They showed that Fap7:uS11 binding renders the importin:eS26 complex sensitive to RanGTP, which it ordinarily is not, again dependent on native uS11:eS26 contacts. They propose that in wild-type cells, the Fap7:uS11 complex performs the essential duty of organizing a Fap7:uS11:eS26 subcomplex and incorporating it into the 90S, but when overexpressed can also perform an adjunct role in RanGTP-dependent unloading of eS26 from the importin thereby compensating for Tsr2-depletion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is important to show by Western analysis that the failure of overexpressed catalytically dead fab1-7 to confer suppression of the Tsr2 depletion is not a trivial result of its failure to accumulate in cells.</p><p>2) It is important to attempt to demonstrate, e.g. by coIP analysis, that eS26 accumulates in a complex with its importin in Tsr2-depleted cells, which is reversed by co-overexpression of Fap7 and uS11.</p><p>3) The relative ratios of H23 to eS26 in lanes 8-13 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> must be quantified.</p><p>4) It is important to investigate whether a tagged from of eS26 is capable of interacting with H23 in the absence of S11, a possibility strongly suggested by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper examines the role of the conserved ATPase Fap7 in proper assembly of 40S ribosomal proteins uS11 and eS26 into the 90S pre-ribosome of yeast.

While pertaining to only a single aspect of ribosome biogenesis, the findings will likely have broader implications for other ribosome assembly steps. There are two experimental shortcomings that should be redressed and several unclear passages that should be revised.</p><p>Subsection “Co-overexpression of Fap7 and the r-protein uS11 bypasses in vivo requirement for Tsr2”, second paragraph: It wasn't stated whether the high-copy plasmids were subcloned and re-tested to confirm that the FAP7 and uS11 genes were responsible for the suppression observed. This would be required.</p><p>Subsection “Fap7 ATPase activity is required to bypass Tsr2 requirement”, last paragraph: It is necessary to show that fap7-2 protein accumulates to levels comparable to that of WT Fap7 to justify the claim that loss of catalytic activity underlies the loss of suppression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Ribosomal proteins are abundant, basic proteins, many of which contain extensions predicted to have dis-ordered structures. To efficiently and accurately integrate these r proteins into assembling ribosomes in eukaryotes, cells must overcome several challenges: nascent r proteins must be folded properly to avoid aggregation, chaperoned to prevent inappropriate interactions with other proteins or RNAs, imported into the nucleus, and properly configured into nascent ribosomes in equal numbers. Most r proteins are essential; if one of them fails to assemble in a timely fashion or assemble properly, assembly of that ribosomal subunit fails.</p><p>This manuscript describes an elegant combination of molecular genetic experiments in vivo and biochemical assays in vitro leading the authors to suggest a much more detailed &quot;prefabrication&quot; mechanism used by yeast to overcome these challenges, to deliver r proteins S11 and S26 into adjacent positions in small ribosomal subunits.</p><p>Previous work revealed that assembly factor Tsr2 helps S26 assemble and assembly factor Fap7 helps S11 assemble. Here it is shown that Fap7 and S11 are imported into the nucleus separately or as a complex, released from import factors using RAN, then bind to S26 and deliver it to pre-ribosomes using ATP hydrolysis by Fap7. Most of the time, S26 is released from import factors by Tsr2. When this occurs, it is not clear how Tsr2 dissociates from S26 before S26 can bind to Fap7-S11, but this step appears to be RAN independent. When Tsr2 is not used to dissociate S26 from import factors, the Fap7-S11 complex can release S26 from import factors in a RAN-dependent fashion. The interesting point is that assembly of S11 and S26 is interdependent, brought together with Fap7, presumably in the nucleus, before they are inserted into pre-ribosomes using ATP hydrolysis by Fap7.</p><p>In my opinion the experiments support the authors' model. The manuscript could be improved by the following:</p><p>1) Introduction, second paragraph: I do not think that 200 assembly factors are required for large subunit assembly; rather, closer to 80. Can the authors double-check this number?</p><p>2) Introduction, last paragraph, and Discussion, first paragraph: the statements imply that all r proteins assemble before nuclear export. The authors state that particles escape nuclear proofreading in the absence of Fap7. Perhaps a detail for this work, but they should clarify that a few other r proteins assemble in the cytoplasm in wild type cells, but that S11 and S26 are among the majority that assemble in the nucleus.</p><p>3) The authors might add to the Discussion:</p><p>How does their work extend and/or contradict previous work describing how Fap7 helps S11 assemble with rRNA, e.g., the work of Loc'h et al.</p><p>In addition maybe briefly compare and contrast their ideas re S11 and S26 with published models for incorporation of r protein L4 by its chaperone, e.g., where or how Fap7 recognizes and binds S11.</p><p>4) Subsection “Two distinct mechanisms extract eS26 from the import machinery”, last paragraph: to clarify the discussion, can the authors state upfront that the existence of major and minor pools of the Fap7-S11 complex and their respective roles in assembly are a model based on results in the paper, in particular based on the suppression of Tsr2 depletion phenotypes by extra copies of both and the S11 and FAP7 genes?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes the coordinated assembly of the ribosomal proteins uS11 and eS26 by Fap7 into the pre-ribosome. The work builds on previous work from the Panse lab that investigated the role of Tsr2 in unloading eS26 from importins after import into the nucleus. In that work, the authors described a RanGTP-independent pathway requiring Tsr2 but also argued that there was a second pathway of unloading. Here, the authors show that a complex of Fap7-uS11 can act in a RanGTP-dependent fashion to release eS26. Experiments are well executed, the data are very clean and well displayed and the logic is largely well laid out. However, I have several concerns regarding the work that should be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors write &quot;Co-overexpression of FAP7 and uS11 bypassed Tsr2-requirement in extracting eS26 from its importin and safely transferring the r-protein to the 90S.&quot; This is not actually shown but is based on extrapolation from in vitro results. Does eS26 accumulate in a complex with its importin in Tsr2 depleted cells and is this relived by overexpression of Fap7 and uS11? This should be tested in vivo by co-IP. This point is important not just to justify this statement but also because this is a major conclusion of the work that is based almost entirely on in vitro analysis.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the authors claim that the loading of uS11 onto H23 is dependent on Fap7 and recruitment of eS26. The dependence on Fap7 is quite nice but the retention of H23 seems to correlate closely with eS26 levels. Is H23 binding to uS11 as claimed or to eS26? The relative ratios of H23 to eS26 in lanes 8-13 should be quantified. The authors must also include controls of eS26 alone with H23.</p><p>3) If uS11 needs Fap7 for its stability, as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, the model for independent import of uS11 seems unlikely. When uS11 accumulates in the cytoplasm in pse1-1 cells, is it associated with Fap7? Do they co-IP? If not, how is it imagined that uS11 is imported without Fap7 to stabilize it? Similarly, when Fap7 accumulates in the cytoplasm in RanGTP cycle mutants, is it associated with uS11?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. It's not clear what the significance is of uS11 interacting with many different importins. These proteins are typically highly negatively charged. Is it possible these simply represent nonspecific electrostatic interactions driven by the high in vitro protein concentrations?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21755.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It is important to show by Western analysis that the failure of overexpressed catalytically dead fab1-7 to confer suppression of the Tsr2 depletion is not a trivial result of its failure to accumulate in cells.</italic> </p><p>This is an important control to exclude the possibility that a catalytically inactive Fap7 is unstable in vivo, and therefore unable to rescue the observed phenotypes associated with Tsr2-depletion. To this end, Western analyses of whole cell lysates derived from Tsr2-depleted cells overexpressing Fap7 and the catalytically inactive fap7-2 was performed.

We loaded equal amounts of eS26-FLAG isolated from each these cells on a SDS-gel and performed Western analyses to monitor importin (Pse1 and Kap123) co-enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1B</xref>). However, we were unable to co-enrich detectable levels of Pse1 and Kap123 in these IPs. One possible explanation could be that at steady state only a small amount of eS26, below the detection levels of our Western analyses, is bound to its importin during transfer to the nucleus. Alternatively, it is possible that the importin:eS26 complexes fall apart upon cell lysis.</p><p>In response to the specific sentence in the Discussion that was criticized by reviewer 3 (point 1), we would like to clarify our idea regarding Tsr2 function. Our model presented in Schütz et al., 2014 <italic>eLife</italic> was based on a combination of in vitro and in vivo findings. In that study, we showed that importin:eS26 complexes, unlike typical importin:cargo complexes, were inefficiently dissociated by RanGTP in vitro. Instead, we found that Tsr2, without the assistance from RanGTP, efficiently releases eS26 from its importin, and prevents its aggregation in vitro. in vivo, Tsr2-depletion renders eS26 susceptible to proteolysis, and precludes its incorporation into the 90S pre-ribosome.

The main finding of this study is that the ATPase Fap7 brings together uS11 and eS26 interactions through native-like tertiary contacts and its ATPase activity is required to integrate a pre-formed uS11:eS26 complex into the 90S. This ensures stoichiometric integration of uS11 and eS26 into the 90S pre-ribosome. Different lines of genetic, cell-biological and in vitro <italic>/</italic>in vivo biochemical evidences support this conclusion. Specifically:</p><p>A) Tsr2-depletion compromises eS26 stability and precludes uS11 integration into the 90S. Fap7-depletion compromises uS11 stability and precludes eS26 integration into the 90S. These in vivo data demonstrate an interdependence of eS26 and uS11 for their incorporation into the 90S.</p><p>B) Together with the above data and the specific genetic interaction between Tsr2 and Fap7:uS11 (suppression data) led us to show that Fap7 organizes a uS11:eS26 complex through tertiary contacts and that its ATPase activity is required to load this complex onto H23 rRNA. The importance of native-like contacts between uS11:eS26, and the importance of Fap7 ATPase activity to load H23 rRNA were validated by genetic, cell-biological and in vivo biochemical studies.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the authors claim that the loading of uS11 onto H23 is dependent on Fap7 and recruitment of eS26. The dependence on Fap7 is quite nice but the retention of H23 seems to correlate closely with eS26 levels. Is H23 binding to uS11 as claimed or to eS26? The relative ratios of H23 to eS26 in lanes 8-13 should be quantified. The authors must also include controls of eS26 alone with H23.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important control. Please see our response to points 3 and 4 in the Essential revisions above.</p><p><italic>3) If uS11 needs Fap7 for its stability, as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, the model for independent import of uS11 seems unlikely. When uS11 accumulates in the cytoplasm in pse1-1 cells, is it associated with Fap7? Do they co-IP? If not, how is it imagined that uS11 is imported without Fap7 to stabilize it?</italic> </p><p>As requested, we have immuno-precipitated uS11-GFP from WT and <italic>pse1-1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2A</xref>). These biochemical studies show that uS11-GFP can co-enrich Fap7. It is unlikely that all uS11-GFP in the cytoplasm is bound to Fap7, since nuclear targeting of GFP-Fap7 is not impaired in a <italic>pse1-1</italic> mutant.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21755.014</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type and <italic>pse1-1</italic> strains expressing uS11-GFP were grown in synthetic media at 25°C to mid-log phase and then shifted to 37°C for 4 h. uS11-GFP was then immuno-precipitated and subjected to Western analysis.(<bold>B</bold>) Wild-type and <italic>prp20-1</italic> strains expressing Fap7-TAP were grown in synthetic media at 25°C to mid-log phase and then shifted to 37°C for 4 h.

These biochemical studies show that Fap7 can co- enrich uS11.</p><p>Newly synthesized uS11, after emerging from the translating ribosome, is likely to be stabilized by cytoplasmic factors before being captured by importins. Yeast cells deficient for the ribosome associated NAC and SSB-RAC chaperone systems that associate with newly synthesized polypeptides accumulate several ribosomal protein aggregates (Koplin et al., 2010). NAC and SSB-RAC chaperone systems might bind uS11 before their transport to the nucleus. Upon arrival in the nuclear compartment interaction with Fap7 stabilizes uS11 and prepares the r-protein together with eS26 for assembly.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. It's not clear what the significance is of uS11 interacting with many different importins. These proteins are typically highly negatively charged. Is it possible these simply represent nonspecific electrostatic interactions driven by the high</italic> in vitro <italic>protein concentrations?</italic> </p><p>We could not test interactions between uS11 and the different importins, since uS11 is aggregation-prone when not bound to Fap7. All interaction studies between importins and Fap7 and Fap7:uS11 complexes are well-established binding assays in the nuclear transport field. These assays are always carried out in the presence of competing <italic>E. coli</italic> lysates to minimize non-specific interactions.</p><p>Budding yeast employs 11 importins to target diverse cargos to the nucleus. In this study, we have tested interactions between Fap7:uS11 complex and Fap7 with all 11 importins. Amongst the 11 importins, we observe differences in binding. For e.g. Sxm1, Kap120, Mtr10 and Nmd5 hardly interact with Fap7 as well as the Fap7:uS11 complex. In contrast, Msn5 efficiently binds to Fap7, but rather weakly with the Fap7:uS11 complex. Finally, only Pse1 and Kap104 binds to the Fap7:uS11 complex. Therefore, we do not think that these interactions are non-specific electrostatic interactions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
