of mutually exclusive competing interactions, may explain why some proteins are dynamic while others are rigid. Frustration is thought to underpin biomolecular recognition and the flexibility of protein-binding sites. Here, we show how a small chemical modification, the oxidation of two cysteine thiols to a disulfide bond, during the catalytic cycle of the N-terminal domain of the key bacterial oxidoreductase DsbD (nDsbD), introduces frustration ultimately influencing protein function. In oxidized nDsbD, local frustration disrupts the packing of the protective cap-loop region against the active site allowing loop opening. By contrast, in reduced nDsbD the cap loop is rigid, always protecting the active-site thiols from the oxidizing environment of the periplasm. Our results point toward an intricate coupling between the dynamics of the active-site cysteines and of the cap loop which modulates the association reactions of nDsbD with its partners resulting in optimized protein function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>local frustration</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>protein dynamics</kwd><kwd>oxidoreductase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/F01709X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stelzl</surname><given-names>Lukas S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/R00126X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sansom</surname><given-names>Mark SP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>208361/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sansom</surname><given-names>Mark SP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>079440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Redfield</surname><given-names>Christina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>092532/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>Stuart J</given-names></name><name><surname>Redfield</surname><given-names>Christina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P300PA_167703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PZ00P3_180142</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cysteine pair oxidation state in nDsbD acts as a ‘switch’ controlling the presence or absence of frustration in the active-site and determining the dynamic behavior of the cap loop.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Molecular recognition, the specific non-covalent interaction between two or more molecules, underpins all biological processes. During protein-protein association, molecular recognition often depends on conformational changes in one or both of the protein partners. Important insight into the mechanisms of molecular recognition has come from NMR experiments probing dynamics on a range of timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldwin and Kay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sekhar et al., 2018</xref>). NMR, and especially the relaxation dispersion method, is unique in providing not only kinetic, but also structural information about the conformational changes leading up to protein association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sugase et al., 2007</xref>). In some cases, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been successfully paired with NMR experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Olsson and Noé, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robustelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stiller et al., 2019</xref>) to provide a more complete picture of the conformational dynamics landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Paul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peters and de Groot, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robustelli et al., 2013</xref>). However, we still do not have a general understanding of the molecular determinants that enable some proteins to access their bound-like conformation before encountering their binding partners in a 'conformational-selection' mechanism, while others undergo conformational change only after recognizing their ligands in an 'induced-fit' mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehr et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Local structural frustration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldwin et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ferreiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freiberger et al., 2019</xref>), the existence of multiple favorable interactions which cannot be satisfied at the same time, has emerged as an important concept in rationalizing why some regions in proteins undergo conformational changes in the absence of a binding partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferreiro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferreiro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferreiro et al., 2014</xref>). In general, globular proteins are overall minimally frustrated and, thus, adopt well-defined native structures. Nonetheless, the existence of a set of competing local interactions can establish a dynamic equilibrium between distinct conformational states. Locally frustrated interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jenik et al., 2012</xref>) are indeed more common for residues located in binding interfaces of protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferreiro et al., 2007</xref>) and can play an important role in determining which parts of these proteins are flexible. However, very few studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Danielsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Das and Plotkin, 2013</xref>) have analyzed in atomic detail how frustration shapes conformational dynamics and, therefore, can enable protein association. This lack of understanding hampers the exploitation of local frustration, and associated dynamic equilibria, as a design principle for generating optimal protein constructs that could be used in the production of synthetic molecular machines.</p><p>To investigate the role of frustration in conformational dynamics, we have used as a model system the N-terminal domain of the transmembrane protein DsbD (nDsbD), a key oxidoreductase in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria. DsbD is a three-domain membrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) which acquires two electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin and, through a series of thiol-disulfide exchange reactions involving pairs of conserved cysteine residues, transfers these electrons to multiple periplasmic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B/C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho and Collet, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Depuydt et al., 2009</xref>). nDsbD, the last component of the DsbD thiol-disulfide cascade, is essentially the redox interaction hub in the bacterial periplasm; it first interacts with the C-terminal domain of DsbD (cDsbD) to acquire the electrons provided by cytoplasmic thioredoxin and then passes these on to several globular periplasmic proteins, including DsbC, CcmG and DsbG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A/B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stirnimann et al., 2006</xref>). All these thiol-disulfide exchange steps involve close interactions between nDsbD and its binding partners, which are essential so that their functional cysteine pairs can come into proximity leading to electron transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haebel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mavridou et al., 2011</xref>). As nDsbD is essentially a reductase in the oxidative environment of the bacterial periplasm, its interactions with its multiple partners must happen in an optimal manner, making this protein an ideal model system to study.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of DsbD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DsbD comprises a central domain with eight transmembrane helices (tmDsbD) and two periplasmic globular domains (nDsbD and cDsbD). The electron transfer pathway from thioredoxin (Trx) to periplasmic partner proteins is shown. cDsbD, DsbC, CcmG and DsbG have a thioredoxin fold (circle), typical of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, while nDsbD adopts an immunoglobulin fold (square). nDsbD and cDsbD are shown in cyan and grey, respectively. (<bold>B</bold>) Electron transfer reactions involving DsbD are shown. Two electrons and two H<sup>+</sup> are transferred in each step. Trx<sub>red</sub> reduces the disulfide bond in tmDsbD<sub>ox</sub>, tmDsbD<sub>red</sub> then reduces cDsbD<sub>ox</sub>, and cDsbD<sub>red</sub> subsequently reduces nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>. Oxidized DsbC, CcmG and DsbG subsequently accept electrons from nDsbD<sub>red</sub>. (<bold>C</bold>) Schematic representation of the thiol-disulfide exchange reaction (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) between cDsbD and nDsbD. (<bold>D</bold>) The central panels illustrate two possible mechanisms mediating cap loop opening in the formation of the nDsbD-cDsbD complex. In the upper scheme, a steric clash upon binding induces cap loop opening. In the lower scheme, the sampling of an open conformation by nDsbD allows formation of the complex without steric clashes. nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> is illustrated on the left (PDB: 1L6P); the cap loop (residues 68–72), which covers the active site is in teal. F70 (stick and surface representation) shields the active-site disulfide bond (yellow) in this closed conformation. The nDsbD cap loop adopts an open conformation in the complex between nDsbD and cDsbD (PDB: 1VRS), shown on the right, allowing interaction of the cysteine residues of the two domains.

The catalytic subdomain of nDsbD is inserted at one end of its immunoglobulin (Ig) fold with the two active-site cysteines, C103 and C109, located on opposite strands of a β-hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). For both oxidized and reduced nDsbD (with and without a C103-C109 disulfide bond, respectively), the active-site cysteines are shielded by the cap-loop region which adopts a closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haebel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mavridou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goulding et al., 2002</xref>). Strikingly, all structures of nDsbD in complex with its binding partners, cDsbD, DsbC, and CcmG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haebel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rozhkova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stirnimann et al., 2005</xref>), show the cap loop in an open conformation that allows interaction between the cysteine pairs of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haebel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stirnimann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rozhkova and Glockshuber, 2007</xref>).</p><p>While these X-ray structures provide static snapshots of the closed and open states of the cap loop, they do not offer any insight into the mechanism of loop opening that is essential for the function of nDsbD. To understand the drivers of this conformational change, two hypotheses regarding the solution state of nDsbD need to be examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Firstly, it is possible that the cap loop only opens when nDsbD encounters its binding partners, in an 'induced-fit' mechanism consistent with the hypothesized protective role of this region of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goulding et al., 2002</xref>). Secondly, it is also plausible that in solution the cap loop is flexible so that it samples open states, and thus allows binding of partner proteins via 'conformational selection' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehr et al., 2009</xref>). Of course, if the cap loop did open in the absence of a binding partner, that could compromise the transfer of electrons in an environment as oxidizing as the periplasm, and particularly through the action of the strong oxidase DsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denoncin and Collet, 2013</xref>). Therefore, one could hypothesize that a protective role for the cap loop would be more important in reduced nDsbD (nDsbD<sub>red</sub>), raising the question of whether nDsbD interacts with its partners via different loop-opening mechanisms depending on its oxidation state. In this scenario, the pair of cysteines could modulate the conformational ensemble of nDsbD as has been hinted at by structural bioinformatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use both state-of-the-art NMR experiments and MD simulations to describe different behaviors for the cap loop depending on the oxidation state of nDsbD. The atomic-scale insight afforded by these two methods reveals how the disulfide bond introduces local frustration specifically in oxidized nDsbD (nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>), allowing the cap loop and active site in nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> to sample open bound-like conformations in the absence of a binding partner. Our observations have implications not only for the function of DsbD, but more broadly for the role of local frustration in ensuring optimized protein-protein interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The solution structure of nDsbD as probed by NMR</title><p>NMR experiments demonstrate that the cap loop has an important protective role in shielding the active-site cysteines of nDsbD. For nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>, we showed previously that reduction of the disulfide bond by dithiothreitol (DTT) is very slow, with only 50% of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> reduced after ~2 hr. This indicates that the cap loop shields C103 and C109 from the reducing agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mavridou et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, NMR spectra for nDsbD<sub>red</sub> collected between pH 6 and 11 show no change in cysteine Cβ chemical shifts. This indicates that the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of C109, the cysteine residue thought to initiate reductant transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rozhkova et al., 2004</xref>), is above 11, thus making it unreactive in isolated nDsbD<sub>red</sub>. This suggests that shielding of the active site by the cap loop in nDsbD<sub>red</sub> protects C103 and C109 from non-cognate reactions in the oxidizing environment of the periplasm.</p><p>The cap loop shields the active site by adopting a closed conformation as in the X-ray structures of oxidized (PDB: 1L6P and 1JPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haebel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goulding et al., 2002</xref>) and reduced (PDB: 3PFU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mavridou et al., 2011</xref>) nDsbD. These structures are very similar to each other with pairwise Cα RMSDs for residues 12 to 122 of less than 0.15 Å.

First, we investigated whether cap loop opening is linked directly to one of the two frustrated F70 χ1 conformers. The opening of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> at 82.5 ns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> coincides with a change of the F70 χ1 from gauche- (−60<sup>o</sup>) to trans (−180<sup>o</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref>). During the 1 μs trajectory, the cap loop experiences several shorter opening events; twenty events with a duration of at least one ns and a F70-to-C109 distance of at least 10 Å are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). In only one of these events does F70 undergo a similar gauche- to trans transition at the point of opening. Fourteen of the openings start from F70 in the trans conformer, while five openings start from the gauche- conformer. Thus, loop opening is not underpinned by a specific F70 χ1 conformer.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the major cap-loop opening event observed in MD simulations of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>.</title><p>Top: Snapshots of structures generated from the MD simulation between 65 and 105 ns show the range of cap loop conformations and, in particular, the F70 and Y71 side chain positions that are sampled.

The four panels on the right show the ϕ (black) and ψ (red) torsion angles for E69, F70, Y71 and G72. The cap loop opens after 3.8 ns and remains open for 21.7 ns. The loop opens with F70 in the trans conformer but this χ1 angle changes several times while the loop is open. Before loop opening, the aromatic ring of Y71 is farther away from C109 than in the 1L6P X-ray structure. This is due to the trans χ1 conformer. At ~20 ns the Y71 χ1 switches to the gauche- conformer; this brings the ring of Y71 closer to C109 and places the ring in between F70 and C109 in a ‘blocking’ conformation. At ~22 ns the ring of Y71 moves out of this position, and away from C109, allowing the loop to close at 25.5 ns.

In closed nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> Y71 also samples both gauche- and trans χ1 conformers, showing a strong preference for gauche- (86%). Despite this preferred conformation, we note that there is no correlation between the χ1 values of F70 and Y71; the less common Y71 trans conformer is observed for both frustrated F70 conformers. We observed the sequence of events leading to loop opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref>). Although the cap loop remains closed from 60 to 80 ns, the side chains of both F70 and Y71 sample a number of different conformations. From 60 to 65 ns, both F70 and Y71 are in the gauche- χ1 conformation observed in the 1L6P X-ray structure. At 65.9 ns, F70 χ1 switches to the trans conformer. This brings the F70 and Y71 rings closer together. From 66 to 80 ns, F70 remains primarily in the trans conformer with only brief excursions to gauche- (at ~72.7 and~77.7 ns), and at 79.9 ns F70 returns to the gauche- χ1 conformer. Meanwhile, at 76.9 and 80.3 ns the ring of Y71 transiently moves into more exposed conformations as a result of changes to χ1 and χ2, but the loop remains closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Immediately before loop opening the F70 and Y71 rings are in close proximity, while Y71 is also close to C109. This flexible and dynamic nature of the side chains of F70 and Y71 in the closed state is reflected in their RMSD, to the equilibrated X-ray structure, observed during the MD trajectories. In the nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> 1 μs trajectories, F70 and Y71 have RMSDs of 2.8 ± 0.8 and 2.6 ± 0.7 Å, respectively when the loop is closed (F70-C109 &lt; 6 Å). By contrast, these RMSD values are 1.7 ± 0.6 and 1.6 ± 0.8 for F70 and Y71, respectively in nDsbD<sub>red</sub> trajectories. It is worth noting here that the aromatic ring of F67 in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>, which is homologous to Y71 in <italic>E. coli</italic> nDsbD, is also dynamic, adopting different conformations in the crystallized closed structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). Taking these observations together, we propose that the existence of local structural frustration for F70 results in increased dynamics for both F70 and Y71, which leads to occasional loop opening in nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>.</p><p>Following opening of the cap loop at 82.5 ns, Y70 and Y71 continue to sample a variety of conformations, which could be important for the cap loop to access a fully open structure. The initial open states show the ring of F70 pointing inwards, due to its trans conformation. Transition of F70 to the gauche- conformer after loop opening, leads to a more extended orientation for F70. The extent of loop opening, as measured by the F70-to-C109 distance, fluctuates during the 120 ns open period; for example, at 85.6 ns the loop is in a more open conformation (12.5 Å) than at 93.2 ns (8.6 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, as the F70-to-C109 distance decreases, the loop is often prevented from closing fully by the side chain of Y71 which sits in between C109 and F70 in a ‘blocking’ conformation (for example at 93.2 ns and later at 151.9 and 155.8 ns [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>]). The orientation of F70 relative to Y71 also changes while the loop is open. At 98.2 ns the position of Y70 is similar to that observed in the open 1VRS X-ray structure but Y71 points inwards. At 102.2 ns the Y70 and F71 orientations are more similar to the 1VRS structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The cap loop can also adopt conformations that are more open than the open 1VRS structure (at ~145 and~181 ns); these structures are characterized by larger F70-C109 and Y71-C109 distances (&gt;16 Å and 10 Å, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>). These conformations may be important for the initial docking of cDsbD prior to nDsbD/cDsbD complex formation, as they would minimize the steric clashes between the two domains during binding.</p><p>The backbone ϕ and ψ torsion angles of D68, E69, F70, Y71 and G72 also show clear changes at 82.5 ns when the loop begins to open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). E69 ϕ and ψ become less variable in the open loop while the ϕ and ψ values for D68 and F70 become more variable. These torsion angle changes are correlated with loss of the hydrogen bond between the amide nitrogen of Y71 and the side chain carboxyl group of D68 upon loop opening. This hydrogen bond is observed in the 1L6P X-ray structure and in 95% of structures between 60 and 82.5 ns, prior to loop opening. Notably, D68 and E69 adopt ϕ and ψ values more reminiscent of the closed state between 160 and 180 ns, despite the loop remaining open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>); during this period the Y71HN-D68Oδ hydrogen bond is again observed in 62% of structures. By contrast, the backbone hydrogen bonds which define the antiparallel β-hairpin of the cap loop and which involve D68-G72 and H66-S74, are always retained in the open loop structures.</p><p>We have also investigated the dynamics of Y71 in the simulations of loop closing, and in particular those simulations in which the loop fails to close completely within 10 ns. During these trajectories Y71 adopts conformations in which it sits between F70 and C109 thus blocking complete closure of the loop as observed, for example, at 93.2 ns in the major opening event and at 2.8 ns in the incomplete loop closing seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>In the light of the important roles identified for both F70 and Y71 in cap loop opening, we investigated the conservation of cap loop residues using bioinformatics. We have used 134 representative sequences, one from each bacterial genus, for our sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). We find that the cap-loop motif is more conserved than the flanking β-strands, in agreement with the central role that this structural motif plays in nDsbD function. In 53% of the sequences an F or a Y is found at position 70; in a further 36.4% of the sequences a residue with a relatively bulky side chain (K/I/L/E/V/T/N), which would shield the cysteines from solvent, is found at position 70. Interestingly, in 85% of sequences an F or a Y is found at position 71; in a further 5.2% of the sequences position 71 is occupied by a bulky hydrophobic residue (I or L). This high conservation of an aromatic amino acid observed for this position further highlights the key role played by Y71 in contributing to loop opening and, more importantly, in preventing rapid loop closure, thus likely facilitating the interaction of nDsbD with cDsbD prior to reductant transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>NMR relaxation dispersion experiments</title><p>Using <sup>15</sup>N NMR relaxation dispersion experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldwin and Kay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loria et al., 1999</xref>) we also detected a difference in the μs-ms timescale dynamics of reduced and oxidized nDsbD. For nDsbD<sub>red</sub>, no evidence for μs-ms dynamics in the cap loop or the active site were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>).

The minor state is entropically less favorable than the ground state. Overall, the reaction coordinate in (<bold>B</bold>) shows that the minor state is less favorable by 8.8 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> at 25°C. The fitting of the experimental curves at the five temperatures also reports on the barrier between the two states. The transition state is enthalphically more favorable than the ground state. There is, however, a sizeable free-energy barrier as the transition state is lower in entropy than the ground state, and so the rate for the forward reaction, while approximately temperature independent, decreases slightly with increasing temperature.

To corroborate that a single exchange process gives rise to the relaxation dispersion curves, we repeated the experiments at four additional temperatures (10, 15, 20°C and 35°C). If the residues underwent different exchange processes we would expect them to show a differential response to temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grey et al., 2003</xref>).

This confirmed that a single process underlies the μs-ms chemical exchange in the cap loop of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>. In addition, the analysis of the data at all five temperatures yielded a detailed description of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the exchange process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6s1sdata1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). The minor ‘excited’ state is enthalpically, but not entropically, more favorable than the major ground state of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>. The fits also demonstrated that no enthalpic barrier separates the ground and excited state of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>. This absence of an enthalpic barrier between the two states might mean that no favorable interactions have to be broken in the transition state, but that the diffusion process itself may limit the speed of the transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dill and Bromberg, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the chemical shift differences determined from the relaxation dispersion experiments suggests that the conformation adopted by the cap loop in the minor state of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> might be similar to the conformation of nDsbD<sub>red</sub>. To interpret the chemical shift differences, we calculated the shift changes expected if the minor state features a disordered cap loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nielsen and Mulder, 2018</xref>). Such a state would include more open conformations and such structures might facilitate the binding of the nDsbD interaction partners. The lack of correlation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> demonstrates that the cap loop does not become disordered in the less populated minor state. The <sup>15</sup>N chemical shift differences between the major and minor states do, however, resemble the chemical shift differences between the oxidized and reduced isoforms of nDsbD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mavridou et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, the correlation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> is not perfect; the differences between the chemical shifts of the minor state of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> and those of nDsbD<sub>red</sub> likely reflect the local electronic and steric differences between having a disulfide bond (in the minor state of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>) and two cysteine thiols (in nDsbD<sub>red</sub>) in the active site. Importantly, the sign of the chemical shift differences between the major and minor state, which could be determined experimentally for W65, E69, F70, Y71, G72 and K73, further indicated that the minor state structure of the cap loop of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> is not disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>), but instead may be similar to that adopted in nDsbD<sub>red</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Coupling between the active site and the cap loop gives rise to the alternative minor state of oxidized nDsbD</title><p>The alternative minor state of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>, which we detected by NMR relaxation dispersion, can also be attributed to coupling between the dynamics of the active-site cysteine residues and the cap loop. In this alternative minor state, the C103 and C109 side chains likely adopt a 'reduced-like' conformation. Both side chains adopt a gauche- conformation (χ<sub>1</sub> ~ −60<sup>o</sup>) in nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>, but a trans conformation (χ<sub>1</sub> ~ 180<sup>o</sup>) in nDsbD<sub>red</sub>. In MD simulations of both redox states, rare excursions of one or the other χ<sub>1</sub>, but never both, to the alternative conformation are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C/F</xref>). We postulate that in the minor state of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>, both of the cysteine side chains adopt the 'reduced-like' trans conformation. In this state, the cap loop could pack tightly onto the active-site disulfide bond, as observed in MD simulations of nDsbD<sub>red</sub>. The backbone <sup>15</sup>N chemical shifts of this minor state consequently resemble those of the reduced protein. Model building of a disulfide bond into the reduced 3PFU crystal structure followed by energy minimization with XPLOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunger, 1992</xref>) showed that the resulting 'oxidized' structure maintains the 'reduced-like' trans conformation (χ<sub>1</sub> ~ −140<sup>o</sup>) for the cysteine side chains and the gauche- conformation for F70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

We generated an nDsbD protein with a truncated cap loop in which the eight residues H66-K73 were replaced by A-G-G (Δloop-nDsbD). The X-ray structure of oxidized Δloop-nDsbD shows that deletion of the cap loop does not cause any significant changes in structure; a Cα RMSD of 0.25 Å is obtained for residues 12–122 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6s2sdata1">Figure 6—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>). Nevertheless, in the absence of F70, the shorter cap loop can no longer closely pack onto the disulfide bond. As a result, no relaxation dispersion is detected in the truncated cap loop variant, as shown for W65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). For A104 (A99), a much sharper amide peak is observed in the HSQC spectrum of Δloop-nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> and this residue shows a flat dispersion profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Importantly, the <sup>1</sup>H<sup>N</sup>-<sup>15</sup>N peaks for C103 (C98) and C109 (C104), which are not observed in the wild-type oxidized protein, can be detected for Δloop-nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>. Finally, <sup>15</sup>N relaxation dispersion profiles for these cysteines are also flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Thus, truncation of the cap loop alters the μs-ms dynamics of the cap-loop region and the active-site cysteines, further supporting our proposed model of tight coupling between the cap loop and active-site cysteines.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have studied oxidized and reduced nDsbD using NMR experiments and microsecond duration MD simulations, and have demonstrated that the conformational dynamics of the active-site cysteines and the cap loop are coupled and behave in an oxidation-state-dependent manner. We showed that the cap loop is rigid in nDsbD<sub>red</sub>, whilst it exhibits more complex dynamics in nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although the cap loop is predominately closed and ordered in both oxidation states, for nDsbD<sub>red</sub> we found no evidence for a significant population with an open cap loop. Our results argue that the cap loop of nDsbD<sub>red</sub> remains closed at all times, to protect the active-site cysteine thiol groups from non-cognate reactions in the oxidizing environment of the periplasm. As such, the nDsbD<sub>red</sub> cap loop may only open to expose the cysteine thiols via an induced-fit mechanism when it encounters its legitimate binding partners, for example CcmG, DsbC and DsbG. In nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>, on the other hand, the cap loop opens spontaneously in MD simulations and while fully open conformations of the cap loop tended to close, partially open structures were stable. Thus, nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> may form a complex with its sole legitimate binding partner, cDsbD<sub>red</sub>, via a conformational selection mechanism. Notably, NMR relaxation dispersion experiments provided no evidence for a long-lived open or disordered conformation of the cap loop as might have been expected. Instead, a minor state with a 'reduced-like' conformation in the active site and cap loop is observed solely for nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>.</p><p>Importantly, combining NMR experiments and MD simulations, we showed how local frustration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferreiro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferreiro et al., 2011</xref>) in nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>, but not in nDsbD<sub>red</sub>, gives rise to differences in the dynamics of the two redox isoforms, on multiple timescales, providing insight into how this could affect protein function. Local frustration has been highlighted in the interaction interfaces of many protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferreiro et al., 2007</xref>), where mutually exclusive favorable interactions result in a dynamic equilibrium of competing structures and determine which parts of a protein are flexible. In nDsbD<sub>red</sub>, the cap loop packs perfectly onto the active-site cysteines and the closed conformation is stable, something that is crucial in the very oxidizing environment in which the domain has to provide electrons. By contrast, in nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>, the disulfide bond disrupts this tight fit of the aromatic ring of F70. Consequently F70 is no longer locked in a single conformation and switches freely between gauche- and trans orientations. This results in increased flexibility for both F70 and Y71 and drives occasional opening of the cap loop, which in this oxidation state might facilitate nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> receiving electrons from its partner. This is further enabled by a possible role of Y71 in preventing rapid loop closing. The observation from sequence alignments that the general architecture of the cap-loop region in β- and γ-proteobacteria is conserved, highlights that our observations in <italic>E. coli</italic> nDsbD can be generalized for many other bacterial species where reductant provision is driven by DsbD in the cell envelope.</p><p>Overall, our results show that it is the oxidation state of the cysteine pair in nDsbD that acts as a 'switch' controlling the presence or absence of local frustration in its active site. This oxidation-state-dependent 'switch' determines the dynamic behavior of the cap loop which translates into optimized protein-protein interaction and biological activity. We propose that redox-state modulation of local frustration, such as that observed here for nDsbD, may play a wider role in biomolecular recognition in other pathways involving redox proteins which are ubiquitous in all organisms. Ultimately, the understanding gained from studies like this would allow controlled introduction of frustration, mimicking intricate natural systems such as DsbD, for more translational applications such as the production of synthetic molecular devices.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>DSBD</td><td/><td>DSBD_ECOLI</td><td>UniprotID P36655</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21(DE3)</td><td>Stratagene</td><td/><td>Competent cells</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pDzn3</td><td>DOIs:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12104-011-9347-9">10.1007/s12104-011-9347-9</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M805963200">10.1074/jbc.M805963200</ext-link></td><td>N-terminal domain of DsbD (nDsbD) (L2-V132)</td><td>Plasmid for wild-type nDsbD expression</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pDzn8</td><td>This study.</td><td>nDsbD (L2-V132) with residues H66-K73 replaced by AGG</td><td>Plasmid for Δ-loop nDsbD expression</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Δ-loop nDsbD</td><td>This study.

&quot;Local frustration determines loop opening during the catalytic cycle of an oxidoreductase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>There is general enthusiasm for this work and agreement that it is carefully done, providing a nice example of the synergy between solution NMR and MD. Combining these two modalities to elucidate how frustration influences dynamics that in turn influences function is of great interest, and the fact that differences in levels of frustration could potentially affect the mechanism of interaction of the DsbD oxidoreductase, depending on the redox state is fascinating.</p><p>After careful consultation between all reviewers we have decided that a revised manuscript should focus on developing the mechanism by which frustration leads to loop opening. The authors have detailed MD simulations of what happens in frustrated (oxidized) and much less frustrated (reduced) systems and trajectories that lead to loop opening. But what is missing is an atomic description of how this is accomplished that careful analysis of your trajectories should supply. In addition, is frustration only characterized by the sidechain of F70 or are other residues involved – that is, could there be a path of frustration which is important for triggering loop opening?

Are the neighboring side-chains packed any differently in the different unit-cells of the crystal structures of Neisseria meningitides shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 (the unit cells with either F70 rotamer, and the open conformation)? What about in IVRS X-ray structure?

To this end, please find below an explanation of the general approach we have taken in order to analyze our MD trajectories and address this question, as well as our detailed replies to the specific points raised by the reviewers.</p><p>As the assessment of the reviewers was generally positive, we have maintained the overall content and layout of our manuscript and, where appropriate, made changes in order to address any concerns raised. To address the main question of how/why the loop opens, we have added a substantial new section in the Results and Discussion entitled ‘Structural features of cap loop opening’ in which we present an in-depth analysis of the MD simulations and discuss the factors that contribute to cap loop opening. In the same section, we provide more characterization of nDsbD when the cap loop is open, and assess the drivers of cap loop closure. To support this new section, we have added one new main figure (Figure 5) and nine figure supplements. Our changes are highlighted in red in the file submitted as a ‘related manuscript file’. Furthermore, we have added two new authors to the manuscript that have provided additional data required to address the questions raised by the reviewers; Diego Gonzalez performed bioinformatics analysis and Emmanuel Saridakis carried out X-ray crystallography, both of which are now included in our revised manuscript. In addition, according to the journal’s instructions, we have added a Key Resources Table and converted our supplementary figures and tables into the <italic>eLife</italic> ‘figure supplement’ and ‘source data’ format.</p><p>To identify the determinants of cap loop motion, we have analyzed the MD simulation trajectories in detail and measured distances, torsion angles and hydrogen bonds between key nDsbD amino acids, as well as solvent accessibilities in different redox states of the protein. Our original manuscript showed the F70 ring to C109 Sγdistance, an indicator of cap loop opening, only for selected trajectories (in Figure 3), and presented a summary of overall distance distributions and overall distributions of the F70 χ1 angle in Figures 3D/H and 4B/C. For greater transparency, we have now included plots of the F70 ring to C109 Sγdistance and the F70 χ1 angle for the full 1μs trajectories for both oxidation states (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This is discussed in greater detail in response to Major Comment (5) below. We have also included data on the solvent accessibility of C103 and C109 Sγ in a 200 ns MD trajectory both for oxidized and reduced nDsbD (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), as further evidence that opening of the cap loop increases the exposure of the cysteines, which in the reduced state remain shielded. We have made minor changes to the text in the Results and Discussion to discuss these new data and figure supplements.</p><p>We analyzed the side chain positions in the closed <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> X-ray structures and in the MD simulations of <italic>E. coli</italic> nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> showing closed conformations, and found that in addition to alternative conformations for F66/F70, which we previously identified as local structural frustration, the side chain of F67/Y71 also adopts variable conformations, whilst other side chain and backbone positions are not affected. Therefore, the effects of structural frustration at F70 are quite localized in nDsbD but do affect Y71, something we had not reported in our original manuscript. It is interesting to note that our analysis shows that the χ1 torsion angles of F70 and Y71 are not correlated, which indicates that Y71 does not show the frustration identified for F70. This is discussed in more detail in the response to Major Comment (1) below.</p><p>We also analyzed the torsion angles of F70 and Y71, their positions relative to each other and to C109 in closed conformations prior to loop opening. We have added a new figure (Figure 5) which shows some of these parameters plotted from 65-105 ns of the major loop opening event (Figure 3F) and support this analysis with more detailed plots of additional parameters for the longer period of 60-200 ns in Figure 5—figure supplements 1, 2 and 3. The plots are complemented by structure ‘snapshots’ taken at various time points during the MD trajectory which help illustrate, in a way that is more accessible to non-MD specialists, how the structure in the vicinity of the cap loop and active site is changing prior to loop opening (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 5). Factors leading to loop opening have also been investigated in a further ~20 opening events of duration between 1 and 22 ns. To demonstrate that observations made for the major loop opening are not unique, we have also included a similar detailed analysis of a 22 ns loop opening event in Figure 5—figure supplement 4 and corresponding structural snapshots in Figure 5—figure supplement 5.</p><p>Our in-depth analysis shows that loop opening is not initiated from a single, specific conformation of the cap loop and active site. We find that opening can occur from either of the two frustrated conformers of F70, and can also happen concurrently with a change in the F70 χ1. Y71 is also found to adopt both the gauche- and trans χ1 conformations at the time of loop opening (see for example Figure 5—figure supplements 2 and 4). Prior to loop opening, F70 and Y71 sample a number of different conformations. This flexible and dynamic nature of the side chains of F70 and Y71 in the closed state is reflected in their RMSD observed during the MD trajectories which are higher for nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> than for nDsbD<sub>red</sub>. We propose that the existence of local structural frustration for F70 results in increased dynamics for both F70 and Y71, which leads to occasional loop opening in nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>. This is discussed in more detail in the response to Major Comment (3) below.</p><p>We have also analyzed torsion angles, distances and hydrogen bonding after cap loop opening in order to gain a better understanding of the types of conformations that are sampled and are important for full loop opening. After opening the loop can adopt a range of more and less open conformations; these are discussed in the subsection “Structural features of cap loop opening”and illustrated in Figure 5 and its figure supplements. We have extended our analysis to the backbone torsion angles of cap loop residues in the closed and open states of the loop. Clear changes upon loop opening are observed for the φ and ψ values of D68, E69, F70, Y71 and G72 (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). These are correlated with the loss of a hydrogen bond between the Y71 HN and D68 Oδ; this is discussed in the subsection “Structural features of cap loop opening”. Finally, by performing a careful analysis of the MD trajectories we discovered another potentially important role for Y71 coming into play after loop opening. Y71 is found occasionally to adopt ‘blocking’ conformations in which is sits between F70 and C109 and prevents the loop from closing; this would prevent rapid loop closure and might facilitate the interaction of nDsbd<sub>ox</sub> with cDsbD<sub>red</sub>. In the light of the important roles played by both F70 and Y71, we investigated the conservation of these residues using bioinformatics (Figure 5—figure supplement 6). This analysis shows a high level of conservation of both these residues, and in particular Y71.</p><p>Overall, we have analyzed a large number of distances and torsion angles in order to identify the structural determinants of cap loop opening. An alternative could have been to adopt a statistical data analysis approach (Peters and Trout, J. Chem. Phys, 2006, Vreede et al. 2010, PNAS, Okazaki et al. Nat Commun. 2019) or a machine learning approach (Jung et al. ArXiv 2019) in order to extract mechanisms from the MD trajectories. However, these approaches typically require a very large number of transition events (&gt;&gt; 50) to identify such features from the data alone. Loop opening in nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> is a complex process; it is not a simple two-state transition from a single closed conformation to a single open one. Instead, it can occur from a number of different closed conformations in which the side chains of F70 and Y71 can adopt numerous orientations. The open state is also conformationally highly diverse, with the loop opening to different extents and loop closing occurring from several different open conformations. Some opening events observed in our 1μs trajectories are very transient (&lt; 1 ns), while others are much longer lived (22 ns and &gt; 120 ns). In our analysis, we considered ~20 different spontaneous opening events. This is not a large enough number of openings to apply the statistical data analysis or machine learning approaches. MD simulations run for much longer than the 1μs reported here would be required in order to adopt this approach; this is well beyond the scope of the current study, especially in the light of the constraints imposed by the current global pandemic. Nonetheless, we are confident that the rigorous descriptive and structurally based approach we have adopted is relevant here. It has unveiled consistent trends and has provided important insights into the mechanism of loop opening, which along with our previously submitted analysis of frustration significantly advance our understanding of the mechanism of reductant transfer in nDsbD. Importantly, prior structural knowledge, as we present here, can greatly aid in any future data driven approaches (Okazaki et al.Nat Commun.2019) and can be critical to assess the results from purely automatic approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What are the &quot;knock-on&quot; effects of the F70 frustration on neighboring side-chains and backbone conformation?

Are the neighboring side-chains behaving differently in the MD simulations that adopt a semi-open conformation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed further analysis of the X-ray structure of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> nDsbD and found that the alternative ‘frustrated’ conformations observed for the side chain of F66 (homologous to F70) were accompanied by variable positions for the side chain of F67 (homologous to Y71); the positions of both these residues are now illustrated in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. No other side-chain rotamer distributions are perturbed in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> nDsbD by the alternative positions for F66, nor is the backbone significantly perturbed.</p><p>This observation for <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> nDsbD indicated that we should look at the behaviour of the side chain of Y71 (the residue homologous to F66) in our MD simulations. Like F70, Y71 also samples both gauche- and trans χ1 conformers. However, unlike F70 which shows an almost equal distribution between the two χ1 conformations in the MD simulations, Y71 shows a preference for the gauche- conformation (86% in closed structures, 78% in open structures). Interestingly, we observe that there is no correlation between the χ1 values of F70 and Y71; the less common Y71 trans conformer is observed for both frustrated F70 conformers. This is discussed in the subsection “Structural features of cap loop opening” and the lack of correlation in the χ1 values of F70 and Y71 is illustrated in the plots shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Figure 5—figure supplement 4. As in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> nDsbD, we also found that in the closed structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> no other side-chains are perturbed by the sampling of gauche- and trans rotamers by F70 and Y71.</p><p>The reviewer asks about side-chain packing in the crystal structure of oxidized <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> nDsbD. The side chains of F66/F67 are found at the surface of the nDsbD structure and in proximity to F66/F67 of other molecules in the unit cell and in neighbouring unit cells. F66/F67 of molecules A and B are in close proximity to each other within the unit cell, while F66/F67 in molecule C are close to F66/F67 in molecule F in a neighbouring unit cell; these 4 molecules all show a closed loop conformation. F66/F67 in molecule E, which is the only molecule with an open loop conformation, are close to F66/F67 in molecule D, which has a closed loop, in a neighbouring unit cell. Although the crystal contacts may stabilize the F66/F67 side chain positions, the striking similarity between these conformations and the conformations found for F70/Y71 in our MD simulations strongly suggests that <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> nDsbD does sample these conformations in solution and that a variety of them got ‘trapped’ during the crystallization process. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that only a single closed conformation is observed in the crystal structure of reduced <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> nDsbD. In the <italic>E. coli</italic> 1VRS structure, the nDsbD cap loop is in an open conformation not because of crystal contacts but because nDsbD is in complex with cDsbD; the same loop conformation is observed for both complexes in the unit cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is it just 1 trajectory that shows the quasi-open state transition? If it is, can authors point to the differences in this trajectory that stabilize this state relative to the other trajectories?</p></disp-quote><p>The ~120 ns cap loop opening highlighted in Figure 3F is the major loop opening event we observed in the 1 μs MD simulations of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>, but it is not the only opening event. This was not clear in our original manuscript and we have clarified this in the revised version. We have added a figure supplement to Figure 3 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) in which we show the F70-C109 distance in the 600 ns of trajectories not shown in Figure 3 (for both oxidized and reduced states). Very short-lived loop openings such as those observed in Figure 3E are also observed in these additional trajectories for nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>, along with ~20 loop opening events with a duration of at least 1 ns and a F70-C109 distance of at least 10 Å; this is discussed in the Results and Discussion. The longest of these additional opening events (~22 ns shown in the middle right-hand panel of Figure 3—figure supplement 2) is analyzed in more detail in Figure 5—figure supplements 4 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Based on the above analyses do any of the conformations of the other side-chains seem important for loop opening? Can the authors postulate on a mechanism for opening?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above in Major Comment (1), we find that Y71, like F70, samples both gauche- and trans χ1 conformers in the MD simulations, but the values for the two residues are not correlated. As discussed in Major Comment (4) below, loop opening does not occur from only one of the frustrated F70 χ1 conformers. Instead, we find that the increased dynamics of F70 and Y71 and the relative orientation of F70 and Y71 to each other and to C109 are important for cap loop opening. The sequence of events leading to the major loop opening shown in Figure 3F is analyzed in depth in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplements 1, 2, 3. More specifically, although the cap loop remains closed from 60-80 ns, the side chains of both F70 and Y71 sample a number of different conformations. Uncorrelated changes in their side chain torsion angles can occasionally bring the F70 and Y71 rings closer together than observed in the 1L6P X-ray structure, whilst at other times the ring of Y71 transiently moves into more exposed conformations. This flexible and dynamic nature of the side chains of F70 and Y71 in the closed state is reflected in their RMSD during the MD trajectories, compared to the equilibrated X-ray structures. In the nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> 1 μs trajectories, F70 and Y71 have RMSDs of 2.8 ± 0.8 and 2.6 ± 0.7 Å, respectively when the loop is closed (F70-C109 &lt; 6 Å). By contrast, these RMSD values are 1.7 ± 0.6 and 1.6 ± 0.8 for F70 and Y71, respectively in nDsbD<sub>red</sub> trajectories. Taking these observations together, we propose that the existence of local structural frustration for F70 results in increased dynamics for both F70 and Y71, which leads to occasional loop opening in nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>. In addition, by analyzing the open parts of the MD trajectories and trajectories starting from an open loop conformation, we find another important role for Y71. This residue is found occasionally to adopt ‘blocking’ orientations in which is sits between F70 and C109 and prevents the loop from closing; this may prevent rapid loop closure and facilitate the interaction of nDsbd<sub>ox</sub> with cDsbD<sub>red</sub>. In the light of the important roles played by F70 and Y71, we investigated the conservation of these residues using bioinformatics (Figure 5—figure supplement 6). This analysis shows a high level of conservation of both these residues (especially Y71) suggesting that our observations are relevant across many bacterial species. Overall, the roles of F70 and Y71 in cap loop motion are discussed in the subsection “Structural features of cap loop opening”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Which conformation of F70 do they authors hypothesize is more likely to result in loop opening? Are there any other concerted structural changes that they think are important?</p></disp-quote><p>We investigated whether cap loop opening is linked directly to one of the two frustrated F70 χ1 conformers, something that would be the most natural assumption. The major cap loop opening of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub> at 82.5 ns in Figure 3F coincides with a change of the F70 χ1 from gauche- to trans. To study this further, we focused on several shorter cap loop opening events occurring during the 1 μs trajectory of nDsbD<sub>ox</sub>. We observed twenty events with a duration of at least 1 ns and a F70-to-C109 distance of at least 10 Å, which we used to assess the F70 conformation at the point of loop opening. In only one of these events does F70 undergo a similar gauche- to trans transition at the point of opening. Fourteen of the openings start from F70 in the trans conformer, while five openings start from the gauche- conformer. Therefore, loop opening is not coupled to a specific F70 χ1 conformer, although more loop openings occur from the trans conformer. This is discussed in the subsection “Structural features of cap loop opening”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I think it can be a bit misleading to pool the statistics of 5 independent trajectories into a single figure. I would like to see all of the individual distributions from different trajectories (The histograms from Figure 3 and Figure 4) in supplementary figures so it’s more clear if we're observing transitions between states, or observing 1 of the 2 states in each trajectory.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making this very important point. Here we pool the statistics of 14 independent trajectories starting from the same starting structure, and differing only in their initial velocities. In this case, pooling the statistics from independent trajectories is permissible, since running multiple simulation trajectories from the same structure can give superior results compared to running a single long trajectory (Knapp et al., JCTC, 2018). More generally, in the case of independent simulations started from different structures, pooling is of course only possible with further modeling, e.g., employing a Markov-state model (Swope et al., J. Phys Chem. B, 2004, Stelzl and Hummer, JCTC 2017, Stelzl et al., JCTC 2017) or a diffusion model (Hummer, New J. Phys., 2005).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the individual distributions of the different simulation trajectories are potentially informative and, thus have added figure supplements that complement Figures 3 and 4. In Figure 3—figure supplement 2, we show the F70-C109 distance for the additional 600 ns of trajectories that are not shown in Figure 3 (for both reduced and oxidized nDsbD). These give a clear illustration of the distribution of closed and open loop structures (as assessed by the F70-C109 distance) that is summarized in Figure 3D/H. Figure 3 and this figure supplement illustrate further that the cap loop of oxidized nDsbD is highly dynamic in multiple different trajectories and opens many times (see response (2) above), while reduced nDsbD features a rigid closed cap loop.</p><p>Further, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 shows the F70 χ1 angle plotted for the full 1μs trajectories of both reduced and oxidized nDsbD; the distributions in Figure 4B/E are based on these data. This new figure shows that the F70 side chain interconverts frequently between the gauche- and trans conformations in oxidized nDsbD. By comparing this supplement to Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2, it becomes clear that these interconversions of F70 χ1 occur in both the closed and open conformations. In the legend of this new figure supplement we state the % of the gauche- and trans conformers in closed versus open structures for oxidized nDsbD. It can also be seen that virtually no transitions are observed for reduced nDsbD (the exception is briefly at ~100 ns in the top panel).</p><p>Finally, the new figure, Figure 5, and several of its supplements (Figure 5—figure supplements 1-5) provide detailed distance and angle information for the two longest (~120 ns and ~20 ns) loop opening events.</p></body></sub-article></article>
