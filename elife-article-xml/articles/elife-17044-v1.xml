the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link>, we published a Registered Report (Kandela et al., 2015) that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper “Discovery and Preclinical Validation of Drug Indications Using Compendia of Public Gene Expression Data“ (Sirota et al., 2011). Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that cimetidine treatment in a xenograft model using A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells resulted in decreased tumor volume compared to vehicle control; however, while the effect was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 4C; Sirota et al., 2011), it was not statistically significant. Cimetidine treatment in a xenograft model using ACHN renal cell carcinoma cells did not differ from vehicle control treatment, similar to the original study (Supplemental Figure 1; Sirota et al., 2011). Doxorubicin treatment in a xenograft model using A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells did not result in a statistically significant difference compared to vehicle control despite tumor volume being reduced to levels similar to those reported in the original study (Figure 4C; Sirota et al., 2011). Finally, we report a random effects meta-analysis for each result. These meta-analyses show that the inhibition of A549 derived tumors by cimetidine resulted in a statistically significant effect, as did the inhibition of A549 derived tumors by doxorubicin. The effect of cimetidine on ACHN derived tumors was not statistically significant, as predicted.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17044.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17044.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>drug retargeting</kwd><kwd>cimetidine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009827</institution-id><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Editors' Summary: This Replication Study has reproduced important parts of the original paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> (RP:CB) is a collaboration between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://centerforopenscience.org/">Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</ext-link> that seeks to address concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>) for a paper by Sirota et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>In 2011, Sirota et al. presented a computational approach to identify drugs that could be repurposed for alternative diseases. Cimetidine, an H2 receptor blocker used to treat gastric ulcers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kubecova et al., 2011</xref>), was predicted to be a therapeutic approach for lung adenocarcinoma. Using a xenograft model with the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line, cimetidine resulted in a statistically significant decrease in tumor volume on the last day of the experiment compared to vehicle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sirota et al., 2011</xref>). A decrease in tumor volume was also observed with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, a positive control therapy. Cimetidine treatment was also tested in mice implanted with the ACHN renal cell carcinoma cell line, which did not change tumor volume compared to vehicle control. This was in agreement with the prediction and demonstrated specificity of the approach by Sirota and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sirota et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The Registered Report for the paper by Sirota et al. described the experiments to be replicated (Figure 4C–D and Supplemental Figure 1), and summarized the current evidence for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>). The outcome measures reported in this Replication Study will be aggregated with those from the other Replication Studies to create a dataset that will be examined to provide evidence about reproducibility of cancer biology research, and to identify factors that influence reproducibility more generally.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17044.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tumor xenograft experiment testing efficacy of cimetidine in inhibiting the growth of tumors in SCID mice.</title><p>Female SCID mice bearing subcutaneous A549 human lung adenocarcinomas (<bold>A</bold>) or ACHN renal cell carcinomas (<bold>B</bold>) were randomized into three treatment groups once tumors reached a calculated volume of 100 mm<sup>3</sup>.

This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 4C–D and Supplemental Figure 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sirota et al., 2011</xref>. Tumor volume was determined by caliper daily for the duration of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the original study included three doses of cimetidine in the experimental design, this replication attempt was restricted to only the highest dose (100 mg/kg). Tumors from A549 cells treated with cimetidine grew to an average of 2.37 times their original volume by day 11 [n=13, <italic>SD</italic>=0.723], similar to the ~2.3 times reported in the original study. This is in comparison to tumors from A549 cells treated with vehicle, which grew to an average of 3.29 times their original volume by day 11 [n=14, <italic>SD</italic>=1.17], similar to the ~3.3 times reported in the original study. Tumors from ACHN cells treated with vehicle or cimetidine grew to an average of 2.96 [n=15, <italic>SD</italic>=0.952] or 3.37 [n=15, <italic>SD</italic>=1.50] times their original volume by day 11, respectively. ACHN derived tumors were similar in volume compared to tumors from A549 cells treated with vehicle in this study. This differed from the tumor volumes reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sirota et al., 2011</xref>, which were ~2.1 and ~2.0 times the original volume in tumors from ACHN cells treated with vehicle or cimetidine, respectively, compared to ~3.3 times the original volume in tumors from A549 cells treated with vehicle. Additionally, the relative standard deviation (RSD) associated with this replication attempt (A549 – vehicle treated = 35.6%; A549 – cimetidine treated = 30.5%; ACHN – vehicle treated = 32.1%; ACHN – cimetidine treated = 44.5%) was generally larger than the RSD observed in the original study (A549 – vehicle treated = 17.0%; A549 – cimetidine treated = 35.5%; ACHN – vehicle treated = 10.3%; ACHN – cimetidine treated = 12.0%), however, the range of RSD among the conditions was more consistent in this replication attempt compared to the original study.</p><p>There are multiple approaches that could be taken to explore these data (e.g. MANOVA, regression with RE/AR errors, area under the curve), however to provide a direct comparison to the original analysis, which used volume measurements at day 11, and the available original data, we are reporting the analysis specified <italic>a priori</italic> in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>). To test if cimetidine is effective in the A549 derived xenograft model, but not in the ACHN derived xenograft model, we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) having two levels of tumors (A549 derived or ACHN derived) and two levels of drug treatment (vehicle or cimetidine). The ANOVA result on tumor volumes at day 11 (natural log-transformed) was not statistically significant for all effects at the 0.05 significance level. The interaction effect, with a sample size powered <italic>a priori</italic> to detect the effect based on the originally reported data, was not statistically significant, <italic>F</italic>(1,53) = 3.88, <italic>p</italic>=0.054. Thus, the null hypothesis that the effect of the drug treatment (difference between vehicle and cimetidine) on inhibiting tumor volume growth is similar for A549 and ACHN derived tumors can not be rejected. The main effect for cell line, <italic>F</italic>(1,53) = 1.21, <italic>p</italic>=0.277, and drug treatment <italic>F</italic>(1,53) = 1.13, <italic>p</italic>=0.292 were also not statistically significant.</p><p>As outlined in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>), we planned to conduct three comparisons using the Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons. Although the Bonferroni method is conservative, it was accounted for in the power calculations to ensure sample size was sufficient. The planned pairwise comparison of the tumor volumes from A549 derived tumors treated with vehicle compared to cimetidine was not statistically significant (<italic>t</italic>(53) = 2.16, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.035, <italic>a priori</italic> Bonferroni adjusted significance threshold = 0.0167; (Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>=0.105)). Additionally, the planned pairwise comparison of ACHN derived tumors treated with vehicle compared to cimetidine was not statistically significant (<italic>t</italic>(53) = −0.58, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.562, a prior Bonferroni adjusted significance threshold = 0.0167; (Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.99)). While not statistically significant, the treatment of A549 derived tumors with cimetidine resulted in decreased tumor volume compared to vehicle control at day 11, which is in the same direction as the original study. The treatment of ACHN derived tumors with cimetidine did not result in an observational difference in tumor volume after treatment when compared to vehicle control treated tumors, similar to the original study.</p><p>As an additional control for tumor growth inhibition, tumors from A549 cells were treated with 2 mg/kg doxorubicin, similar to the original experimental design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While tumors from A549 cells treated with vehicle grew to an average of 3.29 times their original volume by day 11, tumors in mice treated with doxorubicin grew to an average of 1.87 times the original volume by day 11 [n=4, <italic>SD</italic>=0.845], similar to the ~2.0 times, reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sirota et al., 2011</xref> in the doxorubicin condition. Analysis of vehicle treated compared to doxorubicin treated tumor volumes at day 11, which was planned <italic>a priori</italic>, was not statistically significant (Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>t</italic>(6.73) = 2.68, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.0325, <italic>a priori</italic> Bonferroni adjusted significance threshold = 0.0167; (Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>=0.0976)). While not statistically significant, the treatment of tumors from A549 cells with doxorubicin resulted in a smaller volume when compared to vehicle control at day 11, which is in the same direction as the original study. Additionally, mice treated with doxorubicin started to lose weight and had a rough coat starting on approximately day 7 of the treatment schedule. A small reduction in tumor volume compared to vehicle control has also been reported in other studies that utilized low dose doxorubicin experimental designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hossain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lopez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Wang et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2010</xref>).</p><p>At the completion of the treatment schedule, tumors were excised and imaged (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/xcuh6/">https://osf.io/xcuh6/</ext-link>), similar to the representative A549 derived tumors treated with vehicle or 100 mg/kg cimetidine shown in Figure 4D of the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sirota et al., 2011</xref>). The excised tumors were also weighed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), as described in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>). This was an additional measured parameter not included in the original study. The tumor weights were subjected to a two-way ANOVA having two levels of cell lines (A549 derived or ACHN derived), two levels of treatment (vehicle or cimetidine), and their interaction. The main effect of cell lines yielded an <italic>F</italic> ratio of <italic>F</italic>(1,53) = 7.560, <italic>p</italic>=0.00814, indicating that the mean tumor weight was significantly larger for A549 derived tumors [n=27, <italic>M</italic>=0.138, <italic>SD</italic>=0.0423] than for ACHN derived tumors [n=30, <italic>M</italic>=0.108, <italic>SD</italic>=0.0402]. The main effect of treatment was not significant (<italic>F</italic>(1,53) = 0.586, <italic>p</italic>=0.447) nor was the interaction effect (<italic>F</italic>(1,53) = 0.00005, <italic>p</italic>=0.994). Exploratory analysis of vehicle treated [n=14, <italic>M</italic>=0.134, <italic>SD</italic>=0.0444] compared to doxorubicin treated [n=4, <italic>M</italic>=0.110, <italic>SD</italic>=0.0576] A549 derived tumor weights was not statistically significant (Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>t</italic>(4.078) = 0.771, <italic>p</italic>=0.483). While not statistically significant, the treatment of tumors derived from A549 cells with doxorubicin resulted in a small effect (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.51 [−0.62, 1.63]), which is in the expected direction. A small reduction in tumor weight compared to vehicle control has also been reported in other studies that utilized a similar low dose doxorubicin experimental design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Biswas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hossain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lopez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17044.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Final tumor weights from xenograft experiment testing efficacy of cimetidine in inhibiting the growth of tumors in SCID mice.</title><p>At the end of the predefined study period (Day 12), tumors from the xenograft experiment reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> were excised and weighed.

Any known differences, including reagents and protocol differences, were identified prior to conducting the experimental work and described in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>). However, this is limited to what was obtainable from the original paper, which means there might be particular features of the original experimental protocol that could be critical, but unidentified. So while some aspects, such as site of injection, number of cells injected, strain of mice, and manufacturer of the drugs were maintained, others were unknown or not easily controlled for. These include variables such as circadian biological responses to therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fu and Kettner, 2013</xref>), mouse sex and strain stocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Clayton and Collins, 2014</xref>), the microbiome of recipient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Macpherson and McCoy, 2015</xref>), housing temperature in mouse facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kokolus et al., 2013</xref>), cell line drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>), and differing compound potency resulting from different stock solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kannt and Wieland, 2016</xref>).

Tumor (caliper measurements) and body weight (scale: Scout Pro O’Haus, model # SP202 (S/N: B443188875)) were measured three times a week before enrollment to reduce stress in the mice and were measured daily during the course of the experiment. Once the tumor reached 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, the mice were randomized into the treatment groups (vehicle (DPBS), 100 mg/kg cimetidine (dissolved in DPBS and pH adjusted and filtered through 0.22 µm syringe), or 2 mg/kg doxorubicin (dissolved in DPBS and filtered through 0.22 µm syringe)), taking into account the pre-specified group sizes. Two mice were not enrolled in the study due to unanticipated death and a small tumor size. Injections were administered via the intraperitoneal (IP) route using a 1 ml syringe (BD, cat # Z192090) with 27 gauge needles (BD, cat # 305109) as a repeat dose each day for cimetidine and twice a week for doxorubicin for 11 days with a dosing volume of 100 µl per 20 gram mouse. The volume of injection was calculated based on the total body weight obtained on the same day prior to injection. After repeat dosing for 11 days, all surviving animals were sacrificed 24 hr post last dose.

Without Bonferroni correction, the p-value is significant (p = 0.035) despite the larger error size. Please explain and discuss.</italic> </p><p>We performed Bonferroni correction because of the multiple comparisons (3 in total) that we performed on this experimental design. While this is a more conservative approach to adjust for multiple testing, we accounted for this in our power calculations to ensure the sample size was sufficient. The 2x2 design and the multiple planned contrasts was conducted to test the interaction, which the original study implies when they conclude that a statistically significant difference between vehicle and cimetidine in A549 and no difference between vehicle and cimetidine in ACHN is concordant with their computational prediction. However, the difference between significant and not-significant is not necessarily statistically significant (see: Gelman and Stern, 2006; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011), which is why the replication study designed and performed the statistical tests this way.</p><p>To allow readers to interpret the test results, we report the corrected and uncorrected p values. To further clarify why we performed the ANOVA and multiple comparison corrections we revised the manuscript to explain the analysis and how we accounted for the Bonferroni approach in our sample size calculations.</p><p> <italic>3) Please note that there are more effective models in which the curves can be easily fit by regression analysis (e.g. MANOVA or Regression with RE/AR errors).

We agree that different models to analyze the data could be used and we encourage others to explore the data this way. This is one of the reasons we are making our raw data available. However, for this specific project we have restricted our analysis to what we specified in the Registered Report and how the sample size was determined. The final caliper measurement was also the approach taken in the original paper. Also, during peer review of the Registered Report we proposed performing an exploratory analysis of all the data, but removed this as suggested by a reviewer since in vivo caliper measurements are noisy, especially with the earlier time-points when the tumors are smaller in size. We have revised the manuscript to communicate how multiple approaches could be taken, but we have limited our analysis to what we proposed.</p><p>We have also revised the manuscript to state the error of the measurements between the mice in this replication attempt, which generally had larger relative standard deviations compared to the original study. However, this replication was more consistent among the conditions compared to the original study. (Replication attempt: (A549 – vehicle treated = 35.6%; A549 – cimetidine treated = 30.5%; ACHN – vehicle treated = 32.1%; ACHN – cimetidine treated = 44.5%). Original study: (A549 – vehicle treated = 17.0%; A549 – cimetidine treated = 35.5%; ACHN – vehicle treated = 10.3%; ACHN – cimetidine treated = 12%)). Additionally, we have included a supplement figure for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which plots the data for each individual animal rather than the averages.</p><p> <italic>4) Please address the following minor issues. There are substantial variability sources in the study that may cause small effect changes. These include:</italic> </p><p> <italic>a) Drift in the A549 cell line: was this authenticated in the repeated study compared to the original one?</italic> </p><p>We confirmed the A549 and ACHN cells were correct by STR profile and free of mycoplasma and rodent pathogens. However, we do not know the profile of the original cell lines as these were not shared, nor was the source of the cell lines identified in the original study. We have included this aspect as a feature that might be critical, but unidentified at the end of the Results/Discussion section.</p><p> <italic>b) Different compound potency from different stock solutions: were titration curves performed to assess whether the EC50 of the compounds recapitulated those in the original study? This is especially critical since the growth curves at 50mg/kg and 100mg/kg were dramatically different.
