The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is thought to be responsible for processing and encoding distinct contextual associations in response to highly similar inputs. The mossy fiber (MF) axons of the dentate granule cells convey strong excitatory drive to CA3 pyramidal neurons and express presynaptic, PKA-dependent forms of plasticity. Here, we demonstrate an essential role for the PKA anchoring protein, AKAP7, in mouse MF axons and terminals. Genetic ablation of AKAP7 specifically from dentate granule cells results in disruption of MF-CA3 LTP directly initiated by cAMP, and the AKAP7 mutant mice are selectively deficient in pattern separation behaviors. Our results suggest that the AKAP7/PKA complex in the MF projections plays an essential role in synaptic plasticity and contextual memory formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20695.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20695.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>PKA anchoring</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>spatial discrimination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5-T32-GM007750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deem</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DA017392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castillo</surname><given-names>Pablo E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-MH081935</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castillo</surname><given-names>Pablo E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM032875</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKnight</surname><given-names>G Stanley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The PKA anchoring protein, AKAP7, localizes PKA in dentate granule mossy fibers and this localization plays an important role in contextual discrimination and cAMP-induced synaptic plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction </title><p>The hippocampal formation, which comprises the hippocampus and dentate gyrus (DG), plays a crucial role in the encoding and retrieval of episodic and spatial memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burgess et al., 2002</xref>). The DG receives input from the entorhinal cortex and sends its output via dentate granule cell (DGC) axons or mossy fibers (MFs) to synapse with proximal dendrites of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amaral et al., 2007</xref>). Previous theoretical studies predicted that one function of the DG is to accurately separate similar memories by orthogonally encoding discrete non-overlapping input patterns onto the CA3 field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee and Solivan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rolls, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). This precise form of encoding is known as pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilbert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kesner and Rolls, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakashiba et al., 2012</xref>). Behavioral studies have helped to clarify the role of the circuit between the DG and region CA3 in modulating spatial and contextual pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aimone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Myers and Scharfman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Treves et al., 2008</xref>). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to this functional role in pattern separation are incompletely understood.</p><p>Activity-dependent, long-term changes in synaptic transmission (e.g. long-term potentiation, LTP, and depression, LTD) within hippocampal circuits provide a basis for learning and memory. Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a key mediator of both pre- and postsynaptic forms of long-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kandel et al., 2014</xref>). A Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs) are multi-domain scaffolding proteins that localize PKA and other proteins to discrete subcellular domains and spatially restrict intracellular signaling events that are required for neuroplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dell'Acqua et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scott et al., 2013</xref>). We, and others, have shown that genetic deletion of a dendritic AKAP (AKAP5) results in delocalization of PKA from the postsynaptic dendrites of CA1 and CA3 hippocampal neurons and leads to behavioral defects in memory and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tunquist et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weisenhaus et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies have shown localization of PKA-RIIβ to MF projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glantz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weisenhaus et al., 2010</xref>) suggesting the presence of a presynaptic anchoring protein. However, no presynaptic AKAP has been previously reported in adult neurons. Moreover, a role for AKAPs in pattern separation has not been explored.</p><p>The MF-CA3 synapse is well-known for expressing a form of presynaptic, PKA-dependent, and NMDA receptor-independent LTP (herein referred to as MF-LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005</xref>). The molecular nature of this presynaptic LTP is not fully understood, although several protein targets have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castillo, 2012</xref>). A model for MF-LTP suggests that presynaptic calcium influx activates calcium-sensitive adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that produce cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to PKA activation and the phosphorylation of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villacres et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weisskopf et al., 1994</xref>). MF-LTP can be induced either synaptically by repetitive stimulation of MFs (tetanus) or by direct elevation of cAMP by the application of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) activator, forskolin. Previous studies using mice with defects in specific cyclases or subunits of PKA have suggested mechanistic differences in synaptic versus forkolin-induced LTP in this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wong et al., 1999</xref>). The role of sub-cellular localization of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway has not been addressed in DGCs and could play a critical role in both synaptic plasticity and contextual discrimination.</p><p>We report that AKAP7 (also referred to as AKAP15/18) is expressed in many regions of the brain including the hippocampus. In the hippocampal formation, AKAP7 is selectively expressed in DGCs and localizes to both dendrites and the MF presynaptic projections. Loss of AKAP7 results in delocalization of PKA-RIIβ from the MF projections. AKAP7 global KO mice demonstrate deficits in non-cued spatial and contextual pattern separation, behaviors that have been associated with DG function. Moreover, we deleted AKAP7 from DGCs and found that the behavioral deficits seen in the global KO are specific to the DG-CA3 pathway. Slice electrophysiology revealed that AKAP7 deficient animals were severely impaired in cAMP-induced MF-LTP. Our results identify AKAP7 as a unique AKAP that localizes PKA to axons and terminals of adult neurons and we demonstrate that AKAP7 functions to regulate both synaptic plasticity and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AKAP7 is highly expressed in dentate granule cells</title><p>The <italic>Akap7</italic> gene encodes multiple isoforms using two separate promoters to generate either long (γ/δ) or short (α) isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Only the final exon, containing the PKA-binding domain characteristic of AKAPs, is shared by all AKAP7 isoforms. The final exon also contains a modified leucine zipper domain which interacts with brain Na<sup>+</sup> and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and facilitates PKA modulation of ion conductance through these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marshall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tibbs et al., 1998</xref>). Long and short AKAP7 isoforms differ in subcellular localization. Long isoforms, γ/δ, are predominantly cytosolic, although they contain a potential nuclear localization sequence. Only the short α isoform contains N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation sites, facilitating plasma membrane association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 1998</xref>). The long isoforms are expressed in all tissues examined including brain but the short isoform is predominantly expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2012</xref>) and found in many regions of the brain including the hippocampus, cortex, striatum, thalamus and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Since the AKAP7 KO mice revealed a dramatic delocalization of PKA from MF projections, we reasoned that presynaptic PKA-dependent forms of long-term plasticity might be disrupted. To examine this possibility, we monitored MF-CA3 synaptic transmission and plasticity in acute hippocampal slices acquired from AKAP7 WT and KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Cyclic AMP-induced LTP, monitored with extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings, was nearly abolished in the AKAP7 KO mice when compared to WT littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To more directly measure presynaptic function at the MF-CA3 synapse, we performed whole-cell recordings of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) under experimental conditions designed to reduce polysynaptic contamination generated by associational-commissural inputs onto the CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwon and Castillo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005</xref>).

We also examined tetanus-induced LTP using whole cell recordings of NMDAR-EPSCs and found a similar result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since tetanus-induced LTP in the MF-CA3 pathway has previously been shown to be presynaptic and require PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weisskopf et al., 1994</xref>), we tested the possibility that compensation in AKAP7 KO mice might have produced a PKA-independent form of LTP. We pharmacologically inhibited PKA with H89 and observed that the tetanus-induced LTP in AKAP7 KO slices remained dependent on PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). A previous report found that presynaptic long-term depression (LTD) at MF-CA3 synapses also relies on cAMP/PKA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tzounopoulos et al., 1998</xref>). We therefore examined the AKAP7 KO and found that LTD was preserved in the AKAP7 KO mice compared with WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To determine if basal presynaptic function was altered in AKAP7 KO mice, we assessed short-term plasticity while monitoring NMDAR-EPSCs. All measured short-term plasticity dynamics, paired-pulse facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and frequency facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>) were comparable to WT controls. These results are consistent with our anatomical findings that deletion of AKAP7 does not cause gross changes in basal synaptic function. Collectively, our results suggest that cAMP-induced LTP requires high levels of localized PKA signaling in MF axons and presynaptic terminals, whereas tetanus-induced LTP does not.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Contextual pattern separation is impaired in AKAP7 KO mice</title><p>Disruption of DG function in mice has been shown to impair contextual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McHugh et al., 2007</xref>) and non-cued spatial forms of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert et al., 1998</xref>), commonly referred to as pattern separation. To test for alterations in contextual pattern separation in the AKAP7 KO mice, we first employed a contextual fear discrimination paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McHugh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakashiba et al., 2012</xref>). WT and KO animals received a foot-shock in ‘context A’ but not in ‘context B,’ where the two contexts differed only in the flooring and wallpaper. WT mice demonstrated intact contextual pattern separation because they rapidly learned that context B was comparatively safer and reduced their freezing behavior in context B after just one trial while retaining a robust freezing response in context A. However, AKAP7 KO mice took 7–8 trials to distinguish context B from context A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). The AKAP7 KO mice were also slightly delayed in extinction of freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), which is thought to involve inhibitory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Myers and Davis, 2007</xref>).

AKAP7α localizes PKA-RIIβ presynaptically in the axons and terminals of MF projections to the CA3 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. We used genetic disruption of AKAP7 first globally and then specifically in DGCs to explore the function of this presynaptic AKAP and the colocalized PKA. We find that loss of AKAP7 impairs the localization of PKA in the MF projections and leads to a defect in pattern separation behaviors that have been shown to depend specifically on DGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McHugh et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, we find that the AKAP7 KO displays a dramatic loss of cAMP-induced LTP at the MF-CA3 synapse.</p><p>There are multiple circuits in which presynaptic PKA has been shown to play an important functional role in synaptic plasticity including the hippocampal MF-CA3 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005</xref>), the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 2014</xref>), cortico-thalamic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castro-Alamancos and Calcagnotto, 1999</xref>), corticostriatal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spencer and Murphy, 2002</xref>) and the parallel fiber synapses in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salin et al., 1996</xref>). In the hippocampus, AKAP7α is primarily restricted to DGCs, although it is expressed in other brain regions including the cortex, striatum, thalamus and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In MF axons, AKAP7 is apparently the only anchor for PKA-RIIβ since the two proteins colocalize throughout the axons and terminals and the loss of AKAP7 results in delocalization of PKA-RIIβ and C subunits from these presynaptic projections as indicated by a strong reduction in immunofluorescence. In contrast, dendritic and cytoplasmic PKA-RIIβ increases in the AKAP7 KO. Dendritic PKA remains localized in the AKAP7 KO and is likely to bind other postsynaptic AKAPs including AKAP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanderson and Dell'Acqua, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tunquist et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weisenhaus et al., 2010</xref>), AKAP12 (gravin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Havekes et al., 2012</xref>) and MAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>). We do not know whether AKAP7 plays any specific role in dendrites that cannot be compensated for by these other AKAPs. The modest elevation in dendritic and somatic PKA in the AKAP7 KO could potentially compete for cAMP during postsynaptic signaling in response to perforant path stimulation from the entorhinal cortex, but this seems unlikely given the highly organized domain structure of PKA signaling complexes in the postsynaptic density.</p><p>Our understanding of the role of the DG in memory and learning has developed significantly over the past 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kesner and Rolls, 2015</xref>). Early studies found that colchicine induced lesions in the DG, but not CA1 regions of the hippocampus in rats, produced deficits in spatial discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilbert et al., 2001</xref>). Genetic disruption of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor specifically in DGCs results in a defect in discrimination between similar contexts (pattern separation) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McHugh et al., 2007</xref>). The discovery that neurogenesis is occurring in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and adult-born DGCs are constantly integrating into the DG circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altman and Das, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Praag et al., 2002</xref>) led to intensive efforts to understand the function of the DG and determine whether these adult born DGCs play a distinct role in contextual discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aimone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sahay et al., 2011</xref>). Although the mechanisms are not resolved, the studies indicate that adult born DGCs are preferentially involved in accurate pattern separation, and the mature DGCs are required for pattern completion or generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakashiba et al., 2012</xref>). We found that deleting AKAP7 did not affect adult neurogenesis, but the function of AKAP7 in pattern separation could preferentially involve these adult born DGCs. In summary, our study identifies an important functional role for AKAP-dependent subcellular localization of PKA in DGCs.</p><p>MF-LTP can be induced by repeated trains of tetanic stimulation or direct activation of cyclases with forskolin to elevate cAMP. Early efforts to understand the role of cAMP and its effectors in MF-LTP relied on pharmacological and genetic tools that affected cAMP and cAMP effectors throughout the DGCs. Bath application of PKA inhibitors during tetanus blocks the induction of MF-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weisskopf et al., 1994</xref>). The role of adenylyl cyclases was demonstrated by genetic deletion of the calcium-stimulated cyclases, AC8 and AC1. Deletion of AC1 or AC8 reduced tetanus-induced MF-LTP and the AC1/AC8 double KO completely eliminated tetanus induced LTP. It is interesting to note that the LTP induced by direct cyclase activation with forskolin was unaffected in the AC1/AC8 double KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wong et al., 1999</xref>) suggesting that forskolin is acting on another cyclase in the DGCs to induce LTP. Targeted disruption of either the Cβ or RIβ subunit gene of PKA inhibited tetanus-induced LTP at MF-CA3 synapses without decreasing cAMP-induced LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 1995</xref>). Recently, the contribution of another cAMP effector, Epac2, was examined. Epac2 is a cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rap1/2, and electrophysiological recordings from Epac2 KO mice demonstrate defects in both tetanus- and cAMP-induced MF-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernandes et al., 2015</xref>). These approaches clearly establish that cyclases, PKA, and Epacs are involved in the mechanisms that underlie MF-LTP, but do not provide an understanding of the importance of subcellular localization of signaling complexes in axons, soma or dendrites of DGCs. Our study demonstrates that AKAP7 anchors PKA in the axonal projections of DGCs and coordinates the cAMP-induced LTP pathway without affecting the PKA dependent, synaptically-induced MF-LTP. This surprising result suggests that localization of PKA could play a differential role in these two different modes of eliciting LTP. One possibility is that synaptically induced LTP is more dependent on the axonal transport of synaptic vesicle proteins that might be phosphorylated in the soma and delivered to the terminals. Rates for transport of these Golgi-derived vesicles are as high as 2–5 µm/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown, 2000</xref>), and they could therefore travel the ~1000 µm distance from the DGC body to the terminals and play a role in the sustained LTP seen 30–40 min after tetanic stimulation. Severing the MF axons near the DGC body prevents synaptically induced LTP without affecting cAMP-induced LTP further supporting a role for the cell body in maintenance of synaptically induced LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calixto et al., 2003</xref>). RI and RII isoforms of PKA have different anchoring characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Benedetto et al., 2008</xref>) with PKA-RI typically concentrated in the soma of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), while PKA-RIIβ is usually tightly anchored to AKAPs in dendrites and, in this study, axonal projections. This leads us to speculate that tetanus-induced LTP depends on PKA activation in the somatodendritic compartment and cAMP-induced LTP depends on PKA-RIIβ in the MF projections. The expression of AKAP7 in other brain regions suggests a possible PKA anchoring role in other presynaptic pathways where PKA-dependent LTP has been observed and our <italic>Akap7</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mouse line will facilitate these future studies.</p><p>Experience-induced changes in synaptic plasticity (LTP and LTD) are the most attractive cellular substrates to explain learning and memory, but it has been exceedingly difficult to make causal connections between synaptic plasticity and behavior. The function of the LTP mechanism that can be directly engaged by forskolin and is disrupted in the AKAP7 KO is unknown. One possibility is that direct activation of localized Gs-coupled receptors, cyclases and PKA in the axons and presynaptic terminals could alter the excitability of those MF projections and might act synergistically with perforant path induced DG excitation. Extrinsic neuromodulatory projections from the locus coeruleus terminate in the stratum lucidum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amaral et al., 2007</xref>) and may provide noradrenergic modulation of MF-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang and Kandel, 1996</xref>). There is evidence for synergism between the β-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, and repetitive synaptic stimulation of MF-LTP in slice culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang and Kandel, 1996</xref>). More recently, it has been observed that a weak tetanic stimulation of the MF-CA3 pathway <italic>in vivo</italic> can synergize with lateral ventricle administration of isoproterenol to elicit LTP lasting more than 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagena and Manahan-Vaughan, 2012</xref>). In addition, the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) receptor is highly expressed in DGCs and this Gs-coupled GPCR is localized to MF projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Otto et al., 1999</xref>). Targeted disruption of the PACAP receptor (<italic>Adcyap1r1</italic>) in neocortex and hippocampus led to deficits in both MF-LTP and contextual fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Otto et al., 2001</xref>). We propose that AKAP7-localized PKA provides an intracellular signaling mechanism to potentiate the actions of neuromodulators targeting G-protein-coupled receptors expressed specifically on the MF projections. DG dysfunction has been implicated in a wide range of psychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and addictive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Fuster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kheirbek et al., 2012</xref>). Our studies suggest that alterations in presynaptically anchored PKA can disrupt specific aspects of DG function and could play a role in these disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of Akap7 mutant mice</title><p>Generation of AKAP7 KO and floxed AKAP7 mouse lines was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2012</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Mary B Kennedy (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mark Dell'Acqua (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript shows convincingly that AKAP7, specifically, the α form of AKAP7, is expressed in the axons and mossy fiber terminals of dentate granule cells in the hippocampus, and that deletion of the AKAP7 gene leads to a dramatic loss of localization of the RIIβ form of PKA in the axons and terminals of DGCs located in stratum lacunosum. They go on to show that both global deletion of AKAP7 and a targeted deletion of AKAP7 in DGCs alone interferes with a specific behavior that has been shown to require the mossy fiber pathway, contextual pattern separation. Thus, the function of AKAP7, which is to localize RIIβ-PKA to DGC axons and terminals, is necessary for animals to display proper contextual pattern discrimination. This appears to be the first time that localization of a particular PKA isoform within neurons by an AKAP has been shown to influence a high level behavior. The study is elegantly done and very interesting. However, the reviewers have several suggested revisions that would improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors do not discuss earlier evidence about a mechanistic distinction between forskolin-induced and tetanus-induced LTP at the mossy fiber terminals until late in the discussion, leaving one reviewer temporarily puzzled about the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that shows a difference in the effect of AKAP7 deletion on LTP induced in these two ways. It would be preferable to move the discussion of the apparently different mechanisms underlying these two forms of presynaptic plasticity to the introduction, or at least to an introductory paragraph motivating the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. One important contribution of the study is the requirement for AKAP7 in direct cAMP induction of PKA-dependent MF-LTP, but not tetanus-induced MF-LTP (which is also PKA-dependent). The Discussion section makes this clear, and the work provides the impetus for future studies characterizing the different roles of AKAP-PKA signaling in DGC cell bodies versus MF terminals in plasticity regulation as well as roles for neuromodulators acting on local PKA signaling in axon terminals. However, for more general readers, this aspect of the study should be explained more explicitly in the Introduction, and results.</p><p>2) In the consultation following the reviews, one reviewer raised the point that the dramatic increase in PKA-RIIβ in the dendrites of the granule cells might act to inhibit PKA in these regions, such that the physiological increase in cAMP in the dendrites is insufficient to fully activate the enzyme. This might disrupt LTP induction, particularly late-LTP induction, in the perforant path-DG synapse. For example, four cAMP molecules are required to bind simultaneously to the dimer of R subunits to release active catalytic units, the increase in R2C2 complexes in the somas would have the effect of suppressing activation of PKA because the bound cAMP would be spread over more tetramers, and it would take more total cAMP to activate the same number of catalytic units. However, another reviewer pointed out that since most type II PKA signaling takes place in micro/nanodomains anchored to AKAPs, where cAMP concentrations are locally controlled by AC and PDE activities typically found in these same complexes, as opposed to free in the bulk cytoplasm, the extra Type II PKA in the DG neuron soma/dendrites of AKAP7KO mice is not likely to inhibit normal regulation of AKAP-anchored Type II PKA signaling in those locations. With AKAP anchoring sites likely already being fully occupied, the extra pool of Type II PKA will most likely be cytosolic and primarily found outside these AKAP-organized micro/nanodomains. Signaling by Type I PKA, either unanchored in the cytoplasm (where RI is usually more abundant than RII) or anchored to RI preferring AKAPs, is also not likely to be inhibited by competition for cAMP binding from extra cytosolic type II PKA, both because RI has a higher cAMP affinity than RII and RII is not likely to displace RI from the few known RI preferring AKAPs, which bind RI with greater affinity than RII. This is in contrast to the majority of other AKAPs that are RII preferring, like AKAP7. If the authors agree with this reasoning, the issue should be addressed in the discussion, along with the possibility that a change in plasticity at the DGC dendritic or somal synapses could contribute to the behavioral effect (Although this is less likely than the direct explanation.).</p><p>3) For the two <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and for the behavioral studies, it would be worthwhile to calculate a measure of effect size, such as Cohen's d, for differences between WT and KO's. The effects are significant, but small. Thus, a statement of Cohen's d, which should be larger than about 0.4, would give a more complete statistical picture of the data. In addition, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> comparisons should be against 50% chance to make sure the &quot;successful&quot; group tests are indeed better than 50%. Group comparisons are not enough. Also, the authors should add, in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, a genotype X test ANOVA comparison (e.g., testing% correct if the authors gave more than one test per mouse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>4) Although in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> it certainly appears that AKAP7 staining in WT mice overlaps more with MF axonal and presynaptic markers (NF-M; ZNT3; SYP) than dendritic and postsynaptic markers (MAP2; PSD-95), adding some quantification of relative AKAP7 co-localization with these markers is needed to support these claims. Likewise for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, some co-localization quantification should be provided to support the authors' statement that AKAP7 KO results in substantial loss of PKA-Calpha co-localization with NF-M.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20695.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors do not discuss earlier evidence about a mechanistic distinction between forskolin-induced and tetanus-induced LTP at the mossy fiber terminals until late in the discussion, leaving one reviewer temporarily puzzled about the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that shows a difference in the effect of AKAP7 deletion on LTP induced in these two ways.

Also, the authors should add, in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>,a genotype X test ANOVA comparison (e.g., testing% correct if the authors gave more than one test per mouse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</italic> </p><p>We have added a measure of effect size (Cohen's d) to the ephys data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (in the figure legends).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> we have added the complete data for the entire 5 day DNMP trial showing that WT and HET mice learn the most difficult 2-arm task and perform statistically better than 50% at days 4-5. The KO and DG-KO differ significantly from their control groups (WT and HET, respectively) by two-way ANOVA over the entire 5 day trial (details in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> legend). We also show the combined data for the test days (4-5) demonstrating a significant difference from respective control groups. We have added Cohen's d values to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> as well.</p><p><italic>4) Although in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> it certainly appears that AKAP7 staining in WT mice overlaps more with MF axonal and presynaptic markers (NF-M; ZNT3; SYP) than dendritic and postsynaptic markers (MAP2; PSD-95), adding some quantification of relative AKAP7 co-localization with these markers is needed to support these claims. Likewise for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, some co-localization quantification should be provided to support the authors' statement that AKAP7 KO results in substantial loss of PKA-Calpha co-localization with NF-M.</italic> </p><p>We have added colocalization values to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> using Image J and Coloc2 as described in the methods and in the figure legend. We note that the markers used to show colocalization were either axonal or terminal specific and AKAP7 is in both compartments giving only partial colocalization shown as intensity correlation quotients (ICQs). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> we also analyzed colocalization between NF-M and PKA C subunit using the same method.</p></body></sub-article></article>
