In the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> stomatal lineage, a transient self-renewing phase creates precursors that differentiate into one of two epidermal cell types, guard cells or pavement cells. We found that irreversible differentiation of guard cells involves RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) recruitment to regulatory regions of master regulators of stomatal initiation, facilitated through interaction with a terminal stomatal lineage transcription factor, FAMA. Disrupting physical interactions between FAMA and RBR preferentially reveals the role of RBR in enforcing fate commitment over its role in cell-cycle control in this developmental context. Analysis of the phenotypes linked to the modulation of FAMA and RBR sheds new light on the way iterative divisions and terminal differentiation are coordinately regulated in a plant stem-cell lineage.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03271.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03271.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03271.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stem cells in animals and plants help to make and replenish the tissues of the body by dividing and becoming specialized types of cells. Once specialized for a certain function, it is important that a cell keeps that function. In plant leaves, one type of stem cell makes two different types of specialized cells: pavement cells and stomatal guard cells. Pavement cells lock together to form a waterproof barrier to the outside, while guard cells surround the small pores that open and close to allow the plant to exchange water, oxygen and carbon dioxide with the atmosphere.</p><p>Once a cell becomes a pavement cell or a guard cell, it does not change its identity again. However, if a single cell is removed from a plant, it can revert to a stem cell and a whole new plant can be grown from it. This poses the question of how, in intact plants, specialized cells like pavement cells and guard cells are prevented from reverting to stem cells.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, a small flowering plant that is widely used as a model organism in research, a protein called FAMA is responsible for controlling a set of genes that turn stem cells into guard cells. Matos et al. have now found that FAMA needs to bind to another protein called RBR to control this process. It seems that these two proteins make the transition from stem cell to guard cell permanent by changing the structure of DNA in regions that control stem cell genes.</p><p>RBR is similar to a human protein called Retinoblastoma that helps prevent tumors and regulate stem cells, but how it actually performs these functions in humans is still debated. Because stem cells and guard cells are displayed on the surface of plant leaves and leave behind clues of their past, Matos et al. were able to watch stem cells grow up to be mature guard cells. When the partnership between FAMA and RBR was broken, it was possible to watch those same guard cells revert backwards into stem cells. Seeing development ‘rewind’ could provide useful insights into the way in which cell identity is controlled in both plants and animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03271.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03271.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>retinoblastoma</kwd><kwd>bHLH transcription factor</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>stomata</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM086632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matos</surname><given-names>Juliana L</given-names></name><name><surname>Lau</surname><given-names>On Sun</given-names></name><name><surname>Hachez</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bergmann</surname><given-names>Dominique C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001692</institution-id><institution>Croucher Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lau</surname><given-names>On Sun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hachez</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001491</institution-id><institution>Belgian American Educational Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hachez</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bergmann</surname><given-names>Dominique C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An adult stem-cell lineage terminally differentiates via recruitment of the RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED protein by a lineage specific transcription factor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants exhibit remarkable developmental plasticity and their cells are typically considered totipotent, in that a complete plant can be regenerated from nearly any isolated individual cell.

A prime example of a specialized lineage is in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaf epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) where asymmetric divisions of protodermal cells generate meristemoid mother cells (MMC) and meristemoids (M), self-renewing cells akin to transit amplifying cells in mammalian stem cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lau and Bergmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pillitteri and Dong, 2013</xref>). At the end of their renewing stages, these meristemoids differentiate into guard mother cells (GMCs), which undergo a single symmetric division to generate the paired guard cells (GCs) of the mature stomata. GCs and each of the intermediate stages leading to their formation are characterized by distinct morphologies and unique gene expression profiles, allowing experimental dissection of lineage progression in intact, developing organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lau and Bergmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pillitteri and Dong, 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03271.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FAMA and RBR physically interact and regulate guard cell division and differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of key stages in stomatal development mediated by bHLHs SPCH, MUTE and FAMA.

GMCs are made in <italic>fama</italic> mutants, but they fail to progress into GCs and instead continue dividing while maintaining expression of earlier fate markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, inset); this failure to make GCs results in seedling lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Overexpression of FAMA reprograms other cells into GC identity, while simultaneously repressing cell division to yield single-celled stomata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</xref>). The mechanisms by which FAMA regulates cell division and terminal differentiation are not known, but FAMA's direct targets include cell cycle regulators and genes associated with mature guard cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hachez et al., 2011</xref>). FAMA has been shown to act as a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</xref>) but can also participate in repression of certain cell cycle targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hachez et al., 2011</xref>). Here we show that FAMA is required for the irreversible differentiation of GCs and that it fulfills this role through recruitment of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Retinoblastoma homologue, RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR). Point mutations that disrupt FAMA-RBR interactions render FAMA capable of promoting initial GC identity, but unable to maintain commitment. By demonstrating FAMA-promoted binding of RBR to the regulatory regions of stomatal regulators whose genomic regions contain repressive chromatin marks, we define a molecular mechanism by which the ubiquitously expressed RBR is recruited to specific genomic contexts at specific times to regulate key developmental events.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>RBR is broadly expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> development and reduction of RBR activity has been correlated with excess division and loss of cell identity in many different contexts, including the early stomatal lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Borghi et al., 2010</xref>). In the epidermis of actively dividing young leaves, RBRp:RBR-CFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cruz-Ramirez et al., 2012</xref>) is expressed in all cell nuclei; as the leaf matures, expression becomes restricted to stomatal lineage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Mosaic co-suppression of the <italic>RBRp:RBR-CFP</italic> transgene leads to loss of fluorescence and concomitant excessive divisions in the CFP-minus sectors, suggesting that RBR represses cell divisions in both the early lineage and the terminally differentiated GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To examine RBR's role specifically in the GCs, we drove expression of artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) against RBR by the FAMA promoter. <italic>FAMAp:amiRNA-RBR</italic> GCs underwent inappropriate extra divisions oriented transverse to the long axis of the cells, while other epidermal cells were not affected, confirming a direct requirement for RBR in GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and confirming phenotypes reported using different amiRNAs directed against RBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>FAMA encodes a canonical RBR binding motif (LxCxE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</xref>) that is conserved among dicot FAMA orthologs, but not in FAMA's closest paralogs SPEECHLESS (SPCH) and MUTE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). LxCxE-dependent physical interaction between FAMA and RBR was tested by <italic>in planta</italic> Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and yeast two-hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) assays.

In the GCs of rescued FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> plants, however, we observed excessive cell divisions, changes in cell morphology, and, most strikingly, production of paired GCs inside of existing GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, phenotypic classes 6–11).</p><p>Phenotypes conferred by FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> and by manipulating RBR in the late stomatal lineage both involved increased cell division, but were not identical. To improve phenotypic resolution, we characterized the expression patterns of cell fate and cell cycle markers in FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> and <italic>FAMAp:amiRBR</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This detailed analysis revealed clear phenotypic differences between reducing RBR levels in GMCs and reducing RBR's interaction with FAMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Notably, the FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> phenotype results, not from chaotic or uncontrolled divisions and fate changes, but rather an orderly reiteration of stomatal lineage progression. This manifested itself as a progressive increase in phenotypic severity with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) and by the appearance of stomatal lineage markers in patterns suggesting that the GCs reverted to MMC identity and proceeded through the intermediate stages of the pathway normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Expression of stomatal-promoting transcription factors (SPCH, MUTE, FAMA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), stomatal-restricting signaling elements (TMM, EPF1, EPF2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>), and general division reporters (<italic>CDKA1;1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>) followed the normal temporal patterns, and ectopic GC divisions appeared to follow early lineage division rules. For example, when a ‘reprogrammed’ GC produced two stomata, they were separated by a non-stomatal cell, indicating that spacing divisions occurred. Distinct cell orientations characteristic of amplifying divisions were also visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Therefore it is plausible that, as the final master regulator bHLH in the stomatal pathway, FAMA (with RBR) ensures terminal differentiation of GCs by facilitating stable repression of early stomatal lineage genes. To test this model, we assayed the co-association of FAMA and RBR with regulatory regions of three key stomatal lineage genes that have significant H3K27me3 coverage (<italic>SPCH, FAMA and EPF1</italic>) and, as specificity controls, two cell cycle genes known to be RBR targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nowack et al., 2012</xref>). Because RBR is essential and expressed in nearly all cells, to accurately assay its role as a potential partner of FAMA in the stomatal lineage, we generated a Myc-tagged version of RBR expressed under the FAMA promoter (<italic>FAMAp:RBR-MYC</italic>). We confirmed that expression of this transgene did not alter stomatal development and that we could effectively immunoprecipitate it from plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In ChIP assays, <italic>SPCH</italic>, <italic>FAMA</italic> and <italic>EPF1</italic> were all targets of FAMA and of stomatal lineage-expressed RBR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Further dissection of the binding regions at <italic>SPCH</italic> and <italic>EPF1</italic> indicates that FAMA and RBR are enriched in the same pattern, suggesting that they bind as part of the same complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). We then tested the key prediction of our model–that association of RBR with a stomatal target gene is dependent on its interaction with FAMA. ChIPs of FAMAp:RBR-MYC in a FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> background showed that RBR enrichment at the promoters of <italic>SPCH</italic> and <italic>FAMA</italic>, but not of the general RBR target gene <italic>PCNA</italic>, was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), consistent with our recruitment model. RBR enrichment at the promoter of a negative regulator of stomatal development, <italic>EPF1</italic>, was more variable in our assays, sometimes showing little change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), but failing to associate with RBR in other replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>The association of FAMA and RBR with the <italic>SPCH</italic> locus is intriguing, as in normal development SPCH is required for initiation of the stomatal lineage and is essential for robust expression of all stomatal genes so far reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MacAlister et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pillitteri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kanaoka et al., 2008</xref>). In theory, failure of FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> to stably repress <italic>SPCH</italic> expression could, by itself, be sufficient to reinitiate the stomatal lineage program. If this were true, ectopic expression of SPCH in GCs should recapitulate the FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> phenotype. Expression of FAMAp:SPCH-YFP (or its hyperactive variants FAMAp:SPCH1-4A or FAMAp:SPCH2-4A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lampard et al., 2008</xref>]) in an otherwise WT background, however, did not mimic FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This suggests that competence to reinitiate the stomatal pathway requires more than expression of a single ‘trigger’ gene, but rather a more generally permissive expression state, a fact supporting a broader chromatin regulating role for the FAMA-RBR complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recently, physical associations between RBR and the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transcription factor SCARECROW (SCR) were found to be essential for modulating stem-cell behavior in the root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cruz-Ramirez et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2013</xref>). Both SCR and FAMA bind to RBR via an LxCxE motif, yet the consequences of these transcription factor/RBR interactions are different; RBR antagonizes SCR function in asymmetric division in the root stem cell compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cruz-Ramirez et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2013</xref>), whereas RBR and FAMA have similar functions promoting differentiation at the terminal stage of stomatal development. Yet, while different RBR/transcription factor complexes may be customized for unique developmental contexts, the underlying molecular mechanisms of gene regulation might be similar. As with FAMA targets, RBR is required for repression of SCR target genes and can associate with their promoter regions, but there have been no experiments addressing whether disrupting association of SCR and RBR affects either proteins' chromatin association. In this study, we provide key data in support of a specific molecular mechanism for transcriptional repression utilizing RBR in combination with cell-type specific transcription factors: first, we demonstrate, through cell-type specific ChIPs, that RBR is associated with the promoter of the stomatal lineage initiator <italic>SPCH</italic> in cells as they are committing to terminal fates and second, we show that this binding is reduced when RBR's interaction with FAMA is disrupted. Thus, our data provide strong support for RBR being recruited by cell-type specific transcription factors to lead to transcriptional repression of their targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>We observed significant changes in RBR association with <italic>SPCH</italic> and <italic>FAMA</italic> regulatory regions in FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> lines; however, RBR was still associated with the <italic>EPF1</italic> locus in some experimental replicates. This could indicate that there are FAMA-independent ways to recruit RBR to this site, or that our FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> manipulation does not eliminate all FAMA-RBR interactions in the endogenous complex. It is interesting, however, that EPF1 differs from SPCH and FAMA in being a repressor of stomatal development and thus alleviation of the repression of <italic>EPF1</italic> would be expected to antagonize reprogramming to a stomatal precursor identity.</p><p>The role of PRC2 complex protein CURLY LEAF (CLF) was recently investigated in connection to stomatal lineage termination and was found to promote the accumulation of H3K27me3 marks on early stomatal lineage genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014b</xref>). These data complement ours in connecting chromatin modification to stable acquisition of terminal cell identities in the stomatal lineage. Additionally, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014b</xref>) report phenotypes, similar to, but milder than those seen in FAMA<sup>LGK</sup>, caused by prolonged expression of a C-terminal GFP-tagged version of FAMA (FAMA<sup>trans</sup>). In a timepoint and tissue common to their data and this study (12 day old cotyledons), FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> plants display reprogramming of ∼80% guard cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) compared with 10% of FAMA<sup>trans</sup>. Lee et al. interpret reinitiation of divisions in guard cells as resulting from a gain of FAMA function, however, this interpretation is at odds with previously published data that FAMA overexpression limits cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hachez et al., 2011</xref>) and is difficult to reconcile with most models of chromatin-mediated repression of transcription. In light of our data showing that a loss of a specific FAMA activity (RBR binding) produces strong lineage reprogramming, we think a more parsimonious explanation of the FAMA<sup>trans</sup>-induced phenotype is that blocking of the FAMA C-terminus by addition of GFP creates a protein that dominantly interferes with FAMA-RBR interactions.</p><p>By independently manipulating RBR levels and RBR-FAMA interactions in terminally differentiating GCs, we could uncouple division and fate modulating roles of RBR. Notably, depletion of RBR in many contexts leads to hyperproliferation and derepression of cell cycle promoting genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Borghi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wachsman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weimer et al., 2012</xref>). This is in contrast to phenotypes that dominate when its association with FAMA is disrupted; namely that specific cell fates and division behaviors and their accompanying gene expression patterns re-emerge in an orderly pattern. RBRp:RBR-CFP itself becomes ectopically expressed in re-dividing FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> GCs. Were RBR to be playing its cell-cycle repressive role in this context, one would expect this ectopic expression might completely halt divisions. That the opposite occurs, however, suggests a qualitatively different role for RBR in combination with FAMA in these cells. Because <italic>RBR</italic> is expressed in all cells of the plant, it is difficult to measure whether our cell-type specific amiRNA completely eliminated <italic>RBR</italic> in guard cells, but our data suggest that RBR's cell-cycle repression activity is more sensitive to dosage than its activity modulating stomatal gene expression. Only by retaining RBR levels but disrupting the FAMA-dependent activity was a clear role for RBR in terminal differentiation unmasked.</p><p>In the balance between proliferation and differentiation, between developmental flexibility and robust fate commitment, several decades of cell culture and animal genetic knockout studies have placed Rb family proteins in key, if disputed, roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chinnam and Goodrich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sage, 2012</xref>). Regulation of the stomatal lineage can parallel that of stem cell populations in animals at cellular, developmental and molecular levels. Both plant stomatal and mammalian myogenic lineages, for example, employ series of paralogous bHLHs during fate specification and differentiation, and activities of these bHLHs are regulated through conserved upstream kinases and by association with Rb/RBR (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matos and Bergmann, 2014</xref>). Bound by immobile cell walls, stomatal lineage cells leave a record of their fate and division history in their marker expression and spatial arrangement on the leaf surface. This plant model, therefore, provides a unique opportunity to dissect cell division and cell fate activities of Rb and other conserved proteins during programming and reprogramming and is a powerful comparative system for future discoveries of fundamental regulatory mechanisms of stem cell initiation, maintenance and termination.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Columbia-0 (Col) was used as wild type in all experiments.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor), Richard Amasino (Reviewing editor), and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) Regarding the ChIP experiments, it would be useful to do some further analyses at higher resolution. It is unclear if the target sites amplified by qPCR overlap for RBR and FAMA at the present resolution. Furthermore, an important control that should be done for at least a few of the target genes, is to generate ChIP data across several neighboring regions to ensure that the peak is real and decaying as expected.</p><p>2) In addition, please show the results from at least two biological replicates (i.e., double the number of columns in the relevant histograms).</p><p>3) Regarding the statistical treatment of the ChIP-qPCR data, rather than apply standard statistics to ratios (i.e., the normalized values), it is more appropriate to compare ratios in the ChIP-qPCR assays (tagged sample vs Col-0 control) by multiplying the standard errors of the individual results. (The errors seem small enough that the differences will hopefully still be significant, but it would be good to know that this is the case.) An ANOVA is also possible (with the CT values themselves) as is a linear regression with the Ct of the sample plotted against the Ct of the control to enable a determination of the correlation of the Ct of Col against the Ct of the control (and a p-value can be obtained for the linear regression).</p><p>4) The arguments for the statement “we largely uncoupled division and fate modulating roles of RBR” and the claim that cells do not return to an embryonic identity or earlier stem cell identity need to be more thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, the relatively easy experiment of evaluating TMO7 and WOX2 expression in marker lines to support the above statements ought to be done.</p><p>5) It is important to note whether or not pRBR-RBR-CFP rescues the rbr null mutants.</p><p>6) Regarding the claim that your data demonstrate the dosage sensitivity of RBR's cell-cycle repression activity, it is important to show that RBR levels are unaltered in FAMA-LGK mutants. Also, given the highly specific RBR accumulation pattern, qRT may not be sufficient to address this issue. Preferable, an RBR-reporter line would be used.</p><p>7) Regarding the pFAMA-RBR-Myc line that is used for their lineage-specific ChIP, it is important to note whether or not expression of this construct affects stomatal development because differentiation appears to be highly dependent on RBR dosage.</p><p>8) Regarding “These results reinforce parallels between stem-cell decisions in plants and animals at molecular and organizational levels...” There are clearly parallels in how plants and animals organize stem cells, but it is not clear what mechanism in particular you have identified in this study that reinforces this idea. This part should be further developed or removed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03271.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Regarding the ChIP experiments, it would be useful to do some further analyses at higher resolution.

The FAMA binding peak is sharper than that of RBR, but the overlap is strong. These studies suggest that FAMA and RBR do indeed bind to the same region and are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) In addition, please show the results from at least two biological replicates (i.e., double the number of columns in the relevant histograms)</italic>.</p><p>We have repeated all of the ChIP experiments starting from new plant material. We found that in the context of this figure, showing both replicates on the same axes made them very difficult to read.

These replicates show similar enrichments to the original ones, with the exception of RBR association with <italic>EPF1</italic> in a FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> background (in the new replicate, RBR binding is also reduced here). We address this variation in the text.</p><p><italic>3) Regarding the statistical treatment of the ChIP-qPCR data, rather than apply standard statistics to ratios (i.e., the normalized values), it is more appropriate to compare ratios in the ChIP-qPCR assays (tagged sample vs Col-0 control) by multiplying the standard errors of the individual results.

These calculations were new to us, so in our attempts to educate ourselves about statistical treatment of ChIP-PCR data, we consulted with colleagues and gathered information from publications. We found that statistical tests on ChIP-qPCR data are actually very uncommon (e.g. none performed in Sawa M et al., Science, 2007; Pruneda-Paz JL et al., Science, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weimer AK et al., Plant Cell, 2012</xref>; and Yu T et al., eLife, 2013). One possible reason is that due to the “sticky” nature of tagged samples, negative control regions may sometimes be called as significantly enriched (statistically) in ChIPed DNA from tagged samples when compared to WT samples, creating false-positives. Thus, most studies use enrichment level at the negative control regions as the baseline to assess binding events.</p><p>We debated how to make the clearest presentation of the data. To conform to current standards and avoid confusion, we removed the statistical tests in our ChIP-qPCR data altogether. We did calculate S.E.M. for the normalized CT values and included this in the figures. We think the additional ChIP data provided in this revision (at higher resolution and on neighboring regions, and with biological replicates) provide compelling data to support our conclusions about FAMA and RBR binding. We did include an expanded version for our ChIP-qPCR data analysis in the methods section: CT values were obtained for sonicated chromatin taken before (input) and after immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Three technical replicates were assayed for each sample. CT values for ChIP DNA were normalized to mean of CT values for input DNA (CT ChIP – μCT Input). Fold enrichment was calculated by dividing the normalized value of MYC-tagged with that of untagged Col. All data are presented as mean ± SEM.</p><p>However, should the editor and reviewer wish to have us keep the measurements of significance in the manuscript, we did calculate significance by t-test and included the t-test calculations here in the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>) and also attempted to address the error propagation issue. Although the reviewer suggested doing an ANOVA instead of a t-test, since we are comparing only two independent samples (tagged vs. untagged) and all of our readings indicated that ANOVA is used when comparing three or more means for statistical significance, we choose to use the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test to determine whether normalized ChIP-qPCR values for MYC-tagged sample and untagged Col control were significantly different from one another. Should the reviewer and editor decide that these calculations are acceptable, it would be simple to substitute the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref> (below) for those currently in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Student’s t-test analysis of ChIP-qPCR data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-D</xref>.

Bellow we show our ChIP-qPCR data calculation. We didn’t find an example in the literature for incorporation of error propagation for ChIP-qPCR data analysis. However, we did try to develop this for our analysis by consulting colleagues and J.R.

Furthermore, the relatively easy experiment of evaluating TMO7 and WOX2 expression in marker lines to support the above statements ought to be done</italic>.</p><p>We have added text in the results and discussion sections to flesh out these statements more fully. In regards to embryonic identity, we, too, prefer using marker lines to obtain cellular resolution of expression patterns when possible. In the case of the experiments done in our manuscript, it is important to realize that these are in a genetic background of <italic>fama-/-</italic>; <italic>FAMAp:FAMA-LGK</italic> +/+; <italic>ML1-RFP</italic>; +/- or +/+, all of which come with their own antibiotic resistances. Because many markers show dose sensitivity, we prefer crossing in a common marker, and introgressing new markers into this background in not a fast process when considering all of the genotypes. For these reasons we also optimized a qPCR experiment (using all of the markers we had already confirmed as positive controls) that would let us more easily monitor other genes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, genes that become expressed in FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> “reprogrammed” cells, are significantly increased. Thus we feel that this assay has the sensitivity needed to detect transcripts of other genes, should they become expressed here.</p><p>In terms of genes to monitor “embryonic” or “meristem” identity, we initially chose a much larger number of genes described as such in publications. However, when looking at these genes in other manuscripts or in expression profile s of multiple tissues, we found that very few could actually be described as truly restricted to just one developmental stage. For example, the <italic>TMO7</italic> gene requested by the reviewer seems like a great choice from Dolf Weijer’s papers. But <italic>TMO7=PRE3</italic> and this gene is expressed in young leaves (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref> from the Bellini lab), so we would not be able to conclude from monitoring its expression whether cells had an early epidermal or meristem identity.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-03271-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>WOX2 and WOX8 were reported to be expressed in the egg cell and in the zygote [Haecker, et al, Development, 2003]. <italic>WOX8</italic> is also expressed in cotyledons so we cannot use it, but <italic>WOX2</italic> does seem to be exclusively embryonic so we included this in our expanded qRT-PCR panel. We requested WOX2 reagents and recently received plasmid that we were able to transform into <italic>fama</italic>-/-; <italic>FAMAp:FAMA</italic><sup><italic>LGK</italic></sup> +/+; <italic>ML1-RFP</italic>; +/- and WT lines, but as it will be at least 4 months before we could confidently determine the expression pattern in stable T2 lines and we already found that <italic>WOX2</italic> was not upregulated in FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> leaves by qRT-PCR (now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we did not think it was worthwhile to delay this paper for the extra months.</p><p><italic>5) It is important to note whether or not pRBR-RBR-CFP rescues the rbr null mutants</italic>.</p><p>In this paper, we use pRBR-RBR-CFP only to demonstrate that the protein is in many cells, including the stomatal lineage. Perhaps the reviewer is making the important point that for functional studies like ChIP, one should be using a functional construct, but because our ChIP construct (FAMAp:RBR-MYC) is only expressed in the late stomatal lineage and RBR is an essential gene, we cannot assay rescue with it.</p><p>All RBR reagents were constructed with the same RBR coding sequence and this coding sequence was shown to rescue rbr in (Cruz-Ramírez et al., 2013, Plos biology) In addition, a C-terminal RFP-tagged version of RBR was shown previously to rescue the rbr mutant defects, suggesting that tagging RBR at its C-terminus, as in our study, does not impair RBR function (Ingouff et al., Plant Cell, 2006). We have included this information and the Cruz-Ramírez references in the revised text.</p><p><italic>6) Regarding the claim that your data demonstrate the dosage sensitivity of RBR's cell-cycle repression activity, it is important to show that RBR levels are unaltered in FAMA-LGK mutants. Also, given the highly specific RBR accumulation pattern, qRT may not be sufficient to address this issue. Preferable, an RBR-reporter line would be used</italic>.</p><p>RBR is expressed in all cells in the plant. This comment makes us realize that with our choice of images to show that RBR is present in the stomatal lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we may have given the wrong impression that RBR was specific to only those cells (if we were to focus into another plane, you would see expression in other cells as shown in previously published work). We have reemphasized that RBR is in all young epidermal cells in the text.</p><p>We have included an image of RBRp:RBR-CFP in the FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> background as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We see no evidence for broadened expression pattern or extended expression in pavement cells, nor for diminished expression in GCs. In the reprogrammed GCs we would actually expect RBR to be up-regulated (re-expressed) as a consequence of these cell’s division behavior as well as because RBR is a target of SPCH (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref>). This is what we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 D-G</xref>) Importantly, we also show that neither RBRpro:RBR-CFP nor FAMApro:RBR-MYC is sufficient to repress (or promote) GC divisions in a WT background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2 C-F</xref>, respectively).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-03271-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>7) Regarding the pFAMA-RBR-Myc line that is used for their lineage-specific ChIP, it is important to note whether or not expression of this construct affects stomatal development because differentiation appears to be highly dependent on RBR dosage</italic>.</p><p>We have included an analysis of FAMAp:RBR-MYC phenotypes and expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2 C-F</xref>. We find no evidence for the reiteration of early stomatal lineage behaviors in these GCs, nor do we find suppression of divisions in the GC precursor.</p><p><italic>8) Regarding “These results reinforce parallels between stem-cell decisions in plants and animals at molecular and organizational levels...” There are clearly parallels in how plants and animals organize stem cells, but it is not clear what mechanism in particular you have identified in this study that reinforces this idea. This part should be further developed or removed</italic>.</p><p>We have changed the last two paragraphs of the paper to explain more about the RBR division effects. We make specific references to parallels between myogenic and stomatal lineage in terms of bHLHs, kinases and Rb/RBR and cite literature that discussed this more fully.</p></body></sub-article></article>
