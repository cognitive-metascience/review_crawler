In response to severe injury, <italic>yap</italic> was activated to upregulate <italic>lin28a</italic> transcription. Severe-injury-induced progenitor regeneration was disabled in <italic>lin28a</italic> or <italic>yap</italic> mutants. In contrary, overexpression of <italic>lin28a</italic> initiated the recovery of sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors. Mechanistically, microRNA <italic>let7</italic> acted downstream of <italic>lin28a</italic> to activate Wnt pathway for promoting regeneration. Our findings that lin28a is necessary and sufficient to regenerate the exhausted sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors shed light on restoration of progenitors to initiate HC regeneration in mammals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lin28a</kwd><kwd>sox2</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>zebrafish lateral line</kwd><kwd>yap</kwd><kwd>atoh1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Key R&amp;D Program of China 2018YFA0108304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Linjia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Youth Project 81800164</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Linjia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>General Project 31871467</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Linjia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007162</institution-id><institution>Guangdong Science and Technology Department</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>basic research project 2018A030313497</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Linjia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007162</institution-id><institution>Guangdong Science and Technology Department</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The key Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province 2019B020234002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shenzhen Foundation of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCYJ20170818103626421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19ykpy98</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Linjia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Atoh1+ HC precursors survive post severe injury and activate the Yap-Lin28 pathway to restore progenitor for initiating regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The auditory epithelium is a delicate structure located in the cochlea that is composed of sensory hair cells (HCs) and nonsensory support cells (SCs). During early development of mouse cochlea, the transcription factor sox2 is required to determine the prosensory region that mainly contains progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Julian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kiernan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dabdoub et al., 2008</xref>). From E12.5 to E14.5 sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors exit cell cycle and differentiate into auditory HCs and SCs. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor atoh1 acts as the cardinal gene initiating auditory HC differentiation since atoh1 deficiency causes complete loss of cochlear HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bermingham et al., 1999</xref>). A subset of post-mitotic progenitors start to express high levels of atoh1 and downregulate sox2 expression to differentiate into the HC precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dabdoub et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai and Groves, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Afterwards, their terminal differentiation toward mature HCs is promoted by the upregulation of atoh1 target genes, such as pou4f3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2015</xref>). In the meanwhile, differentiating HCs secret Notch ligands to activate Notch pathway, which inhibits atoh1 expression in neighboring cells and forces them to adopt the SC fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdolazimi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lanford et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The zebrafish lateral line is a mechanosensory organ composed of a series of neuromasts distributed on the body surface for detecting water flow. The lateral line HCs share similarities with their counterparts in mammalian inner ear in morphology, function and developmental pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whitfield, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nicolson, 2005</xref>). Each neuromast contains sensory HCs in the center surrounded by SCs and mantle cells (MCs). Aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as neomycin, ablates mature HCs and initiates robust mitotic regeneration that is characterized with SC division and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams and Holder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Romero-Carvajal et al., 2015</xref>). The powerful capacity to regenerate HCs sustains after multiple rounds of damage, and retains throughout lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cruz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pinto-Teixeira et al., 2015</xref>). Even after severe loss of the tissue integrity, the residual SCs have high potential to recover the neuromast by acting plastic to generate all three cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Viader-Llargués et al., 2018</xref>). Like in inner ear, <italic>atoh1a</italic> is expressed in HC precursors but not mature HCs in neuromast while <italic>sox2</italic> is expressed in a part of SCs and MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lush et al., 2019</xref>). Sox2<sup>+</sup> SCs behave as progenitors to proliferate and differentiate through activation of canonical Wnt pathway during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hernández et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacques et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is unknown how regeneration is initiated when sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors are absent.</p><p>Mammalian sensory HCs are vulnerable to damages caused by antibiotics, chemotherapeutical drugs and noise, which results in various hearing and balance diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). Until now, the principal method used to initiate auditory HC regeneration in mammalian inner ear is to induce the transdifferentiation of SCs into HCs by upregulating atoh1 expression. For example, many studies tried to overexpress atoh1 in SCs with adenovirus, or used Notch inhibitor to increase atoh1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atkinson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mizutari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Izumikawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). However, because the efficiency of HC induction is very low and SCs are lost due to transdifferentiation, very limited progress toward hearing recovery has been achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zheng and Zuo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). New strategies of restoring sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors to initiate mitotic regeneration would be more promising to realize functional regeneration in mammalian adult inner ear. Unfortunately, very little is known whether and how sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors can be restored in sensory epithelium.</p><p>Here in the zebrafish lateral line, we found that exhausted sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors were able to restore quickly for initiating HC regeneration in severe injury. <italic>Atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> HC precursors were the main population that survived post severe injury and dedifferentiated into s<italic>ox2</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitors through yap-lin28a pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exhausted sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors were quickly recovered by intensive proliferation post severe injury</title><p>It is well documented that Notch signaling pathway negatively regulates the differentiation of SCs into HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haddon et al., 1998</xref>). Using the γ-secretase inhibitor LY411575 to inhibit Notch pathway from 3-day-post-fertilization (dpf) to 5dpf, we found that SCs were exhausted by persistent differentiation into HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Neomycin was used to ablate mature HCs following LY treatment (LY+neo), which leads to the severe injury with both HCs and SCs being ablated. Sox2 marks the proliferative progenitors that produce both SCs and HCs in homeostatic and regenerative neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hernández et al., 2007</xref>). We analyzed sox2<sup>+</sup> cells in neo- and LY+neo-treated neuromast by immunostaining with anti-sox2 antibody. While the distribution of sox2<sup>+</sup> cells moved to the center post neo compared with normal larvae, the number was not changed. But sox2<sup>+</sup> cell number was dramatically decreased after LY or LY+neo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Surprisingly, sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors were able to recover quickly post LY+neo. A few sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors appeared early at 6 hr, with increased sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors being regenerated afterwards and recovered to normal level by 48 hr. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>ET4</italic><sup>+</sup> HCs appeared at 48 hr post LY+neo, suggesting that HC regeneration happened after the recovery of sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Exhausted sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors were able to restore quickly post severe injury.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) <italic>ET4;ET20</italic> larvae were treated with neomycin, LY411575 (3dpf-5dpf), or neomycin following LY (LY+neo), and collected at indicated time points post neomycin treatment for sox2 immunostaining.

Neomycin treatment and other types of HC injuries, including heavy metal (copper sulfate) or chemotherapeutic drug (cisplatin), induced sporadic <italic>lin28a</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, LY+neo induced much higher expression of <italic>lin28a</italic> compared with neo alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Since LY+neo induced more cell death than neo as illustrated by ablation of <italic>s100t</italic> expressing HCs, we tested whether <italic>lin28a</italic> induction is proportional to the injury size.

In this study, we simulated the situation of progenitor absence in the zebrafish lateral line through persistent conversion of sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors into HCs with Notch inhibitor LY411575. By adding neomycin post LY treatment to ablate HCs, we created a severe injury model in which both HCs and progenitors were eliminated. In big contrast to mammalian inner ear, progenitors in the lateral line were able to quickly restore themselves post severe injury, with HCs being regenerated afterwards.

Wnt pathway, which acts downstream of <italic>lin28a</italic>, is required to induce progenitor proliferation. We found that Wnt pathway was highly activated immediately post severe injury, but was not activated at 1 hr post neo. Since the number of sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors were not reduced post neo, it seems not necessary to activate Wnt for producing more progenitors.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Shawn Burgess (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The manuscript tackles the interesting topic of hair cell regeneration in the lateral line of the zebrafish, using an injury model to examine the role of a yap-lin28a pathway in regenerating cells. The reviewers have pointed out several strengths of the study, but also raise a number of concerns. It was felt that there would be significant additional work necessary to meet these concerns, and that some of the conclusions were overstated. The reviewers have a number of specific suggestions, and we hope these will be useful to you in moving the work forward. The full reviews are appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study uses a novel injury model to deplete both hair cells and surrounding supporting cells in the larval zebrafish lateral line, allowing the researchers to more closely mimic the mature mammalian inner ear, which does not contain viable progenitor cells. The experiments overall are sound, and the team makes elegant use of several heat shock lines to temporally regulate gene expression during damage and regeneration. The primary findings are that the lateral line is capable of regeneration after a severe injury, and that this regeneration is dependent on the yap-lin28-let7-Wnt pathway, while this pathway is not required for regeneration if supporting cells are still intact. This finding is novel and exciting, as the authors have identified a pathway that is necessary for regeneration in the absence of progenitor cells.</p><p>1) The findings are clearly supported by the data, although I have a reservation about the conclusion that &quot;yap directly binds <italic>lin28a</italic> promoter for transcriptional initiation.&quot; The authors convincingly show that yap can bind the <italic>lin28a</italic> promoter, and that <italic>lin28a</italic> is sufficient to induce regeneration, but not that yap binding of the <italic>lin28a</italic> promoter is necessary for the regenerative response.</p><p>2) My other concern is the conclusion that sox2<sup>+</sup>/<italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> cells present after LY+neo treatment truly represent dedifferentiated cells. The images in Figure 5E show that a brn3c<sup>-</sup> cell expressing the <italic>atoh1a</italic> reporter dTomato can divide to produce two hair cells, even without a severe injury. These data suggest that <italic>atoh1a</italic> can label a subset of progenitor cells in the lateral line, even if these cells are sox2<sup>-</sup>. I agree that their LY+neo injury model increases the number of sox2<sup>+</sup>/<italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, but I am not fully convinced that these cells are dedifferentiated hair cells; they may be an intermediate progenitor cell or hair cell precursor. Similarly, I am not convinced that the cells expressing weak tubulin label in Figure 6 are dedifferentiated cells; these could be newly born hair cells, since EdU is retained following cell division. I do not think additional experiments are necessary, but rather suggest toning down the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript reports work done in zebrafish aimed at further clarifying the mechanism underlying hair-cell regeneration.</p><p>The authors report that <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> committed hair cells de-differentiate into sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors upon injury, which initiates regeneration through a yap-lin28a-let7-Wnt pathway.

The authors show that under normal conditions, <italic>lin28a</italic> plays at best a minor role in regeneration, it is induced in a small number of cells but a genetic knockout of <italic>lin28a</italic> does not have a measurable effect on lateral line hair cell regeneration after ablation with neomycin. In contrast, when notch signaling is inhibited, lateral inhibition from hair cells is blocked and you see supernumerary hair cells at the expense of supporting cells, which are the normal source of new hair cells after ablation. Under these conditions, the authors show atoh1 positive cells will induce <italic>lin28a</italic> and revert to a more support cell-like identity. This phenomenon is mediated via yap signaling and downstream of <italic>lin28a</italic> let7 is blocked, triggering Wnt signaling. When the support cells are depleted by notch inhibition, now a <italic>lin28a</italic> KO has a significant negative effect on hair cell regeneration. In general this is a very carefully done set of experiments that identifies an interesting gene pathway that would be difficult to recognize under typical conditions used to study regeneration. I have one significant additional experiment I would like to see.</p><p>1) The hypothesis and the evidence point to <italic>lin28a</italic> triggering down-regulation of <italic>atoh1a</italic> and a return to a support cell fate. It should therefore be true that in the earlier developing larvae, if you induced <italic>lin28a</italic> expression ectopically, you should be able to inhibit natural differentiation of hair cells. Part of the model presented is that <italic>lin28a</italic> dedifferentiated cells contribute to new supporting cell populations too. Is it possible that the <italic>lin28a</italic> cells can only go &quot;backwards&quot; far enough to divide but not far enough to become support cells again? Under those circumstances the new support cells could come from the mantle cells which have been shown to be capable of fully regenerating all cell types in the neuromast. If it is really complete dedifferentiation, there should be more supporting cells in these larvae and not cells that are neither HC nor SC. It would be interesting if there could be lineage tracing of &quot;dedifferentiated&quot; atoh1<sup>+</sup> cells. Can they actually become supporting cells?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Yap-lin28a axis targets let7-Wnt pathway to restore progenitors for initiating regeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The zebrafish lateral line presents two major advantages for this study: (i) the mechanosensory organs can almost entirely regenerate and (ii) severe damages can be perform suing chemical inhibitor treatments. Here the authors show that:</p><p>1) Sox2 positive progenitors can largely regenerate after being fully illuminated in so-called severe injury after a combination of treatment with a Notch inhibitor (to promote the differentiation of support cells into hair cells) and an antibiotic (to damage the hair cells).</p><p>2) The regenerating sox2-positive cells derive from <italic>atoh1a</italic>-positive, committed hair cells.</p><p>3) The Hippo signaling pathway effector yap is upregulated upon severe injury, is required for regeneration of sox2-positive cells and induces the expression of lin28a.</p><p>4) <italic>Lin28a</italic> is necessary and sufficient to induce the regeneration of sox2-positive progenitors.</p><p>5) Progenitor regeneration results from a yap1-Lin28a-Let7-sox2-Wnt axis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Improve the Western blots to strengthen the data here. At the moment, the immunostainings are not clear, and the increase in yap1 is not clear on the Western blot. Indicate Molecular Weight on the blot.</p><p>2) Confirm the specificity of your antibodies by checking on yap1 mutants.</p><p>3) Confirm the specificity of the verteporfin inhibitor by comparing to the phenotype of yap1 mutants.</p><p>4) Please attend to all the listed minor revisions and, where possible, to any other major revisions, such as citation of additional studies in the Introduction (or provide a rebuttal of these points).</p><p>The full reviews are appended below for your information, in particular, please refer to the detailed comments from reviewer 2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study reveals an interesting, new mechanism driving neuromast regeneration upon severe injury. While I think the study is potentially interesting for <italic>eLife</italic> readership, I feel some parts are not as solid as others, in particular the part on the role of yap1. Please see my specific comments below.</p><p>1) The Introduction is short and miss to refer to some important studies that have been published on similar questions including, for example, work from the Lopez-Shier lab (PintoTeixeira et al., 2015, ViaderLlargues et al., 2018, for example)</p><p>2) Using <italic>hs:notch1a</italic> to block <italic>Atoh1a</italic> function is not ideal. The authors should use <italic>atoh1a</italic> mutants which are available or Morpholino which have been published.</p><p>3) The authors should demonstrate the specificity of the <italic>yap1</italic> and taz antibodies they are using by showing the absence of signal in respective mutants (available). These controls should be shown both for western-blot and immunostaining.</p><p>4) On the western-blot in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, taz seems to be much more upregulated than yap1. Why do the authors then focus exclusively on yap1?</p><p>5) The yap signal and the difference between control and treated in Figure 4C and 4E are not convincing.</p><p>6) &quot;The induction of yap and mst2 was blocked by verteporfin, an inhibitor of yap-mediated transcription by blocking yap-tead1 interaction&quot;: why are the expression of yap and mst2 blocked upon inhibition of yap-mediated transcription? Has it previously been shown that yap and mst2 are transcriptional targets of yap? The authors should look at classical yap/taz transcriptional targets.</p><p>7) Several yap and taz zebrafish mutants have been published. The authors should perform experiments in these mutants instead of – or in addition to – verteporfin experiments.</p><p>8) &quot;We used CHIP-PCR to verify that yap binds to a region 100bp downstream of <italic>lin28a</italic> transcription start site&quot;. How did the author choose this region?</p><p>9) Figure 3A: does the Y-axis indicate EdU cell number (as indicated on the figure) or absolute numbers of HS, SC and MC (as the text suggests)?</p><p>10) &quot;The EdU positive SC cells that were located in each quadrant with no polarization in sibling post LY+neo were almost cleared in <italic>lin28a</italic> mutant (Figure 3C-D)&quot;: The link to polarization all the sudden here is not clear.</p><p>11) Figure 3F: the authors should use yap mutants in addition to Verteporfin treatment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55771.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript tackles the interesting topic of hair cell regeneration in the lateral line of the zebrafish, using an injury model to examine the role of a yap-lin28a pathway in regenerating cells. The reviewers have pointed out several strengths of the study, but also raise a number of concerns. It was felt that there would be significant additional work necessary to meet these concerns, and that some of the conclusions were overstated. The reviewers have a number of specific suggestions, and we hope these will be useful to you in moving the work forward. The full reviews are appended below.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewers, we have added several important references, copyedited the text, toned down some of our conclusions. Based on suggestions of reviewer 1, I toned down our conclusions about dedifferentiation. I changed the title to “Yap-lin28a axis targets let7-Wnt pathway to restore progenitors for initiating regeneration”. Instead of drawing the conclusion that <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> HC precursors were dedifferentiated, we now changed it to that <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> HC precursors gained sox2 expression post severe injury. I have deleted all the data with acetylated tubulin (original Figure 6D-G) since a reference (Liu et al., 2018) I have just read showed that it labels not only HCs but also SCs. Therefore, it’s not appropriate to use acetylated-tubulin as a specific marker for HC to test the fate change. Based on suggestions of reviewer 3 I have changed the nomination of <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> cells from committed HCs into HC precursors since <italic>atoh1a</italic> expression is shut down in mature HCs.</p><p>To answer the reviewer’s questions, we have made new experiments and integrated the results to the updated figures.</p><p>1) As pointed by all reviewers, we have used <italic>atoh1a:dTomato</italic> reporter to trace dTomato expression in HCs, SCs and MCs in normal condition, post normal and severe injury. Our new data in updated Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-D showed that <italic>atoh1a</italic> label mostly HCs and a small number of SCs in normal and neo-treated larvae. Higher number of <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> SCs was detected in LY+neo compared with neo. More importantly, many MCs were also labeled with <italic>atoh1a</italic> post LY+neo, which was not detected in normal or neo. This piece of data suggests that <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> cells behaved like progenitor/stem cells that give rise to many support cell types post severe injury.</p><p>2) As suggested by reviewer 3, we have tested <italic>hs:lin28a</italic> for HC differentiation during development. Our results showed that <italic>lin28a</italic> expression has no effect on developing HC.</p><p>I believe that the quality of the revised version is highly improved thanks to the reviewers’ comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The findings are clearly supported by the data, although I have a reservation about the conclusion that &quot;yap directly binds lin28a promoter for transcriptional initiation.&quot; The authors convincingly show that yap can bind the lin28a promoter, and that lin28a is sufficient to induce regeneration, but not that yap binding of the lin28a promoter is necessary for the regenerative response.</p></disp-quote><p>Verteporfin is a specific inhibitor that blocks the transcriptional activity of yap by inhibiting yap and tead interaction.

Unfortunately, they all died after adding EdU post LY+neo, possibly because of their weakness caused by vascular and heart defect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) My other concern is the conclusion that sox2<sup>+</sup>/atoh1a<sup>+</sup> cells present after LY+neo treatment truly represent dedifferentiated cells.

Based on reviewer 3’s suggestion, we have changed the nomination of <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> cells from committed HCs to HC precursors since mature HCs lose <italic>atoh1a</italic> RNA expression. Our data (blue dots in updated Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B) are consistent with this conclusion by showing that one <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> precursor divided and became two brn3c<sup>+</sup> HCs post neo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These data suggest that atoh1a can label a subset of progenitor cells in the lateral line, even if these cells are sox2<sup>-</sup>.

Reduced hair-cell numbers may be an indirect consequence of lower proliferation, cellular extrusion or increased cell death.</p></disp-quote><p>Data in Figure 3A showed that HC number was decreased in <italic>lin28a</italic> mutant. The reviewer is correct that the HC decrease may be caused by loss of SC proliferation or other possible reasons. We didn’t do further analysis since we mainly focus on progenitor proliferation rather than HC production in this manuscript.

I learned from the published paper by Wibowo et al., 2011 that young HCs are dTomato<sup>+</sup> cells and mature HCs lose dTomato expression. Therefore, the mosaic expression of dTomato in HCs in Figure 5C may be caused by different states of HC maturity. We have changed the description accordingly in the manuscript.</p><p>We found a few dTomato<sup>+</sup> SCs in normal and neo conditions (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and the number is highly increased post LY+neo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;However, more than half of the dTomato<sup>+</sup> cells turned on sox2 expression at 12h and 48h post LY+neo and become dTomato<sup>+</sup>sox2<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure 5D), suggesting that atoh1a<sup>+</sup> cells were converted to sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors upon severe injury.&quot;</p><p>Again, because sox2 is expressed by nearly every non-sensory cell, it is not surprising that some cells will co-express atoh1a and sox2.</p></disp-quote><p>I agree with the reviewer that most SCs have sox2 expression in normal larvae. Atoh1 is expressed in differentiating HC precursors and our data showed that very few dTomato<sup>+</sup>sox2<sup>+</sup> cells existed in normal neuromast (updated Figure 5A-D). In accordance, several publications showed that atoh1 and sox2 is antagonistic in development (Dabdoub et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2017). But the number of dTomato<sup>+</sup>sox2<sup>+</sup> cells was highly increased post LY+neo, indicating that <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> cells gained sox2 expression in severe injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;However, it's only in LY+neo-induced severe injury that dTomato<sup>+</sup> cells converted to sox2<sup>+</sup> cells labeled by sox2:GFP (white dots in Figure 5F and Video 3), which confirms the dedifferentiation of atoh1a<sup>+</sup> cells into sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors. „</p><p>This statement is not supported by evidence presented in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data in updated Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and Video 3 showed that the two blue-dotted dTomato<sup>+</sup> cells were GFP negative in the beginning, and divided into four daughter cells which gained GFP expression. We have changed the conclusion about dedifferentiation to that <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> cells gained sox2 expression in severe injury. Thank the reviewer for pointing out this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The hypothesis and the evidence point to lin28a triggering down-regulation of atoh1a and a return to a support cell fate. It should therefore be true that in the earlier developing larvae, if you induced lin28a expression ectopically, you should be able to inhibit natural differentiation of hair cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the reviewer for the suggestion. To address the question whether <italic>lin28a</italic> affect early differentiation, we have analyzed 3dpf and 5dpf <italic>hs:lin28a</italic> larvae for HC counting. The results (updated Figure 4—figure supplement 1) showed that <italic>lin28a</italic> has no effect on HC differentiation during development. Our data in Figure 3 and Figure 4 also indicate that <italic>lin28a</italic> has no effect on HC differentiation (HC+, EdU incorporated HCs). And data in updated Figure 6—figure supplement 1 showed that differentiation related gene <italic>her4</italic> was not changed in <italic>hs:lin28a</italic>. All these data indicate that lin28a has no effect on differentiation in either development or regeneration. It could be possible that new <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> HC precursors are produced when <italic>lin28a</italic> inhibits the differentiation of old <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Part of the model presented is that lin28a dedifferentiated cells contribute to new supporting cell populations too. Is it possible that the lin28a cells can only go &quot;backwards&quot; far enough to divide but not far enough to become support cells again? Under those circumstances the new support cells could come from the mantle cells which have been shown to be capable of fully regenerating all cell types in the neuromast. If it is really complete dedifferentiation, there should be more supporting cells in these larvae and not cells that are neither HC nor SC. It would be interesting if there could be lineage tracing of &quot;dedifferentiated&quot; atoh1<sup>+</sup> cells. Can they actually become supporting cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Our new data in updated Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-D showed that <italic>atoh1a</italic> label mostly HCs and a small number of SCs in normal and neo-treated larvae. Higher number of <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> SCs was detected in LY+neo compared with neo. More importantly, many MCs were also labeled with <italic>atoh1a</italic> post LY+neo, which was not detected in normal or neo-treated conditions. This piece of data suggests that <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> cells behaved like progenitor/stem cells that give rise to many support cell types post severe injury. However, the lineage tracing experiment using cre/loxP system is necessary to confirm whether <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are dedifferentiated or not. Since we were not able to do this experiment because of technology reason, we have already toned down the conclusions in our manuscript. Now the dedifferentiation conclusion was changed to that <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> HC precursors gained sox2 expression post severe injury.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Improve the Western blots to strengthen the data here.

While I think the study is potentially interesting for eLife readership, I feel some parts are not as solid as others, in particular the part on the role of yap1. Please see my specific comments below.</p><p>1) The Introduction is short and miss to refer to some important studies that have been published on similar questions including, for example, work from the Lopez-Shier lab (PintoTeixeira et al., 2015, ViaderLlargues et al., 2018, for example)</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewer for the nice suggestion. We have previously included PintoTeixeira et al., 2015 in the Introduction. Now we added ViaderLlargues et al., 2018 in the Introduction as an important reference for the high potential of SCs to regenerate after severe damage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Using hs:notch1a to block Atoh1a function is not ideal. The authors should use atoh1a mutants which are available or Morpholino which have been published.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2F we found that LY+neo-induced <italic>lin28a</italic> is decreased in <italic>hs:notch1a</italic>. I agree with the reviewer that <italic>atoh1a</italic> mutants or <italic>atoh1a</italic> morpholino is more specific to block <italic>atoh1a</italic> function than <italic>hs:notch1a</italic>. However, HCs are absent in <italic>atoh1a</italic> mutants or morphants, which makes it impossible to cause severe damage by combined treatment of LY and neomycin. In order to induce severe damage, we have to use <italic>hs:notch1a</italic> to transiently block <italic>atoh1a</italic> expression without affecting hair cell development.</p><p>The aim of this experiment is to check whether <italic>lin28a</italic> is induced in <italic>atoh1a</italic> expressing cells. In addition to this piece of data, we observed that <italic>lin28a</italic> induction is increased in <italic>hs:atoh1a</italic> and <italic>lin28a</italic> is co-labeled with <italic>atoh1a</italic> post severe injury. All these evidences clearly indicate that <italic>lin28a</italic> is induced in <italic>atoh1a</italic><sup>+</sup> cells post severe injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should demonstrate the specificity of the yap1 and taz antibodies they are using by showing the absence of signal in respective mutants (available). These controls should be shown both for western-blot and immunostaining.</p></disp-quote><p>Our new results in updated Figure 2—figure supplement 2F showed that yap antibody had good immunostaining signal in LY+neo-treated neuromast, which was lack in yap mutants. Western-blot results in Figure 2—figure supplement 2C have detected the yap band in siblings but not in yap mutants. These results indicate that yap antibody is specific in recognizing yap protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) On the western-blot in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, taz seems to be much more upregulated than yap1. Why do the authors then focus exclusively on yap1?</p></disp-quote><p>We have optimized the western-blot conditions with yap antibody and updated the Figure 2—figure supplement 2B results. We found that yap protein level was upregulated at 1h and 5h post LY+neo while taz was upregulated until 5h. In addition, yap but not taz was detected in neuromast by immunostaining at 1h post LY+neo (updated Figure 2—figure supplement 2D-G and data not shown). Based on these results, yap is activated earlier than taz post severe injury and might be responsible for regeneration. Indeed, we found that the regenerative proliferation and <italic>lin28a</italic> induction were blocked in yap mutants (Figure 3F and 2J). All these indicate that yap activation is required for severe-injury-induced regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The yap signal and the difference between control and treated in Figure 4C and 4E are not convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>I assume the reviewer referred to Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and E in the original figures which were now updated as Figure 2—figure supplement 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 2G. We have proved the specificity of yap antibody by using yap mutants in the updated Figures (details in major point 3). The signal of yap immunostaining seemed localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm of neuromast cells, possibly because yap shuttles between nuclei and cytoplasm. We also noticed that the injury induced yap expression not only in neuromast but also in surrounding skin and muscle. Only yap expressing cells within the neuromasts were chosen and divided by total cell number to calculate the ratio. The ratio of yap expression was significantly increased post LY+neo, which was inhibited in <italic>hs:notch1a</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) &quot;The induction of yap and mst2 was blocked by verteporfin, an inhibitor of yap-mediated transcription by blocking yap-tead1 interaction&quot;: why are the expression of yap and mst2 blocked upon inhibition of yap-mediated transcription? Has it previously been shown that yap and mst2 are transcriptional targets of yap? The authors should look at classical yap/taz transcriptional targets.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewer for the suggestion. We have tested the classic yap transcriptional target genes cyr61 and ctgfa post severe injury by real time PCR. Results in updated Figure 2—figure supplement 2H indicated that expression levels of cyp61 and ctgfa were increased post severe injury, which was inhibited by verteporfin. This indicates that yap activity is activated post severe injury. Our results in updated Figure 2—figure supplement 2I suggested that yap probably upregulated expressions of itself and mst2 to create a positive feedback loop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Several yap and taz zebrafish mutants have been published. The authors should perform experiments in these mutants instead of – or in addition to – Verteporfin experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewer for the suggestion. We have tested regenerative proliferation in yap mutants. The proliferation was significantly decreased in yap mutants (updated Figure 3F), which resembled the phenotype of verteporfin treatment (updated Figure 3G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) &quot;We used CHIP-PCR to verify that yap binds to a region 100bp downstream of lin28a transcription start site&quot;. How did the author choose this region?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the promoter region of <italic>lin28a</italic> to search for the conserved yap binding motif by sequence similarity. There is a yap binding motif located at 100bp downstream of <italic>lin28a</italic> transcription start site, where a tead1 binding motif is located nearby. This suggested that yap might cooperate with tead1 to activate <italic>lin28a</italic> transcription. We verified the binding of yap to this region by CHIP-PCR (Figure 2H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 3A: does the Y-axis indicate EdU cell number (as indicated on the figure) or absolute numbers of HS, SC and MC (as the text suggests)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewer for pointing out this typo. It should be the absolute number of HC, SC and MC, and we changed the Y-axis label accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) &quot;The EdU positive SC cells that were located in each quadrant with no polarization in sibling post LY+neo were almost cleared in lin28a mutant (Figure 3C-D)&quot;: The link to polarization all the sudden here is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Results in Figure 3D showed that the EdU+ proliferative cells post LY+neo is not polarized since the statistical analysis is not significant (N.S. at the bottom).
