arrest to regulate expression of downstream genes. The ribosomal tunnel also provides a protected environment for initial protein folding events. Here, we present a 2.9 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of a ribosome stalled during translation of the extremely compacted VemP nascent chain. The nascent chain forms two α-helices connected by an α-turn and a loop, enabling a total of 37 amino acids to be observed within the first 50–55 Å of the exit tunnel. The structure reveals how α-helix formation directly within the peptidyltransferase center of the ribosome interferes with aminoacyl-tRNA accommodation, suggesting that during canonical translation, a major role of the exit tunnel is to prevent excessive secondary structure formation that can interfere with the peptidyltransferase activity of the ribosome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

that act as <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory polypeptides to promote ribosome stalling and thereby regulate gene expression. One of the most recently discovered examples is the Vibrio export monitoring polypeptide (VemP) that allows <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> to adapt to changes in salinity by modulating expression of components of the protein targeting machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> is a Gram-negative marine-estuarine bacterium that, unlike most bacteria, has two paralogs of SecDF (SecDF1 and SecDF2) to enhance protein export in cooperation with the SecYEG translocon. In Na<sup>+</sup>-rich environments, <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> utilizes the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent SecDF1; however, in Na<sup>+</sup>-limiting environments <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> switches to the Na<sup>+</sup>-independent (presumably H<sup>+</sup>-dependent) SecDF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>). The switch between SecDF1 and SecDF2 is facilitated by the stalling activity of VemP. In Na<sup>+</sup>-rich environments, VemP is targeted by its signal sequence (SS) to the SecDF1-SecYEG translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>). The force applied to VemP during protein translocation prevents VemP-dependent ribosome stalling, thereby enabling the complete VemP to be translated and released from the ribosome. Under such conditions, SecDF2 expression is repressed due to sequestration of the ribosome-binding site (RBS) of <italic>secDF2</italic> within a stem-loop structure in the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In Na<sup>+</sup>-limiting environments, however, VemP is not translocated due to the inactivity of SecDF1, and the resulting lack of force on the VemP nascent chain leads to ribosomal stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Ribosome stalling dissolves the stem-loop structure within the mRNA, exposes the RBS and thereby induces expression of Na<sup>+</sup>-independent SecDF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In brief, the mechanisms by which VemP switches protein synthesis between the SecDF1 and SecDF2 paralogs is dependent on the application of a force to the signal sequence containing VemP nascent chain. This force serves as a direct indicator of the SecDF-SecYEG protein translocation activity, which in turn is dependent on the environmental conditions.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25642.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biochemical and structural analysis of VemP stalling.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the VemP-SecDF2 mRNA encoding VemP leader peptide with N-terminal signal sequence (SS) and C-terminal stalling region (green), followed by a stem-loop structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site (RBS) of the SecDF2 gene (left).

Although VemP-mediated regulation of SecDF2 expression is reminiscent of other peptide-stalling regulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ito and Chiba, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>), such as SecM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakatogawa and Ito, 2001</xref>) and MifM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiba et al., 2009</xref>), the VemP stalling sequence and force-sensing mechanism appears to be completely distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ito and Chiba, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis of VemP sequence on efficiency of stalling</title><p>To ensure the stalling efficiency of the VemP constructs before initiating the structural analysis, we engineered three LepB-based constructs carrying C-terminal VemP residues, termed VemP ‘short’, ‘long’ and ‘GS’, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). VemP ‘short’ carries the 19 amino acid segment that Ishii <italic>et al</italic> had chosen as the target for alanine scanning mutagenesis from VemP (138–156) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>). VemP ‘long’ carries a 26 amino acid long segment including seven additional N-terminal residues of VemP (131–156), whereas VemP ‘GS’ is similar to the former two, except that residues 131–138 were substituted with a glycine-serine (GS) linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). VemP ‘short’, ‘long’ and ‘GS’ were expressed in pulse-chase experiments in <italic>E. coli</italic> without any N-terminal signal sequence (see Material and methods). Using this assay, the major product observed to accumulate for VemP ‘short’ was full-length LepB-VemP fusion protein, whereas relatively little (10%) stalled peptide was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, VemP ‘long’ containing the extended stalling window dramatically increased the stalling efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). As expected, mutations previously reported to abrogate ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>), L153A and Q156stop, led to a reduction in stalling efficiency for the VemP ‘short’ and particularly for the VemP ‘long’ constructs. VemP ‘GS’ also had a reduced stalling efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). Taken together, these fusion proteins proved to be ineffective at inducing elongation arrest to the full extent in vivo. The influence of residues 131–138 on ribosome stalling and SecDF2 induction was not so extensively characterized in the previous study, where only mutation of residues 132 and 136–138 to alanine were reported to have little or no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that residues beyond the previously characterized 19-aa stalling window of VemP contribute to the efficiency of VemP-mediated translation arrest.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cryo-EM structure of the VemP-SRC</title><p>In order to investigate which residues of VemP are involved in establishing interactions with the exit tunnel during ribosome stalling, and in particular to decipher the molecular mechanism of force-sensitive ribosome stalling by VemP, we used cryo-EM to determine the structure of a VemP-stalled ribosome-nascent chain complex (VemP-SRC). Since we observed a contribution of the amino acids in VemP beyond the initially identified stalling window and to ensure the maximum ribosome stalling efficiency, the wildtype VemP sequence lacking only the signal sequence (residues 26–159, ΔSS-VemP), rather than a shorter stalling window, was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Translation of the ΔSS-VemP construct in an <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate-based translation system led to the accumulation of VemP-peptidyl-tRNA (about 40 kDa), of which the size was reduced to the expected free peptide (18 kDa) upon RNase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The robustness of stalling of the wildtype ΔSS-VemP was evident from the persistence of the VemP-peptidyl-tRNA, even with incubation times of up to 100 min where only minor fractions of full-length VemP were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).

The α-helix located in the upper region of the tunnel is comprised of the C-terminal 10 residues (N147–Q156) of VemP and is directly linked to the P-tRNA and thereby located directly in the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). The α-helix located in the lower region of the tunnel is comprised of the N-terminal 10 residues (M120–S129) of VemP for which density is clearly visualized. We note that the N-terminal stretch of the VemP nascent chain from the lower α-helix to tunnel exit is less well resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The formation of α-helical secondary structure within the upper and lower regions of the exit tunnel is generally consistent with previous biochemical and structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhushan et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kosolapov and Deutsch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu and Deutsch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matheisl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Woolhead et al., 2004</xref>). The linker between the two α-helices is located within the constriction of the exit tunnel, adjacent to ribosomal proteins uL4 and uL22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–d</xref>). The linker is composed of 17 residues (130–146) that form two consecutive turns: one connecting the C-terminal α-helix which is a canonical α-turn (I140–K144), followed by a less well-ordered turn without hydrogen bonding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).

Additionally, in the hCMV stalling peptide a C-terminal α-helix was also observed in the upper region of the tunnel in a similar yet slightly shifted position compared to the C-terminal helix of VemP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhushan et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matheisl et al., 2015</xref>). Structurally, the extensive compaction and secondary structure formation of VemP results in an unprecedented total of 37 residues being housed within the upper two thirds (approximately 50–55 Å) of the ribosomal exit tunnel, which contrasts with the 21–33 aa that were visualized within the exit tunnel for other stalling peptides, such as SecM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhushan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), MifM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sohmen et al., 2015</xref>), TnaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bischoff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seidelt et al., 2009</xref>) and CMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhushan et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matheisl et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). When calculating the theoretical minimal number of residues for the VemP peptide chain to stretch all the way from the PTC to the tunnel exit, it would require at least 51 aa, which is in stark contrast to only 31 aa for MifM and 34 for SecM due to lack of compaction.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25642.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the VemP nascent chain in the ribosomal tunnel with other stalling peptides.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overall superposition of VemP (model in green, surface in light green) with MifM (red, PDB ID 3J9W) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sohmen et al., 2015</xref>), SecM (orange, PDB ID 3JBU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), hCMV (yellow, PDB ID 5A8L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matheisl et al., 2015</xref>), TnaC (cyan, PDB ID 4UY8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bischoff et al., 2014</xref>) and ErmBL (blue, PDB ID 5JU8)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arenz et al., 2016</xref>) in the ribosomal tunnel (light grey).

These residues encompass 17 of the 19-aa stalling window of VemP ‘Short’, with only the mutations of either S141A and S155A having no influence on ribosome stalling. Many of these residues establish specific interactions with components of the ribosomal exit tunnel, which is likely to explain their importance for ribosomal stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–f</xref>). For example, the sidechains of N154 and Y150, which are located in the upper C-terminal α-helix of VemP, can stack on the nucleobases of U2506 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) and C2610 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), respectively, of the 23S rRNA. Additionally, N154 comes within hydrogen bonding distance of U2584 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Within the α-turn of VemP, K144 can hydrogen bond with the non-bridging phosphate-oxygen of U747 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), whereas W143 can stack upon the R92 sidechain located the tip of the β-hairpin of uL22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Consistently, alterations in uL22 have been shown to reduce the efficiency of VemP-mediated ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>). The α-turn of VemP is additionally stabilized by stacking interactions between R139 of VemP and A752 of the 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). The seven residues (131–137) within the loop linking the α-turn of VemP to the lower N-terminal α-helix map within the VemP ‘Long’ region. As mentioned, alanine mutagenesis (Y132A, S136–H138A) suggested that the identity of some of these residues is not important for ribosome stalling, with the exception of the H138A mutation that had a modest effect on arrest efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>). Consistently, in the VemP-SRC structure, residues 135–138 of loop are less well-resolved and no sidechain interactions with the exit tunnel are observed. By contrast, the remaining loop residues (130–134) are better resolved. The sidechain of H133 comes within hydrogen bonding distance of the backbone of K58 of uL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>), which may contribute to the improved stalling efficiency of the VemP ‘Long’ over the VemP ‘Short’ observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>. Additionally, the sidechain of W124, which is located in the lower N-terminal α-helix of VemP, stacks on the R95 sidechain of uL22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Collectively, the interactions observed in the VemP-SRC structure are consistent with previous biochemical and mutational analysis indicating that the majority of critical residues and interactions are located in the upper region of the tunnel, but that the additional residues within the lower region of the tunnel can also contribute to the efficiency of stalling.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25642.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Interactions of the VemP nascent chain with the ribosomal tunnel (with density shown).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) N154 of VemP (green) stacks upon U2506(b) of the 23S rRNA (blue).

Comparison of the conformation of nucleotides at the PTC of the VemP-stalled ribosomes revealed two nucleotides of the 23S rRNA, U2585 and U2506, which adopt conformations incompatible with peptide bond formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Accommodation of an aminoacyl-tRNA at the A-site of the PTC requires a transition of the PTC from an uninduced to an induced state, which involves a shift in the position of U2585 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schmeing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Youngman et al., 2004</xref>). In the VemP-SRC, U2585 adopts a unique conformation, distinct from both the uninduced and induced U2585 conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Moreover, the upper α-helix of VemP extends into the PTC and thereby directly prevents the transition of U2585 from the uninduced to the induced state, due to steric clashes with Asn154 of VemP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). In contrast to VemP, the hCMV helix does not directly prevent the analogous human nucleotide U4493 (<italic>E. coli</italic> U2585) from adopting the induced state. It is rather hCMV’s penultimate Pro21, which is not part of the helix, that prevents this transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Additionally, U2506 is observed to adopt two distinct conformations, U2506(a) and U2506(b) in the VemP-SRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The U2506(a) conformation would sterically clash with the aminoacyl moiety of A-tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>) and is likely to contribute to prevent aminoacyl-tRNA accommodation at the A-site of the PTC. The induced state of the PTC also involves a shift in the position of U2506 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schmeing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Youngman et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>), which cannot occur in the VemP-SRC because the upper α-helix of VemP blocks the induced conformation of U2506 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>), analogously to that observed for U2585 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Unlike VemP, hCMV does not retain an uninduced conformation of human U4414 (<italic>E. coli</italic> U2506) but allows the induced conformation of U4414 since it is sterically less constrained by the more distant hCMV helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matheisl et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, although α-helix formation has also been observed in the upper tunnel of an hCMV-stalled ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matheisl et al., 2015</xref>), the CMV α-helix did not directly extend into the PTC as seen here for VemP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f–g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d,h</xref>). Indeed, the two C-terminal proline residues of the CMV stalling peptide appeared to be more important for inactivating the PTC and inducing translation arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matheisl et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, translation arrest via stabilization of the uninduced state has also been observed for other force-sensing stalling peptides on the ribosome, such as SecM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) and MifM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sohmen et al., 2015</xref>).

These findings suggest that formation of secondary structure, such as an α-helix, directly at the PTC is likely to be detrimental for peptide bond formation and, therefore, for translation efficiency. Thus, the PTC of the ribosome and its immediate tunnel context must have evolved to generally disfavour excessive secondary structure formation. However, it also raises the question as to whether secondary structure formation at the PTC is used by the ribosome for specific nascent proteins to modulate the rate of translation, which could have important downstream consequences for co-translational protein folding and targeting events.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25642.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for VemP-mediated translation stalling and relief.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>b</bold>) Schematic summarizing the molecular basis for (<bold>a</bold>) VemP-dependent translation arrest and (<bold>b</bold>) relief of arrest via the pulling-force (indicated by arrow) on VemP protein translocation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25642.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25642.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25642-fig6-v1"/></fig></p><p>Relief of VemP-mediated ribosome stalling is proposed to result from the force exerted on the nascent chain during membrane insertion of the N-terminal signal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>). It is easy to imagine how, in the case of VemP, force application would inevitably prevent the formation of extensive secondary structure formation during translation, or at least lead to an unraveling of any secondary structure that does form within the tunnel, and thereby eventually allowing sterically the transition into the induced conformation of the PTC. As a result, peptide bond formation would be promoted again and translation elongation continued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Interestingly, all three molecularly characterized force-sensing stallers employ the mechanism of preventing the adoption of the catalytically required induced state of the PTC by steric hindrance. This may be the favoured mechanism because the conformational trajectory from the uninduced to the induced state coincides with the direction of force applied to the nascent peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Yet, it is surprising that the stalling peptides use completely different modes by which they interact with the ribosomal tunnel in a force-sensitive manner to achieve this goal.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA manipulations</title><p>To test the effect of adding the extra C-terminal VemP sequence to the identified 19aa stalling window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>), the VemP ‘short’ plasmid was constructed from a previously designed pING1 plasmid carrying a <italic>lepB</italic>-based construct harboring a SecM arrest peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ismail et al., 2012</xref>). In order to produce a soluble, non-membrane targeted variant, transmembrane helix 1 and 2 of Lep were deleted using PCR.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Rachel Green (Reviewer #1) is a member of our board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Koreaki Ito (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We have received comments from three expert reviewers all of whom find the structure of the VemP-dependent stalling peptide complexed with the ribosome to be of high quality and broad general interest. The reviewers raise several issues, a few minor computational questions, and some concerns with the biochemical experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (and whether they should be included in the body of the manuscript given their limited utility), and a request for a clearer comparison with CMV-stalling peptide, and the possible inclusion of an additional citation. The authors should address the specific issues raised by the reviewers. Otherwise, once these minor issues are addressed, the manuscript should be acceptable for publication at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript by Su et al. described a cryoEM structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes stalled on an mRNA encoding the VemP peptide and characterized in some molecular detail. Here, the authors redefine the critical features of the peptide sequence needed for efficient stalling (extending the amino acid window by 7 aa to 26 in total) and then isolate from in vitro translation reactions the stalled ribosome complex. Elimination of the signal sequence from the peptide is critical in vivo for allowing stalling to occur but is apparently not necessary in the PURE system that is being utilized in vitro. The authors then present a well-resolved structure of the ribosome, with high resolution for the ribosome as a whole (2.9 Å), and with only slightly reduced resolution in the exit tunnel (3-3.5 Å). With this resolution, the authors are able to identify the overall highly compacted structure of the nascent peptide (which is quite distinct from that observed for other force-regulated stalling sequences like MifM and SecM), the details of interactions of the peptide with the tunnel that specify the stall, and an &quot;uninduced&quot; PTC that explains why catalysis does not proceed (A site tRNA is sterically hindered from binding).</p><p>Overall, the data are clean and convincing, and the structure provides insight into a different way in which a nascent peptide in the ribosome exit tunnel can regulate protein synthesis. This report will be of interest to readers of <italic>eLife</italic> and I recommend publication.</p><p>Points:</p><p>1) The term &quot;translocation&quot; used in the manuscript refers to protein translocation, yet to someone in the translation (not secretion) field, this refers to the reaction catalyzed by EFG. This could be clarified throughout the manuscript.</p><p>2) Discussion of Na<sup>+</sup> regulation was a bit hard to integrate into the results of the manuscript. It might be worth clarifying that the results presented do not shed light on this particular subject but that this was how the motif was originally identified/studied.</p><p>3) More detailed comparison of the CMV stalling peptide and VemP could be made. While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> clearly shows that there is considerably more compaction in VemP peptide than in MifM or SecM, the distinction relative to the CMV peptide is less obvious. This should also be addressed in the text.</p><p>4) The induced fit of the ribosome PTC was documented structurally by Schmeing et al., 2005 and the results here nicely agree. However, earlier biochemical work (Youngman et al., 2004) detailed an induced fit mechanism based on differences in reactivity of intact tRNAs and minimal A site substrates (like puromycin). It might be worth considering whether this study should also be cited.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Su et al., present an interesting structural analysis of the regulation of SecDF2 translation mediated by VemP-dependent stalling of the 70S ribosome. They obtained a cryo-EM reconstruction of the stalled and affinity-purified 70S complex. They reached the very high resolution of 2.9 Å and the high quality of the map facilitated de-novo modelling of the nascent VemP peptide located in the ribosomal exit tunnel. The structural analysis reveals an unprecedented, highly compacted state of the nascent peptide with two α-helices formed. Importantly, specific interactions of the VemP peptide with ribosomal residues of the tunnel and a remodeling of critical bases of the ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center explains the molecular mechanism of VemP-dependent stalling of translation. Overall, the data are of very high quality and the paper is very well written.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Here is another contribution from the Beckmann-Wilson groups reporting the structures of ribosome-nascent polypeptide complexes, which have stalled after translating special amino acid sequences called arrest sequences. This time, the authors chose VemP, a regulatory nascent polypeptide from <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic>, which was reported recently to play a central role in the adaptation of this marine bacterium to environments of low sodium concentrations. VemP is expressed from the upstream open reading frame in front of secDF2, encoding a proton-utilizing export enhancer, and undergoes translational elongation arrest, which enables the expression of secDF2 by disrupting the secondary structure of mRNA and exposing the ribosome-binding sequence of secDF2. VemP is a &quot;Sec-monitoring substrate,&quot; and its elongation arrest is cancelled in a manner coupled with its translocation across the membrane. When this species of bacteria are living in seawater, they express only SecDF1, which can only use a gradient of Na<sup>+</sup>. Accordingly, the cellular Sec activity declines when they encounter a low salinity environment. The Sec dysfunction acts to prolong the stalling of the VemP-translating ribosome, which in turn enhances translation of SecDF2 by the ribosomal pool in the cell. VemP is the third member of the force-sensitive class of regulatory arrest peptides, following SecM and MifM in the order of discovery.</p><p>The study has been conducted with a high standard of design and skills, and the results provide additional insights into an emerging concept in molecular biology: nascent chain handling of the translating ribosome. Taken together with the results of similar analyses carried out to date, the present study reveals the high degree of diversity, with which different nascent polypeptides interact with the ribosomal components. Notably, the nascent chain of VemP establishes extensive contacts with the ribosome and undergoes an unprecedented extent of secondary structure formation in the ribosomal interior. I recommend publication of this work as it presents a clear case of nascent chain-instructed ribosomal dysfunction and force-dependent translation recovery.</p><p>Specific comments.</p><p>1. Initially, I did not understand exactly what were the VemP constructs that the authors referred to &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot;. Inspection of Materials and Methods then made me realize that they were not really VemP constructs; rather, the authors inserted segments of VemP comprising the 19 and the 26 amino acids into the LepB sequence. The authors must have expected that these amino acid sequences would fully halt translational elongation when transplanted into a sequence context of an unrelated protein, LepB in this case. However, Ishii et al. only determined the C-terminal end of the VemP arrest sequence, leaving the N-terminal boundary obscure. Moreover, it is known that the arrest proficiency can be affected by the nature of the N-terminally adjacent sequences, although the LepB sequence may be expected to be inert in this respect. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> show that neither the short nor the long construct exhibited full elongation arrest in vivo; less than 10% and ~50% efficiency, respectively, for &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot;. By contrast, the full-length delta-signal VemP gives nearly 100% arrest in vivo as shown by Ishii et al and in vitro as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>. In my opinion, the information content of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is quite limited. Most importantly, the authors anyway used the full-length delta-signal VemP to prepare the samples of ribosome-nascent chain complexes for cryo-EM analysis. These considerations lead me to suggest that the clarity of the paper will be improved if the authors remove <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> as well as the schemes of the short, the long and the GS constructs, from the main body of the manuscript. A simple description something like the following might be sufficient and appropriate: &quot;We constructed LepB variants containing the 19 amino acid segment that Ishii et al chose as the target of alanine scanning mutagenesis or the 26 amino acids segment having 9 additional N-terminally neighboring residues, but these fusion proteins proved to be incapable of inducing elongation arrest to the full extent in vivo. Therefore, we used the full-length mature sequence of VemP (delta-signal VemP) for EM analysis&quot;.</p><p>2. What does ST stand for in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>? If it means stalled fragment, it does not apply to the Q156Stop constructs, which produce prematurely terminated, but not stalled, products. Incidentally, the letters indicating the constructs are too small to read.</p><p>3. The stalling efficiency is very low in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> experiment, whereas it is almost 100% in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> experiment. Why? Does hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA linkage take place under the conditions of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> experiment? From the description in Material and Method, it seems that the authors used the former conditions for preparation of the cryo-EM samples. If so, the experimental system was accompanied by incomplete stalling or hydrolytic removal of the tRNA. Please clarify these issues.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25642.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The term &quot;translocation&quot; used in the manuscript refers to protein translocation, yet to someone in the translation (not secretion) field, this refers to the reaction catalyzed by EFG.

The reason is that this initial analysis of the VemP sequence on stalling efficiency resulted in the important conclusion that 7 or possibly even more Nterminal residues contribute to the stalling efficiency, in addition to the originally identified VemP stalling window. This is in agreement with our subsequent observation from the cryo-EM analysis that interactions between VemP and the ribosomal tunnel wall exist beyond the initial stalling window and even beyond the 7 residues. Moreover, showing this assay also explains why we decided to use an almost complete VemP sequence and not only the originally identified stretch for cryoEM as one could have expected.</p><p>To improve the clarity of the manuscript, we have revised and integrated your</p><p>suggestion to the text. The major revisions are the following:</p><p>Results, section “Analysis of VemP sequence on efficiency of stalling”:</p><p>“To ensure the stalling efficiency of the VemP constructs before initiating the structural analysis, we engineered three LepB-based constructs that carried C-terminal VemP residues, termed VemP “short”, “long” and “GS”, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).

For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the NuPAGE gel was homemade and for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> a precast commercial NuPAGE gel. The appearance of the ratio of the peptidyl-tRNA to the free peptide was indeed lower in gel 1E, however, only due to an apparent pH deviation that hydrolyses to a larger extend the peptidyl-tRNA linkage when using the homemade gels. Therefore, as suggested by the referee, the different ratios indeed represent different degrees of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis in the different gel systems and not differences in the stalling efficiency. Moreover, single-particle image processing confirmed that the occupancy of proper P-site tRNA-bound ribosomes with high resolution was 80%, indicating good quality of sample preparation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
