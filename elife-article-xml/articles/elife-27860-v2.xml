open-reading frames (altORFs) in addition to annotated protein coding sequences (CDSs). We show that a large number of small proteins could in fact be coded by these altORFs. The putative alternative proteins translated from altORFs have orthologs in many species and contain functional domains. Evolutionary analyses indicate that altORFs often show more extreme conservation patterns than their CDSs. Thousands of alternative proteins are detected in proteomic datasets by reanalysis using a database containing predicted alternative proteins. This is illustrated with specific examples, including altMiD51, a 70 amino acid mitochondrial fission-promoting protein encoded in <italic>MiD51</italic>/<italic>Mief1</italic>/<italic>SMCR7L</italic>, a gene encoding an annotated protein promoting mitochondrial fission. Our results suggest that many genes are multicoding genes and code for a large protein and one or several small proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27860.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are often referred to as the workhorses of the cell, and these molecules affect all aspects of human health and disease. Thus, deciphering the entire set of proteins made by an organism is often an important challenge for biologists.</p><p>Genes contain the instructions to make a protein, but first they must be copied into a molecule called an mRNA. The part of the mRNA that actually codes for the protein is referred to as an open reading frame (or ORF for short). For many years, most scientists assumed that, except for in bacteria, each mature mRNA in an organism has just a single functional ORF, and that this was generally the longest possible ORF within the mRNA. Many also assumed that RNAs copied from genes that had been labelled as “non-coding” or as “pseudogenes” did not contain functional ORFs.</p><p>Yet, new ORFs encoding small proteins were recently discovered in RNAs (or parts of RNA) that had previously been annotated as non-coding. Working out what these small proteins actually do will require scientists being able to find more of these overlooked ORFs.</p><p>The RNAs produced by many organisms – from humans and mice to fruit flies and yeast – have been catalogued and the data stored in publicly accessible databases. Samandi, Roy et al. have now taken a fresh look at the data for nine different organisms, and identified several thousand examples of possibly overlooked ORFs, which they refer to as “alternative ORFs”. This included more than 180,000 from humans.</p><p>Further analysis of other datasets that captured details of the proteins actually produced in human cells uncovered thousands of small proteins encoded by the predicted alternative ORFs. Many of the so-called alternative proteins also resembled parts of other proteins that have a known activity or function. Lastly, Samandi, Roy et al. focused on two alternative proteins and showed that they both might affect the activity of the proteins coded within the main ORF in their respective genes.</p><p>These findings reveal new details about the different proteins encoded within the genes of humans and other organisms, including that many mRNAs encode more that one protein. The implications and applications of this research could be far-reaching, and may help scientists to better understand how genes work in both health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>small proteins</kwd><kwd>open reading frames</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>alternative translation</kwd><kwd>translation initiation sites</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-137056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roucou</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouangraoua</surname><given-names>Aida</given-names></name><name><surname>Landry</surname><given-names>Christian R</given-names></name><name><surname>Roucou</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003151</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-PR-181807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landry</surname><given-names>Christian R</given-names></name><name><surname>Roucou</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009947</institution-id><institution>Merck Sharp and Dohme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roucou</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-136962</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roucou</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conventional annotations of coding sequences have missed thousands of short open-reading frames encoding proteins that are conserved and with specific functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Current protein databases are cornerstones of modern biology but are based on a number of assumptions. In particular, a mature mRNA is predicted to contain a single CDS; yet, ribosomes can select more than one translation initiation site (TIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mouilleron et al., 2016</xref>) on any single mRNA. Also, minimum size limits are imposed on the length of CDSs, resulting in many RNAs being mistakenly classified as non-coding (ncRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zanet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazzini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prabakaran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Slavoff et al., 2013</xref>). As a result of these assumptions, the size and complexity of most eukaryotic proteomes have probably been greatly underestimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrews and Rothnagel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fields et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saghatelian and Couso, 2015</xref>). In particular, few small proteins (defined as of 100 amino acids or less) are annotated in current databases. The absence of annotation of small proteins is a major bottleneck in the study of their function and their roles in health and disease. This is further supported by classical and recent examples of small proteins of functional importance, for instance many critical regulatory molecules such as the F0 subunit of the F0F1-ATPsynthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stock et al., 1999</xref>), the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase regulator phospholamban (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmitt et al., 2003</xref>), and the key regulator of iron homeostasis hepcidin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nemeth et al., 2004</xref>). This limitation also impedes our understanding of the process of origin of new genes, which are thought to contribute to evolutionary innovations. Because these genes generally code for small proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schlötterer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLysaght and Hurst, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sabath et al., 2012</xref>), they are difficult to unambiguously detect by proteomics and in fact are impossible to detect if they are not included in proteomics databases.</p><p>Functional annotation of ORFs encoding small proteins is particularly challenging since an unknown fraction of small ORFs may occur by chance in the transcriptome, generating a significant level of noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landry et al., 2015</xref>). However, given that many small proteins have important functions and are ultimately one of the most important sources of functional novelty, it is time to address the challenge of their functional annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landry et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We systematically reanalyzed several eukaryotic transcriptomes to annotate previously unannotated ORFs which we term alternative ORFs (altORFs), and we annotated the corresponding hidden proteome. Here, altORFs are defined as potential protein-coding ORFs in ncRNAs, in UTRs or in different reading frames from annotated CDSs in mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). For clarity, predicted proteins translated from altORFs are termed alternative proteins and proteins translated from annotated CDSs are termed reference proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27860.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Annotation of human altORFs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) AltORF nomenclature.

Because identical ORFs can be present in different RNA isoforms transcribed from the same genomic locus, the number of unique altORFs and CDSs becomes 183,191 and 54,498, respectively. AltORFs were also predicted in other organisms for comparison (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). By convention, only reference proteins are annotated in current protein databases. As expected, altORFs are on average small, with a size ranging from 30 to 1480 codons. Accordingly, the median size of predicted human alternative proteins is 45 amino acids compared to 460 for reference proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), and 92.96% of alternative proteins have less than 100 amino acids. Thus, the bulk of the translation products of altORFs would be small proteins. The majority of altORFs either overlap annotated CDSs in a different reading frame (35.98%) or are located in 3’UTRs (40.09%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). 9.83% of altORFs are located in repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>), compared to 2.45% of CDSs. To assess whether observed altORFs could be attributable solely to random occurrence, due for instance to the base composition of the transcriptome, we estimated the expected number of altORFs generated in 100 shuffled human transcriptomes. Overall, we observed 62,307 more altORFs than would be expected from random occurrence alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; p&lt;0.0001). This analysis suggests that a large number are expected by chance alone but that at the same time, a large absolute number could potentially be maintained and be functional. The density of altORFs observed in the CDSs, 3’UTRs and ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) was markedly higher than in the shuffled transcriptomes, suggesting that these are maintained at frequencies higher than expected by chance, again potentially due to their coding function. In contrast, the density of altORFs observed in 5’UTRs was much lower than in the shuffled transcriptomes, supporting recent claims that negative selection eliminates AUGs (and thus the potential for the evolution of altORFs) in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iacono et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neafsey and Galagan, 2007</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27860.009</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>AltORF and alternative protein annotations in different organisms.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Genomes</th><th colspan="6" valign="top">Features</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="2" valign="top"/><th colspan="2" valign="top">Transcripts</th><th colspan="2" valign="top">Current annotations</th><th colspan="2" valign="top">Annotations of alternative protein coding sequences</th></tr><tr><th>mRNAs</th><th>Others1*</th><th>CDSs</th><th>Proteins</th><th>AltORFs</th><th>Alternative proteins</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><italic>H. sapiens</italic> GRCh38 RefSeq GCF_000001405.26</td><td valign="top">67,765</td><td valign="top">11,755</td><td valign="top">68,264</td><td valign="top">54,498</td><td valign="top">539,134</td><td valign="top">183,191</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>P. troglodytes</italic> 2.1.4 RefSeq GCF_000001515.6</td><td valign="top">55,034</td><td valign="top">7527</td><td valign="top">55,243</td><td valign="top">41,774</td><td valign="top">416,515</td><td valign="top">161,663</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>M. musculus</italic> GRCm38p2, RefSeq GCF_000001635.22</td><td valign="top">73,450</td><td valign="top">18,886</td><td valign="top">73,55 1</td><td valign="top">53,573</td><td valign="top">642,203</td><td valign="top">215,472</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>B.

The first and second positions of a codon experience stronger purifying selection than the third because of redundancy in the genetic code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pollard et al., 2010</xref>). In the case of CDS regions overlapping altORFs with a shifted reading frame, the third codon positions of the CDSs are either the first or the second in the altORFs, and should thus also undergo purifying selection. We analyzed conservation of third codon positions of CDSs for 100 vertebrate species for 1088 altORFs completely nested within and conserved across vertebrates (human to zebrafish) with their 889 CDSs from 867 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We observed that in regions of the CDS overlapping altORFs, third codon positions were evolving at significantly more extreme speeds (slow or quick) than third codon positions of random control sequences from the entire CDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), reaching up to 67-fold for conservation at p&lt;0.0001 and 124-fold for accelerated evolution at p&lt;0.0001.

The plot contains 889 CDSs containing at least one fully nested altORF, paired with one of its altORFs selected at random (to avoid problems with statistical non-independence). PhyloPs for both altORFs and CDSs are based on third codons in the CDS reading frame, calculated across 100 vertebrate species. We compared these differences to those generated based on five random regions in CDSs with a similar length as altORFs. Expected quantiles of the differences (‘DQ’ columns) were identified and compared to the observed differences. We show the absolute numbers (‘n’) and observed-to-expected ratios (‘O/E’) for each quantile. There are clearly substantial over-representations of extreme values (red signaling conservation DQ 0.95, and blue signaling accelerated evolution DQ 0.05) with 317 of 889 altORFs (35.7%).

Only a small fraction of TISs detected by ribosomal profiling mapped to altORFs<sup>3’</sup> even if those are more abundant than altORF<sup>5’</sup> relative to shuffled transcriptomes, likely reflecting a recently resolved technical issue which prevented TIS detection in 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miettinen and Björklund, 2015</xref>). New methods to analyze ribosome profiling data are being developed and will likely uncover more translated altORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ji et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with the presence of functional altORFs<sup>3’</sup>, cap-independent translational sequences were recently discovered in human 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weingarten-Gabbay et al., 2016</xref>). Second, we re-analyzed proteomic data using our composite database containing alternative proteins in addition to annotated reference proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

In the first dataset, we detected 3957 predicted alternative proteins in the interactome of reference proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hein et al., 2015</xref>), providing a framework to uncover the function of these proteins. In a second proteomic dataset containing about 10,000 reference human proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rosenberger et al., 2014</xref>), a total of 549 predicted alternative proteins were detected. Using a phosphoproteomic large data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>), we detected 384 alternative proteins. The biological function of these proteins is supported by the observation that some alternative proteins are specifically phosphorylated in cells stimulated by the epidermal growth factor, and others are specifically phosphorylated during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Because the sequence similarities and the presence of particular signatures (families, domains, motifs, sites) are a good indicator of a protein's function, we analyzed the sequence of the predicted alternative proteins in several organisms with InterProScan, an analysis and classification tool for characterizing unknown protein sequences by predicting the presence of combined protein signatures from most main domain databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitchell et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

With respect to the targeting of proteins to the secretory pathway or to cellular membranes, the main difference between the alternative and the reference proteomes lies in the very low number of proteins with both signal peptides and transmembrane domains. Most of the alternative proteins with a signal peptide do not have a transmembrane segment and are predicted to be secreted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c,d</xref>), supporting the presence of large numbers of alternative proteins in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vanderperre et al., 2013</xref>). The majority of predicted alternative proteins with transmembrane domains have a single membrane spanning domain but some display up to 27 transmembrane regions, which is still within the range of reference proteins that show a maximum of 33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>).</p><p>We extended the functional annotation using the Gene Ontology. A total of 585 alternative proteins were assigned 419 different InterPro entries, and 343 of them were tentatively assigned 192 gene ontology terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). 15.5% (91/585) of alternative proteins with an InterPro entry were detected by MS or/and ribosome profiling, compared to 13.7% (22,055/161,110) for alternative proteins without an InterPro entry (p-value=1.13e-05, Fisher's exact test and chi-square test). Thus, predicted alternative proteins with InterPro entries are more likely to be detected, supporting their functional role. The most abundant class of predicted alternative proteins with at least one InterPro entry are C2H2 zinc finger proteins with 110 alternative proteins containing 187 C2H2-type/integrase DNA-binding domains, 91 C2H2 domains and 23 C2H2-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>). Eighteen of these (17.8%) were detected in public proteomic and ribosome profiling datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), a percentage that is similar to reference zinc finger proteins (20.1%). Alternative proteins have between 1 and 23 zinc finger domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>). Zinc fingers mediate protein-DNA, protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wolfe et al., 2000</xref>). The linker sequence separating adjacent finger motifs matches or resembles the consensus TGEK sequence in nearly half the annotated zinc finger proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laity et al., 2001</xref>). This linker confers high-affinity DNA binding and switches from a flexible to a rigid conformation to stabilize DNA binding. The consensus TGEK linker is present 46 times in 31 alternative zinc finger proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). These analyses show that a number of alternative proteins can be classified into families and will help deciphering their functions.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27860.029</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Gene ontology (GO) annotations for human alternative proteins.</title><p>GO terms assigned to InterPro entries are grouped into 13 categories for each of the three ontologies.

Thus, we examined whether there is any association between the % of overlap or identity and functional similarity within alternative/reference protein pairs. We performed blast searches of the 183,191 predicted alternative proteins against 54,498 reference proteins using BlastP. All altORFs with more than 80% identity and overlap had already been removed to generate our database (as indicated in the Materials and methods).

This study provides a unique opportunity to test if, in addition to possessing zinc finger domains, some pairs of reference and alternative proteins coded by the same gene may functionally interact. We re-analyzed the MS data using our alternative protein sequence database to detect alternative proteins in this interactome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Five alternative proteins (IP_168460.1, IP_168527.1, IP_270697.1, IP_273983.1, IP_279784.1) were identified within the interactome of their reference zinc finger proteins. This number was higher than expected by chance (p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>) based on 1 million binomial simulations of randomized interactomes. These physical interactions within zinc finger alternative/reference protein pairs suggest that there are examples of functional relationships between large and small proteins coded by the same genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Function of alternative proteins</title><p>Finally, we integrated the expression analyses and the conservation analyses of alternative/reference protein pairs to produce a high-confidence list of alternative proteins predicted to have a function and found 2715 alternative proteins in mammals (<italic>H. sapiens</italic> to <italic>B. taurus</italic>), and 44 in vertebrates (<italic>H. sapiens</italic> to <italic>D. rerio</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).

Its coding sequence is present in exon 2 of the <italic>MiD51/MIEF1/SMCR7L</italic> gene. This exon forms part of the 5’UTR for the canonical mRNA and is annotated as non-coding in current gene databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12a</xref>). Yet, altMiD51 is robustly detected by MS in several cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>: HEK293, HeLa Kyoto, HeLa S3, THP1 cells and gut tissue), and we validated some spectra using synthetic peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1</xref>), and it is also detected by ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vanderperre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). We confirmed co-expression of altMiD51 and MiD51 from the same transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12b</xref>). Importantly, the tripeptide LYR motif predicted with InterProScan and located in the N-terminal domain of altMiD51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12a</xref>) is a signature of mitochondrial proteins localized in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Angerer, 2015</xref>). Since <italic>MiD51/MIEF1/SMCR7L</italic> encodes the mitochondrial protein MiD51, which promotes mitochondrial fission by recruiting cytosolic Drp1, a member of the dynamin family of large GTPases, to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Losón et al., 2013</xref>), we tested for a possible functional connection between these two proteins expressed from the same mRNA. We first confirmed that MiD51 induces mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2</xref>). Remarkably, we found that altMiD51 also localizes at the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s3">Figure 12—figure supplement 3</xref>) and that its overexpression results in mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12d</xref>). This activity is unlikely to be through perturbation of oxidative phosphorylation since the overexpression of altMiD51 did not change oxygen consumption nor ATP and reactive oxygen species production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s4">Figure 12—figure supplement 4</xref>). The decrease in spare respiratory capacity in altMiD51-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s4">Figure 12—figure supplement 4a</xref>) likely resulted from mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Motori et al., 2013</xref>). The LYR domain is essential for altMiD51-induced mitochondrial fission since a mutant of the LYR domain, altMiD51(LYR→AAA) was unable to convert the mitochondrial morphology from tubular to fragmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12d</xref>). Drp1(K38A), a dominant negative mutant of Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smirnova et al., 1998</xref>), largely prevented the ability of altMiD51 to induce mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s5">Figure 12—figure supplement 5a</xref>). In a control experiment, co-expression of wild-type Drp1 and altMiD51 proteins resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s5">Figure 12—figure supplement 5b</xref>). Expression of the different constructs used in these experiments was verified by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s6">Figure 12—figure supplement 6</xref>). Drp1 knockdown interfered with altMiD51-induced mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>), confirming the proposition that Drp1 mediates altMiD51-induced mitochondrial fragmentation. It remains possible that altMiD51 promotes mitochondrial fission independently of Drp1 and is able to reverse the hyperfusion induced by Drp1 inactivation. However, Drp1 is the key player mediating mitochondrial fission and most likely mediates altMiD51-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, as indicated by our results.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27860.039</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>AltMiD51<sup>5’</sup> expression induces mitochondrial fission.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) AltMiD51<sup>5’</sup> coding sequence is located in exon two or the <italic>MiD51/MIEF1/SMCR7L</italic> gene and in the 5’UTR of the canonical mRNA (RefSeq NM_019008).+2 and+1 indicate reading frames.

In light of the increasing evidence from approaches such as ribosome profiling and MS-based proteomics that the one mRNA-one canonical CDS assumption is untenable, our findings provide the first clear functional insight into a new layer of regulation in genome function. While many observed altORFs may be evolutionary accidents with no functional role, several independent lines of evidence support translation and a functional role for thousands of alternative proteins: (1) overrepresentation of altORFs relative to shuffled sequences; (2) overrepresentation of altORF Kozak sequences; (3) active altORF translation detected via ribosomal profiling; (4) detection of thousands of alternative proteins in multiple existing proteomic datasets; (5) correlated altORF-CDS conservation, but with overrepresentation of highly conserved and fast-evolving altORFs; (6) overrepresentation of identical InterPro signatures between alternative and reference proteins encoded in the same mRNAs; and (7) presence of clear, striking examples in altMiD51, altDDIT3 and 5 alternative proteins interacting with their reference zinc finger proteins. While far from proven in our study, three of these lines of evidence (5, 6, and 7) would support the intriguing hypothesis that many altORFs code for proteins that cooperate functionally with the proteins coded by their CDSs. This hypothesis would also agree with recently increasing evidence that small proteins often regulate the function of larger proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couso and Patraquim, 2017</xref>). Further experimental examples and more detailed co-conservation studies will be needed to address this hypothesis.</p><p>The presence of two or more coding sequences in the same gene provides a mechanism for coordinated transcriptional regulation. Consequently, the transcription of these coding sequences can be turned on or off together, similar to prokaryotic operons. We speculate that having genes composed of a CDS and one or more altORFs gives rise to fewer, denser transcription units and allows cells to adapt more quickly with optimized energy expenditure to environmental changes.</p><p>Upstream ORFs, here labeled altORFs<sup>5’</sup>, are important translational regulators of canonical CDSs in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnstone et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the altORF<sup>5’</sup> encoding altDDIT3 was characterized as an inhibitory upstream ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jousse et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Young et al., 2016</xref>), but evidence of endogenous expression of the corresponding small protein was not sought. The detection of altMiD51 and altDDIT3 suggests that a fraction of altORFs<sup>5’</sup> may have dual functions as translation regulators and functional proteins.</p><p>Our results raise the question of the evolutionary origins of these altORFs. A first possible mechanism involves the polymorphism of initiation and stop codons during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Reinhardt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreatta et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, the generation of an early stop codon in the 5’end of a CDS could be followed by the evolution of another translation initiation site downstream, creating a new independent ORF in the 3’UTR of the canonical gene. This mechanism of altORF origin, reminiscent of gene fission, would at the same time produce a new altORF that has identical protein domains with the annotated CDS, as we observed for a substantial fraction (24%) of the 585 alternative proteins with an InterPro entry. A second mechanism would be de novo origin of ORFs, which would follow the well-established models of gene evolution <italic>de novo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schlötterer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knowles and McLysaght, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neme and Tautz, 2013</xref>) in which new ORFs are transcribed and translated and have new functions or await the evolution of new functions by mutations. The numerous altORFs with no detectable protein domains may have originated this way from previously non-coding regions or in regions that completely overlap with CDS in other reading frames.</p><p>Detection is an important challenge in the study of small proteins. A TIS detected by ribosome profiling does not necessarily imply that the protein is expressed as a stable molecule, and proteomic analyses more readily detect large proteins that generate several peptides after enzymatic digestion. In addition, evolutionarily novel genes tend to be poorly expressed, again reducing the probability of detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schlötterer, 2015</xref>). Here, we used a combination of five search engines, thus increasing the confidence and sensitivity of hits compared to single-search-engine processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vaudel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shteynberg et al., 2011</xref>). This strategy led to the detection of several thousand alternative proteins. However, ribosome profiling and MS have technical caveats and the comprehensive contribution of small proteins to the proteome will require more efforts, including the development of new tools such as specific antibodies.</p><p>Only a relatively small percentage of alternative proteins (22.6%) are functionally annotated with Interpro signatures, compared to reference proteins (96.9%). An obvious explanation is the small size of alternative proteins with a median size of 45 amino acids, which may not be able to accommodate large domains. It has been proposed that small proteins may be precursors of new proteins but require an elongation of their coding sequence before they display a useful cellular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couso and Patraquim, 2017</xref>). According to this hypothesis, it is possible that protein domains appear only after elongation of the coding sequence. Alternatively, InterPro domains were identified by investigating the reference proteome, and alternative proteins may have new domains and motifs that remain to be characterized. Finally, an unknown fraction of predicted altORFs may not be translated or may code for non-functional peptides.</p><p>In conclusion, our deep annotation of the transcriptome reveals that a large number of small eukaryotic proteins, possibly even the majority, are still not officially annotated. Our results with altMiD51, altDDIT3, and some zinc-finger proteins also suggest that some small and large proteins coded by the same mRNA may cooperate by regulating each other’s function or by functioning in the same pathway, confirming the few examples in the literature of unrelated proteins encoded in the same genes and functionally cooperating (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quelle et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramowitz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergeron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yosten et al., 2016</xref>). To determine whether or not this functional cooperation is a general feature of small/large protein pairs encoded in the same gene will require more experimental evidence.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27860.052</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Examples of proteins encoded in the same gene and functionally interacting</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"><bold>Gene</bold></th><th valign="top"><bold>Polypeptides</bold><sup>*</sup></th><th valign="top"><bold>Reference</bold></th><th valign="top"><bold>altORF localization</bold></th><th valign="top"><bold>altORF size aa</bold></th><th valign="top"><bold>Conservation</bold></th><th valign="top"><bold>Summary of functional relationship with the annotated protein</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"> CDKN2A, INK4</td><td valign="top">Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A or p16-INK4 (P42771), and p19ARF (Q8N726)</td><td valign="top">(61)</td><td valign="top">5'UTR</td><td valign="top">169</td><td valign="top">Human, mouse</td><td valign="top">the unitary inheritance of p16INK4a and p19ARF may underlie their dual requirement in cell cycle control.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> GNAS, XLalphas</td><td valign="top">Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(s) subunit alpha isoforms XLαs (Q5JWF2) and Alex (P84996)</td><td valign="top">(62)</td><td valign="top">5'UTR</td><td valign="top">+700</td><td valign="top">Human, mouse, rat</td><td valign="top">Both subunits transduce receptor signals into stimulation of adenylyl cyclase.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> ATXN1</td><td valign="top">Ataxin-1 (P54253) and altAtaxin-1</td><td valign="top">(63)</td><td valign="top">CDS</td><td valign="top">185</td><td valign="top">Human, chimpanzee, cow</td><td valign="top">Direct interaction</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Adora2A</td><td valign="top">A2A adenosine receptor (P30543) and uORF5</td><td valign="top">(64)</td><td valign="top">5'UTR</td><td valign="top">134</td><td valign="top">Human, chimpanzee, rat, mouse</td><td valign="top">A2AR stimulation increases the level of the uORF5 protein via post-transcriptional regulation.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> AGTR1</td><td valign="top">Angiotensin type 1a receptor (P25095) and PEP7</td><td valign="top">(65)</td><td valign="top">5'UTR</td><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">Highly conserved across mammalian species</td><td valign="top">Inhibits non-G protein-coupled signalling of angiotensin II, without altering the classical G protein-coupled pathway activated by the ligand.</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>*</sup>The UniProtKB accession is indicated when available.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Generation of alternative open-reading frames and alternative protein databases</title><p>Throughout this manuscript, annotated protein coding sequences and proteins in current databases are labeled annotated coding sequences or CDSs and reference proteins, respectively.

All reference proteins and the corresponding alternative proteins were combined together in each comparison so that all domains of all isoforms for a given reference protein were considered in each comparison.

Briefly, cells were lysed with co-ip lysis buffer (0.5 % NP40, Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.5, NaCl 150 mM and two EDTA-free Roche protease inhibitors per 50 mL of buffer). After 5 mins of lysis on ice, lysate was sonicated twice at 11% amplitude for 5 s with 3 min of cooling between sonication cycles. Lysate was centrifuged, supernatant was isolated and protein content was assessed using BCA assay (Pierce). GFP-Trap beads were conditioned with lysis buffer. 40 µL of beads were added to 2 mg of proteins at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. After overnight immunoprecipitation, beads were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min and supernatant was discarded.

Cells were plated in a XF96 plate (Seahorse Biosciences) at 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS with antibiotics. After 24 hr, cells were transfected for 24 hr with an empty vector (pcDNA3.1) or with the same vector expressing altMiD51<sup>Flag</sup> with GeneCellin tranfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were equilibrated in XF assay media supplemented with 25 mM glucose and 1 mM pyruvate and were incubated at 37°C in a CO<sub>2</sub>-free incubator for 1 hr. Baseline oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) of the cells were recorded with a mix/wait/measure times of 3/0/3 min respectively. Following these measurements, oligomycin (1 μM), FCCP (0.5 μM), and antimycin A/rotenone (1 μM) were sequentially injected, with oxygen consumption rate measurements recorded after each injection. Data were normalized to total protein in each well. For normalization, cells were lysed in the 96-well XF plates using 15 μl/well of RIPA lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% NaDeoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5).

HeLa cells were seeded onto 96-well black/clear bottom plates at a density of 6,000 cells per well with four replicates for each condition. After 24 hr, cells were transfected for 24 hr with an empty vector (pcDNA3.1) or with the same vector expressing altMiD51<sup>Flag</sup> with GeneCellin according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were untreated or incubated with the ROS inhibitor (N-acetyl-L-cysteine) at 10 mM for 1 hr. Following this, the cells were washed twice with the wash solution and then labeled for 1 hr with the Oxidative Stress Detection Reagent (green) diluted 1:1000 in the wash solution with or without the positive control ROS Inducer Pyocyanin at 100 µM. Fluorescence was monitored in real time. ROS accumulation rate was measured between 1 and 3 hr following induction.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Chen Xie (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes an analysis of Eukaryotic genomes to identify alternative open reading frames (altORFs). The paper posits the existence of a large number of altORFs. Evidence that these are indeed protein coding includes there existence as orthologs across several species and the apparent constraint on their evolution between species. The authors also describe how the proteins encoded within the same gene may participate in similar functions.</p><p>This interesting and important study should be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after addressing the major issues outlined below. Because this is the first systematical work about altORF, and the altORF list in the paper may play an important role in future research, the results have to be very solid and strict.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the generation of the altORF database the authors remove all sequences that share more than 80% identity with the reference proteome. Nevertheless, there are still questions related to the similarity between altORF and reference proteins originating from the same genes. The authors should examine whether there is any association between the% overlap and the functional similarity (in terms of protein domains, localization, function etc.). Even if the overlap is lower than 80%, protein pair may still share multiple features.</p><p>2) Previous proteogenomic studies that find novel protein sequences based on genomic data (including point mutations) show lower score distribution of the new sequences, compared to the reference proteome (Menschaert and Fenyo, and related papers). Together with the larger size of the alternative sequences, analyses normally results in high false discovery rate of alternative sequences. The authors should present the score distributions and examine whether such different distribution occurs also in their altORF. Based on these, they may require separating between the FDR filtrations of these databases (as done with genomic data).</p><p>3) The overlap between ribo-seq and MS-based proteomics is surprisingly low. The authors explain that limitation of ribo-seq mapping probably underestimates the identified ORFs. It should be explained why the MS data does not cover larger proportions of the Ribo-seq IDs. Deeper analysis of this comparison should determine whether these missing ORFs are expected to be more lowly expressed, or are these specific to the examined systems in each discipline. Importantly, in case that the examined systems are markedly different, the comparison might be meaningless. The authors should try to analyze similar systems to enable meaningful assessment of these approaches.</p><p>4) The authors studied the conservation of each human altORF or annotated CDS by checking whether it existed in other species, and found many conserved altORFs. They should consider the possibility that even a neutral ORF may stay intact until a disabling mutation is fixated. A short ORF has much lower probability to be disabled than a long ORF and stays intact for much longer time, and most of altORFs are very short. It will be better if the authors use a statistical model to estimate the disabling probability of an ORF with a specific length in a specific time. Then they may estimate how many altORFs are really under functional constraint.</p><p>5) The authors used PhyloP values representing 100 vertebrates basewise conservation of the third positions of altORF overlapping and non-overlapping regions in annotated CDS to study the selection pattern of altORF CDS, but they should only use altORF-annotated CDS pairs conserved in vertebrates instead of all of them. In addition, they can also compare the PhyloP values of the first and second positions with the third positions of altORF5', altORF3', and altORFnc conserved in vertebrates to investigate their selection pattern.</p><p>6) In their analyses of ribosome profiling data, the authors believed that a TIS with 10 or 5 reads is active. It may be an artifact because there are always reads in the 5' UTR of mRNA even there is no upstream ORF; and reads supporting the TIS of an altORFCDS may be just due to the translation of annotated CDS. That may explain why much more altORF5' and altORFCDS are supported than altORF3' and altORFnc. A more strict way is to check the periodicity of the reads, and there are already tools, such as RiboTaper or RibORF. The authors should use at least one of the tools to analyze and check whether they get the same pattern. In addition, the authors should also analyze the altORFs supported by proteomics data in the same way as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.</p><p>7) In their analyses of proteomics data, is it possible that the peptides of altORFs may also come from the microbe in human samples, such as parasites or infectious microbe? For example, randomly picking up a peptide &quot;MKHIPSR&quot; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">supplementary file 2</xref>, table &quot;RAW MS OUTPUT&quot;, row 9), and running NCBI BLASTP against the nr database, found four perfect matches, including one from a protein in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, which is an infectious bacteria. This phenomena may be highly likely for short peptides. Unless this scenario is highly improbable, the authors could filter out the peptides, which can also be from the microbe in human in order to make the evidence more reliable.</p><p>8) Subsection &quot;Evidence of functional coupling between reference and alternative proteins coded by the same genes&quot;, the authors claimed that &quot;If there is functional cooperation or shared function, one would expect orthologous alternative-reference protein pairs to be co-conserved&quot;. However, functional cooperated proteins are not necessarily co-conserved. For example, a newly originated altORF can also interact with its annotated CDS; many co-conserved proteins do not interact with each other, e.g., there are tens of thousands of proteins co-conserved in human and chimpanzee and most of them do not cooperate. The co-conservation analysis may be informative for multiple gene birth and death events in a large phylogenic tree of dozens or hundreds of species, but not in this case.</p><p>9) Paragraph two of the same subsection, the authors claimed &quot;Another mechanism that could functionally associate alternative and reference proteins from the same transcripts would be that they share protein domains&quot;. Proteins that share similar domains do not necessarily cooperate, and in contrast many proteins that do not share similar domains do interact nevertheless. The results about the zinc finger proteins and the two altORFs that are experimentally studied are interesting. However, it is better to remove the part about relation between co-conservation / domain sharing and functional cooperation.</p><p>10) Discussion first paragraph, the authors claimed that &quot;underrepresentation of altORFs in repeat sequences&quot; supported the functional role of altORFs. However, their altORFs were predicted from the transcriptional annotation that was probably underrepresented in repeat regions, and this observation may be simply caused by the biased locations of transcripts. They should also perform the same analysis of repeat regions with annotated CDS, and compare the results with those of altORFs. Combining this with the above two points, the statement of three lines of evidence: (6), (7), (8) should be removed.</p><p>11) Finally, the data at &quot;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://roucoulab.com/p/downloads">https://roucoulab.com/p/downloads</ext-link>&quot; only include simple information of altORFs. Considering that this altORF list may be important for further studies, as much information as possible should be provided in order to let others follow the work easier. We encourage the authors to include freely accessible and well-organized tables containing information about the 183,191 human altORFs and 51,818 annotated CDSs at their website. For each ORF/CDS, the authors should provide: ORF accession, ORF type (5', CDS, 3', nc), chromosome, start position, end position, sequence, transcript accession, conservation (chimpanzee, mouse,.[...], yeast), ribosome profiling evidence (each data set separately), proteomics evidence (each data set separately), predicted functional signatures.

The co-conservation or domain sharing evidence in this paper was very weak and did not support the conclusion, functional cooperation. In the other way, even the few cases mentioned in the paper, which altORFs and annotated ORFs did functionally interact with each other do not show co-conservation or domain sharing. Simply changing &quot;functional cooperation&quot; to &quot;functional relationship&quot; makes no difference. The relevant parts in the manuscript should be removed, and the Title and Abstract should also be edited accordingly.

Nevertheless, there are still questions related to the similarity between altORF and reference proteins originating from the same genes. The authors should examine whether there is any association between the% overlap and the functional similarity (in terms of protein domains, localization, function etc.). Even if the overlap is lower than 80%, protein pair may still share multiple features.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to examine whether there is any association between the% overlap or identity and functional similarity between alternative-reference protein pairs (encoded in the same gene), we have blasted the 183,191 predicted alternative proteins against 54,498 reference proteins using BlastP. All altORFs with more than 80% identity and overlap had already been removed to generate our database (as indicated in the Materials and methods). We have found 100 (0.055%) alternative proteins with 25 to 100% identity and 10 to 100% overlap with their reference protein pairs. Among them, 20 (0.00054%) alternative proteins share the same InterPro signature with their respective reference proteins. The distribution of the percentage of sequence identity and overlap between alternative-reference protein pairs with (w/, n=20) or without (w/o, n=80) identical Interpro signature is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3</xref>. We observed no significant differences between both groups (p-value=0.6272; Kolmogorov Smirnov test). We conclude that there is no significant association between identity/overlap and functional relationship.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Previous proteogenomic studies that find novel protein sequences based on genomic data (including point mutations) show lower score distribution of the new sequences, compared to the reference proteome (Menschaert and Fenyo, and related papers). Together with the larger size of the alternative sequences, analyses normally results in high false discovery rate of alternative sequences. The authors should present the score distributions and examine whether such different distribution occurs also in their altORF. Based on these, they may require separating between the FDR filtrations of these databases (as done with genomic data).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we compared the score distributions between reference proteins PSMs and previous combined FDR alternative proteins PSMs. We observed a significant difference in the distribution, even when comparing alternative and reference proteins with comparable numbers of peptides and PSM counts. Even though part of this difference is attributable to the small size of alternative proteins and thus reduced chances to produce high quality fragmentation products, we proceeded to separate alternative and reference proteins for FDR filtrations as previously described (PMID: 26670565, 25263569). This resulted in a reduced number of unique alternative protein hits of 4,872 (previously 10,362) and a total number of PSM of 15,491 (previously 40,478). The text, tables, figures and methods have been modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The overlap between ribo-seq and MS-based proteomics is surprisingly low. The authors explain that limitation of ribo-seq mapping probably underestimates the identified ORFs. It should be explained why the MS data does not cover larger proportions of the Ribo-seq IDs. Deeper analysis of this comparison should determine whether these missing ORFs are expected to be more lowly expressed, or are these specific to the examined systems in each discipline. Importantly, in case that the examined systems are markedly different, the comparison might be meaningless. The authors should try to analyze similar systems to enable meaningful assessment of these approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the overlap is low and two reasons may explain this observation. (1) For the prediction of altORFs, the predicted TIS is the AUG that defines the longest altORF. It is possible that experimental TISs correspond to downstream in-frame AUGs. Alternatively, our TIS predictions are based on the presence of AUG codons only. Yet, a fraction of experimental TISs occur on non-AUG codons. In both cases, an erroneous assumption (wrong AUG or non-AUG start site) in the prediction necessarily results in the lack of detection of the altORF by ribosome profiling. (2) About 40% of predicted and detected altORFs are localized in 3'UTRs. Even though a technical issue preventing ribosome profiling in 3'UTRs was recently resolved, as indicated in the manuscript, but no experimental data for initiating ribosomes has been published yet with this 3'UTR-optimized protocol.</p><p>Our goal was to use a novel protein sequence database with unannotated (or alternative) ORFs (mostly but not exclusively small ORFs), and reanalyze independent public large-scale MS and ribo-seq data, to test if novel proteins expressed from these alternative ORFs can be detected. Our aim was not to compare two independent methods, ribo-seq and MS, to identify these novel proteins. Thus, we believe that our study provides a proof of principle that many unassigned peptides in MS data can be assigned to alternative proteins, and TISs identified in ribo-seq data can also match alternative ORFs. In this manuscript, we further focused on the functional annotation and the functional relationships between proteins encoded in the same genes. Nevertheless, it will be interesting in further studies to run both MS and ribo-seq experiments on similar systems (same cells, same tissues) in order to show the expression of these novel proteins with two independent methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors studied the conservation of each human altORF or annotated CDS by checking whether it existed in other species, and found many conserved altORFs. They should consider the possibility that even a neutral ORF may stay intact until a disabling mutation is fixated. A short ORF has much lower probability to be disabled than a long ORF and stays intact for much longer time, and most of altORFs are very short. It will be better if the authors use a statistical model to estimate the disabling probability of an ORF with a specific length in a specific time. Then they may estimate how many altORFs are really under functional constraint.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting and important point, and our team exerted considerable effort discussing how we might successfully implement it. There are a number of operational challenges to designing a statistical model to estimate the probability that an ORF becomes disabled by a mutation. To start with, each ORF may have its own functionality and be subject to types of disabling mutations that cannot be easily identified by broad-scale bioinformatics approaches; this is likely to be particularly true for altORFs, which may represent understudied or novel protein classes. We thus started with the assumption that our model would look only at the introduction of a stop codon into a previously functioning sequence.</p><p>A proper model for this would minimally need to incorporate (a) the fact that different codons may appear with different frequencies in relation to nucleotide frequencies; (b) varying mutation rates depending on the nucleotide, codon, and larger genomic context; (c) different probabilities of arriving at a stop codon depending on the precursor codon; (d) varying mutation rates across the tree of life; (e) the probability that the stop codon is itself subsequently lost, so as to re-generate the detection of conservation in our analyses; and (f) the phylogenetic structure of the dataset. While it is certainly possible to construct such a model, it is also a formidable task we feel goes well beyond what is normally requested in the context of revising an article: it would require more effort than many entire publications, and could certainly not be achieved within the 2-month revision timeframe. For the moment, we have only generated the conservation data for 8 species (relative to humans), and this was itself a substantial task, but we would need many more and better phylogenetic resolution to run a convincing model.</p><p>We thus do not feel it is possible to run anything like a convincing model that would capture the probability that altORFs are disabled as a function of their length over evolutionary time, within the context of this article. Simplifying assumptions might be made, but they are likely to cause us to have substantial doubt as to the conclusions of the model. We have thus arrived at an intermediate solution we hope will prove satisfactory: we have examined the relationship between the length of alternative and reference proteins and their conservation in our existing data set. We do not think this analysis necessarily belongs in the manuscript itself (though we would be happy to include it in the Supplement if requested), but we do feel it should assuage any concerns that might be related to this point regarding the validity of our analyses, and we present the results here for the reviewers/editors.</p><p>Briefly, we plotted the number of species in which a protein (alternative or reference) was found conserved relative to humans (maximum of 8 for our eight species: yeast, nematodes, fruit flies, zebrafish, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, mice, cow, chimpanzee) against the length of the generated protein in codons. We did this for the full set of human reference proteins, the full set of alternative proteins, and several alternative protein subsets chosen to be progressively stronger candidates to code functional proteins. These additional categories were based on six criteria: (1) presence of a kozak sequence; (2) presence of a transmembrane sequence; (3) presence of a signaling peptide sequence; (4) presence of an interpro scan entry; (5) detection by mass spec; and (6) detection by TIS. The least stringent group was selected based on the presence of at least two of these criteria (&quot;weak candidates&quot;, 6085 alternative proteins). The next most stringent was to require both TIS and mass spec detection (&quot;TIS + MS&quot;, 467 alternative proteins). Third, we required 3 or more criteria (&quot;Strong candidates&quot;, 278 alternative proteins). Fourth, we required TIS and mass spec and one additional criteria (&quot;TIS + MS + 1&quot;; 99 alternative proteins).</p><p>We also analyzed the relationship statistically. Linear models did not appear to fully capture the relationship, so we tried a quadratic model, which had a better fit to the data in all cases. We additionally tried a cubic spline to assess whether the quadratic model was sufficient; spline coefficient p-values and visual inspection of splines indicated that there was little improvement over the quadratic model, so we limited ourselves to the quadratic model.</p><p>We present only the visual results, as there is little additional information to be gained from the statistical details. Please keep in mind the varying samples sizes - particularly, the very large number of reference proteins and alternative proteins relative to the numbers of more restrictive alternative proteins categories. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows that, as is known, CDSs are much longer than altORFs, and many more of them are fully conserved across all 8 species. However, the relationship between length and conservation in CDSs is strongly negatively quadratic, with highest conservation at intermediate lengths and a peak at about 350 codons. This same negative quadratic pattern was also apparent in all altORF categories, but was much less pronounced for the full altORF category than for the increasingly restrictive subsets. Notice how the peak of the quadratic curve becomes much sharper in increasingly stringent subsets.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27860.063</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27860-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>We believe the quadratic relationship indicates substantial complexity in the relationship between length and conservation. On the one hand, the comment of the reviewer is certainly right that shorter sequences are less likely to disappear randomly, and on the other it is known that longer sequences tend to be better conserved for other reasons (PMID 12410938, 24379829). There are probably other factors at play as well that combine to produce the observed quadratic relationships. We believe the progressively more quadratic relationships for the progressively more stringent altORF categories indicate an increasing detection of functional proteins in these categories. In the full altORF category, a mix of non-functional sequences likely dilutes the signal, and produces a straighter, less quadratic relationship that is closer to the linear decline predicted by the comment. In the more stringent categories, the increasing conservation at intermediate lengths suggests that those categories are successfully identifying sequences that respond to the full range of underlying forces that produce the quadratic relationship in the CDSs.</p><p>Crucially, we note that the strong quadratic relationships imply that a model that controls for the appearance of a stop codon would be inappropriate in this context. There are other factors at work that intersect with length, and if we were to model the impact of length on the persistence of a sequence based solely on the risk of a stop codon without also modelling these other factors, we would certainly arrive at false or misleading results.</p><p>Lastly, we note that the possibility of a large number of false positives among the 183K alternative proteins presents challenges for detecting a generalized signal, and that any future models along these lines will likely have to use our approach of selecting candidate altORFs based on additional criteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors used PhyloP values representing 100 vertebrates basewise conservation of the third positions of altORF overlapping and non-overlapping regions in annotated CDS to study the selection pattern of altORF CDS, but they should only use altORF-annotated CDS pairs conserved in vertebrates instead of all of them. In addition, they can also compare the PhyloP values of the first and second positions with the third positions of altORF5', altORF3', and altORFnc conserved in vertebrates to investigate their selection pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like first to highlight that this analysis was performed with altORFs completely nested within CDSs, as indicated in the manuscript. As requested by the reviewer, we have repeated this analysis with altORF-CDS pairs conserved in vertebrates. Since the reviewer mentions conserved altORFs-CDS pairs, we assumed he/she meant co-conserved pairs. In order to do that, we had to move up the co-conservation analysis from previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> (section &quot;Evidence of functional coupling between reference and alternative proteins coded by the same genes&quot;) to the &quot;Conservation analyses&quot; subsection (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The results of the new analysis appear in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and the conclusions have not changed. We have modified the text and the figure legend accordingly.</p><p>We have moved the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>With regards to the PhyloP values of the first and second positions with the third positions of altORF5', altORF3', and altORFnc conserved in vertebrates, we identified 30 co-conserved altORF5' and altORF3'. Since an altORFnc cannot be paired with a CDS (i.e. by definition, ncRNAs do not have an annotated CDS), altORFnc could not be included in this analysis. PhyloP values were extracted and plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> (graph A). We looked at conservation level in UTR regions outside co-conserved altORF5'-CDS and altORF3'-CDS pairs by examining phyloP values in 5 randomly picked non-altORF. Thus, for each altORF, we generated 5 random altORFs of the same length in the same UTR. These random UTRs do not overlap the non-random altORF. In most cases, average phyloP values were lower in the random altORFs compared to the non-random altORFs (graph B).</p><p>Among the 30 co-conserved altORF5' and altORF3', 6 altORFs (i.e. 20%) highlighted in red in the graphs display a clear pattern with PhyloP values for nucleotides 1 and 2 clearly above PhyloP values for nucleotide 3 (graph A), whilst this pattern completely disappears in the corresponding random altORFs (graph B).</p><p>Due to the low numbers of co-conserved altORF5'- and altORF3'-CDS pairs, we believe that it would be too speculative to draw a definitive conclusion and we have not included the results of this analysis in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27860.064</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-27860-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In their analyses of ribosome profiling data, the authors believed that a TIS with 10 or 5 reads is active. It may be an artifact because there are always reads in the 5' UTR of mRNA even there is no upstream ORF; and reads supporting the TIS of an altORFCDS may be just due to the translation of annotated CDS. That may explain why much more altORF5' and altORFCDS are supported than altORF3' and altORFnc. A more strict way is to check the periodicity of the reads, and there are already tools, such as RiboTaper or RibORF. The authors should use at least one of the tools to analyze and check whether they get the same pattern. In addition, the authors should also analyze the altORFs supported by proteomics data in the same way as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to mention that we did not select the 10 and 5 reads thresholds. These thresholds were those selected by the authors of the manuscripts used in our analyses. Since these manuscripts have already been peer-reviewed, we believe that it is reasonable to use what they believed are valid TISs, i.e. TISs with a minimum of 5 or 10 reads, depending on the study. Our analyses consisted in identifying TISs experimentally detected in those studies, which match predicted altORFs start sites.</p><p>With regards to the characteristic three-nucleotide periodicity of the reads, this applies only to elongating ribosomes, but not to initiating ribosomes (RiboTaper: PMID 26657557; RibORF: PMID 26687005. For a review: PMID 27015305). We analyzed ribosome profiling data for initiating ribosomes only. We did not analyze ribosome profiling data for elongating ribosome.</p><p>We have analyzed the altORFs supported by proteomics data in the same way as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, as requested by the reviewer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We have added the following text in the results: The majority of these proteins are coded by altORF<sup>CDS</sup>, but there are also significant contributions of altORF<sup>3'</sup>, altORF<sup>nc</sup> and altORF<sup>5'</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In their analyses of proteomics data, is it possible that the peptides of altORFs may also come from the microbe in human samples, such as parasites or infectious microbe? For example, randomly picking up a peptide &quot;MKHIPSR&quot; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">supplementary file 2</xref>, table &quot;RAW MS OUTPUT&quot;, row 9), and running NCBI BLASTP against the nr database, found four perfect matches, including one from a protein in Pseudomonas, which is an infectious bacteria. This phenomena may be highly likely for short peptides. Unless this scenario is highly improbable, the authors could filter out the peptides, which can also be from the microbe in human in order to make the evidence more reliable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have blasted all detected peptides against the proteome from several organisms.</p><p><italic><underline>-Pseudomonas</underline></italic>:</p><p>11,811 sequences from Uniprot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=Pseudomonas%20AND%20organism:%22pseudomonas%22&amp;fil=reviewed:yes&amp;sort=score">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=<italic>Pseudomonas</italic>%20AND%20organism:%22pseudomonas%22&amp;fil=reviewed:yes&amp;sort=score</ext-link>)</p><p>994100 sequences from NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/?term=Pseudomonas">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/?term=<italic>Pseudomonas</italic></ext-link>)</p><p>-<underline>Deinococcus</underline>: 202,035 sequences from NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/?term=deinococcus">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/?term=deinococcus</ext-link>)</p><p>-<italic><underline>Escherichia coli</underline></italic>:</p><p>4,446 sequences from Uniprot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=escherichia%20coli%20organism:%22escherichia%20coli%22&amp;fil=organism%3A%22Escherichia+coli+%28strain+K12%29+%5B83333%5D%22+AND+reviewed%3Ayes&amp;sort=score">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=escherichia%20coli%20organism:%22escherichia%20coli%22&amp;fil=organism%3A%22Escherichia+coli+%28strain+K12%29+%5B83333%5D%22+AND+reviewed%3Ayes&amp;sort=score</ext-link>)</p><p>3262888 sequences from NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/?term=Escherichia+Coli">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/?term=Escherichia+Coli</ext-link>)</p><p><underline>Archaeon</underline>: 574084 sequences from NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/?term=Archaeon">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/?term=Archaeon</ext-link>)</p><p><underline>Viruses</underline>: 17,374 sequences (173 different species) from Uniprot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=viruses&amp;fil=reviewed%3Ayes&amp;sort=score">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=viruses&amp;fil=reviewed%3Ayes&amp;sort=score</ext-link>)</p><p>Importantly, these blast outputs did not return any hits with 100 percent identity and 100% overlap.

Some of them may be annotated in the future or may never be annotated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection &quot;Evidence of functional coupling between reference and alternative proteins coded by the same genes&quot;, the authors claimed that &quot;If there is functional cooperation or shared function, one would expect orthologous alternative-reference protein pairs to be co-conserved&quot;. However, functional cooperated proteins are not necessarily co-conserved. For example, a newly originated altORF can also interact with its annotated CDS; many co-conserved proteins do not interact with each other, e.g., there are tens of thousands of proteins co-conserved in human and chimpanzee and most of them do not cooperate. The co-conservation analysis may be informative for multiple gene birth and death events in a large phylogenic tree of dozens or hundreds of species, but not in this case.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that co-conservation does not necessarily mean interaction or cooperation. Nevertheless, the assumption that proteins that function together in a pathway or in a complex are likely to be co-conserved more often than expected inspired the development of different computational methods to infer protein cooperation and build interaction networks (PMID 20334628, 17803817, 15128449). What we actually meant is that co-conservation more often than expected of a small and a large protein coded in the same gene would not necessarily mean functional cooperation or interaction, but would nevertheless support a possible relationship. In the revised manuscript, we use the term <italic>functional relationship</italic> rather than functional cooperation/interaction. We have also added the following sentence: &quot;The functional associations discussed here are potential functional interactions that do not necessarily imply physical interactions.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Paragraph two of the same subsection, the authors claimed &quot;Another mechanism that could functionally associate alternative and reference proteins from the same transcripts would be that they share protein domains&quot;. Proteins that share similar domains do not necessarily cooperate, and in contrast many proteins that do not share similar domains do interact nevertheless. The results about the zinc finger proteins and the two altORFs that are experimentally studied are interesting. However, it is better to remove the part about relation between co-conservation / domain sharing and functional cooperation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment that functional domain sharing does not imply cooperation or interaction. The functional associations discussed here are potential functional interactions, not direct physical interactions. Indeed, domains determine the function of proteins, and domain annotation is actually used by function prediction programs (PMID 16772267). In the absence of experimental evidence, inference of shared function can be obtained by comparative analyses of domains and motifs (PMID 27899635, 18177498, 15980588). Also, two proteins sharing common domains or belonging to the same family are more likely to be functionally linked, specifically have related functions with reference to molecular function and biological process (e.g. PMID 16632496).</p><p>We have changed the wording in order to avoid any misinterpretation. For example, we have systematically changed functional cooperation to functional relationship in the revised manuscript. In addition, we have added the following sentence earlier in the text (see response to comment 8): &quot;The functional associations discussed here are potential functional interactions that do not necessarily imply physical interactions.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Discussion first paragraph, the authors claimed that &quot;underrepresentation of altORFs in repeat sequences&quot; supported the functional role of altORFs. However, their altORFs were predicted from the transcriptional annotation that was probably underrepresented in repeat regions, and this observation may be simply caused by the biased locations of transcripts. They should also perform the same analysis of repeat regions with annotated CDS, and compare the results with those of altORFs. Combining this with the above two points, the statement of three lines of evidence: (6), (7), (8) should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not find evidence in the literature that recent transcriptional annotations are probably underrepresented in repeat regions. In contrast, a large proportion of the transcripts in the human genome are thought to be initiated from repetitive elements. The FANTOM4 project reported that 31.4% of cap-selected human transcripts initiate within repetitive elements (PMID 19377475). Another study on the landscape of transcription in human cells reported a figure of 18% (PMID 22955620). Other studies show that repeat regions are actively transcribed (e.g. PMID 25012247).</p><p>We have performed the analysis of repeat regions with CDSs. In agreement with the reviewer\x92s comment, the results shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> indicate that there are 4 times more altORFs that CDSs in repeat regions (9.83% vs 2.45%).

For each ORF/CDS, the authors should provide: ORF accession, ORF type (5', CDS, 3', nc), chromosome, start position, end position, sequence, transcript accession, conservation (chimpanzee, mouse, [...], yeast), ribosome profiling evidence (each data set separately), proteomics evidence (each data set separately), predicted functional signatures. Perhaps more data? It should not require too much effort since the data are already stored in MySQL database.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee.

The co-conservation or domain sharing evidence in this paper was very weak and did not support the conclusion, functional cooperation. In the other way, even the few cases mentioned in the paper which altORFs and annotated ORFs did functionally interact with each other do not show co-conservation or domain sharing. Simply changing &quot;functional cooperation&quot; to &quot;functional relationship&quot; makes no difference. The relevant parts in the manuscript should be removed, and the Title and Abstract should also be edited accordingly. Actually, the rest of the work is already very significant and solid.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have completely removed the co-conservation analysis and corrected the Title and the Abstract accordingly. Since the presence of identical domains in alternative/reference protein coded by the same genes is part of the functional annotation, an important goal of the manuscript, we left this observation in the Results section; however, we removed the term &quot;domain sharing&quot;.</p><p>We only briefly speculate about possible cooperation in the Discussion (Two sentences at the end of the first paragraph; one sentence in the last paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
