checkpoint kinase Mps1 senses kinetochore-microtubule attachment and promotes checkpoint signaling to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. The kinetochore scaffold Knl1, when phosphorylated by Mps1, recruits checkpoint complexes Bub1–Bub3 and BubR1–Bub3 to unattached kinetochores. Active checkpoint signaling ultimately enhances the assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) consisting of BubR1–Bub3, Mad2, and Cdc20, which inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome bound to Cdc20 (APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>) to delay anaphase onset. Using in vitro reconstitution, we show that Mps1 promotes APC/C inhibition by MCC components through phosphorylating Bub1 and Mad1. Phosphorylated Bub1 binds to Mad1–Mad2. Phosphorylated Mad1 directly interacts with Cdc20. Mutations of Mps1 phosphorylation sites in Bub1 or Mad1 abrogate the spindle checkpoint in human cells. Therefore, Mps1 promotes checkpoint activation through sequentially phosphorylating Knl1, Bub1, and Mad1. This sequential multi-target phosphorylation cascade makes the checkpoint highly responsive to Mps1 and to kinetochore-microtubule attachment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22513.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22513.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>spindle checkpoint</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP110465-P3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Hongtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP120717-P2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Hongtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Hongtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The spindle checkpoint kinase Mps1 sequentially phosphorylates multiple substrates to amplify checkpoint signals, making the checkpoint highly dependent on Mps1 function and directly responsive to kinetochore-microtubule attachment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Faithful chromosome segregation is ensured by a cellular surveillance system termed the spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Musacchio, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sacristan and Kops, 2015</xref>). During mitosis, the spindle checkpoint senses kinetochores that are not attached or improperly attached to spindle microtubules and enhances the production of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) consisting of BubR1–Bub3, Mad2, and Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sudakin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tang et al., 2001</xref>).

Inhibition of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> delays anaphase onset until all kinetochores in a mitotic cell achieve proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment. A dysfunctional spindle checkpoint causes chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy, which have been implicated in cancers, birth defects, and other human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gorbsky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holland and Cleveland, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The kinetochore-microtubule attachment is closely monitored by the evolutionarily conserved checkpoint kinase Mps1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravamudhan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hiruma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Winey, 2012</xref>).

MCC diffuses from kinetochores to inhibit APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> throughout the cell.</p><p>Artificial tethering of Mad1–Mad2 to attached kinetochores causes prolonged activation of the spindle checkpoint and delays anaphase onset in the absence of spindle poisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maldonado and Kapoor, 2011</xref>). This artificial activation of the checkpoint still requires the kinase activity of Mps1, indicating that, aside from Knl1 phosphorylation, Mps1 has downstream functions in the checkpoint. Studies in the budding and fission yeast suggest that one such function of Mps1 is to phosphorylate Bub1 and establish a phosphorylation-dependent interaction between Bub1 and Mad1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">London and Biggins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mora-Santos et al., 2016</xref>). Although the RLK motif in the Mad1 C-terminal domain (CTD) responsible for phospho-Bub1 binding is conserved from yeast to man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brady and Hardwick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>), this Mps1-stimulated Bub1–Mad1 interaction has not been formally demonstrated in humans. Whether Mps1 has additional roles in regulating Mad1 also remains to be established.</p><p>Here, we report a direct phosphorylation-dependent interaction between human Bub1 and Mad1 in vitro. This interaction requires phosphorylation of Bub1 by both Cdk1 and Mps1, and is critical for spindle checkpoint activation in human cells. We have in vitro reconstituted checkpoint-dependent APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition by MCC components, which requires a functional phospho-Bub1–Mad1 scaffold. Furthermore, we have found that Mps1 directly phosphorylates Mad1 in its CTD. Phosphorylated Mad1 CTD directly binds to the N-terminal region of Cdc20 and contributes to APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition presumably through stimulating MCC assembly. Therefore, Mps1 activates the spindle checkpoint through a three-step phosphorylation cascade. Phosphorylation of Knl1 by Mps1 enables Bub1 recruitment. Phosphorylation of Bub1 by Mps1 establishes the Bub1–Mad1 interaction. Phosphorylation of Mad1 by Mps1 positions Cdc20 for MCC assembly. We propose that this sequential multi-target phosphorylation cascade makes the checkpoint highly responsive to Mps1 whose function is directly regulated by kinetochore-microtubule attachment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphorylation of Bub1 by Cdk1 is required for the spindle checkpoint</title><p>Bub1 is a spindle checkpoint kinase conserved from yeast to man.

Recombinant Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup>–Bub3 was strongly phosphorylated at S459 by recombinant Cdk1, but not Mps1, in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This finding is consistent with the fact that Bub1 S459 is followed by a proline, and matches the minimal Cdk1 substrate consensus of [S/T]P. We next confirmed that Myc-Bub1 was indeed phosphorylated in mitotic HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, Bub1 S459 phosphorylation in mitosis was reduced upon treatment of the Mps1 inhibitor, reversine. Because recombinant Bub1 protein was not phosphorylated at S459 by Mps1 in vitro, the effect of Mps1 inhibition on S459 phosphorylation may be indirectly through checkpoint inactivation. This result further suggests that Bub1 S459 phosphorylation is regulated by the spindle checkpoint, possibly through the actions of phosphatases.</p><p>We then tested whether this phosphorylation site was required for the spindle checkpoint. HeLa cells depleted of endogenous Bub1 with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) had reduced mitotic index in the presence of taxol, indicative of checkpoint defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This mitotic arrest deficiency was rescued by ectopic expression of siRNA-resistant Bub1 full-length (FL), but not the S459A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting a requirement for Bub1 S459 phosphorylation in the spindle checkpoint.</p><p>In mitosis, Bub1 phosphorylates histone H2A and Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawashima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2004</xref>). While H2A phosphorylation by Bub1 contributes to Shugoshin recruitment to kinetochores and protection of centromeric cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawashima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2013b</xref>), Bub1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc20 contributes to the spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2004</xref>). We thus tested whether Bub1 S459 phosphorylation regulated its kinase activity. Bub1 FL and S459A exhibited comparable kinase activities towards Cdc20 S153 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, Bub1 S459 phosphorylation might contribute to checkpoint activation without compromising its kinase activity.</p><p>Bub1 is known to have a scaffolding role in the spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klebig et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, expression of the Bub1 mutant lacking the kinase domain (Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup>) at higher levels restored the taxol-induced mitotic arrest of Bub1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup> S459A failed to rescue the mitotic arrest deficiency caused by Bub1 depletion. This result suggests that the scaffolding function of the non-kinase region of Bub1 requires S459 phosphorylation.</p><p>To further confirm a role of Bub1 S459 phosphorylation in checkpoint-dependent mitotic arrest, we performed live-cell imaging of HeLa cells stably expressing GFP Bub1<sup>FL</sup>, Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup>, or Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup> S459A that were depleted of endogenous Bub1. In the presence of taxol, cells expressing Bub1<sup>FL</sup> or Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup> stayed in mitosis for about 6.7 hr or 4.7 hr, respectively, before undergoing mitotic cell death or slippage.

Collectively, these lines of evidence suggest the non-kinase region of Bub1 has an important role in supporting the spindle checkpoint, and this role requires phosphorylation of S459 by Cdk1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phosphorylation of yeast Bub1 by Mps1 enables its binding to Mad1</title><p>It has been reported previously that the middle region of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Bub1 (scBub1), when phosphorylated by Mps1, binds to Mad1–Mad2 and that this phosphorylation-dependent Bub1–Mad1 interaction is critical for the spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">London and Biggins, 2014</xref>). An attractive hypothesis is that phosphorylation of S459 in human Bub1 by Cdk1 similarly enables its binding to Mad1. However, despite repeated attempts, we could not detect binding between Mad1 and recombinant Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup>–Bub3 phosphorylated by Cdk1 in vitro. We decided to first examine whether phosphorylation of T453 of scBub1 (which corresponds to S459 in human Bub1) was required for binding to scMad1. Because the full-length Mad1 was difficult to express, we used a C-terminal fragment of Mad1 (Mad1<sup>E</sup>) that contains both the Mad2-interacting motif (MIM) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Co-expression of scBub1<sub>369–608</sub> with the kinase domain of scMps1 in bacteria led to phosphorylation of the scBub1 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">London and Biggins, 2014</xref>), only the phosphorylated scBub1 bound to the scMad1<sup>E</sup>–scMad2 complex. Internal deletion of the CM rendered scBub1<sub>369–608</sub> unable to bind to scMad1–Mad2, indicating a requirement of this motif in this interaction. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis showed that the smaller phosphorylated scBub1<sub>449–530</sub> fragment containing the CM bound to scMad1–Mad2 with a moderate affinity of 2.2 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, this phospho-scBub1 fragment bound to the CTD of scMad1 with a similar affinity, indicating that Mad1 CTD is sufficient for the scBub1–scMad1 interaction, and Mad2 and the MIM of Mad1 are not required for this interaction.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22513.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sequential phosphorylation of human Bub1 by Cdk1 and Mps1 enhances its binding to Mad1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domains and motifs of Mad1.

Our mass spectrometry analysis revealed that all three residues were phosphorylated in scBub1<sub>449–530</sub> co-expressed with scMps1. We next synthesized scBub1 CM phospho-peptides containing pT453 or pT455 or both. We could not test the contribution of scBub1 pS458 to scMad1 binding, because the synthesis of pS458-containing peptides failed for unknown reasons. Both the singly phosphorylated pT455 peptide and the doubly phosphorylated pT453-pT455 peptide, but not the singly phosphorylated pT453 peptide, bound efficiently to scMad1 CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Mutating the conserved RLK motif in Mad1 CTD abolished scMad1 binding to both scBub1 phospho-CM peptides. Furthermore, ITC analysis showed that the pT455 and pT453-pT455 peptides bound to scMad1 CTD with the same affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, Mps1-dependent phosphorylation of scBub1 at T455 alone is sufficient to establish scBub1–scMad1 binding. The scBub1–scMad1 interaction is mainly mediated by phospho-T455 of scBub1 and the RLK motif of scMad1. We note that phosphorylation of the T455 site in scBub1 has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">London and Biggins, 2014</xref>), and mutation of this residue disrupts scBub1–scMad1 binding and causes benomyl sensitivity in yeast cells, establishing the functional relevance of this phosphorylation event.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sequential phosphorylation of human Bub1 by Cdk1 and Mps1 enhances Mad1 binding</title><p>Because phospho-T455 of scBub1 (which corresponds to T461 in human Bub1) was more critical for scMad1 binding than phospho-T453 (which corresponds to S459 in human Bub1), we wondered if phosphorylation of T461 in human Bub1 was similarly required for human Mad1 binding. We synthesized several phospho-peptides of human Bub1 CM and tested their binding to human Mad1. The pT461 peptide exhibited weak binding to human Mad1 CTD, and the doubly phosphorylated pS459-pT461 peptide had stronger binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). ITC assays confirmed that human Mad1 bound with higher affinity to the pS459-pT461 peptide than to the pT461 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As a specificity control, binding of both peptides was reduced by mutating the RLK motif in Mad1 CTD. Interestingly, the triply phosphorylated pS459-pT461-pT464 peptide bound more weakly to Mad1 than the pS459-pT461 peptide, indicating that phosphorylation of T464 had an inhibitory effect. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of both S459 and T461 of human Bub1 is required for its optimal interaction with Mad1.</p><p>We generated a phospho-specific antibody that recognized both pS459 and pT461 (pSpT) in Bub1. Incubation of recombinant Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup>–Bub3 with both Cdk1 and Mps1 led to efficient phosphorylation of both residues, whereas incubation with either kinase did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The pSpT antibody did not recognize the Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup>S459A/T461A (SATA) mutant treated with both Cdk1 and Mps1, demonstrating the specificity of the antibody. The weak signal seen with Cdk1 alone was likely due to cross-reactivity of the pSpT antibody with Bub1 singly phosphorylated at S459. We then tested the order of these two Cdk1- and Mps1-mediated phosphorylation events. When we first incubated Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup> with Cdk1 to phosphorylate S459 and then inhibited Cdk1 with RO3306, subsequent addition of Mps1 led to efficient phosphorylation at T461, as detected by the pSpT antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, when we first incubated Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup> with Mps1, inhibited Mps1 with reversine, and then added Cdk1, Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup> was still efficiently phosphorylated at S459, but was only weakly phosphorylated at T461, as revealed by a weak pSpT signal. This result suggests that phosphorylation of Bub1 at S459 and T461 by Cdk1 and Mps1 occurs sequentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Cdk1 phosphorylation at S459 primes Mps1 phosphorylation at T461. This notion is consistent with the fact that Mps1 prefers to phosphorylate sites with an acidic residue at the −2 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dou et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>With both Cdk1- and Mps1-mediated phosphorylation, we observed an interaction between human Bub1<sup>ΔK</sup>–Bub3 and GST-Mad1<sup>E</sup>–Mad2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). As important controls, mutations of both phosphorylation sites on Bub1 or the RLK motif on Mad1 greatly reduced this interaction.

Similar to Bub1 S459A, neither Bub1 T461A nor Bub1 SATA could rescue the mitotic arrest deficiency caused by depletion of endogenous Bub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Moreover, as we showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jia et al., 2016</xref>), partial depletion of Bub1 and inhibition of Plk1 by BI 2536 synergistically inactivated the spindle checkpoint and reduced nocodazole-triggered mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). This mitotic arrest deficiency was rescued by the expression of siRNA-resistant Bub1 WT, but not S459A, T461A, or SATA, indicating that phosphorylation of both sites on Bub1 are critical for checkpoint signaling.</p><p>We further tested whether the RLK motif in Mad1 (which was likely the binding element of the Bub1 phospho-residues) was similarly required for the spindle checkpoint. Because we could not deplete Mad1 to sufficiently low levels to reveal a defect in nocodazole-dependent mitotic arrest, we adopted a previously reported strategy that involved the artificial targeting of Mad1 to kinetochores through a fusion to Mis12, a subunit of the outer kinetochore Mis12 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maldonado and Kapoor, 2011</xref>). Expression of the Mis12–Mad1 fusion protein caused spontaneous mitotic arrest, which was dependent on Mps1, BubR1, and Mad2, indicating that this arrest required an active spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Consistent with previous studies in yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballister et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinrich et al., 2014</xref>), the Mis12–Mad1 fusion proteins with the MIM or RLK motifs mutated failed to induce the mitotic arrest. Thus, both the Mad2-binding and Bub1-binding activities are critical for the checkpoint function of Mad1.

Although neither Bub1 nor Mad1 is a component of MCC, they both directly interact with MCC components. The constitutive Mad1–C-Mad2 complex interacts with O-Mad2 and converts it to I-Mad2, which can bind to Cdc20 to form the Cdc20–C-Mad2 complex. Furthermore, several previous studies have characterized the direct, checkpoint-relevant binding of Bub1 to Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di Fiore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diaz-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2008</xref>).

Incubation of the human Mad1<sup>E</sup>–Mad2 complex with human Mps1 and ATP slightly reduced the gel mobility of Mad1<sup>E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggestive of Mad1 phosphorylation by Mps1. Mass spectrometry analysis identified 15 phosphorylation sites in Mad1<sup>E</sup>, with 13 sites located in the flexible region N-terminal to the CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Only two sites, T644 and T716, were located in Mad1 CTD, a domain known to be important for the spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinrich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kruse et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with the initial discovery of human Mps1 as a dual-specificity kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mills et al., 1992</xref>), a tyrosine residue in Mad1 was phosphorylated by Mps1.</p><p>We used the Mis12–Mad1 fusion protein to test the potential relevance of these phosphorylation sites in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Mutating all identified phosphorylation sites in Mis12–Mad1 (YF-14A) abolished the mitotic arrest exerted by this fusion protein. Strikingly, mutating the two sites in the CTD individually (T644A and T716A) abrogated the function of Mis12–Mad1 more strongly than simultaneously mutating the 13 sites outside of the CTD. Mass spectrometry analysis of the endogenous Mad1 immunoprecipitated from mitotic HeLa cells did not produce coverage of the T644 or T716 regions. We thus generated a phospho-specific antibody against Mad1 phospho-T716, and confirmed that ectopically expressed Mad1 (with its MIM mutated to alanine prevent checkpoint inactivation; MIM/5A) was indeed phosphorylated at T716 during mitosis in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We could not detect T716 phosphorylation on endogenous Mad1, presumably due to the low sensitivity of the antibody. Our attempt to generate phospho-specific antibody against Mad1 phospho-T644 failed, preventing us from verifying that Mad1 T644 could indeed be phosphorylated in human cells. Taken together, our results suggest that phosphorylation of Mad1 by Mps1 might be required for Mad1 function in human cells, with the two sites in the CTD being the most critical ones.</p><p>We tested whether phosphorylation of these Mad1 sites was involved in MCC assembly and APC/C inhibition. Mad1<sup>E</sup>–Mad2 WT, but not the phosphorylation-deficient YF-14A mutant, supported Mps1-dependent MCC formation and APC/C inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Strikingly, mutation of a single phosphorylation site T716 in Mad1 abolished the stimulatory effect of Mps1. Thus, phosphorylation of Mad1 T716 by Mps1 enhances the formation of APC/C-inhibitory MCC in vitro. In contrast, the Mad1 T644A mutation did not affect the ability of Mps1 to stimulate MCC formation, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue contributes to Mad1 function in vivo through other mechanisms. Surprisingly, mutating the RLK motif of Mad1 also abolished the phospho-Mad1-dependent APC/C inhibition, even in the absence of Bub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This result indicates that the RLK motif has an additional function aside from binding to Bub1. There are two copies of the RLK motif in each Mad1 CTD homodimer. It is possible that one RLK copy binds to Bub1 while the other interacts with MCC components to facilitate MCC formation. Alternatively, the RLK mutation might have unintended structural consequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mps1-mediated phosphorylation of Mad1 at T716 promotes Cdc20 binding</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, Mps1 and Mad1<sup>E</sup>–Mad2 only stimulated the APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>-inhibitory activity of the MCC mixture containing Cdc20<sup>FL</sup>, but not that of the mixture containing Cdc20<sup>ΔN60</sup>. This suggests that Mps1-phosphorylated Mad1 might bind to the N-terminal tail of Cdc20, which contains two conserved basic motifs (BM1 and BM2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Indeed, the Mad1<sup>E</sup>–Mad2 complex pre-treated with the kinase domain of Mps1 was efficiently pulled down by the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged N-terminal fragment of Cdc20 (residues 1–170, Cdc20<sup>N</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Inhibition of Mps1 by reversine greatly reduced this interaction. Mutating T716, but not all other phosphorylation sites, greatly diminished this interaction. These results indicate that phosphorylation of Mad1 at T716 by Mps1 is necessary and sufficient for Cdc20<sup>N</sup> binding. Further mapping revealed a requirement for residues 26–37 of Cdc20 in phospho-Mad1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>), suggesting that BM1 (<sup>27</sup>RWQRK<sup>31</sup>) might be the binding site for Mad1 pT716. Because I-Mad2 binds to the Mad1-bound C-Mad2, this phosphorylation-dependent binding between Mad1 CTD and Cdc20<sup>N</sup> might place the MIM of Cdc20 in the vicinity of I-Mad2, promoting the formation of Cdc20–C-Mad2 complex, which can further bind BubR1 to form MCC.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22513.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of Mad1 T716 promotes its binding to Cdc20.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domains and motifs of Cdc20.

How Mps1 regulates checkpoint signaling is not fully understood. It is well established that Mps1 can phosphorylate Knl1 at multiple MELT motifs to recruit the Bub1–Bub3 complex to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krenn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">London et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Primorac et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shepperd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vleugel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamagishi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Mps1-dependent Bub1–Mad1 interaction has also been characterized in the budding and fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">London and Biggins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mora-Santos et al., 2016</xref>), but has so far not been reported in humans. In the current study, we have shown that after priming phosphorylation by Cdk1, human Mps1 can phosphorylate the conserved motif of human Bub1, which enables the binding of human Mad1. Therefore, Bub1 is another evolutionarily conserved substrate of Mps1. We have reconstituted phospho-Bub1–Mad1-dependent APC/C inhibition by MCC components in vitro and demonstrated a requirement for this interaction in the spindle checkpoint in human cells. In addition, we have identified novel phosphorylation events of Mad1 by Mps1, which are also required for checkpoint activation and APC/C inhibition. As a master kinase in the spindle checkpoint, Mps1 establishes a phosphorylation cascade by sequentially phosphorylating Knl1, Bub1, and Mad1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Such a multiple-target phosphorylation cascade reinforces the requirement for Mps1 during checkpoint activation, making checkpoint signaling completely dependent on and highly responsive to the kinase activity of Mps1.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22513.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A sequential multi-target phosphorylation cascade by Mps1 promotes the assembly and activation of the Bub1–Mad1 scaffold.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mps1 recognizes unattached kinetochores (KT) through its direct binding to the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80C). At kinetochores, Mps1 first phosphorylates Knl1 at multiple MELT motifs to recruit the Bub1–Bub3 complex (a). After Cdk1 phosphorylates Bub1 S459, Mps1 then phosphorylates Bub1 T461 (b). The doubly phosphorylated Bub1 conserved motif (CM) binds to and recruits the Mad1–C-Mad2 core complex. Mps1 then phosphorylates Mad1 at T716, and this phosphorylation enables Mad1 binding to Cdc20 (c). (<bold>B</bold>) The boxed region in (A) is magnified and shown with more molecular details here. The Mad1–C-Mad2 core complex bound to phosphorylated Bub1 CM can further recruit O-Mad2 and convert it to I-Mad2. The WD40 domain of Cdc20 is anchored to the Phe and KEN boxes of Bub1, whereas the N-terminal basic tail of Cdc20 is bound by the phosphorylated Mad1 CTD. This bipartite Cdc20-binding mode positions the MIM of Cdc20 close to I-Mad2, promoting the formation of the C-Mad2–Cdc20 complex. This binary complex can further bind to BubR1 (bound to Bub1 or from cytosol) to form MCC.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22513.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22513.012</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22513-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><p>The phosphorylated region of Bub1 and the RLK motif in Mad1 involved in phospho-peptide binding are both conserved from yeast to man, indicating a conserved binding mode. The checkpoint-dependent Bub1–Mad1 interaction is readily detectable in the budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brady and Hardwick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">London and Biggins, 2014</xref>). On the other hand, we have failed to detect the Bub1–Mad1 interaction in human cell lysates, even though we have demonstrated a role for Bub1 and the RLK motif of Mad1 in the kinetochore targeting of Mad1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). The yeast Bub1–Mad1 interaction requires only a single Mps1-dependent phosphorylation event at scBub1 T455, whereas the human Bub1–Mad1 interaction needs sequential phosphorylation at both S459 and T461 of human Bub1 by Cdk1 and Mps1 in vitro. In human cells, the Bub1–Mad1 interaction is likely buttressed by other factors at mitotic kinetochores. For example, the metazoan-specific Rod-Zwilch-ZW10 (RZZ) complex is particularly important for the Mad1 kinetochore localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caldas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Silió et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that RZZ contributes to the Bub1–Mad1 interaction when all are anchored at kinetochores. The intrinsically weak affinity between Bub1 and Mad1, along with the difficulty of preserving the doubly phosphorylated Bub1 and other auxiliary interactions only present at intact kinetochores, may underlie the difficulty in detecting the Bub1–Mad1 interaction in human cell lysates. The Bub1–Mad1 interaction is also observed in C. elegans, although in that case the interaction involves different domains of Bub1 and Mad1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moyle et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, there are species-specific differences in this functionally important interaction.</p><p>Mps1 prefers to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues with a negatively charged residue at the −2 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dou et al., 2011</xref>). Similar to the MELT motifs of Knl1, the T644 site of Mad1 (<sup>641</sup>IDIT<sup>644</sup>) identified in this study matches the substrate consensus of Mps1. Furthermore, phosphorylation of T461 in human Bub1 by Mps1 is enhanced by prior phosphorylation at S459 by Cdk1. The negatively charged phospho-S459 can serve the same purpose as the −2 acidic residue in the substrate recognition by Mps1. This type of Cdk1-primed Mps1 phosphorylation consensus likely exists in other Mps1 substrates. To our surprise, Mad1 T716 and adjacent residues do not match the consensus of Mps1 substrates. The MELT motifs of Knl1, Bub1 T461, and Mad1 T644 are all located in loops or flexible regions. In contrast, although it is surface exposed, Mad1 T716 resides in a well-folded α helix. We speculate that Mps1 might recognize Mad1 T716 through tertiary contacts, instead of a linear peptide motif. On the other hand, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that T716 is phosphorylated by a kinase other than Mps1 in vivo.</p><p>We do not know how phosphorylation of Mad1 T644 by Mps1 contributes to the spindle checkpoint, as it is not required for the reconstituted APC/C inhibition by MCC components in vitro. This phosphorylation does not appear to enhance the binding of phospho-Bub1 CM to Mad1. One possibility is that this phosphorylation is required for Mad1 CTD to interact with other regions of Bub1.</p><p>A key downstream activity of the spindle checkpoint is to inhibit APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>. We have reconstituted Bub1–Mad1- and Cdk1/Mps1-dependent checkpoint inhibition of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>. Although we did not directly monitor the kinetics of MCC formation, it is very likely that the effects of Bub1–Mad1 and Mps1 on APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition are through promoting the assembly of MCC. We note that Bub1 has been reported to directly interact with BubR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Overlack et al., 2015</xref>). The Bub1–BubR1 interaction has been reported to be dispensable for the spindle checkpoint, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). BubR1<sup>N</sup> used in our assay does not contain the Bub1-binding region. Thus, our assays do not test whether the Bub1–BubR1 interaction can contribute to MCC assembly and APC/C inhibition.</p><p>How the upstream checkpoint proteins, after being recruited to kinetochores, direct the assembly of MCC is an unresolved question. Our in vitro reconstitution experiments have provided important insight into this question. Our results support a model in which Bub1–Mad1 acts as a scaffold to recruit and activate MCC components, thus promoting MCC assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Two phosphorylation-dependent molecular interactions, the Bub1–Mad1 interaction and the Mad1–Cdc20 interaction, are critical for the assembly and proper function of the scaffold. We have dissected the individual contributions of these two interactions to MCC assembly and APC/C inhibition in vitro. For example, to define the function of Bub1–Mad1 in MCC assembly, we eliminated the effect of Mad1 phosphorylation by Mps1 through inhibiting Mps1 prior to the addition of Mad1, and through the use of Cdc20<sup>ΔN60</sup>, which no longer interacts with phosphorylated Mad1. Likewise, to assay the contribution of Mad1–Cdc20 to MCC assembly, we simply omitted Bub1 to eliminate its contribution. Although either interaction suffices to promote MCC assembly in vitro, disruption of either Bub1–Mad1 or Mad1–Cdc20 interactions in human cells largely abolished checkpoint activation Therefore, these two interactions likely cooperate with each other to promote checkpoint signaling in vivo. The Cdc20<sup>N</sup>-binding function of phosphorylated Mad1 CTD provides a possible explanation for the recent findings that Mad1 has additional checkpoint functions aside from recruiting and activating Mad2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinrich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kruse et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We propose that Bub1–Mad1 can simultaneously recruit I-Mad2, Cdc20, and BubR1 into the same large complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Within this complex, the WD40 domain of Cdc20 binds to the Phe and KEN boxes of Bub1, and the N-terminal tail of Cdc20 is anchored to phosphorylated Mad1 CTD. This bipartite anchorage may optimally position the MIM of Cdc20 in the vicinity of I-Mad2, allowing I-Mad2 to entrap the MIM. The resulting C-Mad2–Cdc20 complex can then bind to BubR1 to form MCC. Even though the Bub1–BubR1 interaction may not be critical for the checkpoint, the Bub1-bound BubR1 is in a good position to encounter Mad2–Cdc20 and to be incorporated into MCC.</p><p>In conclusion, combining in vitro reconstitution and cellular experiments, we have established the Bub1–Mad1 complex as an evolutionarily conserved catalytic platform for stimulating APC/C inhibition by MCC components. We have further demonstrated the importance of an Mps1-orchestrated phosphorylation cascade in forming and activating this catalytic platform. This multi-target, sequential phosphorylation cascade renders the checkpoint highly sensitive to changes in the kinase activity of Mps1. Because the kinetochore targeting of Mps1 itself is directly controlled by kinetochore-microtubule attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hiruma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ji et al., 2015</xref>), our findings further highlight a unique signal-transducing principle of the spindle checkpoint that not only enables signal amplification but also keeps the final signaling output responsive to kinetochore attachment status.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HeLa Tet-On cells were initially purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA), and were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine.

Cell pellets were lysed with the wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 0.1% NP-40, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM NaF, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 500 nM okadaic acid, and 10 units/ml TurboNuclease (Accelagen). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with antibody-coupled Protein A beads (Bio-Rad) at 4°C for 2 hr. Proteins bound to beads were released with the SDS loading buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. For quantitative Western blots, immunoglobulin G (IgG) (H+L) conjugated with Dylight 680 or Dylight 800 (Cell Signaling) was used as the secondary antibody. The membrane strips were scanned with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Protein purification</title><p>Expression of GST-BubR1<sup>N</sup> (residues 1–370), GST-Mad2, GST-scBub1 fragments, GST-Mad1, and GST-scMad1 fragments in BL21(DE3) was induced by 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16°C overnight, after the OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.8. Mad1 and scMad1 fragments (Mad1<sup>E</sup>) containing the Mad2-interacting motif (MIM) were co-expressed with Mad2 and scMad2, respectively. Fragments of scBub1 were co-expressed with His<sub>6</sub>-scMps1 (the kinase domain; residues 440–720). Harvested pellets were lysed in the wash buffer I [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol] supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail.

Bub1 and Cdk1 were co-expressed with Bub3 and Cyclin B1, respectively. Insect cells were infected with the appropriate viruses for 50 hr before being harvested. Cells expressing Bub1–Bub3, Mps1, or Cdk1–Cyclin B were lysed in the wash buffer I supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail. Cleared lysates were incubated with pre-equilibrated Strep-Tactin Superflow (Qiagen) or Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads. The protein-bound beads were washed and eluted with dethiobiotin (Sigma) or reduced glutathione.

Bait-bound beads were then blocked with 2% fat-free milk when necessary before being mixed with 100 µl diluted prey proteins. After incubation, beads were washed and eluted with the SDS loading buffer. The bead-bound proteins were analyzed by Coomassie blue staining or Western blotting. For the quantification of band intensities, Coomassie-stained gels were scanned and quantified with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). In cases that synthesized peptides were used as bait, peptides were immobilized on SulfoLink resin (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The synthetic scBub1 peptides contained residues 449–473 of scBub1, various phospho-residues, and a cysteine at the N-terminus. All synthetic human Bub1 peptides, except the pS459 peptide, contained residue 455–477 of human Bub1, the appropriate phospho-residues, and a cysteine at the N-terminus. The Bub1 pS459 peptide contained residues 439–480, pT452/pS459, and a cysteine at the C-terminus.</p><p>All isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays were performed with a MicroCal Omega ITC200 titration calorimeter (GE Life Sciences) at 20°C. Recombinant scMad1<sup>CTD</sup> protein or scMad1–scMad2 complexes were dialyzed into the HEPES Buffer I (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). Recombinant human Mad1<sup>CTD</sup> protein was dialyzed into the HEPES Buffer II (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl). For each titration, 300 μl of scMad1 proteins (20 µM) or human Mad1 (50 µM) were added to the calorimeter cell. The scBub1 phospho-peptides or purified scMps1-phosphorylated scBub1<sub>449–530</sub> fragment (300 µM) in the HEPES Buffer I or the human Bub1 phospho-peptides (500 µM) in the HEPES Buffer II were injected with an injection syringe in 19 2-μl portions.

However, a mechanistic understanding of the catalytic assembly of the MCC at the kinetochore is still missing. In this study the authors provide important insights in the role of the kinases Cdk1 and Mps1 in promoting the interaction between Bub1 and Mad1 in human cells. In addition, they reveal a new function of MAD1 in recruiting Cdc20. Through in vitro reconstitution, they demonstrate that these interactions help to bring together the core components of the MCC, enabling its assembly. The work is of high quality and the findings are of great interest for the SAC field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One concern is with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, where we would be interested in seeing the same experiment without Plk1 inhibition – for better comparison to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p><p>2) It seems that experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref> may have been performed only once (low n).

Because these cell lines did not behave properly after long-term storage in liquid nitrogen, we have performed new experiments in triplicates using stable cell lines expressing GFP-Bub1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>). The results were consistent with the original dataset. With the large sample size (n&gt;150 for each sample), we could now see significant differences between the Bub1 FL and ΔK samples and between the ΔK WT and S459A samples.</p></body></sub-article></article>
