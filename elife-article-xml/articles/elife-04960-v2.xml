The essence of asymmetric cell division (ACD) is the polarization of cells and subsequent division, leading to unequal compartmentalization of cellular/extracellular components that confer distinct cell fates to daughter cells. Because precocious cell division before establishing cell polarity would lead to failure in ACD, these two processes must be tightly coupled; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells, ACD is prepared by stereotypical centrosome positioning. The centrosome orientation checkpoint (COC) further serves to ensure ACD by preventing mitosis upon centrosome misorientation. In this study, we show that Bazooka (Baz) provides a platform for the correct centrosome orientation and that Baz-centrosome association is the key event that is monitored by the COC. Our work provides a foundation for understanding how the correct cell polarity may be recognized by the cell to ensure productive ACD.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04960.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04960.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04960.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The tissues of an animal's body are built from cells that are originally derived from stem cells. Each stem cell can divide and give rise to another stem cell and a cell that will become a more specific type of cell—such as a nerve cell, muscle cell, or sperm cell. If this asymmetric cell division is disrupted, it can result in developmental disorders and diseases such as cancer.</p><p>When a cell divides, a structure known as the spindle separates the copies of the chromosomes into the two newly formed cells. The spindle consists of long protein filaments that extend from two smaller structures known as centrosomes, which are found at opposite sides of the cell. The position of these centrosomes governs the orientation of the spindle, which in turn determines the plane in which cell division takes place. Thus, cells that need to divide with a certain orientation must have a mechanism that ensures that their centrosomes are correctly positioned. However, the existence of such a mechanism has been underexplored, and it remains unclear how the alignment of the centrosomes is controlled.</p><p>Inaba et al. analyzed how stem cells in the male fruit fly divide asymmetrically to form one stem cell and second cell that develops into sperm. The experiments revealed that a protein called Bazooka (or Baz for short) closely associates with the centrosomes just before the cells start to divide. Many other animals—such as humans and worms—have proteins that are closely related to Bazooka, which are needed for asymmetric cell divisions. When Inaba et al. reduced the levels of the Bazooka protein in the fruit fly cells, a large number of these cells ended up with centrosomes that were incorrectly aligned. As a result, these cells' spindles were also oriented incorrectly.</p><p>These findings suggest that the interactions between Bazooka and the centrosomes inform a cell when the centrosomes are correctly orientated. However, further work will be required to determine the details of how Bazooka controls asymmetric cell divisions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04960.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04960.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>asymmetric division</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>niche</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM086481</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Yukiko M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute </institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Yukiko M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000870</institution-id><institution>John D. and Catherine T.

Disruption of this balance is postulated to underlie many pathological conditions, including tumorigenesis/tissue hyperplasia (due to excess self-renewal) and tissue degeneration/aging (due to excess differentiation). Intensive investigation has revealed the mechanisms that polarize cells and orient the division plane; however, less is known about how cells might respond to perturbation of cell polarity and whether/how cells might ensure that cell division occurs only after the establishment of correct polarity.</p><p>A mechanism to coordinate the timing of two potentially independent events during the cell cycle is defined as a checkpoint. The spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) in budding yeast is a prominent example of a checkpoint that coordinates cell division with cell polarity; mitotic exit is delayed by the activity of SPOC if the spindles are not correctly oriented in a manner to ensure equal segregation of chromosomes into the mother and daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pereira and Yamashita, 2011</xref>). A similar spindle orientation checkpoint mechanism is also reported in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gachet et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the importance of asymmetric divisions in the development of multicellular organisms, the potential checkpoint mechanisms that ensure asymmetric cell divisions, similar to the SPOC in the budding yeast, are poorly defined.</p><p>We have established <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells (GSCs) as a model to study the checkpoint that coordinates polarization of cells and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Inaba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> male GSCs divide asymmetrically, producing one stem cell and one differentiating cell, the gonialblast (GB). Asymmetric stem cell division is achieved by stereotypical positioning of the mother and daughter centrosomes in order to orient the spindle perpendicularly to the hub cells, the major component of the stem cell niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2007</xref>). Stereotypical centrosome behavior that occurs in preparation for asymmetric cell division has been described in other stem cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rebollo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rusan and Peifer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conduit and Raff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Januschke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Salzmann et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting the evolutionarily conserved nature of the process. Asymmetric GSC division is further ensured by the centrosome orientation checkpoint (COC) that prevents mitotic entry in the presence of incorrectly oriented centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Inaba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). Upon sensing the centrosome misorientation, COC is activated to prevent mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the defective COC can be suggested by the presence of misoriented spindles. We have shown that the centrosomal protein Cnn and a polarity kinase Par-1 are critical component of the COC, defects of which leading to high frequency of spindle misorientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Inaba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04960.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The apical centrosome associates with the Baz Patch.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The centrosome orientation in GSCs and the function of COC.

In the case of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), the lack of microtubule attachment to the kinetochore (or tension at the kinetochore) is sensed as defective spindle assembly, triggering SAC activation to halt mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). In the operation of the COC, what is sensed as correct or incorrect centrosome orientation to inactivate or activate the COC remains unknown. Here, we show that Bazooka (Baz)/Par-3, a well-established polarity protein and a known substrate of Par-1 kinase, forms a small subcellular structure that anchors the centrosome right before mitotic entry. We provide evidence that the association between Baz and the centrosome is the key event that is interpreted to indicate ‘correct centrosome orientation’ by GSCs. We further show that Par-1-dependent phosphorylation of Baz is critical for GSC spindle orientation. Our study provides a framework of the mechanism by which GSC sense correct cell polarity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Baz forms a subcellular structure between the hub and GSCs that closely associate with the centrosome</title><p>Baz/Par-3, which is a known physiological substrate of Par-1, contributes to cell polarity and spindle orientation in diverse systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Watts et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benton and St Johnston, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Siller and Doe, 2009</xref>). Because we previously found that Par-1 is a critical component of the COC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>), we examined the role of Baz in the centrosome orientation and/or COC. Baz has been reported to localize at the hub-GSC interface along with E-cadherin following overexpression in the germline (nos &gt; Baz-GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Leatherman and Dinardo, 2010</xref>), which was confirmed by using independent UAS-Baz-YFP construct (see below). However, closer inspection using antibody staining and Flytrap Baz-GFP that expresses endogenous levels of Baz [CC01941 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kelso et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buszczak et al., 2007</xref>)] revealed that Baz forms foci at the hub-GSC interface (referred to as the ‘Baz patch’ hereafter), instead of entirely colocalizing with E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The Baz patch is a small structure, with a size of approximately 1.5 µm, and this patch is considerably smaller than the GSC-hub interface that is marked by E-cadherin (4–6 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We noticed that the Baz patch was often closely associated with the apical centrosome (68.8 ± 2.2% of total GSCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, arrowheads). We termed this close association of the Baz patch and the centrosome ‘Baz-centrosome docking’. Baz-centrosome docking is a more specific criteria compared to centrosome orientation: ∼90% of total GSCs had ‘oriented’ centrosomes, a category that can be further subdivided into GSCs with ‘oriented, but not docked’ centrosomes (∼20%) and those with ‘oriented and docked’ centrosomes (∼70%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The remaining ∼10% of total GSCs had misoriented centrosomes as reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Baz-centrosome docking is cell cycle dependent and peaks during the late G2 phase</title><p>Using a combination of multiple cell cycle markers, we found that Baz-centrosome docking is cell cycle dependent, reaching a peak of ∼80% during late G2 phase. The GSC cell cycle was judged by the following criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). (1) A short pulse of ex vivo BrdU incorporation was used to detect cells in S phase. GSCs that were positive for BrdU were always connected with their differentiating daughters (GBs), which were also positive for BrdU in synchrony. This finding suggests that GSCs (and GBs) enter S phase prior to cytokinesis and that the G1 phase is extremely short. (2) As cells progress into G2 phase, GSCs started to accumulate Dap, a Cip/Kip family CDK inhibitor, in the nucleus, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Meyer et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, late G2 GSCs were detected as nuclear Dap-positive cells. (3) Prior to nuclear Dap accumulation, GSCs that completed cytokinesis, negative for BrdU and had not accumulated nuclear Dap were judged as early G2 phase.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04960.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Baz-centrosome docking is cell cycle-dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A representative image of an undocked centrosome in S phase.

During S phase, the frequency of Baz-centrosome docking was low (∼20%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>). GSCs in early G2 phase maintained low Baz-centrosome docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>); however, once GSCs reached late G2 phase, Baz-centrosome docking was elevated dramatically, reaching approximately 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). As GSCs entered mitosis, Baz was broadly distributed to the hub-GSC interface instead of being confined as a small patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This distribution resembled the Baz crescent that was observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schober et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wodarz et al., 1999</xref>). At this point in the cell cycle, Baz-centrosome docking could no longer be defined due to diffuse Baz localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, N/A). Together, these data demonstrate that Baz-centrosome docking is a cell cycle-dependent event that occurs just before mitotic entry.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Baz plays a critical role in the centrosome orientation and the COC</title><p>The tight association (docking) of the Baz patch and the centrosome just before mitotic entry led us to hypothesize that such association may be the physical basis for ‘correct centrosome orientation’ that allows GSCs to enter mitosis. We speculated that the Baz patch may provide a docking site for the centrosome to correctly orient and that once such docking occurs, GSCs may interpret this docking as ‘correct centrosome orientation’.</p><p>To address these possibilities, we first examined the potential role of Baz in centrosome orientation and COC function. We used centrosome and spindle misorientation as the major criteria for assessment of the function of centrosome orientation mechanism and the COC. If the centrosome orientation mechanism is defective, a high frequency of centrosome misorientation would result, although this scenario does not necessarily lead to spindle misorientation. If the COC is intact, GSCs with misoriented centrosomes would halt cell cycle progression prior to mitotic entry, resulting in a low frequency of spindle misorientation, even if the centrosomes are highly misoriented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). If the COC is also defective, then GSCs with misoriented centrosomes would enter mitosis unchecked, resulting in a high frequency of misoriented spindles.</p><p>We first attempted to knock down Baz using two independent RNAi lines (validated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In control GSCs, centrosomes were oriented in most of the GSCs (up to ∼10% centrosome misorientation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,G</xref>) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2007</xref>). On the contrary, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Baz caused a high frequency of centrosome misorientation in interphase GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,G</xref>). This result suggests that Baz is required for normal centrosome orientation in GSCs. Combined with the observation that the centrosome docks to the Baz patch, these results indicate that the Baz patch provides a physical platform for GSC centrosome association to achieve correct centrosome orientation. Baz RNAi caused a minor but statistically significant increase in the spindle misorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D, G</xref>), suggesting that Baz is also required for COC at least partially.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04960.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Baz is required for centrosome orientation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Control (<bold>A</bold>) and Baz RNAi (<bold>B</bold>) testes showing GSCs in interphase.

Upon overexpression, Baz often formed ectopic patches outside the hub-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, arrow) and often broadly localized to the hub-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Leatherman and Dinardo, 2010</xref>). Ectopic Baz patches were often associated with misoriented centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, inset), suggesting that the Baz patch has the ability to dock to centrosomes ectopically, even outside the hub-GSC interface. Strikingly, Baz overexpression led to a high frequency of spindle misorientation as well as centrosome misorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). These data indicate that the Baz patch can ectopically dock the centrosome, and this docking is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of the COC, allowing GSCs to enter mitosis with misoriented spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p>The status of COC activity was further assessed by a recently developed assay, in addition to scoring the centrosome and spindle misorientation. Recently, we showed that the treatment of testes with colcemid, a microtubule depolymerizing agent, can serve as a sensitive assay to monitor the COC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Venkei and Yamashita, 2015</xref>). When testes were incubated with colcemid, spermatogonia, the differentiating progeny of GSCs, arrest in mitosis due to the activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). On the contrary, GSCs arrest in G2 phase of the cell cycle instead of mitosis due to centrosome misorientation and activation of COC, which operates prior to SAC. In the absence of functional COC (such as in <italic>par-1</italic> mutant), however, colcemid treatment leads to SAC-mediated mitotic arrest by bypassing COC-mediated G2 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Thus, accumulation of mitotic GSCs in the presence of colcemid serves as a sensitive readout of defective COC. By using this method, we assessed the activity of COC in control, Baz RNAi and Baz-overexpressing GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Indeed, the results confirmed the model obtained by the scoring of centrosome/spindle orientation: (1) Baz RNAi GSCs maintain relatively intact COC activity, and (2) Baz-YFP overexpression allows GSCs to enter mitosis, presumably through ectopic Baz-centrosome docking, which inactivates COC activity.</p><p>In summary, the data presented here point to a model in which the Baz patch is a platform for centrosome anchoring, and the Baz-centrosome association (docking) is the cellular process that passes the COC to permit mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Considering the (partial) requirement of Baz in COC, we speculate that Baz may play dual roles in COC, depending on the centrosome-docking status: it might contribute to activation of COC when undocked with centrosomes, whereas it might inactivate COC when docked with centrosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Baz functions downstream of E-cadherin</title><p>Similar to Baz overexpression, overexpression of a dominant-negative E-cadherin (dCR4h) leads to a high frequency of misoriented spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Inaba et al., 2010</xref>). dCR4h lacks the extracellular domain and thus cannot engage in the homotypic interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Oda and Tsukita, 1999</xref>). As a result, overexpressed dCR4h localizes to the entire cortex of GSCs instead of being limited to the hub-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Inaba et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin may participate in anchoring of the centrosomes, and ectopic anchoring between dCR4h and the centrosome may satisfy the conditions required to inactivate the COC to allow mitotic progression.</p><p>Because Baz/Par-3 is recruited to adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Le Borgne et al., 2002</xref>), we speculated that Baz might function downstream of E-cadherin to anchor the centrosomes. To test this possibility, we first investigated the effect of dCR4h expression on Baz localization. GSC clones that express dCR4h were induced by heat-shock treatment (hs-FLP, nos &gt; stop &gt; gal4, UAS-dCR4h-GFP, UAS-GFP). In control GFP-negative GSCs, the Baz patch was observed as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, arrow). On the contrary, in GSCs that expressed dCR4h, Baz broadly localized along the hub-GSC interface, as opposed to concentrated localization as a patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, broken lines), and the frequency of Baz patch-positive GSCs was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that overexpression of dCR4h often formed ectopic Baz patches away from the hub-GSC interface, and such a Baz patch was associated with the centrosomes (approximately 10% of GSCs expressing dCR4h, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, Baz patch was undetectable in most of GSC clones that are homozygous for E-cadherin loss of function mutation (<italic>shg</italic><sup><italic>10469</italic></sup>) confirming that Baz localization depends on E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>).

The mechanism by which Par-1 mediates sensing of the correct centrosome position is unknown. Therefore, we set out to examine whether phosphorylation of Baz by Par-1 is important for COC function.</p><p>Two conserved serine residues of Baz protein, serine 151 (S151) and serine 1085 (S1085), are known to be phosphorylated by Par-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krahn et al., 2009</xref>). To begin to address the relationship between Baz and Par-1 in the COC, we first examined the phosphorylation status of Baz using phosphorylation-specific antibodies against phospho-S151 (pS151) and phospho-S1085 (pS1085) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krahn et al., 2009</xref>). We detected pS151 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), but not pS1085, at the Baz patch; thus, we focused only on pS151 function in subsequent experiments. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the Baz patch is dependent on the cell cycle and/or centrosome orientation status. Baz phosphorylation was considerably weaker in GSCs in early G2 phase with undocked but oriented centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>) compared to that in GSCs in late G2 phase when the centrosome is docked to the Baz patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D</xref>).

Upon expression of the nonphosphorylatable form of Baz (Baz-SA, Baz-S151A S1085A), GSCs showed a high frequency of centrosome and spindle misorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results clearly demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Baz by Par-1 is critical for COC function. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of wild-type Baz as well as the phosphomimetic form of Baz (Baz-SE, Baz-S151E) suppressed spindle misorientation caused by Par-1 RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of the non-phosphorylatable form of Baz (Baz-SA) did not rescue spindle misorientation due to Par-1 RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results clearly demonstrate that Par-1 executes its function in the COC mainly through phosphorylation of Baz. Notably, Baz-SE did not rescue the centrosome misorientation phenotype, and overexpression of Baz-SE in a wild-type background resulted in a high frequency of centrosome misorientation, despite near complete suppression of spindle misorientation caused by Par-1 RNAi. These observations suggest that although phosphorylation of Baz is sufficient for COC function, dephosphorylation is also important for anchoring the centrosomes. The cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation cycle of Baz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>) is also consistent with the idea that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle of Baz may be important for anchoring the centrosomes and monitoring centrosome orientation. Taken together, these results reveal the critical function of Par-1-mediated Baz phosphorylation in the function of the COC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Impact of COC defects on asymmetric outcome of GSC divisions</title><p>To further assess the outcome of COC defect in these mutant conditions described above, we scored the frequency of symmetric GSC divisions. After inducing GSC clones at a low frequency (i.e., dominantly single GSC clone/testis), symmetric outcome can be assessed by scoring the frequency of ‘doublet’ clones (i.e. two GSC clones are juxtaposed each other) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salzmann et al., 2013</xref>). Wild-type GSC clones showed a basal level of doublet frequency (∼10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This is due to expected low frequency events: (1) two juxtaposing GSCs become clones independently, and (2) ‘crawling back’ of GBs to the niche causes symmetric outcome of the division as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sheng and Matunis, 2011</xref>). dCR4h clones showed increased doublet frequency due to symmetric divisions as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salzmann et al., 2013</xref>). GSC clones of Baz overexpression, Baz RNAi or Par-1 RNAi showed significant increase in the frequency of doublet clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, GSC clones of Baz-SA as well as dCR4h with Baz RNAi did not increase the frequency of doublet clones. We did not examine Baz-SE, since Baz-SE yielded extremely low frequency of GSC clone induction for unknown reasons. These results demonstrate a correlation between COC defect/spindle misorientation and symmetric GSC division. However, the extent of spindle misorientation and the doublet clone frequency did not perfectly correlate, suggesting that there may be additional mechanisms to contribute to symmetric outcome: for example, spindle misorientation may not necessarily lead to symmetric GSC divisions, if spindle orientation is corrected after entering mitosis or the GSC clones are defective in niche adhesion in addition to spindle orientation.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04960.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>COC is required to prevent symmetric GSC divisions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An assay system to examine symmetric GSC divisions.

Precocious cell division before establishment of correct polarity would lead to a deleterious outcome, such as a failure in cell fate determination; however, the presence of checkpoint mechanisms to ensure asymmetric division has not been thoroughly investigated. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, which divide asymmetrically by stereotypically oriented spindles, a phenomenon called ‘telophase rescue’ has been reported: many mutants that compromise correct spindle orientation in neuroblasts eventually divide asymmetrically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schober et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wodarz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Peng et al., 2000</xref>).

Such correction might indicate the presence of an orientation/polarity checkpoint, although the mechanistic basis remains unknown. Thus, the COC may serve as a model system to study a new class of checkpoints that specialize in monitoring division orientation in multicellular organisms.</p><p>In the present study, we showed that Baz is a critical player in centrosome orientation and its checkpoint in <italic>Drosophila</italic> male GSCs. Baz forms a subcellular structure (Baz patch) at the hub-GSC interface, which anchors the apical centrosome prior to mitotic entry. Our data indicate that Baz-centrosome docking is the cellular event that is recognized by the COC as correct centrosome orientation. The data presented in this study point to the following working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>): (1) Baz patch is formed at the hub-GSC interphase in an E-cadherin-dependent manner. (2) Baz patch functions to recruit the centrosome. In the absence of Baz, centrosome is highly misoriented. (3) Baz is (partially) required for the COC activity. Baz patch that is not docked to the centrosome might contribute to the activation of COC to prevent mitotic entry. (4) Once Baz patch is docked to the centrosome, this docking is interpreted as 'correct centrosome orientation’, leading to inactivation of COC and thus mitotic entry. This model indicates that Baz plays dual roles in COC depending on its centrosome-docking status: in the absence of docking, Baz patch activates COC, whereas centrosome-docked Baz functions to inactivate COC.</p><p>Our results show that Par-1-mediated phosphorylation of Baz is critical for spindle orientation, although the mechanistic details of phosphorylated Baz function are yet to be determined. The fact that both phosphomimetic form (Baz-SE) as well as wild-type Baz can rescue spindle misorientation in Par-1 RNAi GSCs suggests that timing of phosphorylation might not be so critical, in spite of observed phosphorylation–dephosphorylation cycle of Baz during normal cell cycle. With the currently available data, it is unclear how temporal regulation of Baz phosphorylation relates to steps of Baz-centrosome docking, mitotic entry, and spindle orientation. Furthermore, it is puzzling that overexpression of Baz causes high frequency of spindle misorientation in wild type, whereas the overexpression of the same construct in Par-1 RNAi background lowers spindle misorientation. Future investigation is required to understand how distinct isoforms of Baz (phosphorylated vs non-phosphorylated) participate in distinct aspects of centrosome/spindle orientation.</p><p>In summary, our study reveals a cellular mechanism by which stem cells integrate information about cell polarity to regulate their cell cycle progression. Such a mechanism ultimately functions to ensure the asymmetric outcome of stem cell division.

The key to the concept of the checkpoint is how cells spend time (correcting, waiting) prior to commitment to the next cell cycle stage (i.e. mitotic entry in this case). Although measuring the cell cycle time and spindle orientation in GSCs for genotypes of interest would be the most direct way to test the hypothesis (as suggested by the reviewers), this is not practical for the following reasons: thus, we adapted a new assay to assess the COC activity, which provided significant new insights into COC mechanism, as summarized below.</p><p>Reasons that live observation is not practical in addressing COC activity: Cell cycle of GSCs is quite long (calculated to be 12-16 hours as shown in Yadlapalli et al., 2011, JCS), and one would have to observe two successive mitoses of a single GSC to measure the cell cycle time confidently. However, by the time of second mitosis (which can easily go beyond 20-30 hours after starting the ex vivo culture), the condition of the culture would not be an ideal one, leaving a concern on how valid the measured cell cycle time might be.</p><p>An alternative approach to assess the activity of COC: We recently reported a more sensitive assay to address COC activity (Venkei and Yamashita, Development 2015). We showed that upon addition of colcemid, whereas spermatogonia (differentiating progeny of GSCs) arrest in mitosis due to spindle assembly checkpoint, much like any other cell types reported to date (including mammalian culture cells etc.), GSCs instead arrest in G2 phase due to activation of COC (microtubule depolymerization leads to centrosome misorientation, which activates COC). We have further shown that, in GSCs defective in COC (such as par-1 mutant), GSCs would enter and arrest in mitosis (now due to the spindle assembly checkpoint, which is independent of COC). Thus, accumulation of mitotic GSCs in the presence of colcemid can serve as a very sensitive assay to detect defective COC.</p><p>The results of colcemid assay to assess COC activity in the genotypes dealt with in this manuscript: By using this new assay, we confirmed that 1) Baz is required for centrosome orientation, and plays a relatively minor role in COC, and 2) Baz-overexpression, as well as dCR4h overexpression, leads to defective COC as suggested by high frequency of spindle misorientation. These results thus strengthened our original conclusion.</p><p><italic>In the Cadherin experiments, when talking about</italic> “<italic>fewer spindles</italic>”<italic>, please be really clear about whether you mean a small fraction of the spindles that are seen, or a smaller total number of spindles. One expects fewer spindles, but the fraction of spindles that were mis-oriented should be the same as when Baz is present. Is this correct</italic>?</p><p>(This part was further clarified by the editors:)</p><p><italic>In the experiments testing dCR4h expression to spread out the e-cadherin, we are not sure we get the logic of the conclusion of the Baz knockdown:</italic> “<italic>As a result, the COC remains active due to a lack of Baz-centrosome docking, resulting in prevention of the GSCs from entering mitosis and a lower frequency of misoriented spindles.</italic>” <italic>I think what is confusing us is that if Baz is necessary for the checkpoint to be satisfied, then the checkpoint should never be satisfied whether or not the spindle is correctly oriented, and so what we would have expected is fewer spindles, period, but the fraction of spindles that were mis-oriented should be the same as when Baz is present. Perhaps this is a terminology issue, when the authors talk about</italic> “<italic>fewer spindles</italic>”<italic>, they need to be really clear about whether they mean a small fraction of the spindles that are seen, or a smaller total number of spindles</italic>.</p><p>We really appreciate this insightful comment. In the original manuscript, we interpreted the low frequency of spindle misorientation in GSCs of “Baz-RNAi + dCR4h overexpression” as indicating that the lack of Baz prevents COC clearance, explaining low frequency of misoriented spindles. However, contrary to this interpretation, we found that Baz-RNAi + dCR4h GSCs arrest in mitosis (instead of G2) upon colcemid treatment, suggesting that these GSCs are defective in COC or COC is falsely satisfied in this condition. This result indeed revealed that the reviewers’ insight was correct, and that they had sensed something that was not entirely logical in our original manuscript. We are very thankful that the reviewers prevented us from publishing the wrong interpretation we had before.</p><p>Now we have reached a better working model. Specifically, we revised our idea as following:</p><p>In our original manuscript, we speculated that Baz-centrosome docking is sufficient to induce mitotic entry (i.e. COC inactivation), but that Baz is not required for COC. However, our new data suggest Baz’s dual roles in centrosome orientation and COC (model: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), possibly depending on centrosome docking status: when Baz is docked with the centrosome, it signals to inactivate COC as proposed previously. In addition, we now speculate that Baz is (at least in part) required to activate COC when Baz patch is not docked with centrosome. The detailed discussion on this point is added to the revised text.</p><p><italic>Also in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>, the idea that Cad recruits baz is based solely on overexpression of a dominant negative construct. Loss of function studies should be included. Numerous Ecad alleles of varying strengths are available to facilitate this analysis</italic>.</p><p>We have added the scoring of Baz patch formation in GSC clones that are null for E-cadherin (FLP-FRT mediated mosaic clone using <italic>shg</italic><sup><italic>10469</italic></sup> (E-cadherin mutant)). This experiment confirmed that E-cadherin is required for Baz patch formation. The result is added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>, data on mitotic entry is lacking. The prediction is that mitotic index is higher in cadherin DN than cadherin DN + baz RNAi</italic>.</p><p>As described above, the reviewers’ suggestion led us to conduct additional experiments, which are now incorporated in the revised manuscript as a new model. Again, we are very grateful to the reviewers for helping us to reach a better understanding of the mechanism.</p><p><italic>The fact that Baz phosphomimetic mutant suppresses the spindle orientation defect of Par-1 RNAi indicates that the phosphorylation must not play a role in deciding when the checkpoint is satisfied, why then is the orientation defect in Par-1 RNAi suppressed by the phosphorylation? Also, an important control is to show that overexpression of wild type Baz does not cause this suppression.

We examined the effect of wild type Baz, as well as non-phosphorylatable form of Baz (Baz-SA) in the Par-1 RNAi background. This showed that wild type Baz can also rescue the spindle misorientation phenotype of Par-1 RNAi, whereas Baz-SA does not. These data indicate that: 1) Baz phosphorylation is critical for spindle orientation, 2) but (as reviewer suspected) the timing of phosphorylation might not play a major role in COC. We added these discussions in the main text, and also softened the description of checkpoint as suggested by the reviewers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
