maintenance and genetic diversification and is mediated by dedicated recombinase enzymes. Here, we describe an innate capacity for non-enzymatic recombination (and ligation) in random-sequence genetic oligomer pools. Specifically, we examine random and semi-random eicosamer (N<sub>20</sub>) pools of RNA, DNA and the unnatural genetic polymers ANA (arabino-), HNA (hexitol-) and AtNA (altritol-nucleic acids). While DNA, ANA and HNA pools proved inert, RNA (and to a lesser extent AtNA) pools displayed diverse modes of spontaneous intermolecular recombination, connecting recombination mechanistically to the vicinal ring cis-diol configuration shared by RNA and AtNA. Thus, the chemical constitution that renders both susceptible to hydrolysis emerges as the fundamental determinant of an innate capacity for recombination, which is shown to promote a concomitant increase in compositional, informational and structural pool complexity and hence evolutionary potential.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nucleic acids</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>ligation</kwd><kwd>non-enzymatic</kwd><kwd>origin of life</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105178804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Alexander I</given-names></name><name><surname>Porebski</surname><given-names>Benjamin T</given-names></name><name><surname>Houlihan</surname><given-names>Gillian</given-names></name><name><surname>Holliger</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012623</institution-id><institution>Federation of European Biochemical Societies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FEBS Long-Term Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mutschler</surname><given-names>Hannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OT/1414/128</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abramov</surname><given-names>Mikhail</given-names></name><name><surname>Herdewijn</surname><given-names>Piet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Vlaanderen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G078014N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abramov</surname><given-names>Mikhail</given-names></name><name><surname>Herdewijn</surname><given-names>Piet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Random sequence RNA pools display an innate capacity for ligation and recombination, enabling them to “bootstrap” themselves towards higher compositional, informational and structural complexity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The phenotypic richness of a biopolymer pool, that is the density of functional sequences within the sequence space (the totality of all available or possible sequences), is a central, if largely unexplored parameter of its evolutionary potential. This property critically informs many aspects of biological function including the adaptability of biological systems as a function of combinatorial diversity ranging from bacterial populations to the mammalian immune system and to abiotically-generated sequence pools. In all such cases, ‘survival’ (in a Darwinian sense) depends on the availability of functional entities (such as a neutralizing antibody) within the combinatorial space available to the system (such as the number of circulating B-lymphocytes or the size of a phage display repertoire). The same concept is also of central importance to the proposed spontaneous emergence of function from prebiotic pools of informational polymers, a key conjecture of current scenarios for the origin of life. Indeed, the phenotypic richness of random-sequence pools of the natural nucleic acids RNA and DNA, as well as a variety of xeno nucleic acids (XNAs), has been studied by in vitro selection methods reliant on iterative rounds of enrichment and amplification, yielding ligands (aptamers) and catalysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wachowius et al., 2017</xref>). Extrapolation from such selection experiments and analysis of the mutational landscapes of functional oligomers indicated a low frequency of such functional molecules (1 in 10<sup>10</sup>-10<sup>13</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson and Szostak, 1999</xref>), suggesting that, globally, the pools are essentially inert, although weak ligands/catalysts might be more frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ekland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knight et al., 2005</xref>). Together, experimental data and theoretical considerations suggest that function scales with sequence (i.e. information) and structural complexity (or a related property, termed ‘functional information’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carothers et al., 2004</xref>)). Thus, sequences with any given function (and among these, those with highest functionality) are more frequently found in longer, informationally and compositionally more complex, and by inference structurally more diverse pools, despite a potential trade-off through increased misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ekland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sabeti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carothers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Legiewicz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiménez et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with this, in silico models predict a sharp drop in the propensity of both folded structures and structural complexity in RNA pools with shorter oligomer lengths (&lt;25 nucleotides, nt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Briones et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, the pools of short, random RNA oligomers of mixed sequence composition (&lt;20 nt) accessible from prebiotic chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monnard et al., 2003</xref>) would be predicted to contain few defined three-dimensional structures and even fewer functional sequences. This raises the question how functions that would constitute a living system could ever have emerged spontaneously from such pools.</p><p>Starting from the premise that the global potential of oligomer pools for function may have been underestimated by an undue focus on single ‘hit’ sequences (i.e. fitness peaks), we have sought to examine the innate, global functional potential of the pools themselves, which has never been measured directly. Specifically, we examine pools of short RNA oligomers of semi- and fully-random sequence (with or without activation chemistry) and compare them to equivalent pools of chemically related but distinct genetic polymers, including DNA as well as the xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) ANA (arabino-), HNA (hexitol-) and AtNA (altritol-nucleic acids), with regards to a simple functional test: the ability to undergo intermolecular ligation and/or recombination. While DNA, ANA and HNA pools proved inert, we discover a pervasive tendency of diverse-sequence RNA (and to a lesser extent AtNA) pools to undergo ligation and/or recombination even in the absence of extraneous activation chemistry, and analyse the constitution and emergent properties of recombined pools by deep sequencing, bioinformatic analysis and in silico simulation. Our results suggest that RNA (and to a lesser extent AtNA) hold a privileged position among simple alternatives for genetic information storage and propagation due to an innate capacity for recombination enabled by energetically near-neutral transesterification chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eftink and Biltonen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Usher and McHale, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verlander et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Verlander and Orgel, 1974</xref>). Furthermore, our results demonstrate that such spontaneous, non-enzymatic recombination among random-sequence pool members acts to counterbalance hydrolytic decomposition and in the process, progressively increases pool compositional, informational and structural diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We chose to specifically examine 10<sup>15</sup>-member pools of eicosamer (20 nt long) RNAs. While still within the range of oligomer lengths likely to be accessible via prebiotic chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferris et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monnard et al., 2003</xref>), 20-mer sequences are predicted to exhibit at least some tendency for secondary structure formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Briones et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, a 10<sup>15</sup>-member eicosamer pool (1.7 nmol) comprises significant redundancy (909 copies) of each possible 20-mer sequence. Finally, as shown previously, naturally occurring 20-mer sequences can associate into non-covalent multimer complexes reconstituting function such as catalysis, when incubated in eutectic ice phases at −9 °C, as exemplified by the hairpin ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mutschler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vlassov et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In order to examine the innate potential of such pools for functionality (such asligation), we first examined the reactivity of 2’, 3’-cyclic phosphate (&gt;p)-activated random RNA pools. &gt;p groups form as part of RNA degradation reactions, as well as during proposed prebiotic nucleotide synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jarvinen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li and Breaker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Powner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibard et al., 2018</xref>) and can mediate non-enzymatic ligation in the presence of an organizing template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lutay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Usher and McHale, 1976</xref>). In order to maximize reactivity, we incubated pools in ice; eutectic ice phase formation has been shown to promote molecular concentration, reduce RNA hydrolysis, and provide a benign, compartmentalized medium, making water ice a potentially beneficial medium for RNA propagation at the origin of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attwater et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Attwater et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mutschler et al., 2015</xref>). We first incubated a &gt;p activated random RNA eicosamer pool (N<sub>20</sub>&gt;p, including 6% 5’-Carboxyfluorescein (FAM) labelled N<sub>20</sub>&gt;p to facilitate detection of ligation products) in ice without any organizing template and sought to detect higher molecular weight (MW) product bands by gel shift in denaturing gel electrophoresis (Urea-PAGE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We observed significant intermolecular, covalent N<sub>20</sub>&gt;p pool ligation with yields of ~10% (after 2 months, −9 °C) both in the presence or absence of magnesium (+ / - Mg<sup>2+</sup>) counterions (10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). No ligation was observed in equivalent control samples incubated at −80 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Deep sequencing of the most prominent higher MW band confirmed that &gt;80% of sequences corresponded to ligation events between two eicosamers (N<sub>20</sub> × N<sub>20</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, RNA eicosamer pools activated by &gt;p undergo a disproportionation reaction by intermolecular ligation, yielding a subpopulation of pool sequences extended in length (predominantly 40-mers and some 60-mers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>)).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43022.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reactivity of 2’, 3’ cyclic phosphate (&gt;p) activated N<sub>20</sub> RNA pools.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) N<sub>20</sub>&gt;p pools are incubated in eutectic ice phases, spiked with 6% 5’FAM (Carboxyfluorescein)-labelled N<sub>20</sub>&gt;p to facilitate detection of ligation products (orange) by Urea-PAGE.

In accordance with previous studies on &gt;p reactivity, this suggests that ligation is accelerated by inter-strand hybridization, which positions reactive groups in proximity and increases their effective concentration, while reducing the entropic cost of intermolecular ligation. In support of this, we found evidence for extensive intramolecular association and non-covalent complex formation in random eicosamer pools as judged by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, random pools contain a significant proportion of organizing templates through intermolecular hybridization among pool oligomers and this provides gapped duplex junctions poised for ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lutay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Usher and McHale, 1976</xref>).</p><p>We wondered if these pools contained RNA sequence motifs that would promote ligation by mechanisms other than gapped duplex formation. To aiddiscovery of specific motifs, we repeated the ligation experiments using semi-random RNA sequence pools comprising random eicosamers (N<sub>20</sub>) flanked by (unstructured) 20 nt constant sequence primer binding sites (C1<sub>20</sub>, C2<sub>20</sub>). The use of such ‘bait’ (C1<sub>20</sub>-N<sub>20</sub>&gt;p, B&gt;p) and ‘prey’ (5’OH-N<sub>20</sub>-C2<sub>20</sub>, OH-P) oligonucleotides (2.5 µM each) enabled rapid detection and analysis of intermolecular bait × prey (B × P) ligation products with high sensitivity by RT-PCR using primers complementary to C1<sub>20</sub> and C2<sub>20</sub> as well as much shorter incubation times than needed for direct detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

These yielded an even broader length distribution of products, comprising full-length 80 nt B-P ligation products (likely originating by direct nucleophilic attack of the bait pool terminal bait-3’OH (or −2’OH) attack on the 5’ppp of the prey pool), as well as a wide range of shorter products, derived from both B and P truncationlikely as a result of non-canonical, multi-step reaction trajectories. Indeed, we note that our method of RT-PCR amplification omits the detection of any potential intermolecular recombination or ligation product that does not display a B-P sequence arrangement. Therefore, bait or prey-pool self-ligation (or recombination) (yielding B-B, P-P type products) or reverse ligation (yielding P-B) or indeed non-canonical intramolecular reactions yielding circular, lariat or branched products (unless resolved into a B-P arrangement) are not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, although rapid and convenient, our PCR assay likely underestimates the true level of intra- and inter-pool reactivity (and the true molecular diversity of reaction products).</p><p>Nevertheless, most significantly (and consistent with the reactivities observed above), we observed comparable intermolecular reactivity in unmodified semi-random RNA sequence bait and prey pools (C1<sub>20</sub>-N<sub>20</sub>-3’OH × 5’OH-N<sub>20</sub>-C2<sub>20</sub>) - that is pure RNA pools devoid of phosphorylation or any other activation chemistry. Remarkably, these showed intermolecular assembly, yielding a similar distribution of truncated products as observed for bait-2’/3’p×5’OH prey reactions, suggesting intermolecular recombination via transesterification chemistry as outlined above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>).</p><p>In order to better understand the reactivity of unmodified RNA pools without the obscuring imprint of conserved C<sub>20</sub> sequences (and PCR amplification bias), we next sought to directly observe reactivity of random RNA eicosamer pools devoid of any activation chemistry. In these (bait × prey: 5’FAM-N<sub>20</sub>-3’OH × 5’OH-N<sub>20</sub>A<sub>10</sub>-3’OH), the prey pool included an invariant A<sub>10</sub> tail sequence to aid recovery and analysis (by poly-dT primed reverse transcription), and to allow detection of prey self-recombination products (P-P). After an extended incubation (5 months, −9 °C) we were able to directly visualize formation of two distinct recombination products by gel electrophoresis without any amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The two main product bands (Rec1 and Rec2, together ca. 2.3% yield) were analysed using either poly-dT-primed (for Rec1) or poly-U tailing followed by poly-dA primed SMARTer RT-PCR (Rec1 and Rec2) and deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For Rec1, we found recombination fragment distributions from ~40 to ~50 nt that include the characteristic fingerprint of a &gt;p ligation junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). In contrast, the longer (on average) Rec2 products (~45 to ~55 nt) showed an ApN ligation junction as they were formed (albeit less efficiently (ca. 0.2% yield)) from recombination of two prey segments within the A<sub>10</sub> tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Thus, as with the unmodified semi-random sequence RNA pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), intermolecular ligation products in random, non-activated RNA pools are likely formed by a transesterification process initiated either by direct recombination or by hydrolytic cleavage (of either B or P), followed by putative ligation of truncated RNA&gt;p sub-fragments. These mechanisms give rise to recombination product species such as bait-prey (B-P, forming Rec1) or prey-prey (P-P present in both Rec1 and Rec2). Bait-bait recombination (B-B) products are not observed, as the bait 5’OH is blocked by FAM modification to aid analysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43022.026</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Reactivity of unmodified random RNA pools.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

Furthermore, selected pools not only exhibited an overall increase in local duplex formation, but also generally more stable (predicted) minimal free energy structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, pure random-sequence RNA pools, devoid of any activation chemistry or conserved sequence regions (apart from an A<sub>10</sub> tag) display an innate capacity for intermolecular recombination, yielding subsets with altered oligomer length distribution (including longer RNA oligomers), enhanced sequence diversity and structural stability.</p><p>Finally, we sought to dissect critical chemical parameters required for an innate recombination potential. To this end, we expanded our investigation beyond RNA to compare and contrast the potential of pools of a range of RNA congeners (representing systematic variations of the canonical ribofuranose ring structure), with respect to intermolecular ligation or recombination. We first examined unmodified, semi-random sequence pools of DNA or prebiotically plausible ANA (arabino nucleic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Noronha et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roberts et al., 2018</xref>). In these chemistries, the canonical ribofuranose ring of RNA is replaced with either a 2’-deoxyribose (DNA) lacking the 2’ hydroxyl of RNA, or an arabinofuranose ring (ANA), in which the analogous 2’-hydroxyl group is in the axial (<italic>trans</italic>) position. Like RNA, both DNA and ANA are capable of forming functional catalytic motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silverman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>), including small self-cleaving DNA catalysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, both DNA and ANA pools contain sequences with potential function, and in the case of DNA should be able to perform autocatalytic DNA strand cleavage, as a first step of a recombination reaction. However, while we readily detected recombination in the semi-random-sequence RNA pools (as above), neither DNA nor ANA pools showed detectable recombination even after prolonged incubation (up to 6 months, −9 °C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and despite the 10–100-fold higher sensitivity of PCR (DNA) compared to RT-PCR (RNA and ANA) detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohuchi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Okello et al., 2010</xref>). Even inclusion of transition metal ions (Zn<sup>2+</sup>), which had been shown to strongly promote DNA self-cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu et al., 2013</xref>), did not result in recombination in DNA (or ANA) pools, while apparently inhibiting it in RNA pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43022.030</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Reactivity of unmodified semi-random sequence pools of RNA and related genetic polymers.</title><p>Binary combinations of semi-random sequence bait and prey pools of RNA, DNA, ANA, HNA and AtNA and their reactivity are visualised by RT PCR as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

Indeed, while HNA proved inert, AtNA (like RNA) proved to be sensitive to alkaline pH-induced hydrolysis, albeit with an apparent 6-fold slower strand scission rate than RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that (akin to RNA) the equivalent vicinal 2’-OH in AtNA can participate in intramolecular transesterification reactions presumably via an analogous cyclic phosphate (AtNA&gt;p) intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). At the same time, the observed lower hydrolytic reactivity suggests that formation of AtNA&gt;p cyclic phosphate may be energetically less favourable than in RNA. Next, we examined whether HNA and AtNA pools (devoid of extraneous activation chemistry) could participate in intermolecular recombination reactions. To this end, we compared the reactivity of semi-random sequence pools of HNA and AtNA to equivalent RNA pools, but observed unambiguous recombination only in the RNA pools (as seen previously) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). To expedite potentially weak tendencies for recombination, we exposed semi-random sequence pools of HNA and AtNA (as well as control RNA) pools briefly to alkaline pH (50 mM NaOH at 65 °C (RNA (3 min), HNA/AtNA (27 min), neutralized with 1 M Tris•HCl pH 7.4) in order to generate an increased amount of &gt;p products, before a prolonged incubation (−9 °C ice, 5 months). Using a novel engineered reverse transcriptase (RT TK<sup>2</sup>, see Materials and methods), which, unlike commercial enzymes, is able to reverse transcribe both RNA as well as both HNA and AtNA oligomers, we analysed ligation products by RT-PCR. While HNA pools again proved inert, we now observed clear intermolecular recombination in the AtNA pools, although to a notably lesser extent than equivalent RNA pools.</p><p>Deep sequencing of the recombination products from both RNA and AtNA pools revealed a similar size distribution indicative of recombination but, in the case of RNA, biased towards smaller products, presumably due to increased hydrolytic degradation induced by exposure to alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Furthermore, a clear ApN nucleotide signature was observed at the AtNA recombination junction, distinct from the CpN signature of RNA, presumably reflecting the different chemical requirements for AtNA recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The finding that only RNA (and to a lesser extent AtNA) pools are capable of intermolecular recombination, while DNA, ANA and HNA pools were inert, strongly suggests that a vicinal cis-diol configuration forms a critical chemical determinant of an innate intermolecular recombination potential with the propensity for recombination modulated by ring geometry.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recombination is a fundamental process in biology both central to genetic diversification and genome repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pesce et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Visser and Elena, 2007</xref>), as well as a protective mechanism against the progressive corruption of genetic information by drift (i.e. Muller’s ratchet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Muller, 1964</xref>)).

In the case of random RNA as well as semi-random RNA and AtNA oligomer pools, a subset of these non-covalent intermolecular assemblies do not remain inert (and non-covalent), but display a pervasive tendency to undergo spontaneous disproportionation reactions resulting in intermolecular recombination and ligation.</p><p>The discrepancy between the extent of ligation / recombination we observe (2–10 % of pool sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) to the predicted frequency of functional sequences of, for example, aptamers / ribozymesfrom repertoire selection / SELEX experiments (1 in 10<sup>10</sup>-10<sup>13</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson and Szostak, 1999</xref>)) should be viewed within the same context. Indeed, standard SELEX experiments are designed to iteratively deplete the interaction network's underlying pool reactivity and instead isolate the exceedingly rare unitary sequences capable of function. While such experiments have been ground-breaking in revealing the potential of RNA (as well as DNA and some XNAs) for complex catalytic or ligand-binding functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silverman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson and Szostak, 1999</xref>), our results show that a back-extrapolation from the hit frequency of SELEX experiments leads to a gross underestimation of global pool functionality, as only single sequences are considered and systems-level interactions and networks are ignored.</p><p>We were able to visualize the intermolecular recombination and / or ligation products both directly by gel shift in denaturing gel electrophoresis and by specific RT-PCR amplification. Both assays provide evidence for <italic>bona fide</italic> ligation and recombination products as PCR or sequencing artefacts can be ruled out on multiple grounds. For one, incubation at −80 °C, which freezes the eutectic phase in our buffer system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mutschler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mutschler and Holliger, 2014</xref>), never yields products, establishing that fragments do not recombine during workup. Furthermore, the appearance (or absence) of recombination products is clearly and reproducibly linked to chemical features of the original pool (e.g. free 5’OH (RNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), or cis diol (RNA, AtNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>)), which are erased in the RT step. Finally, in both the case of the &gt;p activated and unmodified random RNA sequence pools, we are able to observe the formation of ligation / recombination products directly by Urea-PAGE, which would dissociate even highly stable non-covalent complexes. Indeed, we note that our assays likely underestimate total pool reactivity (as well as the diversity of potential reaction products) as a range of more complex potential recombination modes, including intra- and intermolecular circular, lariat or branched products are only partially detected by our methods, or not at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Previous reports of non-enzymatic RNA recombination with defined substrates suggests that the majority of such reactions are likely to involve either a concerted mechanism of direct in-line attack on an internal phosphodiester linkage or, more frequently, a two step-mechanism of two consecutive transesterification reactions via an &gt;p intermediate generated by hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lutay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nechaev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Staroseletz et al., 2018</xref>). In both reaction trajectories, ligation /recombination is promoted by proximity through in trans intermolecular hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) as well as the concentration and entropic effects of eutectic ice phase formation. Whilst we observe formation of canonical 3’−5’ linkages with some RNA motifs (H4), we expect that the majority of RNA pool linkages likely conform to 2’−5’ regiochemistry as these linkages form preferentially in RNA duplex geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lutay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Orgel, 2004</xref>), although such information is lacking for AtNA. In RNA, sporadic 2’−5’ linkages have been found to be broadly compatible with folding and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engelhart et al., 2013</xref>) and can progressively be converted to the canonical 3’−5’ linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mariani and Sutherland, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The mechanistic basis for the distinctive sequence signature (CpN) in RNA is currently unclear, although CpA and UpA junctions have been shown to be generally more reactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaukinen et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, the bias may reflect the higher propensity for C&gt;p formation and/or reactivity, which may be more reactive due to the stronger electron withdrawal by the cytosine ring system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krishnamurthy, 2012</xref>) or hydrogen bond interactions between the C-2 oxygen of the pyrimidine and the 2'-hydroxyl of the ribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bibillo et al., 2000</xref>). Earlier reports suggest that reactivity of phosphodiester bonds in a gapped duplex can be context dependent being strongly modulated by the local sequence (stacking) and base-pairing (H-bonding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaukinen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oivanen et al., 1998</xref>), which may explain the different AtNA recombination signature (ApN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>Repertoire selection experiments had previously shown that random sequence pools of different genetic polymers (including RNA, DNA and some XNAs) all contain functional sequences, including highly active ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wachowius et al., 2017</xref>), DNAzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silverman, 2016</xref>) and to a lesser extent ANA-, HNA- and other XNAzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). Although rare, these functional sequences can be isolated by iterative rounds of selection and amplification. In contrast, in the experiments presented here (which do not involve enrichment), we observe striking differences in innate reactive potential of different chemistries, with only RNA (and to a lesser extent AtNA) pools undergoing ligation and recombination. In contrast, DNA, ANA and HNA pools remained inert in our experiments, even under forcing conditions such as alkaline pH or high concentrations of transition metal ions like Zn<sup>2+</sup>, which have been shown to promote self-cleavage in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu et al., 2013</xref>). While nucleophilicity and p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of the 5’-OH are likely to be comparable in RNA, DNA and the XNAs examined herein, classic studies using model nucleotide phosphodiester and -triester compounds suggest an at least 30-fold higher reactivity of RNA internucleotide diester linkages compared to DNA and ANA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lönnberg and Korhonen, 2005</xref>). This increased reactivity is thought to be due to the vicinal cis-diol configuration of RNA, with the 2´-OH stabilizing the negative charge developing on the phosphorane intermediate and /or the departing 3´-oxygen by both H-bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lönnberg and Korhonen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oivanen et al., 1998</xref>) and local electronic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aström et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with this mechanistic model, AtNA, an RNA congener, sharing an analogous vicinal cis-diol configuration (in a six-membered ring context), was found to be capable of intermolecular recombination, although AtNA reactivity appears to be significantly lower than RNA. The latter may be due to greater torsional strain required for in-line attack or formation of an analogous cyclic phosphate (AtNA&gt;p) intermediate (with an almost planar configuration) in the context of a six-membered ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruzik et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Although &gt;p is only weakly activated towards nucleophilic attack, in the context of high effective concentrations of a 5’OH nucleophile in a gapped duplex (or pre-organized internal loop motifs like H4, J4), intermolecular bond formation can be efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Usher and McHale, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lutay et al., 2006</xref>). Crucially, &gt;p groups form spontaneously as part of RNA (and presumably AtNA) hydrolytic degradation. While DNA pools have been found to comprise a number of small self-cleaving motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu et al., 2013</xref>), these yield 3’OH and 5’p termini, which require further activation for ligation. Thus a vicinal diol configuration not only accelerates the initial strand cleavage step of recombination, but also yields cleavage product termini (&gt;p and 5’OH) competent for re-ligation. Indeed, other vicinal cis-diol containing genetic polymers have previously been examined by solid-phase synthetic chemistry as part of systematic variation along the ribo- and lyxopyranosyl series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eschenmoser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wippo et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>), and ligative polymerization of 2’, 3’&gt;p activated pyranosyl tetranucleotides on a template has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bolli et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, a vicinal diol configuration appears to be a critical component of a spontaneous capacity for recombination, setting RNA apart from a range of other prebiotically plausible genetic polymers including TNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schöning et al., 2000</xref>), ANA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roberts et al., 2018</xref>) and PNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Böhler et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The pervasive spontaneous ligation and recombination activity displayed by oligomer pools described herein may seem counterintuitive, but such behaviour is both predicted and supported by theoretical arguments from statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. These suggest that under the right boundary conditions, recombination - with an concomitant increase in the diversity of length distribution of (RNA) polymer chains - is favoured by entropic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blokhuis and Lacoste, 2017</xref>). Remarkably, not only is the diversity in oligomer length distribution altered but recombined pools also display a shift towards an increased tendency for secondary structure formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This observation likely reflects both the tendency of longer oligomers to form more stable and more diverse secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Briones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stich et al., 2008</xref>) as well as some degree of intrapool selection for sequences capable of intermolecular hybridization and duplex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, recombination also scrambles parts of the pool sequence information, which could lead to an increase in informational complexity in redundant pools such as the random 20-mer RNA and semi-random 40-mer RNA and AtNA oligomer pools used in our experiments. To better understand this effect, we explored recombination outcomes by in silico simulations of a broad range of boundary conditions (including a range of hydrolytic cleavage (degradation) vs. ligation rates, pool redundancy and code complexity (2-letter vs. 4-letter code)). Using the Shannon population level entropy index D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Derr et al., 2012</xref>) as an established measure of informational complexity (see Material and methods), we find that recombination in simulated, redundant N<sub>10</sub> and N<sub>20</sub> pools disproportionates pool sequences into a distribution of both shorter (cleavage) and longer (ligation) strands and spontaneously increases D under a wide range of boundary conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, in silico recombination reveals critical pool and reaction parameters that enhance information gains, whereby increases in pool informational complexity (as measured by <italic>D</italic>) scale with pool redundancy, code complexity and oligomer length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Under the conditions used in our experiments, i.e. ca. 1000-fold pool redundancy, a 4-letter base alphabet and N<sub>20</sub> oligomer length, information gains occur under almost all boundary conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, spontaneous recombination in random oligomer pools under any but the most strongly degradative regimes expands both sequence size distribution and sequence diversity, and thereby progressively increases pool compositional (sequence length distribution), structural (secondary structure formation) and informational complexity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43022.038</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The change in information content in a random sequence pool as a consequence of recombination.</title><p>Informational content / complexity change is computed as the population level Shannon entropy (Diversity index: <italic>D</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Derr et al., 2012</xref>)), where <italic>N</italic> is the total number of unique sequences in the pool, and <italic>n<sub>i</sub></italic> is the proportion of individuals belonging to the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> unique sequence. <italic>D</italic> is zero if all molecules are identical and <italic>D</italic> is maximal when molecules are uniformly distributed through sequence space (top panel). <italic>D</italic> changes after recombination of a N<sub>20</sub> 4-letter code, random sequence pool of 100-fold redundancy (each sequence is present in 100 copies).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Innate potential of random genetic oligomer pools for recombination&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a guest Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another. As you will see from the individual reviews, there was a range of opinions regarding the importance and validity of the work. Overall, the work was seen as technically strong, but there were major concerns about the impact of the work. All three reviewers and the guest editor agreed that very substantial revisions would be necessary before the manuscript could be considered again for <italic>eLife</italic>. Most importantly, reviewer 2 raises the point that the manuscript is too focused on the audience of nucleic acid chemists; a re-submitted manuscript would have to demonstrate, supported by literature, that the study is of interest to a wider audience. Otherwise, reviewer 2 and the guest editor feel that the manuscript would be appropriate for more specialized journals such as Nucleic Acids Research or Angewandte Chemie.</p><p>At this point we cannot directly invite revision, but we do remain interested in the work. We would likely reconsider the work, if you can make a much more convincing case regarding the general interest and advance of your findings, plus fully address the following concerns (and address the rest of the reviewers' comments as much as possible).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer 1: major comments 1 and 4.</p><p>Reviewer 2, major comment 1: please provide clear arguments, supported by literature, why this study is of interest to a broader audience than nucleic acid chemists, by inserting a section into the introduction. The first paragraph of reviewer 3 (last sentence) could be used as starting point. Major comment 2: Based on this concern, please describe in additional sentences how the reactions monitored in the study could give rise to an overall increase in compositional complexity if both cleavage and ligation events are considered.</p><p>Reviewer 3: all major comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This study investigates the ability of random sequence pools of RNA, DNA, ANA, HNA, and AtNA to promote ligation and recombination reactions. The work is original, and explores important concepts related to the functional potential of polymers. However, from my perspective it could be significantly improved by considering the following issues.</p><p>1) You used gel purification and high-throughput sequencing to identify molecules from different types of random sequence pools that undergo ligation or recombination reactions after long incubations. My major criticism of this work is that you did not show that these sequences react at enhanced rates relative to the average polymer sequence. Each pool probably contains a small number of molecules with enhanced ligation or recombination rates and a large excess of sequences that react at background levels. After a single purification (analogous to a single round of selection), it is possible that these pools will still contain mostly inactive sequences. If this is the case, sequencing will not necessarily provide information about motifs that promote ligation/recombination (but see point two). The clearest way to address this point would be to experimentally measure the ligation/recombination rates of randomly chosen variants from at least one of the evolved pools. Are the ligation/recombination rates of these sequences higher than those of arbitrary sequences or the unevolved starting pool? Figure 2—figure supplement 4 shows that you can measure the rates of some of these sequences in a reasonable amount of time, but not whether they are enhanced relative to arbitrary sequences or the starting pool. The fact that the sequence compositions of the ligated/recombined pools are different from the starting pools is encouraging in this respect. On the other hand, because the results of many experiments in this study cannot be correctly interpreted without knowing why particular sequences reacted, additional characterization is needed. I would also consider putting at least some of these results in the main figures.</p><p>2) I am aware of several studies (such as Pitt and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2010 and Jiménez et al., 2013) in which high-throughput sequencing was used to characterize pools after in vitro selection experiments. In these studies, sequenced pools contained multiple copies of some variants, and a key component of the analysis was to show that copy number was correlated with catalytic or binding activity. I could imagine analyzing your experiments in a similar way. Furthermore, showing that some sequences appear multiple times in the high-throughput sequencing reads would provide additional evidence that they have enhanced ligations/recombination rates. I suspect that your evolved pools contained too many sequences to perform this type of analysis, but these issues should be at least briefly discussed.</p><p>3) It seems to me that a model of recombination in which a 5' hydroxyl group in one oligonucleotide attacks a phosphodiester bond in the other is simpler than the one proposed here (in which recombination requires both self-cleavage and ligation). I would recommend providing evidence from either experiments or the literature in support of your proposed mechanism.</p><p>4) RNA secondary structure can only be predicted to a limited extent. For this reason, I am not convinced that the ligation junctions of these sequences typically occur in the context of duplexes. Can you demonstrate this experimentally? Furthermore, I am not aware of reliable methods to predict RNA tertiary structure. For this reason (and because it is does not change any of the main conclusions of the paper) I would remove the statement in the Results section that J4 forms a purine-rich 4x4 internal loop with a triple-shared GA motif.</p><p>5) For me, one of the most exciting and interesting parts of the manuscript was your analysis of the reactivity of polymers other than RNA and DNA. However, the way in which the results were presented was not logical to me. I would recommend first comparing the ability of each of these polymers to promote ligation/recombination reactions under the same conditions, and then discuss new types of experiments (such as treating with base prior to incubation).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Mutschler et al., have investigated spontaneous cleavage and ligation reactions among a diverse population of RNA (and RNA analogue) molecules. These reactions are well known, and the ability of a complementary template to accelerate the rate of ligation was first described over 40 years ago. Although these reactions have previously been carried out with mixed populations, this is the first study, to my knowledge, to apply deep sequencing to assess sequence preferences, especially for ligation. Not surprisingly, the authors find that there are some sequence preferences, which reflect a combination of intrinsic chemical reactivity and the potential for templated interactions. The reasons for the former are obscure, whereas the latter are due to both canonical and non-canonical templating effects. It is not surprising that DNA, ANA (arabino nucleic acid), and HNA (hexitol nucleic acid), all of which lack a vicinal cis-hydroxyl, do not undergo these reactions, whereas AtNA (altritol nucleic acid), which contains a vicinal cis-hydroxyl, does.</p><p>This is a well-executed study that will be of interest to nucleic acid chemists, but will not have broader appeal, as would be required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The conclusions are generally well supported by the data. However, it is somewhat misleading to point to the &quot;increase in the compositional and structural complexity of recombined pools&quot; while ignoring the decrease in oligomer length that occurs due to the same reactions. If one considers only the ligated products, then those materials can be said to have increased complexity. But for the assembly of materials that involve both cleavage and ligation events (as in Figure 3), one must also consider the many shorter cleavage products that arise. It is not clear from this study how the reactions could achieve an overall increase in compositional complexity. Presumably this would require a fractionation process or means to shift the chemical equilibrium in favor of ligation. The present study would be more suitable for a specialized journal such as Nucleic Acids Research or Angewandte Chemie.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes and extensively analyzes the ability of random sequences to ligate and recombine. The testing was primarily performed with RNA sequences and then compared across multiple genetic polymers (DNA, HNA, ANA, AtNA). The authors show (for the most part) that recombination via trans-ligation of two termini and via sequence displacement is detectable either directly using denaturing PAGE or, in cases when constant regions were added to the distal termini, using (RT)PCR. The reactions were performed in the eutectic phase of water-ice and control reactions incubated at -80 °C showed no activity. Overall this is a comprehensively designed and analyzed work with far-reaching importance, particularly for the Origin of Life field, but also for synthetic and chemical biology.</p><p>The ligated junctions for RNA seem to favor a G on the downstream of the ligation site. The RNA ligation site is thus biased, though not completely, towards a C/G sequence, not just CN. The authors use the unligated pool as a control; however, sequencing of unligated prey sequences is strongly biased by the method of introducing sequencing primers on the 5′ end (which depends on cross-templating by the RT enzyme and the SMARTER oligo substrate), so the statistics of the ligated vs unligated nucleotide at the 3′ side of the junction are not reliable. I understand the authors are being careful with their interpretation of the data, but the biases of the trans-templating method are known and can therefore be incorporated into the analysis, at least at the level of discussion if not directly in the Results section.</p><p>Figure 4B is key for the conclusions of this manuscript, but the bands for HNA are practically invisible and for AtNA the -80 control is very poorly visible. When intensified, both HNA and AtNA show bands corresponding to longer products. Ditto for DNA and ANA lanes in Figure Figure 4—figure supplement 1, where little to nothing is visible in either the experiment or the control lanes. These gels should be presented intensified as in Figure 3A. Related to this point, why are the -80 °C controls in Figure 4 invisible in the first place?</p><p>What are the diversities of libraries used? The theoretical limit of a 20-mer is 4<sup>2</sup>≈10<sup>12</sup>. Are these libraries exhaustive with respect to the potential diversity limit? Are there known biases in composition for the non-biological genetic polymers? The authors do not mention the amounts of material used, just concentrations. Clearly, sequencing of the entire starting pool (or even recombined and directly isolated ones) is not practical, but for the PCR-amplified pools, the sequencing results may be exhaustive. For that, however, an estimate of the starting diversity and the total amplification of the recombined products would have to be presented. The manuscript would be enhanced if these numbers were included for all experiments and pools, particularly for the RT-PCR-amplified pools, where the HTS results may represent nearly all ligated sequences.</p><p>The free energy of activation of a &gt;p vs a triphosphate is known. Assuming similar activation energy for the ligation of a 5′-OH with &gt;p and a triphosphate, the expected kinetics for the background reaction can be estimated from the Rohatgi and Szostak, 1996 paper. An estimate of the background ligation rate and acceleration by the individual motifs should be presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43022.054</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study investigates the ability of random sequence pools of RNA, DNA, ANA, HNA, and AtNA to promote ligation and recombination reactions.

In a sense, what we are trying to determine is what the reviewer 1 refers to as the ‘background’. In this respect, our main findings are the following:</p><p>1) Contrary to expectations, the global functionality of the pools exceeds what would be expected by extrapolation from SELEX-type experiments by orders of magnitude (see Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5).</p><p>2) RNA pools in particular show an unprecedented innate and spontaneous propensity for recombination. Recombination increases the compositional, structural and informational complexity of RNA pools (as we demonstrate) and hence their adaptive potential (see Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 7).</p><p>3) Pools of other genetic polymers (specifically Altritol nucleic acids (AtNA)) not found in nature are also capable of recombination, establishing (1) that RNA is not unique in this regard and (2) revealing key chemical and structural parameters required for spontaneous recombination (see Figure 6).</p><p>We would argue that all three of these are significant findings with the potential to fundamentally change our perspective on early evolution and indeed on the functional potential of diverse oligomer pools in both biology and chemistry, and as such are of broad interest. However, we do accept that our arguments were not presented in sufficient breadth. In the revised manuscript, we have endeavoured to set out our findings both more clearly for the general reader and discuss them more fully within the context of previous work and the fundamental importance of the observed processes such as recombination in biology.</p><p>Please find below a more detailed examination of our main points:</p><p>I) in vitro selection experiments (SELEX etc.) have demonstrated repeatedly that diverse random sequence pools of RNA, DNA (as well as some unnatural XNA) oligomers comprise functional sequences including catalysts capable of RNA cleavage and ligation. We therefore may take it as a given that such functional sequences are present in those pools. However, various attempts at extrapolating the frequency of functional sequences all suggest that such functional sequences are extremely rare (10<sup>-10</sup>-10<sup>-13</sup>, see e.g. Bartel and Szostak, 1993; Wilson and Szostak, 1999 or Jiménez et al., 2013) depending on the study and functional criteria)). This is turn would suggest that such pools by themselves should be largely inert and that functional sequences would be impossible to discover in the absence of powerful selection methods involving i.e. efficient means for enrichment, replication and amplification. If true, this would clearly call into question one of the key conjectures about the origin of life, which posits a spontaneous emergence of function from random oligomer pools.</p><p>In the present work we set out to subject the above conjecture to a critical test based on the hypothesis that while individual functional sequences may be vanishingly rare, global pool functionality may be higher due to system-level interactions among pool sequences. Put simply, selection experiments identify individual sequences that are functional but discard simple interaction networks among pool sequences that may also be functional, e.g. as hetero-dimeric, -trimeric,. -oligomeric assemblies. Thereby, selection experiments likely underestimate the global phenotypic potential of the pools by an undue focus on individual sequences. Indeed, in some cases, as in our own selection experiments seeking to isolate improved RNA triplet polymerase ribozymes, the best adaptive solution turned out to be a heterodimer discovered fortuitously within our selection experiment designed to isolate the most active single sequences (Attwater et al., 2018).</p><p>II) Another argument in favour of considering the importance of intrapool interaction networks in potentiating global pool functional potential is their truly vast potential combinatorial diversity. For example, within the eicosamer pools examined herein, which encode a potential diversity of 10<sup>12</sup> unique sequences, there are 10<sup>12</sup> x 10<sup>12</sup> = 10<sup>24</sup> potential binary interactions (larger than Avogadro’s number!).</p><p>Indeed, the data described in our manuscript indicates that such pools are far from inert but display a pervasive tendency (of between 2-10% of pool sequences) for disproportionation reactions through transesterification chemistry resulting in ligation and recombination reactions among pool members.</p><p>III) As outlined above, our intent was never to “bypass” SELEX experiments but rather examine pools global functional potential. However, we accept that we may have given this impression inadvertently by our attempts to dissect the different RNA motifs contributing to pool functional potential in the case of RNA ligation via a 2’, 3’-cyclic phosphate intermediates. We now discuss these results more extensively and provide a more detailed breakdown of the different classes of reactive RNA molecules contributing to this result including an expanded Figure 2 and a new Figure 3 in the main text as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My major criticism of this work is that you did not show that these sequences react at enhanced rates relative to the average polymer sequence.</p></disp-quote><p>With regards to this specific point of reviewer 1, we would like to argue that we in fact did just that.</p><p>Our argument runs as follows:</p><p>1) The “average polymer sequence” is likely to be unreactive on the timescale examined (hence our proportions of 10% (Figure 1), respectively 2% (Figure 4) of reactivity (depending on pre-activation)). Hence, all ligated or recombined random or semi-random sequence pools show enhanced reaction rates compared to the “average” sequence.</p><p>2) Among these subsets of reactive sequences, we find that a majority of intermolecular ligation and recombination reactions proceed via a gapped helical intermediate (as had been described previously for templated &gt;p ligation, see e.g. by Lutay et al., 2006, Biogeosciences (2006), 3: 243 or Usher et al., 1976, Science, 192: 53). In these, intermolecular hybridization provides an internal template and ligation as well as recombination transesterification chemistry via a &gt;p intermediate is accelerated by proximity due to mutual sequence complementarity at the ligation junction.</p><p>To better illustrate point and the activity of these, we have now included data on four randomly picked sequence pairs as suggested by the reviewer. Of these, one pair (pair 1) is predicted to form a helical junction at the ligation site, whereas the other three sequence pairs (pairs 2-4) are predicted to form complexes but without a gapped duplex formation at the ligation junction. As expected, only pair 1 shows ligation under our experimental conditions (presumably ligation reaction promoted by proximity), while no ligation is observed for the other three pairs. This data is now shown in the new Figure 2—supplement 2.</p><p>3) This naturally leads to the question if all reactions would proceed via a gapped duplex intermediate or if among reactive sequence pairs we could identify other, distinct RNA motifs that would also accelerate intermolecular ligation. Indeed, bioinformatics analysis of a subset of reactive pool sequences allowed us to identify putative secondary structure elements promoting ligation, two examples of which (J4, H4) we analysed in more detail. As we show, J4 clearly accelerates cleavage / ligation beyond the rate provided by simple sequence complementarity and could therefore be referred to as nascent catalytic motif. H4 accelerates the reaction compared to the vast bulk of the pool sequences. However, while it is somewhat slower than a comparable helical intermediate, it promotes formation of a canonical 3’-5’ linkage, which is disfavoured in the helical arrangement (Lutay et al., 2006).</p><p>We would therefore argue that we have not only shown that some sequences react with an enhanced rate compared to the average sequence/background rate but that among these, there are again specific motifs, which react with even higher rates and/or distinct regiochemistry. More motifs are very likely to exist but their frequency in the subpool of sequenced RNAs was too low to allow their unambiguous identification.</p><p>In order to better illustrate the above arguments as suggested by the reviewer and outline this hierarchical analysis of RNA motifs involved in ligation, we have expanded this section of the manuscript including an expanded Figure 2 and a new Figure 3 in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The clearest way to address this point would be to experimentally measure the ligation/recombination rates of randomly chosen variants from at least one of the evolved pools. Are the ligation/recombination rates of these sequences higher than those of arbitrary sequences or the unevolved starting pool? Figure 2</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, there are potentially distinct levels of “background” reactivity. To better illustrate this point, we now specifically include analysis of two typical gapped duplexes as well as the two defined non-duplex RNA motifs identified by bioinformatic analysis. This data is now shown in the new Figure 2—supplement 2 and 6 and main text Figures 2 and 3.</p><p>With regards to reconstruction of oligomer reactivities, we note that we can only recapitulate bimolecular reactivity. Any sequences ligated by a 3rd partner oligonucleotide (e.g. acting as a splint) or via more complicated interaction networks or trajectories cannot be reconstructed as the participating oligonucleotides do not form part of the product. Thus, our analysis likely underestimates the extent and diversity of reaction trajectories and reactive motifs as our method is unable to sample in “trans-ligases”. Furthermore, our analysis also excludes non-canonical intra- or intermolecular ligation trajectories that yield circles, lariats or branched products. The lack of reactivity among some randomly picked sequence pairs in Figure 2—supplement 2 should be viewed in this context. Nevertheless, we show that salient features of reactivity as well as individual motifs can be extracted by careful analysis of the data.</p><p>Thus, our data unequivocally shows that random RNA sequence pools comprise a diverse range of functionalities both at the level of rare individual sequences (as was known before) and much more prominently at the systems-level / global pool level (which is a key result from the present work).</p><p> <italic>2) I am aware of several studies (such as Pitt and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2010 and Jiménez et al., 2013) in which high-throughput sequencing was used to characterize pools after</italic> in vitro <italic>selection experiments.

I could imagine analyzing your experiments in a similar way. Furthermore, showing that some sequences appear multiple times in the high-throughput sequencing reads would provide additional evidence that they have enhanced ligations/recombination rates. I suspect that your evolved pools contained too many sequences to perform this type of analysis, but these issues should be at least briefly discussed.</italic> </p><p>We are of course aware of the work of Pitt and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2010 and Jiménez et al., 2013 but these studies differ from our work in that they sought to correlate the activity-sequence relationships in either a repertoire of mutants of a known small ribozyme motifs or in a population of selected anti-GTP aptamers. Thus, both of these studies sought to map fitness peaks centred around discrete sequences either identified previously or known to occur at high frequency upon selection in the pool examined.</p><p>In contrast, our work is aimed at a better understanding not of individual fitness peaks for a given activity but rather the global pool reactivity and potential for function (the fitness landscape in total) as it arises from systems-level interaction networks within the pools.</p><p>While we have also mapped reactivity to individual motifs, we did so as a means to better understand the underlying pool reactivity, not to map out fitness peaks.</p><p>With regard to sequencing coverage, reviewer 1 is indeed correct that, although there is ca. 1000-fold redundancy of 20-mer sequences in our 10<sup>15</sup> sequence pools, the maximum available sequencing depth (10<sup>9</sup>) is insufficient to capture or map sequence enrichment without multiple rounds of selection. Taking this into account, we would therefore argue that the level of reactivity and identification of individual functional sequence pairs in our experiments is striking and unprecedented given the rarity of such sequences observed in previous selection experiments.</p><p>The latter is due to the fact that standard SELEX experiments are designed, to iteratively deplete and disrupt the interaction networks underlying global pool reactivity and instead isolate the exceedingly rate unitary sequences capable of function. While such experiments have been ground-breaking in revealing the potential of RNA (as well as DNA and various XNA) sequences for complex catalytic or ligand-binding functions, our results show that back-extrapolation of their frequency leads to a gross underestimation of pool functionality as only single sequences are considered.</p><p>Without wishing to overstretch the analogy, our results in many ways parallel similar findings in related fields such as chemistry, where increasingly systems-chemistry approaches are found to yield pathways to products believed to be impossible to obtain by conventional linear synthetic approaches.</p><p>In conclusion, in this manuscript we map for the first the time the innate, global functional potential of oligomer pools ab initio. Rather than seeking to isolate the “winners” in an evolutionary experiment (“race”) through cycles of selection, enrichment and amplification, we seek an overview of the potential of all “starters”, i.e. all pool sequences. We have now expanded the discussion of these points to set our work (and its motivation and conclusions) much clearer apart from “conventional” SELEX-type experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It seems to me that a model of recombination in which a 5' hydroxyl group in one oligonucleotide attacks a phosphodiester bond in the other is simpler than the one proposed here (in which recombination requires both self-cleavage and ligation). I would recommend providing evidence from either experiments or the literature in support of your proposed mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We welcome this insightful comment. Previous studies examining RNA ligation via 2’, 3’-cyclic phosphate activation (&gt;p) on an instructing template (e.g. Chetverin et al., 1997; Nechaev et al., 2009) suggested a 2-step mechanism (whereby a first step generates RNA oligomers terminating in &gt;p by hydrolysis). Our own experiments (detailed in Figure 1) of RNA ligation in &gt;p activated random eicosamer pools provides a baseline for reactivity via this chemistry in a random pool setting.</p><p>Our observation that recombination reactions in the same pools lacking &gt;p proceeds on a ca. 10-fold slower timescale suggests that either a direct attack mechanism is kinetically slower or that recombination predominantly proceeds via a 2-step mechanism involving (1) (a slow step of) RNA hydrolysis generating &gt;p and (2) ligation via &gt;p. This has been our rationale for favouring this mechanistic trajectory over a direct in-line attack.</p><p>Nevertheless, reviewer 1 is of course correct that both mechanisms are likely to occur and indeed may be operating concurrently. In the light of this, we have amended the text to make this clear and now discuss both reaction trajectories in the context of ours as well as published findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) RNA secondary structure can only be predicted to a limited extent. For this reason, I am not convinced that the ligation junctions of these sequences typically occur in the context of duplexes. Can you demonstrate this experimentally? Furthermore, I am not aware of reliable methods to predict RNA tertiary structure. For this reason (and because it is does not change any of the main conclusions of the paper) I would remove the statement on page 5 that J4 forms a purine-rich 4x4 internal loop with a triple-shared GA motif.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important comment, but our arguments do not rely on accurate RNA tertiary (or even secondary) structure prediction.</p><p>We very much agree with the referee that exact topologies of RNA secondary structures (that ultimately determine the tertiary structure) are poorly predicted by most software packages (Zhao et al., (2018)). Physics-based free energy minimization approach of RNA secondary structure prediction has been evaluated in detail and found to have a base-pairing consistency of 70% between native and predicted secondary structures for moderately long RNAs (~70 - 500 nts, see e.g. Zhao et al., 2018; Doshi et al., 2004 or Mathews et al., 1999).</p><p>However, for our raw analyses only the accuracy of the base-pairing matters (where 70% accuracy is sufficient for a global picture) while “average” tertiary structures are not (and cannot) be analysed using this method. Furthermore, our finding that &gt;p ligation is favoured at helical junctions is not only in full agreement with the literature (Lutay et al., 2006; Usher et al.,1976; Bolli et al. 1997), but we have provide experimental verification in individual examples in this manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 4, Figure 2—figure supplement 6) suggesting that at the level of the comparatively short RNA oligomers examined herein, predictions are largely trustworthy.</p><p>Finally, we note that our suggestion that the J4 motif folds into a 4x4-loop with a triple-sheared GA motif derives not from bioinformatic predictions, but from the fact that J4-like sequence motifs are found in several natural RNAs, for some of which high-resolution structural information is available (23S rRNA of <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> (PDB ID: 2ZJR) / <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> adenosylcobalamin riboswitch (PDB ID: 4GMA)). These structures provide a rationale as to why and how J4 may promote ligation via a 2’, 5’ linkage (as shown in the new Figure 3). Thus, our statement is backed up by multiple lines of structural evidence and we have therefore not altered it in the revised manuscript. Nevertheless, we now provide more context and discussion on the structural folds of J4 and the other RNA motifs to present our arguments more clearly including main text Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Figure 2—figure supplement, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Figure 2—figure supplement 4, Figure 2—figure supplement 5 and – Figure 2—figure supplement 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For me, one of the most exciting and interesting parts of the manuscript was your analysis of the reactivity of polymers other than RNA and DNA.

I would recommend first comparing the ability of each of these polymers to promote ligation/recombination reactions under the same conditions, and then discuss new types of experiments (such as treating with base prior to incubation).</p></disp-quote><p>We welcome this comment and agree that the differential reactivity of chemically closely related but distinct genetic polymers are a key finding.</p><p>As suggested by reviewer 1, we had originally compared all genetic polymers under the same conditions (e.g. neutral pH, 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>), where we only observed reactivity with RNA pools (Figure 6A). We subsequently introduced modified conditions in order to expedite reactivity in the inert pools e.g. addition of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the case of DNA and ANA pools, which had previously been shown to be an essential cofactor in autocatalytic cleavage by small DNA motifs (Gu et al., 2013). However, we found that even in the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, we observed no reactivity in the DNA (or ANA) pools. These negative results are now provided in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><p>As we had already observed degradation of AtNA (but not HNA) in response to alkaline pH (although 6-fold slower rate for AtNA than RNA, Figure 6—figure supplement 2), we tested RNA, HNA and AtNA pool reactivity following a pulse of NaOH (now Figure 6B). Indeed, this revealed that AtNA, like RNA- is able to recombine, although reactivity was noticeably weaker (ca. 10-20-fold). In contrast, we did not observe recombination of AtNA (and HNA) in absence of NaOH. We had previously not included these negative results but now the data is presented in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 5. A direct comparison of the observed recombination yields between RNA and AtNA is also complicated by the fact that observed yields depend on the efficacy of the respective reverse transcriptase, the sensitivity of which undoubtedly better for RNA. We have now expanded the discussion of the above results in the revised manuscript to better outline the rationale for our different experimental strategies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Mutschler et al., have investigated spontaneous cleavage and ligation reactions among a diverse population of RNA (and RNA analogue) molecules. These reactions are well known, and the ability of a complementary template to accelerate the rate of ligation was first described over 40 years ago. Although these reactions have previously been carried out with mixed populations, this is the first study, to my knowledge, to apply deep sequencing to assess sequence preferences, especially for ligation. Not surprisingly, the authors find that there are some sequence preferences, which reflect a combination of intrinsic chemical reactivity and the potential for templated interactions. The reasons for the former are obscure, whereas the latter are due to both canonical and non-canonical templating effects. It is not surprising that DNA, ANA (arabino nucleic acid), and HNA (hexitol nucleic acid), all of which lack a vicinal cis-hydroxyl, do not undergo these reactions, whereas AtNA (altritol nucleic acid), which contains a vicinal cis-hydroxyl, does.</p><p>1) This is a well-executed study that will be of interest to nucleic acid chemists, but will not have broader appeal, as would be required for publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to respectfully disagree with this assertion of reviewer 2. Recombination, the exchange of information between different genetic polymer strands, is of fundamental importance in biology (see e.g. Visser and Elena, 2007 Pesce et al., 2016) both for genetic diversification in the germline (meiosis) and soma (e.g. gene conversion in avian antibody generation) as well as genome maintenance and repair. It is furthermore of critical importance to guard against the progressive corruption of genetic information by the deleterious effects of genetic drift (i.e. Muller’s ratchet), enabling elimination of neutral or weakly deleterious mutations by backcrossing (Muller, (1964)).</p><p>RNA recombination is widespread among RNA viruses (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011). While generally attributed to template switching etc. recombination by inferred purely chemical processes has been observed in various viruses such as Poliovirus (Gmyl et al., 1999), rubella virus (Adams et al., 2003) or Qbeta bacteriophage (Chetverin et al., 1997), pointing to the possibility of a wider importance of non-enzymatic RNA recombination in present day biology with implications for non-viral transcriptome complexity and fluidity.</p><p>We would therefore argue that our finding that RNA – due to its specific chemical constitution- has an innate capacity and tendency to recombine even in the absence of recombinase enzyme or extraneous activating chemistry has important implications both for origins research as well as indeed the analysis of all diverse RNA oligomer assemblies.</p><p>In the context of primordial RNA pools, this innate capacity has fundamental implications as it provides for a progressive disproportionation of RNA sequences, which does increase pool complexity by the de novo generation of diversity of RNA oligomer length and sequence content and secondary structure driven by intrapool RNA base pairing networks (see also response to point 2 below).</p><p>The potential for spontaneous recombination is likely innate to any diverse assembly of RNA sequences (including those found in biology) and should be considered when analysing such assemblies and their dynamics including studies of the transcriptome and viral populations and quasi-species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusions are generally well supported by the data. However, it is somewhat misleading to point to the &quot;increase in the compositional and structural complexity of recombined pools&quot; while ignoring the decrease in oligomer length that occurs due to the same reactions. If one considers only the ligated products, then those materials can be said to have increased complexity. But for the assembly of materials that involve both cleavage and ligation events (as in Figure 3), one must also consider the many shorter cleavage products that arise. It is not clear from this study how the reactions could achieve an overall increase in compositional complexity.</p></disp-quote><p>We welcome this insightful comment by reviewer 2 and agree that our claims of increased compositional and informational diversity/complexity need to be supported by a more comprehensive analysis of the impact of recombination on pool complexity.</p><p>1) We would like to point out that while notions of spontaneous generation of increased informational and compositional complexity by RNA pools may seem counterintuitive, they are in fact both predicted and supported by theoretical arguments from statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, which suggest that under the right boundary conditions an increase in length and informational complexity of (RNA) polymer chains is favoured by entropic factors (see e.g. Blokhuis and Lacoste, 2017). We now outline these arguments as part of an expanded Discussion section in the revised manuscript.</p><p>2) We now provide in silico simulations and analysis of the population level Shannon entropy (an established measure of pool sequence diversity i.e. informational complexity (Derr et al., 2012)) of pre- and post-recombination pools. These calculations consider total pool informational content, under conditions of random oligomer cleavage and ligation and show that such recombination indeed increases the pool informational diversity under almost any boundary condition, provided that recombination is applied to a pool with significant sequence redundancy. Indeed, this applies to our experimental system: the 10<sup>15</sup>- member eicosamer pools analysed herein are redundant with respect to encoded information, covering the total combinatorial diversity (4<sup>20</sup> =1.09 x 10<sup>12</sup>) ca. 1000-fold (i.e. there are approx. 900 copies of each eicosamer sequence within the pool).</p><p>Our finding that recombination diversifying parts of a redundant sequence pool generates new information is also intuitively understandable, as recombination of part of a redundant pool generates new sequences (both in length distribution and information content), while maintaining (i.e. not destroying) the previous sequence and information content (as redundancy persists but is reduced). In other words, sequence / compositional / informational complexity is increased at the expense of redundancy.</p><p>Other outcomes of our calculations may be less obvious but no less interesting. These include the finding that the informational gains through recombination scale both with sequence code complexity (4 letter code &gt; 2 letter code) and oligomer length as Recombination of longer oligomer pools generates more diversity. The simulations illustrate the trade-offs between enhanced cleavage rates, which generate more short fragments (loss of information) but also generate more ligatable fragments (and thus enable information gains) and ligation rates, which fix informational gains.</p><p>In addition to detailed calculations, we now also provide an extended discussion of these points in our revised manuscript including a new Figure 7 and accompanying figure supplements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not clear from this study how the reactions could achieve an overall increase in compositional complexity. Presumably this would require a fractionation process or means to shift the chemical equilibrium in favor of ligation. The present study would be more suitable for a specialized journal such as Nucleic Acids Research or Angewandte Chemie.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 points out an important aspect of our study. While the above (see point 2) simply examines the generation of diversity as a theoretical concept of informational complexity in the context of early evolution, the impact of recombination on sequence pools under fractionation and / or adaptive pressure is more significant and more relevant to real world scenarios.</p><p>Indeed, there are a number of physicochemical processes (including thermophoretic cycles in porous substrates / adsorption to (mineral) surfaces etc.), which would favour length-extended oligomers over pool members or short cleavage products (see for example Kreysing et al., 2015). However, the simplest fractionation process that favours more diverse and length extended oligomer sequences is selection for (higher order) function.</p><p>Previous studies had established the importance of pool diversity as well as increased oligomer length not only for the discovery of functional motifs but, more importantly, for the discovery of the most active or complex functional motifs (reviewed in Pobanza and Luptáka, 2016), even in the presence of trade-off from an increased tendency for ambiguous folding of longer RNA oligomers (Sabeti et al., 1997). Furthermore, the power of continued recombination of sequence pools under selective pressure to accelerate adaptive walks and evolutionary optimization is clearly demonstrated both by examples from biology (gene conversion, RNA virus recombination (see above)) and protein engineering (see e.g. Stemmer, 1994, reviewed in Arnold, 2009).</p><p>Therefore, we would argue that this all leads to an inescapable conclusion, which is that the innate potential of RNA oligomer pools for recombination provides a route unique to RNA (and to some degree other genetic polymers, see below) to bootstrap themselves towards higher informational, compositional and structural diversity and hence evolutionary potential.</p><p>Given the challenges of prebiotic chemistry to generate oligomer pools of substantial length (the here investigated 20-mers are very much at the upper end of RNA oligomer lengths reported containing all four nucleotides) the innate potential of such pools to extend themselves in length and diversity by recombination is highly significant. In light of theoretical arguments, which suggest a sharp drop in the potential for folding into stable secondary (and by inference tertiary) structures needed for function below a certain oligomer length limit (Briones et al., 2009), recombination might have been of fundamental importance for the emergence of the first functional RNAs.</p><p>Furthermore, in the presence of a fractionation process selecting for increased oligomer length (e.g. thermophoresis (see above)) or a given function (such as binding to a substrate and / or catalysis), RNA pools capable of recombination would yield a continuous supply of extended, more structured and more functional motifs and thereby outcompeting putative rival genetic polymers (such as DNA) unable to recombine. Such process would be potentiated by an ongoing process of recombination during selection (or cyclical iteration of either) as recombination has previously been shown to be a powerful means to accelerate adaptive walks (see above).</p><p>Finally, having established the potentially profound importance of recombination for the emergence of function from oligomer pools, our work begins to define key chemical parameters required for the display of an innate potential for recombination. Among these, a vicinal diol geometry on the ring appears to be crucial enabling formation of a cyclic phosphate upon hydrolysis, which supports subsequent ligation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The ligated junctions for RNA seem to favor a G on the downstream of the ligation site. The RNA ligation site is thus biased, though not completely, towards a C/G sequence, not just CN. The authors use the unligated pool as a control; however, sequencing of unligated prey sequences is strongly biased by the method of introducing sequencing primers on the 5′ end (which depends on cross-templating by the RT enzyme and the SMARTER oligo substrate), so the statistics of the ligated vs unligated nucleotide at the 3′ side of the junction are not reliable. I understand the authors are being careful with their interpretation of the data, but the biases of the trans-templating method are known and can therefore be incorporated into the analysis, at least at the level of discussion if not directly in the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We welcome this perceptive comment.</p><p>The bias of trans-templating is of course real and similar issues exist in other library preparation methods for diverse nucleic acid pools. However, we have several lines of evidence that the CpN dinucleotide signature is a direct result of the transesterification reaction. These are detailed below:</p><p>1) We prepared ligated and recombined RNA pool fractions using a range of different methods (incuding adaptor ligation, direct RT-PCR, SMARTER RT-PCR) but observed the CpN bias regardless. Even the N20 x N20A10 products produced by polyT-primed SMARTer RT-PCR (Figure 5), which we do not compare to preligation material show a raw C-bias at the NpN recombination site in products ≤ 50 nts (Figure 5C). Here, the random nucleotide at the position of the recombination event was never exposed to terminal adapter ligation or template switching.</p><p>2) The reference pools of unligated N<sub>20</sub>&gt;p and C1/C3-bait&gt;p semi-random RNA (controls for experiments described in Figure 1 respectively Figure 2) were prepared by dephosphorylation of the &gt;p followed by adapter ligation of a preadenylated oligonucleotide and not by SMARTer RT-PCR. While this protocol is also prone to sequence biases at the 3’-end (and close to it), due to sequence preferences of the ligase, the reference pools used in Figure 1-supplement 1 are unbiased further upstream of the adapter-ligated 3’-end, where the comparison happens and where we observe the same CpN signature in all recombination reactions. Furthermore, even without taking the pre-ligation material as reference, (and as already stated in 1), a raw C-bias is directly visible in all recombination products shown in the colour plot in Figure 4D, Figure 5C and the supplementary movie, where the C-bias follows the recombination “seam” of the differently sized products independently from the library preparation method.</p><p>Thus, the overall ligation junction sequence bias / motif CpN was apparent throughout all RNA recombination experiments with some (minor) variations as detailed in Figure 1, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1. While referee 3 is correct at noting the bias for a downstream G (CpG) in the N<sub>20</sub>&gt;p experiments, this bias is not observed in all cases (e.g. the semi-random RNAs shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1D) and we have therefore not elaborated on it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4B is key for the conclusions of this manuscript, but the bands for HNA are practically invisible and for AtNA the -80 control is very poorly visible. When intensified, both HNA and AtNA show bands corresponding to longer products. Ditto for DNA and ANA lanes in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, where little to nothing is visible in either the experiment or the control lanes. These gels should be presented intensified as in Figure 3A. Related to this point, why are the -80 °C controls in Figure 4 invisible in the first place?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that bands for HNA (both -9 <sup>o</sup>C &amp; -80 <sup>o</sup>C), AtNA (-80 °C), DNA (both -9 <sup>o</sup>C &amp; -80 <sup>o</sup>C) and ANA (both -9 °C &amp; -80 °C) are practically invisible. Indeed, these reactions are what we consider negative (i.e. ligation / recombination did not take place, and hence no unambiguous PCR amplicons (larger than primer-dimers) were detected (in contrast with clear amplification products of RNA (-9 <sup>o</sup>C) and AtNA (-9 <sup>o</sup>C)).</p><p>As reviewer 3 correctly observes, it is also possible to make out faint bands in some of the other reactions including negative control PCRs, e.g. at -80 °C. However, none of these weak bands relate to (weak) recombination / ligation activity in e.g. the DNA, ANA or HNA pools for a number of reasons:</p><p>The appearance of weak amplification products is a common occurrence in all PCR reactions, where (spurious) bands will eventually appear after sufficient PCR cycles, as even minute amounts of mispriming or cross-contamination are exponentially amplified. The problem is greatly increased in PCR amplifications from random (or semi-random) sequence pools due to the increased likelihood of mispriming events on the random sequence segments. Furthermore, the weak bands pointed out by the referee occur to the same extent in both the -9 °C samples (incubated for prolonged periods) and -80 °C negative controls (which were immediately deep frozen at -80<sup>o</sup>C) and can therefore not be the consequence of a reaction occurring during the incubation period.</p><p>The typical low-molecular weight band seen in the -80 °C negative control reactions (likely due to mispriming of the RT-primer on the random sequence part of the bait fragment) is reduced or absent in Figure 6B (previously Figure 4B), due a) to the pre-incubation NaOH treatment, which leads to fragmentation of semi-randomers (in the case of RNA and AtNA) and b) a lower sensitivity of the RT enzyme for HNA and AtNA. Both a) and b) cause less opportunity for spurious background mispriming of the RT primer in the experiment shown in Figure 6B. At the same time, the intensity of the <italic>bona fide</italic> recombination products in both RNA (and AtNA) (when incubated at -9 <sup>o</sup>C) is enhanced by NaOH (as would be expected).</p><p>We therefore stand by our previous conclusion that only RNA (and to a lesser extent AtNA) pools have an innate potential for ligation and recombination while this capacity is either absent or negligible in DNA, ANA and HNA pools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What are the diversities of libraries used? The theoretical limit of a 20-mer is 4<sup>2</sup>≈10<sup>12</sup>. Are these libraries exhaustive with respect to the potential diversity limit? Are there known biases in composition for the non-biological genetic polymers? The authors do not mention the amounts of material used, just concentrations. Clearly, sequencing of the entire starting pool (or even recombined and directly isolated ones) is not practical, but for the PCR-amplified pools, the sequencing results may be exhaustive. For that, however, an estimate of the starting diversity and the total amplification of the recombined products would have to be presented. The manuscript would be enhanced if these numbers were included for all experiments and pools, particularly for the RT-PCR-amplified pools, where the HTS results may represent nearly all ligated sequences.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 3 for this insightful comment and apologize for having omitted a fuller discussion of the diversities explored, which we now provide in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We chose eicosamer pools because, within the repertoire sizes explored within our experiments (10<sup>14</sup>-10<sup>15</sup> molecules), there is considerable redundancy within these pools (diversity 4<sup>20</sup> = 1.09 x 10<sup>12</sup>). Although we are unable to completely capture this within the current limits of NGS sequencing (ca. 10<sup>9</sup> reads), we can infer whole pool diversity from the degree of randomness of the partially sequenced pool.</p><p>Even within reacted pools where we observe 10% (Figure 1, 10<sup>14</sup> sequences) resp. 2% or 0.2% (Figure 5, 10<sup>13</sup> or 10<sup>12</sup>) of pool sequences ligated / recombined, NGS cannot provide full coverage. We are therefore, in all cases, observing a representative sample. Within that sample we can exploit similarities and redundancy such as is present in structural classes of RNA motifs. We leverage this in the bioinformatic RNA motif classification analysis we present (Figure 2, Figure 3 and associated supplementary figures) and show that it enables us to identify reactive motifs.</p><p>Another issue worthy of consideration is the fact that while we obtain RNA and DNA pools directly by solid-phase synthesis), XNA pools (ANA, HNA, AtNA) need to be obtained by enzymatic synthesis using bespoke engineered polymerases, as solid phase synthesis is not available. While enzymatic synthesis is efficient on random DNA templates, inevitable biases are introduced, which reduce the diversity of XNA pools compared to DNA and RNA pools. Nevertheless, this is unlikely to significantly impact pool reactivity, given the considerable redundancy within eicosamer pools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The free energy of activation of a &gt;p vs a triphosphate is known.
