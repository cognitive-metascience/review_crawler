Aughey et al. tested this technique on various cells of the developing brain and gut, and were able to see differences in the openness of DNA that corresponded to the action of genes that are important in each cell type.

Changes to gene expression are accompanied by concomitant changes to chromatin structure and composition. Therefore chromatin states vary widely across developmental stages and cell types. Functional regions of a genome, including promoters and enhancers, can be identified by their relative lack of nucleosomes. These regions of ‘open chromatin’ can be assayed by their accessibility to extrinsic factors. Consequently, chromatin accessibility profiling techniques are commonly used to investigate chromatin states (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsompana and Buck, 2014</xref>]). Chromatin is highly accessible in pluripotent cell types such as embryonic stem (ES) cells, but is compacted following differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meshorer and Misteli, 2006</xref>). It has been suggested that this open chromatin represents a permissive state to which multiple programmes of gene regulation may be rapidly applied upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaspar-Maia et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The nature of chromatin accessibility across different developmental stages in vivo is less well understood. Imaging studies have been used to demonstrate gross changes to chromatin structure, for example changes to the distribution of heterochromatin have been observed in post-mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Francastel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Gros et al., 2016</xref>). Molecular studies investigating chromatin states in vivo during development have tended to utilise heterogeneous tissues due to the fact that profiling the epigenome of individual cell types frequently requires physical isolation of cells or nuclei, which can be laborious and prone to human error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McClure and Southall, 2015</xref>). Therefore, there is a lack of information regarding cell-type-specific changes to chromatin states in <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Whilst recently developed methods such as ATAC-seq have become popular and address many of the limitations inherent to earlier techniques such as DNAse-seq (i.e. requires fewer cells and increased assay speed), these techniques still require the physical separation of cells and isolation of genomic DNA before chromatin accessibility is assayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It has been suggested that ectopic expression of untethered DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) results in specific methylation of open chromatin regions whilst nucleosome bound DNA is protected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wines et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bulanenkova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boivin and Dura, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh and Klar, 1992</xref>). However, the efficacy of using Dam methylation for chromatin accessibility profiling on a genomic scale is not clear. Furthermore, expression of Dam in a cell-type-specific manner, at levels low enough to avoid toxicity and oversaturated signal, has not been possible until now.</p><p>Transgenic expression of fusions of Dam to DNA-binding proteins is a well-established method used to assess transcription factor occupancy (DNA adenine methyltransferase identification - DamID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Steensel and Henikoff, 2000</xref>). Recently, it was demonstrated that DamID could be adapted to profile DNA-protein interactions in a cell-type-specific manner by utilising ribosome re-initiation to attenuate transgene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aughey and Southall, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Southall et al., 2013</xref>). This technique is referred to as Targeted DamID (TaDa). Here, we take advantage of TaDa to express untethered Dam in specific cell types to produce chromatin accessibility profiles in vivo, without the requirement for cell separation. We show that <bold>C</bold>hromatin <bold>A</bold>ccessibility profiling using <bold>Ta</bold>rgeted <bold>Da</bold>mID (CATaDa) yields comparable results to both FAIRE and ATAC-seq methods, indicating that it is a reliable and reproducible method for investigating chromatin states. By assaying multiple cell types within a tissue, we show that chromatin accessibility is dynamic throughout the development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system (CNS) and midgut lineages. These data have also enabled us to identify enriched motifs from regulatory elements that dynamically change their accessibility during differentiation, as well as to identify functional cell-type-specific enhancers. Finally, we show that compared to their differentiated progeny, somatic stem cell Dam-methylation signals are more widely distributed across the genome, indicating a greater level of global chromatin accessibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CATaDa produces chromatin accessibility profiles comparable to that of ATAC and FAIRE-seq in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye discs</title><p>We reasoned that low-level expression of transgenic <italic>E. coli</italic> Dam, using tissue-specific GAL4 drivers in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, would specifically methylate regions of accessible chromatin exclusively in a cell-type of interest. Detection of these methylated sequences could yield chromatin accessibility profiles for defined cell populations in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To determine if CATaDa produces an accurate reflection of chromatin accessibility, we compared data acquired using this approach with commonly used alternative techniques. A recent study generated ATAC and FAIRE-seq data from <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal eye discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davie et al., 2015</xref>).

We found that increasing the stringency of our peak calling notably decreased the number of peaks identified that coincided with ATAC peaks, but had relatively little impact on unique CATaDa peak discovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Given these data, we suggest that the majority of these peaks are not false positives, but are genuinely accessible sites that are not detected by ATAC-seq. Further examination of these unique peaks indicates that they are significantly smaller than the shared peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We also observe that for peaks identified in either ATAC or FAIRE data that are not present in CATaDa, there is a relative lack of GATC motifs, which suggests that there may be cases in which false negatives are observed due to the limitations of the resolution achievable by Dam methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). To further investigate the differences between CATaDa and ATAC or FAIRE-seq, we investigated the detection of peaks at different genomic features. We found that whilst CATaDa identified fewer peaks than FAIRE in regions proximal to gene promoters (when compared with ATAC), CATaDa was notably better at identification of non-promoter adjacent accessible sites in ATAC data compared to FAIRE-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

For example, intronic open chromatin peaks can be seen at the <italic>bruchpilot</italic> (<italic>brp</italic>) locus, in both third instar (L3) and adult neurons, whilst these peaks are reduced or absent in the progenitor cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This corresponds with the expression of <italic>brp,</italic> which is specifically transcribed in neurons and has an important role in synapse function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, the adjacent gene to <italic>brp, Wnt2,</italic> displays peaks which are most apparent in the NSC and intermediate cell types. Wnt signalling is known to be important for the control of stem cell populations, therefore, these results are also expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ring et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Similar patterns are observed at a number of other loci. At the <italic>asense</italic> (<italic>ase</italic>) locus, (a NSC-specific transcription factor), chromatin is highly accessible at the promoter and upstream intergenic region in NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This signal is considerably reduced in fully differentiated neurons in which <italic>ase</italic> is not expressed. Interestingly, open chromatin is still detectable in these regions in the GMCs/newly born neurons. This pattern is also observed with other NSC expressed factors such as <italic>deadpan</italic> (<italic>dpn</italic>), <italic>CyclinE</italic> (<italic>CycE</italic>) and <italic>prospero</italic> (<italic>pros</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, GMC/newly born neuron profiles frequently show intermediate signal at these loci, indicating that functional elements required for regulation of NSC gene expression are not immediately rendered inaccessible following differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>It is to be expected that many of the functional elements marked by accessible chromatin that are important for regulating gene expression in a given neural cell type would show dynamic accessibility across the lineage (i.e. stem cell-specific enhancers would not be expected to be open in mature neurons). We examined regions of differential chromatin accessibility to determine the extent to which chromatin accessibility is changed during development of the nervous system. Hierarchical clustering of regions of chromatin with differential accessibility between cell types reveals two major clusters in which chromatin is either open in stem cells but inaccessible in neurons, or vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Intriguingly, there are other clusters where maximal chromatin accessibility is observed in either GMCs/early neurons or larval neurons. Therefore, it is not as simple as NSC accessible regions progressively closing during differentiation and neuronal regions gradually opening. There are a large number of loci that are inaccessible in NSCs, then open in the intermediate GMCs/newly born neurons stage before being rendered inaccessible again in terminally differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, a cluster enriched in larval neurons demonstrates that the chromatin accessibility landscape of larval neurons, although similar, is distinct from adult neurons.</p><p>Regions of open chromatin are thought to identify functional regulatory elements such as enhancers. Therefore, it is to be expected that these regions will be enriched for motifs belonging to transcription factors involved in neurogenesis. Identification of enriched motifs in sequences that were accessible in NSCs showed that expected transcription factor binding sites were highly enriched. For example, the E-box motif – CAGCNG – which is bound by the NSC proneural factor <italic>ase</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Southall and Brand, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jarman et al., 1993</xref>). Regions in which open chromatin was specifically enriched in mature neurons yielded a sequence motif corresponding to the transcription factor, Ci. In all groups, sequence motifs were also identified for which no known binding partner could be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Analysis of further subdivision of these clusters revealed yet more novel motifs for the individual cell types examined, as well as indicating that the ase-like motif is specifically enriched for sequences which are accessible solely in the NSCs, and not their progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis of genes at which enriched chromatin accessibility was observed yielded expected biological process terms for each of the cell types examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). For example, terms such as ‘neuroblast fate determination’ and ‘chromosome segregation’ were more highly enriched in stem cells relative to neurons, whilst ‘regulation of behaviour’ and ‘synaptic vesicle docking during exocytosis’ were enriched for differentiated neurons but not NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Chromatin accessibility in adult midgut cell types</title><p>Having observed chromatin accessibility changes in the cells of the developing CNS, we asked whether similar patterns would be observed in adult somatic stem cell lineages.

For example, <italic>escargot</italic> (<italic>esg</italic>) a transcription factor required for ISC self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korzelius et al., 2014</xref>), displays multiple peaks of accessible chromatin at the gene body and surrounding region in ISCs and EBs, whilst little signal is observed in the ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast the <italic>nubbin</italic> locus (encoding EC marker – Pdm1), displays peaks predominantly in the EC data, with relatively closed chromatin in the progenitor cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As observed in the CNS, hierarchical clustering revealed two major groups in which accessible chromatin was enriched in either in the stem cells (ISCs) or differentiated cell (ECs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Smaller clusters were again evident in which accessible chromatin was up or downregulated exclusively in the intermediate EBs. However, this was much less pronounced than the changes observed in GMCs/early neurons of the developing CNS. This indicates that, similar to the CNS lineages, the majority of chromatin accessibility changes involved in specifying the fully differentiated cells do not occur until after EB maturation. As with the cells of the CNS, we were able to identify motifs specifically enriched in each of these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>ISCs and NSCs fulfil similar roles in their respective organs in the production of highly specialised functional cells. However, whilst NSCs exist for a short amount of time during fly development to produce relatively long-lived neurons that persist in the adult CNS for the animal’s lifetime, the ISCs act post-developmentally to constantly replenish ECs in the adult gut. By comparing the chromatin accessibility of these two cell types, it is apparent that there are similarities in their chromatin states. At loci involved in growth or cell division, we see similar accessibility profiles across differentiation between the two tissue types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the similarities that we observed for individual loci between CNS and midgut lineages, we queried whether it was possible to observe trends between the cells in the two lineages on a global scale. Principal component analysis reveals two distinct clusters in which &gt;80% of the variance is explained in the first two principal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These clusters represent the two distinct tissue types, (CNS and midgut) rather than immature and differentiated cells. By examining the overall correlation between all cell types we observed a number of interesting features. Firstly, as expected all cell types correlated most closely with either their direct progeny or progenitor cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Therefore by clustering the data we were able to recapitulate the familial relationship between the cell types of the two lineages. The greatest similarities were observed between the intermediate progenitors and their cognate stem cells (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94/0.98 for CNS and midgut respectively). Interestingly, the greatest correlation outside of a lineage was between the two stem cell types (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76), whilst differentiated cells exhibited only weak correlation (ISCs vs NSC, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.51). This indicates that somatic stem cell types may utilise a broadly similar chromatin landscape for the maintenance of multipotency, whilst lineage-specific variation is relatively small.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Enhancer prediction from Dam accessibility data</title><p>Enhancer activity is closely linked to gene expression, therefore, many tissue-specific enhancers are required to orchestrate correct spatial and temporal transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pennacchio et al., 2013</xref>). However, identification of functional enhancers can be challenging. Chromatin accessibility data have previously been used to identify novel enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawford et al., 2006</xref>). We reasoned that it would be possible to identify genomic regions corresponding to cell-type- specific enhancers by comparing dynamically accessible regions between cell types. In support of this, we observed that the sequence covered by the <italic>71C09-GAL4</italic> line used in this study to profile GMCs/newly born neurons, displayed a higher peak specifically at this region than in either the stem cell or differentiated neuron data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, a clear peak can still be observed in the NSC data, without concomitant reporter expression. Therefore, an enrichment of accessible chromatin does not necessarily correspond to an active enhancer in a given cell type. This is consistent with previous observations that DNase hypersensitive regions are often not active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thurman et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We selected accessible regions with large differences between at least two cell types in the lineage, which satisfied various criteria for us to designate them as putative enhancers (see Materials and methods). We then identified available reporter lines from the Vienna tiles (VT)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kvon et al., 2014</xref>) and FlyLight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>) collections of GAL4 reporter lines that contained sequences encompassing our predicted enhancers upstream of a GAL4 reporter, and verified their expression in the tissues of interest. We identified enhancer-GAL4 lines in which reporter expression matched our predictions for enhancer activity. In the CNS Vienna line VT017417 and FlyLight line GMR56E07 both showed expression in the early part of the lineage in the CNS, with GFP reporter expression detectable predominantly in NSCs and GMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). This is consistent with accessible chromatin readings from our CATaDa data for these cell types in which progenitor cells displayed prominent peaks, whereas differentiated neurons did not. Similarly, we were able to detect functional cell-type-specific enhancers in the midgut. The Vienna line, VT004241, showed reporter expression predominantly in <italic>Delta</italic> positive ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Therefore, it is possible to use CATaDa data to identify novel cell-type-specific enhancers in multiple tissues. Overall 17 of 30 lines (57%) tested showed GFP expression in tissues and cell types that closely matched our predictions based on CATaDa data. This is in line with the rate of enhancer prediction by previous methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kvon et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32341.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Identification of cell-type-specific enhancers from Dam accessibility data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Intronic putative enhancer region VT017417 within <italic>slit</italic> locus reveals expression of GFP reporter gene predominantly in GMCs (white arrow) and newly born neurons, as well as some NSCs (Dpn positive, yellow arrow).

Whilst there are multiple lines of evidence showing that pluripotent cells have high levels of open chromatin, little data exist to support this idea in somatic multipotent stem cells and their progeny. We reasoned that by examining the distribution of normalised mapped sequencing reads (for each GATC fragment) we would be able to determine the nature of open chromatin in a given cell type.</p><p>Initial examination of read distributions indicated that differentiated neurons had fewer GATC fragments with lower read counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, having a limited number of replicates prevented a thorough statistical analysis of this relationship. To increase the significance of our analysis of read distributions, we decided to incorporate further neuronal and NSC datasets into our analysis, which were available to us as control data from existing DamID studies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>] and unpublished data). Including our previously described neuronal data, we examined the distribution of twelve adult and larval neuronal Dam accessibility datasets (derived from individual post-mitotic neuronal subtypes, cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic) and compared to data derived from NSCs.</p><p>From these distributions it is apparent that majority of GATC fragments in the genome have very few corresponding mapped reads in all samples, whilst fragments having over ~10 reads per million (rpm) were relatively infrequent. In other words, most of the genome is inaccessible or accessible at very low levels, whilst hyper-accessible regions are comparatively rare in all cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The greatest difference between the distributions of neurons and NSCs was apparent at very low read numbers. We observed that there was a significantly greater proportion of GATC fragments with low read counts but without being completely inaccessible (~1–3 rpm), in the NSC data compared to neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This abundance of genomic regions in the stem cells with low-level chromatin accessibility indicates that open chromatin is more broadly distributed than in NSCs than neurons. We find that this trend is also apparent in the intermediate progenitor cell types, having intermediate amounts of GATC fragments mapping to low read counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Conversely, we observed a trend towards greater number of GATC fragments to which zero reads were mapped as differentiation progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data demonstrate that differentiated cells are more likely to have regions of chromatin that are completely inaccessible to Dam, indicating a globally lower amount of accessible chromatin in neurons.

Whilst these strategies have been proven to produce meaningful biological data, they suffer from being technically challenging, particularly with regards to cell isolation. We have demonstrated that CATaDa yields chromatin accessibility profiles for defined cell types in vivo without the need for cell isolation, fixation or the extraction of naked chromatin. In addition to its ease of use, CATaDa also has the advantage that the marking of accessible DNA occurs in vivo. Due to this, there are no artefacts associated with chemical fixation or washing of the chromatin prior to the assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baranello et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, widely used tissue dissociation protocols have recently been shown to result in substantial gene expression artefacts, a risk that is also circumvented by labelling the DNA in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van den Brink et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, as Dam is expressed in vivo over several hours, the profiles produced will reflect dynamic changes to chromatin structure over the entire time period during which Dam is expressed.</p><p>CATaDa is limited by its resolution, which is restricted by the frequency of GATC sites in the genome (median spacing of ~200 bp in <italic>Drosophila</italic>). However, this can be increased by using a modified Dam in conjunction with immunoprecipitation (Dam-IP)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiao and Moore, 2011</xref>). Due to the dependence of Dam for methylation of GATC sequences, biases may be observed at loci which are depleted for GATC. It is worth noting that extensive sequence biases have also been reported for DNAse and ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Madrigal, 2015</xref>). Although single cell protocols have recently been developed for chromatin accessibility techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>), for routine experiments it is more usual to require a relatively large number of cells. For example, for FAIRE-seq it is recommended to have a minimum of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsompana and Buck, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Simon et al., 2013</xref>), whilst DNase-seq typically requires 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsompana and Buck, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Song and Crawford, 2010</xref>). In contrast, DamID experiments can be performed with as few as 1000 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tosti, 2017</xref>), therefore CATaDa is likely to also be effective with low cell numbers, making it competitive with ATAC-seq (500–50,000 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, single cell DamID has also recently been demonstrated, indicating that the minimum number of cells required for CATaDa is one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kind et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although we see instances of false negatives in our peak identification with CATaDa due to lack of available GATC sites for methylation, we also observe a number of peaks unique to CATaDa. Whilst it is possible that these signals are the result of an experimental artefact, it seems likely that they are genuine accessible loci. This could be accounted for by the fact that Dam methylase is a relatively small protein compared to Tn5 transposase (utilised in ATAC-seq – 55 and 32 KDa respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Naumann and Reznikoff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boye et al., 1992</xref>]), Therefore, Dam may be able to methylate sites which are inaccessible to Tn5. Alternatively, Dam may be able to methylate some nucleosome bound DNA in which the GATC site is exposed to the nucleoplasm, which may be insufficient for transposition. Whilst the presence of some potential false positives and negatives in the data may be a problem for some applications, overall, CATaDa produces similar overall results to ATAC and FAIRE-seq. As there is already a significant amount of disagreement between ATAC and FAIRE-seq, it is impossible to say whether a unique peak called by any method is a true peak or not, and as these techniques work via different principles, it is likely that these differences reflect biases unique to each approach.</p><p>Due to the technical differences between CATaDa and currently favoured alternatives (e.g. ATAC-seq), it is clear that the choice of which of these techniques is most appropriate is dependent on the application in question. The limited resolution of CATaDa means that it is not well suited for identifying precise limits of enhancer regions or nucleosome positions when compared to ATAC-seq. However, we have demonstrated that CATaDa resolution is sufficient to investigate broad differences in chromatin accessibility between samples, to identify enriched sequence motifs, and even to identify individual cell-type-specific enhancers. Therefore, the technique is suited to answering questions regarding the biology of cell-types of interest. The requirement for expression of Dam may represent difficulties for non-genetically-tractable model systems, or complicate experimental design if a mutant background is desired, (although it should be noted that in the latter case, a genetically encoded cell-type-specific marker may have to be included anyway to facilitate cell-separation for ATAC-seq or other approaches – therefore a complicated genetic background may be unavoidable). On the other hand, the advantages of being able to assay individual cell types residing within a complex tissue, are clear. If the driver used is specific enough, this may even be achieved with minimal or no dissection.</p><p>Targeted DamID is rapidly being embraced by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community with, at present, over 135 laboratories having requested the reagents and a number of papers already published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Southall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dinges et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marshall and Brand, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheetham and Brand, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spéder and Brand, 2018</xref>). Progress is also being made in adapting it for use in vertebrate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tosti, 2017</xref>). Whenever the binding of a protein of interest (POI) is investigated with this technique, Dam-only data (representing chromatin accessibility) for the cell type being assayed is also generated, as it is the control for which the Dam-POI is normalised. Therefore, researchers performing DamID experiments can now take advantage of this data, getting a ‘2-for-1 deal’ whenever they use TaDa to profile the binding of a POI. Furthermore, much of these data are already available from published studies that could be readily analysed to provide novel biological insights.</p><p>The sequence of events which lead to repression of open chromatin in the transition between stem cells and their progeny is not well defined. Through identification of functional elements of the genome at various stages in this process, we can begin to understand how the dynamic chromatin landscape impacts the regulation and maintenance of differentiated cell states. Interestingly, we observe that chromatin accessibility in intermediate cell types is broadly more similar to their stem cell precursors than their differentiated progeny in CNS and midgut lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C,F</xref>). This indicates that many stem-cell-specific regulatory regions remain accessible in intermediate cell types and are not fully repressed until terminal differentiation. This seems particularly surprising in the case of the EBs in the midgut considering that these cells do not undergo further mitotic divisions and are committed to a particular cell fate before their genesis by Notch signalling in the ISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, in the intermediate cells of the larval CNS (GMCs and immature neurons), a relatively high proportion of cells profiled are neurons, which express markers thought to be associated with fully differentiated cells, suggesting that these regulatory regions may be open prior to terminal fate specification.</p><p>The reason for these regions of chromatin remaining accessible in stem cell progeny is unclear, however there are several plausible explanations. Firstly, regions that are bound by transcription factors that activate transcription may be replaced by transcriptional repressors. Such repressive factors are known to have detectable open chromatin ‘footprints’, similarly to activating factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dinges et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, the same factors that bind in the stem cells may recruit new binding partners that alter their activity to initiate repression rather than activation of gene expression. This explanation would require that further modifications occur to the chromatin following repressor activity as open chromatin regions are lost in fully differentiated cells, suggesting that repressors may no longer be bound. Retention of open chromatin regions in intermediate cell types may also reflect increased plasticity, indicating that cell fate has not yet been fully determined and that lineage reversion or dedifferentiation is possible given the introduction of the correct combination of factors. This idea is supported by the fact that immature post-mitotic neurons have been experimentally induced to dedifferentiate by interventions that are ineffective in fully differentiated adult cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Southall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marshall and Brand, 2017</xref>). It has been suggested that in some physiological contexts differentiated cells may revert to replenish stem cell pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kai and Spradling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheetham and Brand, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2015b</xref>). This idea may help to explain retention of plasticity in these cell types.</p><p>It is widely asserted that terminally differentiated cells have limited accessible chromatin whilst their progenitors maintain a broadly open chromatin landscape. However, there are few studies that investigate this phenomenon in vivo. Furthermore, the chromatin state in lineage committed intermediate progenitor cell types has been little studied. With CATaDa we have acquired evidence to indicate that NSCs in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS appear to have more broadly open chromatin landscapes than their fully differentiated progeny. These differences are predominantly in the range of 1 to 3 rpm, which reflects chromatin with very low accessibility. Furthermore, the intermediate or immature progenitors, in both the CNS and midgut, retain a relatively open chromatin state, similar to that of their stem cell precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D,F</xref>). Together, these data support the model of stem cells containing more chromatin that has the potential to be accessed, whereas in differentiated cells, this flexibility is reduced and more regions are rendered completely inaccessible. In pluripotent stem cells, the more highly accessible chromatin landscape is thought to promote rapid initiation of multiple gene expression programmes. The fact that this is also a feature of somatic stem cells suggests that these cells may retain an unexpected level of plasticity even after their terminal cell fate has been specified.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility profiles can be obtained through tightly controlled expression of Dam methylase. These data can be used to predict cell-type-specific enhancers, as well as gaining insights into the global regulation of chromatin. Of particular interest are the dynamic changes in accessibility as cells progress towards terminal differentiation (e.g. the unique open regions observed in GMCs/early neurons) and the delayed compaction of stem cell gene associated chromatin. Also, analysis of the genome-wide distribution of chromatin accessibility supports a model of gradual compaction of large regions of low accessibility chromatin during differentiation. Overall, our results from profiling developing cell types illuminate the dynamic nature of chromatin accessibility in differentiation, and hint at organising principles which may apply to all somatic stem-cell lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p><italic>tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>; UAS-LT3-NDam</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Southall et al., 2013</xref>) was used to allow cell-specific expression of <italic>Dam</italic>.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CATaDa reveals global remodelling of chromatin accessibility during stem cell differentiation in vivo&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gabriel E. Zentner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. From the reviews, and discussion between the reviews, there was a consensus that the paper has greatest value in the category of &quot;Tools and Resources&quot;, which is a specific type of short-format <italic>eLife</italic> paper. Thus I'd like to propose that we publish your paper, after revisions as discussed here and in the reviews, as a &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; article. Please consider that publishing in this category will in no way diminish the import of your work. On the contrary, since CATaDa is a unique and generally applicable tool, we expect it to be highly appreciated by our readership and widely cited. As to revisions, one thing all the reviewers agreed upon is the paper should include a more thorough, genome-wide comparison of the CATaDa, ATAC, and FAIRE methods for chromatin profiling, and discussion of the pros and cons of CATaDa in relative terms. This is important as ATAC and FAIRE are already widely used. A number of other suggested revisions can be found in the reviews, below. We hope you will consider publishing this interesting work as a Tools and Resources report.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The technique detailed in the manuscript is an interesting alternative to currently used methods for chromatin analysis such as ATAC- and FAIRE-seq. In particular the possibility to forego the requirement to isolate the cell type of interest is very attractive, as it would speed up the process, thus limiting the time required for tissue manipulation prior to chromatin extraction. However, we feel that the following points could be improved:</p><p>• A more complete, genome-wide comparison between CATaDa and ATACseq and FAIREseq is necessary to make this a useful into to this new method.</p><p>• As different driver lines are used, it would be beneficial to test the expression levels of the Dam in the various cell types here discussed.</p><p>• The technique is stated to be quite reproducible and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> is introduced to support this. However, it is not explained what samples were plotted and also whether this correlation has been similarly observed for all samples and replicates or the samples plotted are simply the two showing the best correlation observed. Also, a similar plot for midgut cells would be required.</p><p>• In the third paragraph of the subsection “CATaDa profiling shows dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility during differentiation of the nervous system”, it is shown that &quot;GMC/ newly born neuron profiles frequently show intermediate signal&quot; at several loci where gene expression is activated/inactivated during development. In how many of the loci where such behavior is experimentally known to occur can this be observed? Can similar patterns be identified with ATAC- and FAIRE-seq just as well?</p><p>• In the fifth paragraph of the subsection “CATaDa profiling shows dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility during differentiation of the nervous system”, is discussed the ability to identify sequence motifs in regions of the NSC genome classified as open. However, only one example of identified motif (i.e. E-box) is reported. What other known motifs have been identified? Also, in regards of the motifs for which no known transcription factor could be identified, how likely are they to be true binding motifs rather than random sequences?</p><p>• In regards to the Gene Ontology analysis described in the last paragraph of the subsection “CATaDa profiling shows dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility during differentiation of the nervous system”, it would be good if a supplementary table could be added, reporting the top categories and their relative significance of enrichment, rather than just list a few terms that were expected.</p><p>• The comparison described in the last paragraph of the subsection “Chromatin accessibility in adult midgut cell types”, between brain and midgut cells feels superfluous. Although it's good that brain and midgut cells cluster in two different groups, it is fairly obvious given the very different function of the two organs. This paragraph could be rewritten by giving more space to the direct comparison of NSC and ISC, highlighting similarities in the chromatin in the vicinity of genes (e.g.) related to growth and proliferation.</p><p>• Subsection “Enhancer prediction from Dam Accessibility data”, last paragraph, it would be helpful to know how many reporter lines were tested and how many matched the prediction of enhancer activity. Also, this would be a good opportunity for further comparison with ATAC- and FAIRE-seq.</p><p>• In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, what cell type are the GFP+ Dl- cells?</p><p>• Subsection “Distribution of sequencing reads reveals changes in global chromatin accessibility during lineage development”, second paragraph, it is stated that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> was analyzed via &quot;visual inspection&quot;. Some form of statistical test would go a long way to improve the reported observation.</p><p>• When comparing GATC fragments as described in the &quot;Materials and methods&quot; section (&quot;Motif identification&quot; and &quot;Cell type specific enhancer prediction&quot; sections), it is not stated whether the difference in RPM values were selected via statistical tests or nor. In the latter case, it would be best to use the replicates in a statistical test to evaluate &quot;real&quot; differences between cell types.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Various chromatin accessibility methods have been used to map potential regulatory elements, beginning with DNase I hypersensitive sites to more recent FARE and ATAC-seq methods. These methods can be useful when combined with other strategies that more directly report on the function of regulatory elements. In this study, the authors develop a method (CATaDa) to map open chromatin regions based on tissue-specific expression of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Dam methylase in <italic>Drosophila</italic> followed by mapping of GATC methylation sites. The main advantage of the method over previous approaches is that it requires fewer cells and does not require isolation of cells of interest. Using this method the authors profile chromatin accessibility of specific cell types in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuronal and midgut lineages and find changes in chromatin accessibility at different developmental stages.</p><p>The method the authors have developed clearly has some advantages over ATAC-seq, probably the most popular current method for assays of genome-wide chromatin accessibility. However, unlike ATAC-seq, this method requires the generation of transgenic animals that express Dam in specific cell types. This may limit its general use but the authors report great interest from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community (based on requests for reagents). As acknowledged by the authors, the resolution of the method is limited by the occurrence of GATC sites (1/~250 bp). My main concern is that the profiling the authors report provides limited functional insight into the roles of specific enhancers or other regulatory elements in regulation of cell type-specific gene expression. The significance of the global changes in chromatin accessibility described by the authors also remains unclear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Chromatin accessibility is a hallmark of active regulatory regions and is dynamic during development. While many chromatin profiling approaches have been implemented in cultured cells, mapping chromatin accessibility in tissues has been more difficult due to the need to physically dissociate target cells from the organism of interest. Here, the authors present CATaDa, a variation on their earlier TaDa technique for tissue-specific in vivo profiling of protein-DNA interactions. CATaDa makes use of untethered Dam's propensity for methylating open regions of chromatin as a means to assay chromatin accessibility. The authors test CATaDa in neural and midgut stem cells from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, finding that chromatin accessibility changes during differentiation and is ultimately reduced in terminally differentiated cells. CATaDa also facilitated the detection of cell type-specific enhancer elements. I think the paper is a nice demonstration that Dam works as a reagent for tissue-specific profiling of chromatin accessibility in vivo (the stepwise changes in GO terms enriched in NSCs to neurons are particularly nice). The fact that CATaDa does not require cell isolation prior to chromatin profiling as FAIRE or ATAC-seq does makes it a strong choice for this purpose. I think the method will be useful, though I would like to see more extensive comparison to FAIRE and ATAC-seq.</p><p>My read of the manuscript is that CATaDa was a hammer in search of a nail, which turned out to be stem cell differentiation. My feeling is that the biological aspects of the story are case studies for the method (though it is of course good to have confirmation that chromatin accessibility generally decreases during stem cell differentiation in vivo) rather than a story in their own right. I am therefore inclined to think that the paper would be better suited to being a Tools and Resources article, as both the method and the data generated would be useful for the community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32341.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The technique detailed in the manuscript is an interesting alternative to currently used methods for chromatin analysis such as ATAC- and FAIRE-seq.

Furthermore, we have no data to suggest that the rate of Dam translation relates to transgene expression in a linear manner. Therefore, even if we were able to compare the expression levels of the GAL4 drivers between individual cell types in the tissues in question, this would not necessarily be informative in regards to the levels of Dam protein present in these cell types. If high expression of GAL4 drivers were causing Dam to be expressed at a level that is too high, this would be apparent as we would not see the dynamic range of methylation signal observed in all cell types, as Dam methylation would be saturating.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The technique is stated to be quite reproducible and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> is introduced to support this.

Also, in regards of the motifs for which no known transcription factor could be identified, how likely are they to be true binding motifs rather than random sequences?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a new supplementary figure ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) showing the top motifs identified for each group. The e-values reported in the new figure reflect the chance of any given motif occurring randomly. Given that many of these motifs occur at a rate much higher than is expected by chance, it is reasonable to assume that they are functional in the genome, and are therefore likely to be recognised by extrinsic factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In regards to the Gene Ontology analysis described in the last paragraph of the subsection “CATaDa profiling shows dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility during differentiation of the nervous system”, it would be good if a supplementary table could be added, reporting the top categories and their relative significance of enrichment, rather than just list a few terms that were expected.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a supplementary table (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>) with these data as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The comparison described in the last paragraph of the subsection “Chromatin accessibility in adult midgut cell types”, between brain and midgut cells feels superfluous. Although it's good that brain and midgut cells cluster in two different groups, it is fairly obvious given the very different function of the two organs. This paragraph could be rewritten by giving more space to the direct comparison of NSC and ISC, highlighting similarities in the chromatin in the vicinity of genes (e.g.) related to growth and proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased parts of this paragraph as suggested, and added a new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) highlighting the similarity in the vicinity of loci involved in growth and proliferation as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Subsection “Enhancer prediction from Dam Accessibility data”, last paragraph, it would be helpful to know how many reporter lines were tested and how many matched the prediction of enhancer activity. Also, this would be a good opportunity for further comparison with ATAC- and FAIRE-seq.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the manuscript to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, what cell type are the GFP+ Dl- cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the size and morphology of these cells they are probably enteroblasts (EBs). This is supported by the fact that they seem to appear in proximity to the ISCs. The figure legend has been updated to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Subsection “Distribution of sequencing reads reveals changes in global chromatin accessibility during lineage development”, second paragraph, it is stated that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> was analyzed via &quot;visual inspection&quot;. Some form of statistical test would go a long way to improve the reported observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the way this sentence was written in our previous submission may have been misleading. We initially observed this trend with a limited number of datasets, which we included as a supplementary figure, however we were unable to provide a meaningful statistical comparison until we added more replicates to the analysis as explained in the subsequent paragraph. The statistical in question that supports our observation is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>.</p><p>We have re-written this part of the manuscript for improved clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• When comparing GATC fragments as described in the &quot;Materials and methods&quot; section (&quot;Motif identification&quot; and &quot;Cell type specific enhancer prediction&quot; sections), it is not stated whether the difference in RPM values were selected via statistical tests or nor. In the latter case, it would be best to use the replicates in a statistical test to evaluate &quot;real&quot; differences between cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>~97% of the fragments with &gt; 20 RPM difference lie within statistically significant (FDR &lt; 1%) different regions. The other ~3% are GATC fragments that show &gt;20 rpm difference in isolation, therefore are not identified by our peak calling program and do not have an FDR assigned. We have clarified this point in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The method the authors have developed clearly has some advantages over ATAC-seq, probably the most popular current method for assays of genome-wide chromatin accessibility. However, unlike ATAC-seq, this method requires the generation of transgenic animals that express Dam in specific cell types. This may limit its general use but the authors report great interest from the Drosophila community (based on requests for reagents). As acknowledged by the authors, the resolution of the method is limited by the occurrence of GATC sites (1/~250 bp). My main concern is that the profiling the authors report provides limited functional insight into the roles of specific enhancers or other regulatory elements in regulation of cell type-specific gene expression. The significance of the global changes in chromatin accessibility described by the authors also remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have demonstrated that cell specific chromatin accessibility profiling with CATaDa allows the identification of cell specific enhancers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), despite the method having a lower resolution compared to other methods. We have also shown that enriched motifs can be identified in regions of the genome that are specifically accessible in individual cell types (see (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>)). Further functional insight into individual enhancers would require cloning, dissection and/or mutation, which would also be required if using other accessibility profiling methods.</p><p>Regarding the significance of the global changes in chromatin accessibility, we have included some further discussion in our revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
