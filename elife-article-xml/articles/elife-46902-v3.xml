mitotic spindle. The efficacy of chromosome interaction with the spindle can be influenced by how widely chromosomes are scattered in space. Here, we quantify chromosome-scattering volume (CSV) and find that it is reduced soon after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) in human cells. The CSV reduction occurs primarily independently of microtubules and is therefore not an outcome of interactions between chromosomes and the spindle. We find that, prior to NEBD, an acto-myosin network is assembled in a LINC complex-dependent manner on the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear envelope. This acto-myosin network remains on nuclear envelope remnants soon after NEBD, and its myosin-II-mediated contraction reduces CSV and facilitates timely chromosome congression and correct segregation. Thus, we find a novel mechanism that positions chromosomes in early mitosis to ensure efficient and correct chromosome–spindle interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromosomes</kwd><kwd>mitotic spindle</kwd><kwd>acto-myosin</kwd><kwd>nuclear envelope</kwd><kwd>LINC complex</kwd><kwd>human cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>096535/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Tomoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097945/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Tomoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>208401/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Tomoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C28206/A114499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochegger</surname><given-names>Helfrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K015869/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Tomoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live-cell imaging shows that the contractile acto-myosin network on the nuclear envelope remnant positions chromosomes in early mitosis to ensure efficient and correct interactions between chromosomes and the mitotic spindle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mitotic spindle is composed of microtubules (MTs) and plays central roles in chromosome segregation during mitosis. To ensure proper chromosome segregation, chromosomes must be efficiently captured and aligned on the mitotic spindle prior to their segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Godek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tanaka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maiato et al., 2017</xref>). For this, chromosomes establish initial interaction with spindle MTs soon after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). Subsequently, sister chromatids interact with MTs from opposite spindle poles (chromosome bi-orientation).</p><p>Several recent studies have revealed how chromosome–MT interactions are established in early mitosis and how these interactions determine the positions of chromosomes on the mitotic spindle. For example, chromosomes initially interact with the lateral side of spindle MTs, and the consequent positioning of the chromosomes facilitates their bi-orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Magidson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Itoh et al., 2018</xref>). Bi-orientation itself causes chromosomes to move to the middle of the mitotic spindle. These movements could also occur prior to bi-orientation, facilitated by chromosome sliding along pre-existing spindle MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kapoor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barisic et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>However, little is known about how chromosome positions are regulated independently of spindle MTs in early mitosis and what the biological significance of such regulation might be. For example, the positions of chromosomes relative to the spindle poles may affect the efficiency of establishing chromosome interaction with spindle MTs soon after NEBD. If chromosomes were located far away from the spindle poles, more time would be required to establish the initial chromosome–MT interaction. Moreover, should chromosomes be located behind a spindle pole, that is opposite from the bulk of spindle and outside of the pole-to-pole region, their interaction with MTs from the other spindle pole would be significantly delayed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chromosome scattering volume is reduced in early prometaphase, independently of spindle MTs</title><p>To investigate chromosome positioning during early mitosis, we quantified how widely chromosomes were scattered in space.

The U2OS <italic>cdk1-as</italic> cells were arrested in G2 with 1NM-PP1, and subsequently released by 1NM-PP1 washout to synchronously undergo mitosis. NEBD was identified by the release of the nuclear-localizing fluorescent reporter (GFP-LacI-NLS) into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using these methods, we quantified the CSV in synchronized U2OS <italic>cdk1-as</italic> cells as they progressed from NEBD (defined as t = 0) into prometaphase. We found that CSV was prominently reduced within the first 8 min following NEBD, and reduction continued more slowly over the following ~10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). CSV reduction was also observed in asynchronous, wild-type U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that it was not an artifact caused by <italic>cdk1-as</italic>-mediated cell cycle synchronization. Consequently, we used U2OS <italic>cdk1-as</italic> cells for synchronous entry into mitosis for the rest of the experiments presented in this work, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>It is possible that the CSV reduction observed following NEBD was an outcome of the interaction between chromosomes and spindle MTs. To test this possibility, we quantified CSV in cells treated with nocodazole. After nocodazole treatment, MTs were almost completely depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In control cells, chromosomes moved inward after NEBD, and subsequently aligned on the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, top-row images; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In cells lacking visible MTs, chromosomes also moved inward after NEBD, but then remained in a spherical formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom-row images; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The CSV was reduced with very similar kinetics in both the presence and absence of MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, graphs). CSV may be slightly smaller at 4 min following NEBD in control cells; if so, this could be due to mild compression of the nuclear envelope (NE) remnants caused by the rapid MT-dependent inward movement of centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, image at +4 min in control). Consequently, we conclude that the overall CSV reduction observed following NEBD is not an outcome of chromosome interaction with spindle MTs.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-46902-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46902.009</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>CSV decreases after NEBD even in the absence of MTs.</title><p>Video of representative cells (Control and Nocodazole-treated) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (SiR-DNA staining).

To test this possibility, we quantified the total volume of chromosome mass (chromosome mass volume [CMV]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) after NEBD. Unlike the CSV, the CMV did not considerably change following NEBD. Thus, we conclude that the reduction in CSV was not due to chromosome condensation, which likely occurs mainly before NEBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mora-Bermúdez et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Actin accumulates outside of the NE in prophase in a LINC complex-dependent manner, and the actin network shrinks after NEBD</title><p>What mechanisms, then, might promote CSV reduction after NEBD? The CSV reduction could be explained if chromosomes were surrounded by a physical barrier that contracts following NEBD. Consistent with this model, we found that in early mitosis an actin network accumulated on the NE, peaking in intensity around NEBD and persisting after it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

Using Airyscan super-resolution microscopy, we compared the localization of the actin network and the lamin B1 network; the latter is found on the nucleoplasmic surface of the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ungricht and Kutay, 2017</xref>) and remains substantially intact soon after NEBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Georgatos et al., 1997</xref>). The actin network was separated outwardly from lamin B1 by 150–200 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that it may localize on the cytoplasmic surface of the NE (or its remnants) following NEBD. A candidate receptor for the actin network on the NE is the LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complex, one end of which is anchored in the NE while the other end extends to the cytoplasm and interacts with actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Luxton and Starr, 2014</xref>). To test whether the NE-association of the actin network during early mitosis was LINC complex-dependent, we visualized the actin network in cells expressing a previously described dominant negative construct of the LINC complex (LINC-DN) or its control – SR-KASH and KASH∆L, respectively, reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Luxton et al., 2010</xref>). As expected, both constructs localized to the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, yellow arrowheads). Crucially, the fluorescence intensity of the actin network was significantly diminished in cells expressing LINC-DN, compared with cells expressing its control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, magenta arrowheads, graph). Therefore, the actin network localizes to the cytoplasmic surface of the NE and its remnants, following NEBD, in a LINC complex-dependent manner.</p><p>If the actin network were a physical barrier, confining chromosomes, and its contraction were to lead to the CSV reduction after NEBD, LINC complex disruption should also alleviate CSV reduction.

To obtain more evidence for this model, we performed light-induced local inhibition of myosin II activity in mitotic cells. We used azido-blebbistatin (azBB), which covalently binds the heavy chain of myosin II and inhibits its ATPase activity when exposed to infra-red light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Képiró et al., 2012</xref>). A low concentration of azBB was used to ensure that myosin II was inhibited only at the region exposed to infra-red light. We exposed a half of the nucleus to infra-red light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and compared the CSV over time in the exposed and non-exposed halves of the nucleus. In the exposed half of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>; blue), the CSV reduction was alleviated, compared to the non-exposed half (red). In the cells not treated with azBB (control), there was no significant difference in CSV between exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>; green) and non-exposed (orange) halves of nuclei.

In prophase, the acto-myosin network is formed on the cytoplasmic side of the NE, relying on the LINC complex. Following NEBD, the activity of myosin-II in the acto-myosin network promotes contraction of this network on the NE remnants. This contraction reduces CSV following NEBD, which in turn seems to facilitate chromosome alignment on the metaphase spindle (congression) and to ensure high-fidelity chromosome segregation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46902.036</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Summary diagram.</title><p>Prior to NEBD, the LINC complex promotes the accumulation of acto-myosin to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope (<bold>i, ii</bold>). Upon NEBD, myosin II promotes contraction of the acto-myosin network on the NE remnant, thus reducing the CSV (<bold>iii</bold>). Constraining chromosomes from scattering results in efficient chromosome interaction with the spindle MTs and timely chromosome congression (<bold>iii, iv</bold>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46902-fig6-v3.tif"/></fig><p>We found that, with LINC-DN expression and pnBB treatment, chromosome congression to the middle of the mitotic spindle was significantly delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). To achieve efficient chromosome congression, chromosomes must promptly establish initial interaction with spindle MTs and subsequently move from a position near the spindle poles to a position at the middle of the spindle. A delay in either step would lead to inefficient congression – which step, then, was delayed with LINC-DN expression and pnBB treatment (and with consequent defects in CSV reduction)? We presume that LINC-DN expression and pnBB treatment mainly delayed chromosome movement to the middle of the spindle, rather than the initial interaction. Consistent with this notion, LINC-DN expression and pnBB treatment diminished CSV reduction during 8–16 min after NEBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>); however at this stage, the initial chromosome–MT interaction had likely already occurred – for example, during 6–8 min after NEBD, many chromosomes had moved inward away from the NE remnants, probably due to MT interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). Moreover, the appearance of back-of-spindle chromosomes after LINC-DN expression was well correlated with a delay in chromosome congression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We reason that, during 8–16 min after NEBD, the contractile acto-myosin network constrained chromosomes within the pole-to-pole region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), thus reducing the occurrence of back-of-spindle chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>) and facilitating chromosome movement to the middle of the spindle, that is congression. However, the CSV reduction also occurs during an earlier phase (0–8 min after NEBD), and it is very possible that the earlier CSV reduction facilitates the initial chromosome–MT interaction. While this possibility is intriguing, we currently lack the ability to inhibit the CSV reduction during this phase and to analyze consequent chromosome–MT interactions.</p><p>Our result suggests that contraction of the acto-myosin network on NE remnants starts immediately after NEBD to facilitate CSV reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). What triggers the contraction of the acto-myosin network at this specific timing in the cell cycle? We speculate that NEBD reduces tension on the NE, which may trigger the contraction of the acto-myosin network on the NE remnants. Similar mechanisms have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pontes et al., 2017</xref>); for example, during cell migration, reduced membrane tension within lamellipodia led to local contraction of the acto-myosin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Gauthier et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have revealed important roles of the actin cytoskeleton and non-muscle myosin in high-fidelity chromosome segregation. For example, in starfish oocytes, actin depolymerization beneath the NE remnants facilitates the interaction of chromosomes with spindle MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burdyniuk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lénárt et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, spindle integrity relies on actin on the spindle and myosin-10 at spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woolner et al., 2008</xref>). In PtK2 cells, actin and non-muscle myosin on the mitotic spindle regulate the length of the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sheykhani et al., 2013</xref>). In mouse oocytes, actin dynamics on the spindle promote robust kinetochore–MT interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mogessie and Schuh, 2017</xref>). Moreover, several studies suggest that actin and myosin-II on the cell cortex are important for formation and correct orientation of the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rosenblatt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Whitehead et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kunda and Baum, 2009</xref>). In the current study, we found a novel actin- and myosin II-dependent mechanism promoting efficient and correct interaction between chromosomes and the mitotic spindle in human cells. In contrast to the mechanisms mentioned above, this mechanism is dependent on the acto-myosin network formed on the cytoplasmic surface of the NE and relies on its contraction driven by myosin II. Thus, the actin cytoskeleton and non-muscle myosin appear to contribute to high-fidelity chromosome segregation through multiple mechanisms. It will be intriguing to explore how these mechanisms are conserved in evolution and used in different cell types to ensure correct chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Cells were then arrested in the evening by addition of 1NM-PP1 (in the case of U2OS <italic>cdk1-as</italic> cells) or RO-3306 (in the case of HeLa or RPE cells), alongside SiR-DNA to stain chromatin where required. At this stage, media was also replaced with Fluorobrite medium (Gibco A18967-01) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco 10500), 2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco 200 mM, 25030–025), 25 mM HEPES (1 m Lonza BE17-737E) and 1 mM Na-Pyruvate (100 mM, Lonza BE13-115E). The following day cells were released from arrest by washing in 2 ml Fluorobrite medium (with supplements) 12 times, immediately followed by image acquisition. pnBB, azBB and MK-1775 were added after the final wash, prior to imaging. Nocodazole was added 1 hr before release, and added again after the final wash, prior to imaging. GFP-Tubulin construct was stably transfected in cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>.

For live-cell imaging of asynchronous U2OS cells, they were treated in the same way but were not arrested overnight before imaging. When a cell drifted during live-cell imaging, the frame of time sequence images in figures was adjusted so that a chromosome mass was still positioned at the center of the frame in each image. The timing of NEBD was determined by (a) the efflux of GFP-LacI-NLS signals from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, (b) the influx of GFP tubulin signals from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, or (c) the influx of GFP-NMHCII-A signals from the cytoplasm into the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell preparation for immunofluorescence</title><p>The night before fixation, media was replaced with Fluorobrite medium with supplements and the cells arrested with 1NM-PP1 if required. On the following day, cells were released by washing in 2 mL Fluorobrite medium 12 times. Progression into mitosis was confirmed under a phase contrast light microscope. Then cells were fixed when they reached an appropriate stage, based on observation of chromosome condensation. To fix cells for immuno-staining, they were rinsed with pre-warmed PBS and incubated for 10 min with 37°C 4% methanol-free formaldehyde at 37°C. They were then rinsed three times with PBS and permeabilized for 10 min in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. Following this they were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for an hour at 37 °C. While blocking, primary antibodies were prepared in 5% BSA in PBS to the relevant dilution. Following blocking, cells were incubated rocking with the primary antibody mixture for at least 60 mins at room temperature (or 4°C if incubated overnight). Following primary incubation, cells were washed rocking in PBS for 5 min, three times. Meanwhile, secondary antibodies plus phalloidin/Hoechst 33342 were prepared to the relevant dilution in 5% BSA in PBS. Cells were then incubated rocking with secondary antibodies for at least 60 min at room temperature (or 4 °C if incubated overnight). Following secondary incubation, cells were washed rocking in PBS for 5 min, three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence and cell staining</title><p>Primary antibodies were used for immuno-staining with the following dilution: anti-Tubulin 1:1000 (Cell Signalling Technology YL1/2), anti-LaminB1 1:1000 (Abcam ab16048) and anti-Actin 1:1000 (Thermo-Fisher PA1-183). Secondary antibodies were used with the following dilution: A488 goat anti-Rabbit 1:1000 (Thermo-Fisher A-11034), A488 donkey anti-Rat 1:1000 (Thermo-Fisher A-21208), and A594 goat anti-Rabbit 1:1000 (Thermo-Fisher A-11037).

SiR-DNA was supplemented when 1NM-PP1 was added to arrest cells. Azidoblebbistatin (azBB) was added when cells were released from the arrest (by washing off 1NM-PP1). To identify cells in prophase, the start of chromosome condensation was monitored with SiR-DNA signal. A scan area was zoomed in so that it covered roughly half of the nucleus in prophase. A z-stack (three sections, 2 µm apart) of the region was then rapidly scanned four times with 633 nm and 488 nm lasers to observe chromosomes and GFP-LacI-NLS, respectively, alongside 860 nm multi-photon laser exposure to photoactivate the covalent binding of azBB to Myosin II. The region was scanned in three rounds in this way at 1-min interval. The scan area was then extended so that image of the entire nucleus could be acquired. The whole nucleus was then imaged for SiR-DNA and GFP-LacI-NLS in a z-stack of 20 µm with 2 µm z-interval, every 2 min. The timing of NEBD was judged based on the efflux of GFP-LacI-NLS from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. The nuclear region exposed to 860 nm light could be discriminated based on partial photo-bleaching of SiR-DNA signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Measurement of chromosome scattering volume</title><p>U2OS <italic>cdk1-as</italic> cells expressing GFP-LacI-NLS were imaged every 2 min in the presence of SiR-DNA. Z-stacks of 10-sections were acquired with 2 µm interval. The CSV was measured as follows: The surface of chromosomes was identified using Imaris (3D surface object tool). Obviously non-chromosome objects were excluded in this process. On each z-section, the surface contours of multiple chromosomes were connected into one single-stroke contour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, green lines imposed on images), using Imaris, in such a way that the connection doesn’t affect 2D convex hull. These contours were used to generate a continuous 3D surface contour, which was required to compute a 3D convex hull. Based on this continuous 3D surface contour, a 3D convex hull was generated using Imaris (convex hull generation tool). The volume of this 3D convex hull was defined as the CSV. To compare reduction of CSV between two conditions, we used two-way ANOVA in which data at all the time points shown in relevant graphs were included in analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Measurement of the volume and intensity of the actin network</title><p>U2OS <italic>cdk1-as</italic> cells expressing mCherry-Lifeact and GFP-tubulin were imaged every 2 min. Z-stacks of 10-sections were acquired at 2 µm intervals. A 3D surface object was generated using Imaris by creating contours following the actin network at each z-section. The volume of the surface object was taken as the volume inside the actin network. Meanwhile, to measure the intensity of actin network, a two pixel wide line was drawn along the actin network on a single z-section using Fiji; the shape of the nucleus as seen by the exclusion of GFP-tubulin background was used as a guide when the actin signals were ambiguous. The mean gray value of the pixels within this line was taken as a measurement. As a background reading, a measurement was taken from a similar two-pixel wide line drawn in the cytoplasmic region surrounding the nucleus. To generate a final reading, the measurement from the cytoplasm was subtracted from the measurement from the actin network.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Measurement of chromosome mass volume</title><p>U2OS <italic>cdk1-as</italic> cells imaged every 2 min in the presence of SiR-DNA.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Helder Maiato (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript by Booth et al. describes an acto-myosin network that assembles on the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear envelope prior to mitosis. This network seems to be present in some human cell lines (U2OS, RPE) but not others (HeLa). The authors provide evidence that contraction of the network after nuclear envelope breakdown gathers chromosomes in the spindle center, which may support chromosome attachment to the spindle. This is a novel observation that extends the repertoire of molecular mechanisms that act during early mitosis to establish proper chromosome attachment.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Actin networks are known to influence mitosis and meiosis beyond their role in cytokinesis. An actin cortex underneath the plasma membrane supports mitotic cell rounding, spindle assembly and spindle positioning. Actin filaments can support spindle function, and nuclear actin has been shown to help expand the nucleus after mitosis. In starfish oocytes, chromosomes are collected towards the spindle by an actin network, and in mammalian eggs actin supports chromosome attachment to spindle microtubules.</p><p>The work reported in this manuscript expands this array of actin functions. The authors establish that the volume that chromosomes occupy (the 'chromosome scattering volume', CSV) decreases in the first ~8 minutes after nuclear envelope breakdown and continues to drop over the subsequent 20 minutes. They found that reduction of the CSV was impaired by a dominant-negative LINC complex mutation, which also abolished the pre-mitotic enrichment of actin around the nuclear envelope. Inhibition of myosin II activity similarly impaired CSV reduction, suggesting that it is driven by contraction of the actin network surrounding the nucleus. The effect was enhanced by additional depolymerization of microtubules, suggesting that microtubules and actin cooperate. The same dominant-negative LINC mutation also led to chromosome attachment defects, and the authors concluded that the reduction in CSV helps chromosome capture by the mitotic spindle.</p><p>Overall, this paper reports novel and interesting observations on the early stages of mitosis in human cells, which is an area with many unknowns, and the paper thus constitutes a significant advance for the field. The experiments are for the most part well designed, executed and controlled.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The conclusion that the acto-myosin network contraction positions chromosomes for attachment to the spindle, as stated in the title, is not well substantiated. The authors do not directly assess chromosome attachment. The initial reduction of CSV (during the first ~8 min) remains intact in LINC-DN or pnBB-treated cells, and this is the time when chromosomes are expected to attach to the spindle. Unless the authors provide direct evidence, this conclusion needs to be toned down.</p><p>- An alternative explanation for the observed attachment defects is that microtubule-related mechanisms of congression are disrupted. Spindles in pnBB-treated cells clearly have an atypical morphology (Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 6) and it remains unclear whether this is secondary to attachment problems or could be the primary cause of the attachment defects. The authors should examine mitotic spindles in the LINC-DN and in jasplakinolide-treated cells to determine whether the spindle defects co-occur with the failure to reduce CSV. Additional visualization of a kinetochore marker would allow the authors to judge when chromosome attachment to the spindle happens in these cells.</p><p>- The text is very concise, which makes it easy to read. However, the reviewers felt that it was too succinct, and that the discussion of prior work was not given adequate space. Prior work on the position and movement of chromosomes in early mitosis, on the relation between actin/myosin and spindles and on the 'spindle envelope' seems relevant.

Forer (Protoplasma 2007, Cytoskeleton 2013,.…).</p><p>- In many experiments, the authors only analyzed a small number of cells, and it seems that control cells from different days yield average normalized CSV curves that are significantly different from each other. For the most part, the differences between control- and treated cells seem large enough that this is not a concern. However, the conclusion that nocodazole-treated cells differ at the 4-min time point from control cells (Figure 1C) does not seem robust. Picking different control cells would yield a different conclusion. The authors either need to image more cells or tone down their conclusion. The number of asynchronously growing cells observed for CSV at mitotic entry (Figure 1—figure supplements 1-4) should be increased beyond three.</p><p>- Since the authors speculate about potential segregation defects in the absence of the CSV-reduction mechanism, it would be appropriate to analyze chromosome segregation in the LINC-DN or pnBB cells, which is easily feasible.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46902.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The conclusion that the acto-myosin network contraction positions chromosomes for attachment to the spindle, as stated in the title, is not well substantiated.

To achieve efficient chromosome congression, chromosomes must promptly establish initial interaction with spindle MTs and subsequently move from a position near the spindle poles to a position at the middle of the spindle. A delay in either step would lead to inefficient congression. In this context, we agree with the reviewers, and we presume that LINC-DN expression and pnBB treatment mainly delayed chromosome movement to middle of the spindle, rather than the initial chromosome interaction with spindle MTs. Consistent with this notion, LINC-DN expression and pnBB treatment diminished CSV reduction during 8-16 min after NEBD (Figure 2D and 3A), however at this stage, the initial chromosome–MT interaction had likely already occurred (as pointed out by reviewers) – for example, at 6–8 min after NEBD, several chromosomes had moved inward away from the NE remnants, probably due to MT interaction (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Moreover, the appearance of back-of-spindle chromosomes after LINC-DN expression was well correlated with a delay in chromosome congression (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). We reason that, during 8–16 min after NEBD, the contractile acto-myosin network constrained chromosomes within the pole-to-pole region (Figure 3—figure supplement 6), thus reducing the occurrence of back-of-spindle chromosomes (Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 3D) and facilitating chromosome movement to the middle of the spindle. We have included this argument in Discussion of our revised manuscript.</p><p>Nonetheless the CSV reduction also occurs during an earlier phase (0–8 min after NEBD), and it is very possible that the earlier CSV reduction facilitates the initial chromosome–MT interaction. We would very much like to address this possibility. However, we currently lack the ability to inhibit the CSV reduction during this phase and to analyse consequent chromosome–MT interactions. In the current work, although we analysed timing of chromosome congression (Figure 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 3B), we did not directly analyse earlier events of chromosome attachment to spindle MTs, leading to congression. Thus, as suggested by reviewers, we have toned down the relevant language and conclusion – for example, we used words ‘Evidence that…’ for a section title and ‘likely’ for conclusion in Results in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- An alternative explanation for the observed attachment defects is that microtubule-related mechanisms of congression are disrupted. Spindles in pnBB-treated cells clearly have an atypical morphology (Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 6) and it remains unclear whether this is secondary to attachment problems or could be the primary cause of the attachment defects.

Additional visualization of a kinetochore marker would allow the authors to judge when chromosome attachment to the spindle happens in these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now analysed spindle morphology during the early stage of bipolar-spindle formation, in LINC-DN-expressing cells and in control cells. As indicated by the reviewers’ comment, pnBB-treated cells sometimes showed atypical spindle morphology, which includes (a) spindle MTs extending from a pole in wide-ranging directions (Figure 3—figure supplement 3, pnBB, +8 and +10 min) and (b) a pronounced bundle of interpolar MTs (Figure 3—figure supplement 6, pnBB, +10 min). However, such atypical spindle morphology was also found in LINC-DN-expressing cells and in control cells during the early stage of bipolar-spindle formation (newly added Figure 3—figure supplement 5). Thus, we did not find any obvious difference in the spindle morphology at this early stage of mitosis between control cells, pnBB-treated cells and LINC-DN expressing cells.</p><p>We have also visualised kinetochores and MTs using fluorescent protein tags and live-cell imaging. While we could identify kinetochore interaction with the bundles of spindle MTs, we were not able to confidently identify initial kinetochore–MT interaction, which is known to frequently occur on the lateral side of a single MT. To bypass this technical difficulty, we resorted to estimating chromosome interactions with spindle MTs by analysing chromosome positions relative to the actin network on the NE remnants (Figure 2—figure supplement 2. Soon after NEBD, chromosomes were found positioned adjacent to the acto-myosin network on NE remnants (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, during 1–4 min; Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). We reasoned that the contractile acto-myosin network was pushing chromosomes inward during this period. Subsequently (6–8 min following NEBD), in the region where the bipolar spindle was formed, those chromosomes directly adjacent to the acto-myosin network moved away from the network and thus were no longer spatially associated with the network (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). We interpreted that chromosomes established interactions with spindle MTs, and subsequently MT-based mechanisms had moved the chromosomes further inward, away from the acto-myosin network. Though this method does not provide precise timing of initial chromosome–MT interaction, we can estimate that the interaction largely occurred within 8 min following NEBD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The text is very concise, which makes it easy to read.

We now cite and discuss most of these papers, suggested by reviewers, in the second paragraph of the revised Introduction and in the fourth paragraph of the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In many experiments, the authors only analyzed a small number of cells, and it seems that control cells from different days yield average normalized CSV curves that are significantly different from each other. For the most part, the differences between control- and treated cells seem large enough that this is not a concern. However, the conclusion that nocodazole-treated cells differ at the 4-min time point from control cells (Figure 1C) does not seem robust. Picking different control cells would yield a different conclusion. The authors either need to image more cells or tone down their conclusion. The number of asynchronously growing cells observed for CSV at mitotic entry (Figure 1—figure supplements 1-4) should be increased beyond three.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now toned down our conclusion regarding the 4-min time point in Figure 1C by stating that ‘CSV may be slightly smaller at 4 min following NEBD in control cells; if so, this could be due to…’ (words in bold were inserted in the revised manuscript).</p><p>We have also now increased the number of cells in our analysis, from three to eight, in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Our conclusion from the extended data set remains unchanged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Since the authors speculate about potential segregation defects in the absence of the CSV-reduction mechanism, it would be appropriate to analyze chromosome segregation in the LINC-DN or pnBB cells, which is easily feasible.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now scored frequency of abnormal chromosome segregation in control, LINC-DN-expressing and pnBB-treated cells (Figure 5E and Figure 5—figure supplement 3E). In 18–20% of LINC-DN expressing and pnBB-treated cells, abnormal chromosome segregation was observed, i.e. chromosomes were left either in the middle of spindle or at the back of spindle during anaphase.</p></body></sub-article></article>
