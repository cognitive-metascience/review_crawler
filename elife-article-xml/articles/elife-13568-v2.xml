BIK1. The heterotrimeric G proteins composed of the non-canonical Gα protein XLG2, the Gβ protein AGB1, and the Gγ proteins AGG1 and AGG2 are required for FLS2-mediated immune responses through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that in the pre-activation state, XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1, and it functions together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1, allowing optimum immune activation. Following the activation by flg22, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in the N terminus. The phosphorylated XLG2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD. The study demonstrates that the G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13568.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13568.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13568.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells need to be able to detect changes in their environment and respond accordingly. This ability involves signals from outside of the cell triggering changes to the activity inside the cell. Heterotrimeric G proteins are important for this kind of signaling in a wide range of organisms. In animals and fungi, these proteins directly work with a specific class of receptor proteins called G protein-coupled receptors (or GPCRs for short). Plants also have heterotrimeric G proteins, but it remains unclear whether they similiarly work with GPCRs.</p><p>Plants detect invading microbes by using receptors that are completely different from GPCRs. For example, a receptor called FLS2 from the model plant Arabidopsis senses a telltale protein produced by bacteria, and then passes the signal to another protein called BIK1 to activate the plant’s defenses. Heterotrimeric G proteins are required for this process, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.</p><p>Liang, Ding et al. now show that heterotrimeric G proteins regulate FLS2-controlled defenses by directly interacting with FLS2 and BIK1. Heterotrimeric G proteins also enhance defenses in at least two different ways. Firstly, in the absence of an infection, heterotrimeric G proteins stabilize the BIK1 protein to ensure that it is ready to respond. Secondly, if FLS2 does detect the telltale bacterial protein, BIK1 marks one of the heterotrimeric G proteins with a phosphate group. This then allows the G protein to boost the activity of another plant enzyme that is vital for defense signaling.</p><p>In the future, it will be important to work out how activation of FLS2 leads to the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. Furthermore, heterotrimeric G proteins are likely to regulate additional plant proteins when defenses are activated, and further studies are needed to identify these proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13568.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13568.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>plant immunity</kwd><kwd>oxidative burst</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>heterotrimeric G proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jian-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yuelin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jian-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jian-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Heterotrimeric G proteins are coupled to and regulate plant receptor signaling, which allows optimum immune activation and enhances the production of reactive oxygen species.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As an intensely studied Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) in plants, FLS2 serves as an excellent model understanding plant innate immune signaling and receptor kinases in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Macho and Zipfel, 2014</xref>).

In the pre-activation state, the GDP-bound Gα interacts with the Gβγ dimer to form a heterotrimer. Upon activation by GPCR, Gα exchanges GDP for GTP, resulting in the activation of the heterotrimer. The activated Gα and Gβγ dissociate from each other to regulate downstream effectors. Plants contain canonical Gα (encoded by <italic>GPA1</italic> in Arabidopsis), Gβ (encoded by <italic>AGB1</italic> in Arabidopsis), Gγ proteins (encoded by <italic>AGG1, AGG2</italic>), and a non-canonical Gγ (encoded by <italic>AGG3</italic> in Arabidopsis) (Urano and Jones, 2013).

However, it is still debated whether plants possess 7 transmembrane GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Taddese et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Urano and Jones, 2014</xref>). One recent report suggests that GPA1, AGG1/2 can interact with BAK1 and the chitin-binding receptor kinase CERK1, but not FLS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aranda-Sicilia et al., 2015</xref>).

How XLG2 and AGB1 regulate PRR-mediated immunity remains elusive.</p><p>In this study, we report XLG2, AGB1, and AGG1/2 modulates flg22-triggered immunity by directly coupling to the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex. Prior to activation by flg22, the G proteins attenuate the proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1, ensuring optimum signaling competence. After flg22 stimulation, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1, indicating a ligand-induced dissociation of Gα from Gβγ. In addition, we provide evidence that activation by flg22 additionally leads to XLG2 phospohrylation by BIK1, and this phosphorylation positively regulates RbohD-dependent ROS production. Together the study illustrates two distinct mechanisms underlying the G protein-mediated regulation of the FLS2 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of XLG2 and AGB1 in FLS2-mediated immunity</title><p>To identify additional components of the FLS2 immune pathway, we conducted a reverse genetic screen for mutants that were compromised in flg22-induced disease resistance to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv <italic>tomato (Pst</italic>).

Both the N and C termini of XLG2 are sufficient for the interaction with AGB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Note that XLG2-FLAG and AGB1-HA used in co-IP assays retain their biological functions when introduced into <italic>agb1</italic> protoplasts or <italic>xlg2</italic> plants (see below in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). In the animal model, the heterotrimeric G protein is dynamically regulated upon ligand stimulation of GPCR. We tested whether flg22 treatment can similarly regulate XLG2-AGB1 interaction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, the flg22 treatment resulted in a great reduction in XLG2-AGB1 interaction in <italic>Nb</italic> plants, suggesting that Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins are reminiscent of their animal counterparts in that the heterotrimer is dynamically regulated upon ligand activation of receptors. Because the heterotrimeric G protein mutants under investigation all display defects in flg22-induced ROS, which requires phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase RbohD by the BIK1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2014</xref>), we monitored the flg22-induced phosphorylation of RbohD in <italic>agb1</italic> using antibodies that recognize the BIK1-specific S39 phosphorylation. Flg22-induced S39 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in <italic>agb1</italic> mutant protoplasts, whereas complementation of the mutant protoplasts with <italic>AGB1</italic> restored RbohD S39 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistent with a positive role of AGB1 in flg22-induced RbohD S39 phosphorylation, transient overexpression of <italic>AGB1</italic> in WT protoplasts resulted in constitutive S39 phosphorylation in RbohD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

In contrast, immunoprecipitation of the control protein CPR5-FLAG failed to identify any PBL20 peptides. Co-IP and luciferase complementation assays confirmed that XLG2/3 indeed interacted strongly with PBL20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). AGB1 also interacted with PBL20, albeit much weaker than did XLG2. Because PBL20 and BIK1 belong to the same family of receptor like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) and share similar biochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), we therefore tested whether BIK1 also interacts with the G proteins.

Similar to the full-length XLG2 protein, the C terminus of XLG2 also dissociated from BIK1 when protoplasts were treated with flg22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). GST pull-down assays showed that the HIS-tagged C-terminal fragment of XLG2 strongly interacted with GST-tagged FLS2 kinase domain, but not GST alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that the C terminus of XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2. Surprisingly, GST pull-down assay showed a weak interaction between XLG2 and BIK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, phosphatase treatment of BIK1 enhanced its interaction with XLG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that XLG2 has greater affinity with non-phosphorylated BIK1.

Secondly, the interactions of the G proteins with FLS2 and BIK1 are also dynamically regulated by flg22. The flg22-induced dissociation of the G proteins from BIK1 coincides with the flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation, suggesting that the flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation triggers the dissociation of the G proteins. Indeed, de-phosphorylation of BIK1 strongly enhanced its interactions with both XLG2 and AGB1 in vitro.

However, mutations in the phospho-sites did not affect XLG2-BIK1 interaction nor BIK1 stability, suggesting that the phosphorylated XLG2 regulates components other than BIK1. Indeed, XLG2 constitutively interacts with RbohD, suggesting that the phosphorylated XLG2 further enhances ROS production by modulating RbohD. RbohD is known to be subject to multiple regulations including phosphorylation by CPK5 and BIK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dubiella et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2014</xref>) and calcium binding to EF-hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ogasawara et al., 2008</xref>). The results presented here show that RbohD is additionally regulated by a phosphorylated XLG2, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins reported here are analogous to the animal counterpart in that, upon activation by receptors, dissociate from each other and activate downstream effectors. Unlike the animal heterotrimeric G proteins, however, the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins additionally regulate signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex prior to receptor activation. Taken together, our results highlight remarkable similarities and striking differences in heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor signaling in animals and plants as a result of independent evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials</title><p>Arabidopsis plants used in this study include WT (Col-0), <italic>xlg2, xlg2 xlg3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>xlg3</italic> (SALK_107656c), <italic>agb1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ullah et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>gpa1-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jones et al., 2003</xref>) and <italic>agg1 agg2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trusov et al., 2007</xref>), and <italic>NP::BIK1-HA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>NP::FLAG-RbohD</italic> transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p> <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plants used for luciferase-complementation assay and Arabidopsis plants used for ROS burst, protoplast preparation and bacterial infection assays were grown in soil at 23°C and 70% relative humidity with 10/14 hr day/night photoperiod for 4–5 weeks.

The role of G-proteins in regulating BIK1 function is novel and exciting. Particularly strong are the data supporting a role of G-proteins in regulating pre-stimulation processes in immunity. Compared to this, however, a role of G-proteins in signaling post flg22 treatment appears rather vague and mostly correlative. For example, what is the evidence that phosphorylated XLG2 (pXLG2) is required for interaction with RbohD? The latter is important as evidence for post-activation function of G-proteins is mainly correlative (flg22 treatment results in phosphorylation of the N-terminus of XLG2 and XLG2 interacts with RbohD apparently even in the absence of flg22). Likewise, how does XLG2 binding to RbohD affect RbohD activity and why don't the phosphomimic forms of XLG2 show high basal levels of ROS production in the absence of flg22?

So a phosphorylated XLG2 may alter RbohD activity through a phosphorylation-induced conformational change or by recruiting other components. At this point, we do not know the real answer and will have to keep it vague. Nonetheless, we have clarified our results to state that the interaction is constitutive (at the end of the Results section and in the subsection “Flg22-induced phosphorylation in XLG2 is required for optimum ROS production and Pst resistance”) and that the mechanism by which the phosphorylated XLG2 regulate RbohD activity remains unknown (in the aforementioned subsection). Phospho-mimicking form of XLG2 showed identical phenotypes as did WT plants. This is likely because XLG2 effectors, such as RbohD, are regulated by multiple signal input. The phosphorylation of XLG2, while necessary, is not sufficient for the activation of RbohD. This point has been clearly stated in the text (subsections “XLG2 phosphorylation is required for disease resistance to Pst and optimum ROS production upon flg22 induction “and “Flg22-induced phosphorylation in XLG2 is required for optimum ROS production and Pst resistance“).</p><p><italic>There are also concerns regarding the novelty of some of the findings presented when comparing those to published work.</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Are there literature data available on how xlg1, agg3, and gpa1 mutants perform in the specific assays reported here in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>?
