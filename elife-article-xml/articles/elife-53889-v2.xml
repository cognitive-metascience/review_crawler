conserved step in animal development, where control is passed from the maternal to the zygotic genome. Although the MZT is typically considered from its impact on the transcriptome, we previously found that three maternally deposited <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNA-binding proteins (ME31B, Trailer Hitch [TRAL], and Cup) are also cleared during the MZT by unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that these proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Marie Kondo, an E2 conjugating enzyme, and the E3 CTLH ligase are required for the destruction of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup. Structure modeling of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CTLH complex suggests that substrate recognition is different than orthologous complexes. Despite occurring hours earlier, egg activation mediates clearance of these proteins through the Pan Gu kinase, which stimulates translation of <italic>Kdo</italic> mRNA. Clearance of the maternal protein dowry thus appears to be a coordinated, but as-yet underappreciated, aspect of the MZT.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bestselling author and organizing consultant Marie Kondo has helped people around the world declutter their homes by getting rid of physical items that do not bring them joy. Keeping the crowded environment inside a living cell organized also requires work and involves removing molecules that are no longer needed. A fertilized egg cell, for example, contains molecules from the mother that regulate the initial stages as it develops into an embryo. Later on, the embryo takes control of its own development by destroying these inherited molecules and switches to making its own instead. This process is called the maternal-to-zygotic transition.</p><p>The molecules passed from the mother to the egg cell include proteins and messenger RNAs (molecules that include the coded instructions to make new proteins). Previous research has begun to reveal how the embryo destroys the mRNAs it inherits from its mother and how it starts to make its own. Yet almost nothing is known about how an embryo gets rid of its mother’s proteins. To address this question, Zavortink, Rutt, Dzitoyeva et al. used an approach known as an RNA interference screen to identify factors required to destroy three maternal proteins in fruit fly embryos.</p><p>The experiments helped identify one enzyme that worked together with another larger enzyme complex to destroy the maternal proteins. This enzyme belongs to a class of enzymes known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (or E2 enzymes) and it was given the name “Kdo”, short for “Marie Kondo”. Further experiments showed that the mRNAs that code for the Kdo enzyme were present in unfertilized eggs, but in a repressed state that prevented the eggs from making the enzyme. Once an egg started to develop into an embryo, these mRNAs became active and the embryo started to make Kdo enzymes. This led to the three maternal proteins being destroyed during the maternal-to-zygotic transition.</p><p>These findings reveal a new pathway that regulates the destruction of maternal proteins as the embryo develops. The next challenge will be identifying other maternal proteins that do not “spark joy” and understanding the role their destruction plays in the earliest events of embryonic development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>maternal to zygotic transition</kwd><kwd>RNA binding proteins</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin-proteasome system</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM128680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rissland</surname><given-names>Olivia S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010174</institution-id><institution>University of Colorado</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rissland</surname><given-names>Olivia S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In fruit flies, maternally deposited RNA-binding proteins are removed during the maternal-to-zygotic transition via a mechanism of translational upregulation of Kondo, the key E2 enzyme, at egg activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper embryogenesis is critical for animal development. Many of the earliest events occur prior to the onset of zygotic transcription, and they are instead directed by maternally deposited proteins and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). During the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), genetic control of developmental events changes from these maternally loaded gene products to newly made zygotic ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vastenhouw et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the MZT requires both the activation of zygotic transcription and clearance of maternal transcripts. Failure to mediate either of these processes is lethal for the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benoit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to our understanding of the transcriptome during the MZT, much less is known about changes in the proteome. Despite the fact that the maternal dowry of proteins plays key roles in embryogenesis, there are only a handful of examples of cleared maternal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guven-Ozkan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pesin and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sysoev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, we found that three RNA-binding proteins (ME31B, Trailer Hitch [TRAL], and Cup) are rapidly degraded during the MZT in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, at a time point coinciding with the major wave of zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). ME31B, TRAL, and Cup form a complex that blocks translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinkelin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilhelm et al., 2003</xref>). All three proteins are required for oogenesis, and they appear to bind and repress thousands of deposited maternal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keyes and Spradling, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tritschler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilhelm et al., 2003</xref>). The degradation of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup coincides with many of the hallmarks of the MZT, but explorations into this issue have been hindered by a lack of understanding of how their destruction is controlled.</p><p>We previously made an intriguing observation that genetically linked the clearance of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup, to the Pan Gu (PNG) kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Composed of three subunits (PNG, Giant Nuclei [GNU], and Plutonium [PLU]), the PNG kinase is central to the oocyte-to-egg transition and mediates key aspects of embryogenesis, including resumption of the cell cycle, zygotic transcription, and maternal mRNA clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elfring et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>). Unlike many animals, the oocyte-to-egg transition in <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not require fertilization but is instead triggered by egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doane, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heifetz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horner and Wolfner, 2008a</xref>). Here, the PNG kinase is activated by mechanical stress as the oocyte passes through the oviduct, and then phosphorylation and degradation of the GNU subunit quickly inactivates the kinase, restricting its activity to the first half hour after egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hara et al., 2017</xref>). One way that PNG mediates the oocyte-to-embryo transition is by rewiring post-transcriptional gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kronja et al., 2014</xref>). Possibly by phosphorylating key RNA-binding proteins such as Pumilio, PNG activity leads to changes in the poly(A)-tail length and translation of thousands of transcripts during egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hara et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, two targets induced by PNG activity are the pioneer transcription factor Zelda, which is responsible for initial zygotic transcription, and the RNA-binding protein Smaug, which is responsible for clearance of many maternal transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benoit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>). The PNG kinase also phosphorylates ME31B, Cup, and TRAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hara et al., 2018</xref>), but it is unclear what effect phosphorylation has on these proteins. One possibility has been that PNG phosphorylation could lead to the degradation of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup, but this model has been thus far unexplored.</p><p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system is a major protein degradation pathway. Here, a series of ubiquitin activating enzymes, conjugating enzymes, and ligases (E1, E2, and E3, respectively) lead to the post-translational addition of a polyubiquitin chain on a target protein, which then serves as a molecular beacon for degradation by the proteasome. E3 ligases are typically thought to recognize target proteins, while E2 conjugating enzymes provide the activated ubiquitin and in turn recognize the E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). There are hundreds of different E3 ligases and 29 annotated E2 conjugating enzymes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Du et al., 2011</xref>), but most of the client substrates are unknown, and few have been implicated in the MZT.</p><p>Given the key roles of ME31B, Cup, and TRAL in oogenesis and embryogenesis, we wanted to understand the mechanisms controlling their degradation. In particular, we sought to answer how PNG activity at egg activation leads to the degradation of these three RNA-binding proteins several hours later, and how their degradation is coordinated with other elements of the MZT, including zygotic transcription and maternal mRNA clearance. To answer these questions, we performed a selective RNAi screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and identified the E2 conjugating enzyme as UBC-E2H/Marie Kondo and the E3 ligase as the CTLH complex. Interestingly, structural models based on the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qiao et al., 2020</xref>) suggest that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> version is organized differently than its orthologous complexes. The CTLH complex recognized and bound ME31B and Cup even in the absence of PNG activity, strongly suggesting that phosphorylation is not required for the destruction of these proteins. In contrast, <italic>Kdo</italic> mRNA is translationally upregulated by more than 20-fold upon egg activation in a PNG-dependent manner. Thus, egg activation through PNG mediates translation upregulation of <italic>Kdo</italic> and so leads to ME31B, Cup, and TRAL destruction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PNG kinase activity at egg activation triggers destruction of ME31B</title><p>We previously demonstrated by western blotting that ME31B, TRAL, and Cup were degraded 2–3 hr after egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). To understand the mechanisms underlying degradation of these RNA-binding proteins, we decided to establish a fluorescence-based assay so that we could follow ME31B degradation in living embryos. To do so, we took advantage of an ME31B-GFP trap line where the fusion protein is expressed from the endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buszczak et al., 2007</xref>); we have previously shown that ME31B-GFP recapitulates the dynamics of the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with western blotting, the GFP signal in control (<italic>png<sup>50</sup></italic>/FM7) embryos robustly decreased from 2 to 3 hr after egg laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In contrast, the GFP signal remained constant through this time period in <italic>png<sup>50</sup></italic>/<italic>png<sup>50</sup></italic> embryos (hereafter referred to as <italic>png<sup>50</sup></italic>), consistent with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Note that less heterogeneity in fluorescence was also observed in the mutant embryos; this observation likely stems from the fact that in wild-type embryos some ME31B-GFP degradation occurs during embryo collection and staging, but almost none occurs in <italic>png<sup>50</sup></italic> embryos. Together, these results confirm that the differences in ME31B-GFP dynamics are observable by microscopy and that the degradation of ME31B-GFP requires PNG.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The PNG kinase, but not fertilization, is required for ME31B degradation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PNG is required for the destruction of ME31B.

Given that <italic>png<sup>50</sup></italic> embryos did not degrade ME31B-GFP, we first investigated whether the other two components of the PNG kinase, GNU and PLU, were required. When either GNU or PLU were knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), ME31B-GFP was again stabilized, thus confirming that its destruction requires the full PNG kinase.</p><p>We next asked whether the degradation of ME31B-GFP required fertilization by following ME31B-GFP levels with fluorescence microscopy in unfertilized eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast to our results in <italic>png<sup>50</sup></italic> embryos, ME31B-GFP was still unstable in the activated, but unfertilized, eggs. This result is consistent with numerous studies demonstrating that the major events pre-MZT in <italic>Drosophila</italic> require egg activation (primarily through the PNG kinase), but not fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fenger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horner and Wolfner, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tadros et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>).

Pointing to a role of post-transcriptional gene regulation, the poly(A) tail length on <italic>Kdo</italic> mRNA also doubled upon egg activation in a manner dependent on PNG. This result suggests that the translational increase is partially mediated by an increase in poly(A)-tail length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>), which directly impacts translational changes during egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We noted, however, that although a change in poly(A)-tail length partially explained the changes in translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), it did not fully account for all of the translational changes at egg activation. Because we had previously found that ME31B is broadly associated with translational repression in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), we wondered if ME31B binding might also change during egg activation and if such changes could impact translation. To test this possibility, we immunoprecipitated ME31B-GFP complexes from stage 14 oocytes and sequenced bound transcripts, as we have done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). We normalized bound RNA to total abundance to generate an overall occupancy. Although ME31B-GFP binding in stage 14 oocytes was highly correlated with that measured previously in 0–1 hr wild-type embryos (Spearman r [<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic>]=0.66, p&lt;10<sup>–15</sup>), its binding was even more similar in 0–1 hr <italic>png<sup>50</sup></italic> embryos (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.84, p&lt;10<sup>–15</sup>; Fisher’s r-to-z transformation: p&lt;10<sup>–15</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H,I</xref>). These data indicate that although ME31B binds broadly similar transcripts in the oocyte and embryo, its binding does change at egg activation in a manner dependent on the PNG kinase. Moreover, we found that the change in ME31B-GFP binding at egg activation was strongly correlated with the change in translational efficiency (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = –0.48, p&lt;10<sup>–15</sup>) such that those mRNAs with diminished ME31B-GFP binding were translationally activated and those with increased binding were translationally repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Importantly, this relationship held even after we controlled for changes in poly(A)-tail length (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = –0.40, p&lt;10<sup>–15</sup>). Thus, these analyses indicate that PNG activity at egg activation triggers two independent, albeit related, mechanisms for altering translation: changing poly(A)-tail length and altering ME31B binding.</p><p>Importantly, as with poly(A)-tail length, ME31B-GFP binding to <italic>Kdo</italic> mRNA also changed upon egg activation and was substantially reduced in a PNG-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H,I</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that, during oogenesis, ME31B, presumably via Cup and TRAL, acts to repress translation of <italic>Kdo</italic> mRNA and thus suppress production of its own E2. Upon egg activation, PNG activity not only leads to extension of the <italic>Kdo</italic> mRNA poly(A) tail, but also stimulates the dissociation of ME31B from the transcript. Together, these two activities likely promote translation of <italic>Kdo</italic>, setting the stage for clearance of deposited ME31B, TRAL, and Cup.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>ME31B, Cup, and TRAL are RNA-binding proteins that are degraded during the MZT. Despite occurring several hours after egg laying, degradation of these proteins is triggered by egg activation through the activity of the PNG kinase and appears to be mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Through a medium-scale RNAi screen, we identified that the E2 conjugating enzyme Kdo is required for the clearance of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Kdo is conserved from yeast to humans and, as in those systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaiser et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lampert et al., 2018</xref>), appears to work with the CTLH complex, which acts as the E3 ligase. Components of the CTLH complex physically interact with ME31B and Cup, and the CTLH complex is also required for the degradation of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Structure-based homology suggests that, despite its conservation from yeast to humans, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CTLH complex has an unusual architecture, and it remains unclear how it recognizes its substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The association of CTLH with ME31B occurs in the absence of PNG activity, suggesting that, although ME31B (as well as TRAL and Cup) are phosphorylated by the kinase, phosphorylation may not be required for their destruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Instead, translation of <italic>Kdo</italic> appears to be suppressed during oogenesis by its short poly(A) tail length and binding of ME31B. Its translation is dramatically upregulated at the oocyte-to-embryo transition, in a process that depends on PNG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Together, these data suggest a model that egg activation via the PNG kinase leads to translational activation and production of Kdo, which then allows the CTLH complex to ubiquitinate ME31B, TRAL, and Cup and ultimately leads to their destruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). Interestingly, based on RNA-seq data from FlyBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">FlyBase Consortium et al., 2019</xref>), Muskelin shows exquisite tissue-specificity and is only strongly expressed in the ovaries. This observation, together with the translational control of <italic>Kdo</italic>, may partly explain how ME31B, a ubiquitous protein, is specifically destabilized in the early embryo.</p><p>Although the CTLH complex is conserved, it has not yet been studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our data point to this complex being composed of multiple components (Muskelin, RanBPM, Houki, Souji, and Katazuke), as in other organisms. However, due to a lack of available reagents, we do not know about the stoichiometry of these components, and it remains possible that there are additional, <italic>Drosophila</italic>-specific components. Nonetheless, so far, the CTLH complex in <italic>Drosophila </italic>appears different than the human and yeast complexes. Although Gid7 and WDR26 are important in the yeast and human versions, respectively, and we identified a <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog (CG7611), we found no evidence of its association with ME31B or requirement for ME31B degradation; the role of CG7611 in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CTLH complex warrants further investigation. We were also unable to identify orthologs of Gid4 and Gid5, which are critical for substrate recognition in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lampert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maitland et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Santt et al., 2008</xref>). Intriguingly, the residues and domains important for the Gid1–Gid4 and Gid8–Gid5 interactions in budding yeast appear absent to be in RanBPM and Hou, raising the fundamental question of how the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CTLH complex recognizes and positions its substrate proteins. Answering this question will require future investigation and may shed light on other proteins targeted by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CTLH complex and the extent to which ME31B, a ubiquitously expressed protein, is targeted outside of the MZT.</p><p>One unexpected result is the role of PNG in mediating the destruction of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup. PNG phosphorylates all three proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hara et al., 2018</xref>), and so our initial hypothesis was that this modification also stimulated their destruction. However, contrary to our expectations, ME31B and Cup interacted with the CTLH complex even in <italic>png<sup>50</sup></italic> embryos, demonstrating that phosphorylation by PNG was not required for binding of ME31B and Cup by the E3 ligase. An unresolved question, then, is how PNG phosphorylation affects the activities of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup. Intriguing observations from the Orr-Weaver lab suggest that the modification can impact the ability of these proteins to repress gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hara et al., 2018</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that phosphorylation may then contribute to the MZT by modulating the activities of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup, rather than their stability.</p><p>The link between PNG and the destruction of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup instead appears to be mediated through the translational upregulation of <italic>Kdo</italic>. Although PNG may contribute through other, as-yet undiscovered, mechanisms as well (such as phosphorylating unknown CTLH adaptor proteins), this link is sufficient to explain the PNG requirement for ME31B degradation: in the absence of Kdo, ME31B is stable during the MZT, and in the absence of PNG, Kdo is not detectably expressed. An important question for the future will be to understand what elements in the <italic>Kdo</italic> mRNA are responsible for its translational repression during oogenesis. One hint may be that the 3'UTR of <italic>Kdo</italic> contains several putative Pumilio-binding sites, and translation of <italic>Kdo</italic> is upregulated in ovaries where Pumilio has been knocked down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flora et al., 2018</xref>). Pumilio is also a target of PNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hara et al., 2018</xref>), and so a possible model is that translational repressors, such as Pumilio, are phosphorylated and inactivated at egg activation, leading to the production of Kdo.</p><p>PNG also mediates the translational upregulation of key MZT effectors: Zelda, the pioneer transcription factor, and Smaug, an RNA-binding protein that targets nearly two-thirds of the maternal transcriptome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>). Together with our results, a picture is emerging that egg activation stimulates the production of multiple key factors that are important for clearing the maternal RNA and protein dowry and for producing zygotic gene products.</p><p>Although the MZT has typically been considered from the perspective of RNA, a role for maternal protein clearance is becoming clearer. Over the past few years, the list of proteins degraded during the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MZT has grown and now includes GNU, Matrimony, Cort, Smaug, ME31B, TRAL, and Cup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benoit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pesin and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Whitfield et al., 2013</xref>). Unbiased mass spectrometry experiments also suggest that Wispy and Dhd are also robustly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sysoev et al., 2016</xref>). As this list of proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other developmental systems increases, a new question is emerging: how many maternally deposited proteins are degraded during the MZT? Understanding the mechanisms controlling protein degradation during the MZT as well as the impact of removing the maternal protein dowry will be key issues to explore in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> fly stocks</title><p>Fly stocks were maintained in a 25°C incubator with 65% humidity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Male flies from the TRiP stocks were crossed with the ME31B-GFP driver line.

maternally deposited mRNAs during embryogenesis has been widely studied in a variety of organisms, but the corresponding degradation of maternally deposited proteins remains uncharacterized and mysterious. By identifying the likely components of the ubiquitin system involved in the degradation of three proteins whose activity must be eliminated to proceed with development, this paper both provides a glimpse into how the system is organized and provides leverage for future efforts to tidy up our understanding of this essential step in the transition from maternal to zygotic control of embryogenesis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Egg activation triggers clearance of maternally deposited RNA binding proteins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Eisen as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>It is the consensus of the reviewers that this paper is not quite ready for <italic>eLife</italic> and they have some suggestions for modifying the manuscript that they feel might get it there.</p><p>Although it is our custom to produce a consensus review, in this case I think the separate reviews are more useful and I am leaving them as submitted. The reviewers arrived at the following during discussion that I think sums up their suggestions for how to reformulate the paper. Again, take this for what it is – suggestions from thoughtful colleagues – rather than a proscription for how you should present your work.</p><p>Overall, the reviews feel the paper should be refocused and some of the conclusions tones down or marked clearly as speculation. Those are noted in either or both reviews – the “timer” for example, and others. The paper could be refocused on the idea the ubiquitin/proteasome system is revved up at egg activation, under control of PNG, by inducing translation of Kondo. This could start by reporting on the analysis of the Bartel/Orr-Weaver data indicated that Kondo was among the strongest regulated genes. They then confirmed this on Westerns. Then, to see if it had an actual effect, they tested it on a target known to be degraded in response to PNG – mei31B (well, mei31-GFP in this case; here, they can introduce it simply as an assay) – and discovered that indeed Kondo is needed for its degradation. [They'd need to remove the rest of the RNAi screen (which is good, because that was confusing or unconvincing in a variety of ways noted in reviews) as well as the parts of the paper that try to tightly connect all this to mei41B-Cup-Tral-based RNA degradation (but over-speculate) and the speculation that PNG sets off the MZT by activating Kondo translation to then degrade mei31B which then…. (etc.). ]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a well-written and clear manuscript that builds on previously published work from the Rissland lab in which they showed that the three proteins involved in translational repression, ME31B, Tral, and Cup, are degraded in a PNG-dependent manner in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. Here they show that this degradation requires an E2 ubiquitin ligase, which they name Kondo, and the CTLH E3 ligase known to function with Kondo orthologs in other systems. They further demonstrate that translation of Kondo is regulated by the PNG kinase. While the identification of Kondo and the regulation of its translation by PNG are interesting, the data presented do not broadly expand the understanding of the functions that control the oocyte-to-embryo transition. However, these observations suggest novel areas for future investigation.</p><p>1) Prior work from the Rissland lab and others previously showed that ME31B, Tral, and Cup were degraded following fertilization in a PNG-dependent manner. As such, the data in Figure 1 confirm the utility of the imaging system in identifying genes that regulate ME31B stability, but do not present new information. The data in Figure 2 suggest that ME31B is degraded by the proteasome, but the limitations of the experimental system (RNAi) do not enable strong conclusions based on these data. In fact, the title for Figure 2 is misleading as the data presented to not allow one to conclude that ME31B is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. In addition, much of the data presented in Figure 6 were previously generated. Indeed, explicit mention of the citations for the data used to generate panels B-I need to be made. In this figure, it appears that the only data generated explicitly for his manuscript is the ME31B binding in oocytes. If this is not the case, then additional methods need to be added for ribosome profiling and poly-A tail length measurements.</p><p>2) It remains unclear what the phenotypic effects of loss of Kondo are in the embryo. Some description needs to be added. Given that Kondo mRNA appears to be expressed throughout development, the specific role of Kondo in the early embryo is challenging to reconcile. In Wang et al., the lab demonstrated that ME31B is expressed in S2 cells. It would be important to test if Kondo protein (along with the mRNA) is expressed in these cells and if so, if it is functioning to destabilize ME31B.</p><p>3) Given that ME31B binding to the Kondo mRNA is abrogated in PNG kinase mutants, a simple model might be that phosphorylation of ME31B (and associated subunits) by PNG alleviates binding to mRNA, enabling translation of many targets, including Kondo. As the authors mention, PNG- regulated translation is common to many mRNAs in the early embryo. Thus, degradation of ME31B may reinforce this translational effect, but may not be required for the change in gene expression. This would be important to test.</p><p>4) Some of the experiments would benefit from increased detail and/or quantification.</p><p>a) The RNAi screen is cleverly based on fluorescence. However, the details shown in Supplemental Table 1 do not describe how stabilization was scored. Was there a quantitative measure of fluorescence over time? If so, this should be described. If not, this seems something that should have been developed. This would help explain whether there is a biological significance to the variability in fluorescence seen in different experiments. For example, in Figure 1 the fluorescence at the zero timepoint in the plu and gnu knockdowns appears more intense than the included controls. In addition, the fluorescence in controls varies both within Figure 1 and between figures.</p><p>b) There is no information on how ubiquitin on ME31B was identified by mass spectrometry nor any discussion of these data other than in subsection “ME31B is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system” where it says &quot;see below&quot;. In addition, the methods describing the mass spectrometry performed are essentially non-existent. These methods need to be included.</p><p>c) Additional controls should be used for the pulldowns in Figure 2B and 5B. In this experimental design the authors should perform anti-GFP pulldowns on extract from flies that do not express ME31B-GFP. This is an important control.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Zavortink et al. examine the cause of degradation of three RNA binding proteins, Mei31B, Tral, and Cup, in the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT) of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In a complex these proteins block translational initiation of maternal mRNAs. They are degraded at the MZT, and remaining Mei31B degrades maternal mRNAs. These authors previously reported that destruction of these proteins depends on PNG kinase. Here they confirm this for Mei31B using a GFP fusion. They then show that ubiquitin machinery is involved in degradation of this fusion protein, and identify an E2, Kondo, and E3, CTLH, as required for this. Based on data mining and new experiments they report that Kondo translation depends on PNG. These items above are new, except for the PNG/Mei31B degradation link. The authors interpret their data into a model that PNG's role in the destruction of the Mei31B-Tral-Cup complex is in activating Kondo translation rather than due to PNG's phosphorylation of the complex's proteins.</p><p>The above conclusions are interesting, but many of the supporting conclusions are more conjectural: consistent with the model but not fully certain of having ruled out all other explanations. For example, many conclusions rely on knockdowns. With the exception of Kondo, where strong knockdown was documented, no information was provided about extent of knockdown, or the testing of multiple independent lines to rule out off-target effects. It was hard to know how to interpret experiments in which only weak knockdown can be used, such as the core barrel proteasome experiments. A partial effect, as seen, is consistent with but not proof of the hypothesis. Similar problems apply to interpretation of some of the CTLH subunit experiments. Not seeing a phenotype for CG7611 could be because of incomplete knockdown, and lack of its presence in the complexes could be a separate unrelated issue of mass spectrometry sensitivity. Lack of a phenotype for Souji knockdown in terms of RanBPM-Mei31B can also not be interpreted mechanistically, although such an interpretation is implied.</p><p>Other cases of imprecision or conjecture include the following situations that go beyond wording problems, and require experimentation to resolve:</p><p>In subsection “The E2 conjugating enzyme UBC-E2H is required for the degradation of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup”, the authors state that both wild-type and fusion proteins were completely stabilized when UBC-E2H was depleted. But Figure 3C shows this only for the fusion protein. In the same figure the wildtype protein's levels decrease with time. This is a potentially important difference that needs attention.</p><p>The paper posits that a timer is set by egg activation through the agency of PNG to cause destruction of Mei31B at the MZT. This timing model is not tested. It could simply be that MZT can only happen after egg activation, and that egg activation, and PNG, is necessary for subsequent clearance of these proteins without serving as a timer.</p><p>Several times the paper says &quot;and likely Tral and Cup&quot;, without testing it. This weakens the conclusions.</p><p>The paper concludes that because CTLH binds Mei31B in the absence of PNG, PNG phosphorylation must not trigger Mei31B destruction. This is consistent with the authors' conclusion but do not prove it. For that, a non-phosphorylatable Mei31B must be tested for ubiquitin-mediated destruction.</p><p>Other phenomena that may contribute are not considered. For example Wispy also regulates poly A tail length. And although SUMO modification, and Dhd, are noted they are not considered in the model.</p><p>Some interpretations are overstatements. For example, the authors state that ubiquitnation of ME31B is &quot;completely absent&quot; in Kondo knockdown, but they can only conclude that any ubiquitination is beyond their detection limit. Conclusions about composition of active CTLH also go well beyond the data</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>I am pleased to inform you that your article, &quot;Egg activation triggers clearance of maternally deposited RNA binding proteins&quot;, has been provisionally accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you can see from the comments from the reviewers, there is disagreement about whether the additional data addresses the concerns raised. However, under our COVID publication policies, we recognize that it is not practical to address them at this time. We therefore ask, as a final step prior to publication, that you do your best to address these limitations in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript builds on previously published work from the Rissland lab in which they showed that the three proteins involved in translational repression, ME31B, Tral, and Cup, are degraded in a PNG-dependent manner in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. In this revision, Zavortink et al. now provide quantification of their florescent imaging and structural modelling of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CTLH complex. However, due to the current limits on experimentation very few of the prior concerns have been addressed experimentally. The prior submission was &quot;not quite ready for <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;, and because of the limited new data this manuscript does not broadly expand the understanding of the functions that control the oocyte-to-embryo transition.</p><p>The additional controls strengthen the conclusions drawn in the manuscript. Nonetheless, previous reviews highlighted a number of avenues for experimentation that would broaden the scope of the manuscript. These included phenotypic characterization of Kondo loss-of-function that could help explain why ME31B is stable in some cells and not others and investigation of whether ME31B phosphorylation by PNG alleviates binding to Kondo mRNA. The authors argue that these are beyond the scope of the current manuscript, but without some additional data the current manuscript does not significantly change the field.</p><p>As it stands, the authors argue that translation of Kondo is triggered by PNG and that Kondo expression is necessary for ME31B expression. (Indeed, this is the model in Figure 7.) But, clearly this cannot be the full story since Kondo is expressed in cells where ME31B is stable. Furthermore, ME31B binds Kondo mRNA (and this is completely missing from the over-simplified model). Thus, it is likely that there are other changes triggered by PNG-mediated phosphorylation that result in ME31B degradation apart from Kondo expression. The identification of Kondo, while interesting, does not broadly shift the understanding of the previously identified PNG-dependent degradation of ME31B, TRAL and Cup.</p><p>The only additional figure in the resubmitted manuscript are the inclusion of the structural modelling of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CTLH complex. The impact of these data on the paper (which is written to address protein dynamics during the MZT) are unclear. This modelling, while potentially informative, does not provide an explanation for the difference between the two RanBPM isoforms or how this structure impacts the triggered degradation of ME31B during the MZT.</p><p>While the authors may argue that current research shutdowns result in the limited new experiments that were added on resubmission, this would not preclude substantive textual changes as suggested in the prior review. Thus, it was surprising that the paper is largely structured as it was previously. In addition, the Materials and methods continue to lack clarity. Just because mass spectrometry was performed at a fee for service facility does not mean that an explanation of how the peptides were identified and quantified can be excluded from the methods of a paper. The methods in the Wang et al. reference has a similarly vague explanation and thus does not provide any additional information. This is important information for future researchers looking to build or extend this work. Similarly, the information on the lysis conditions for the various IPs is unclear. There is a section on &quot;Isolation of embryos&quot; that explains a single lysis condition. Were these the conditions used for the coIP experiments? This is important for anyone wanting to repeat or extend these figures. Along these lines, it would be useful to explain the surprising background precipitation seen in Figures 5B and 6B (for ME31B and ME31B-GFP) and Figure 6C (for Cup) in the IgG control. These non-specific pulldowns of the target proteins suggest lysis or IP conditions might not be very stringent.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I thank the authors for considering my comments and for addressing them as well as possible under COVID-19 constraints. Softening the language where experiments were not possible is acceptable under current situation, and including the Cao et al. study and the implications of the Qiao et al. study addressed some of my major concerns. The authors could consider adding brief acknowledgement of limitations such as not knowing extent of depletion in the knockdowns, noting that it was not possible to test this at present.</p><p>The one comment that was not fully addressed was my Minor Comment #1. The authors' response does address my concern about whether Mei31B-GFP is functional. But they still retain imprecise language in the text, using &quot;Mei31B&quot; when what they tested was Mei31B-GFP, or in statements like &quot;We set out to identify E2 conjugating enzymes and E3 ligases responsible for the degradation of ME31B by.… RNAi screen. As before, we monitored ME31B decay by GFP fluorescence&quot;, or re-state clauses like &quot;knockdown of UBC-E2H… blocked degradation of Mei31B…&quot;, when degradation of Mei31B-GFP was what was monitored in the GFP fluorescence assay. This makes it confusing for readers and is not fully accurate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53889.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the reviews feel the paper should be refocused and some of the conclusions tones down or marked clearly as speculation.

As noted in other papers (Kronja et al., 2014), embryos depleted of Muskelin do produce viable flies, and we have also seen that embryos depleted of Kondo produce adults. However, we have not performed a careful phenotypic investigation, and so we have not commented on the phenotype in our current manuscript.</p><p>It is worth noting that it does appear that some Kondo alleles are recessive-lethal, which is consistent with Kondo having additional roles outside the embryo. Based on this reported phenotype, fairly ubiquitous Kondo expression, and what is known in other organisms, we suspect that Kondo may also lead to the degradation of other proteins through the CTLH complex. In yeast, the CTLH complex has several different substrate adaptor proteins (e.g., Gid4 and Gid10) that in turn target different proteins. We suspect that something similar might be at work in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but identifying the recognized degron and the role of Kondo outside of the embryo extends beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>Unfortunately, S2 cells do not recapitulate key aspects of the embryo system (e.g. ME31B is very stable in these cells [t<sub>1/2</sub> ~6 hours]), which precludes use of S2 cells for these experiments. We cannot speak to the critical differences between the two systems, especially given the strong likelihood that we have not identified all components of the CTLH complex.

Much of the variation between wild-type embryos, we suspect is due to differences in embryo age that occurs during the initial 1-hour collection and preparation prior to placing the embryos on the slide. In order to control for this variation in our quantitation, we normalized the fluorescence to the intensity in the first time point. Similarly, we suspect variation between controls in different figures is due to day-to-day differences in collections, dechorionation times, etc. Of course, this variation is one of the reasons why we included an mCherry in each experiment and in the screen itself.</p><p>In <italic>png50</italic> mutants or other lines lacking key degradation factors, the fluorescence is more homogenous and more intense because there is limited degradation that occurs during the collection stage.

We are unable to identify a putative <italic>Dm</italic> Gid4 or Gid5, using either yeast or human primary protein sequences or structure-based reverse searches based on the yeast structure. Indeed, closer inspection of RanBPM and Hou threaded through the yeast structure revealed striking differences at their predicted interface with Gid5/4: a loop in Gid1 that interacts with Gid4 is missing in RanBPM; a long C-terminal expansion in Gid8 that wraps around Gid5 is also missing in Hou. Together, these results raise the possibility that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> complex has a different organization than the yeast one, which will be exciting to investigate in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other cases of imprecision or conjecture include the following situations that go beyond wording problems, and require experimentation to resolve:</p><p>In subsection “The E2 conjugating enzyme UBC-E2H is required for the degradation of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup”, the authors state that both wild-type and fusion proteins were completely stabilized when UBC-E2H was depleted. But Figure 3C shows this only for the fusion protein. In the same figure the wildtype protein's levels decrease with time. This is a potentially important difference that needs attention.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously seen that ME31B-GFP is slightly more stable than the endogenous protein (Wang et al., 2017) although the underlying mechanism will likely require a better understand of how ME31B is recognized by the E3. We have clarified this point in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper posits that a timer is set by egg activation through the agency of PNG to cause destruction of Mei31B at the MZT. This timing model is not tested. It could simply be that MZT can only happen after egg activation, and that egg activation, and PNG, is necessary for subsequent clearance of these proteins without serving as a timer.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed all mention of the timer from the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several times the paper says &quot;and likely Tral and Cup&quot;, without testing it. This weakens the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>For technical reasons, we cannot directly investigate some aspects of TRAL and Cup biology (e.g., interactions with the CTLH complex or ubiquitination). Nonetheless, as described above, we now include immunoprecipitations against endogenous Cup and observe interactions with RanBPM in wild-type and <italic>png50</italic> embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper concludes that because CTLH binds Mei31B in the absence of PNG, PNG phosphorylation must not trigger Mei31B destruction. This is consistent with the authors' conclusion but do not prove it. For that, a non-phosphorylatable Mei31B must be tested for ubiquitin-mediated destruction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that, in an ideal scenario, this experiment would be important to do. However, it is not feasible for several reasons. First, ME31B is phosphorylated by PNG but the sites are currently unknown (Hara et al., 2018). Second, it remains unclear if ME31B directly recognized or if Cup or TRAL are also recognized. Each of these two proteins is directly phosphorylated by PNG (Hara et al., 2018). Nonetheless, it is clear that both ME31B and Cup can interact with the E3 ligase in the absence of PNG activity, which strongly suggests that the phosphorylation is not required for their recognition by the E3 ligase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other phenomena that may contribute are not considered. For example Wispy also regulates poly A tail length. And although SUMO modification, and Dhd, are noted they are not considered in the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that other phenomena may contribute to the regulation of <italic>Kondo</italic> translation. Indeed, Wispy does regulate Kondo poly(A)-tail length, as determined from data from Eichhorn et al., 2016. Interestingly, this paper also observed that Wispy does not affect the relative translation of mRNAs, and so understanding the role of Wispy for <italic>Kondo</italic> translation will require more substantial investigation. Similarly, although Sumo regulation appears involved in the degradation of ME31B, understanding this involvement falls outside the scope of our current study. (Note that because our discussion of our RNAi screen has been simplified, we have now removed reference to Sumo regulation in the main text, although the source data remains.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some interpretations are overstatements. For example, the authors state that ubiquitnation of ME31B is &quot;completely absent&quot; in Kondo knockdown, but they can only conclude that any ubiquitination is beyond their detection limit.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text in multiple places to reflect this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conclusions about composition of active CTLH also go well beyond the data.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have performed an in-depth analysis of the CTLH complex, modeling on the <italic>Sc.</italic> Gid complex.

(Indeed, this is the model in Figure 7.) But, clearly this cannot be the full story since Kondo is expressed in cells where ME31B is stable. Furthermore, ME31B binds Kondo mRNA (and this is completely missing from the over-simplified model).</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the model from Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thus, it is likely that there are other changes triggered by PNG-mediated phosphorylation that result in ME31B degradation apart from Kondo expression. The identification of Kondo, while interesting, does not broadly shift the understanding of the previously identified PNG-dependent degradation of ME31B, TRAL and Cup.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that other changes due to PNG activity may be important for ME31B degradation and state as much in our discussion. However, because RanBPM and ME31B/Cup interact in PNG mutant embryos, the conclusion stands that PNG phosphorylation is not required for the CTLH complex to recognize ME31B.</p><p>We have added an additional point to the Discussion that may shed some light as to why ME31B is stable outside of the MZT: according to RNA-seq published on FlyBase, Muskelin expression is highly restricted to the ovary and early embryo, and shows little expression in standard cell lines, such as S2 cells. Because Muskelin is required for ME31B degradation, the tissue specificity of Muskelin, together with the translational activation of <italic>Kondo</italic>, may provide an explanation as to why ME31B, TRAL, and Cup are degraded specifically in the early embryo (although there may be additional layers of regulation as well). Another (non-mutually exclusive) possibility is that Cup is the major substrate for the CTLH complex and that ME31B and TRAL are only degraded when Cup is also present. Like Muskelin, Cup expression is highly restricted, and it is only robustly expressed in the ovary and testes (with some minor expression in the imaginal disc). Based on our current understanding, we cannot exclude these different possibilities, but we agree with the reviewer that these are important issues to understand in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the Materials and methods continue to lack clarity. Just because mass spectrometry was performed at a fee for service facility does not mean that an explanation of how the peptides were identified and quantified can be excluded from the methods of a paper. The methods in the Wang et al. reference has a similarly vague explanation and thus does not provide any additional information. This is important information for future researchers looking to build or extend this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included more information about the mass spectrometry in our Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the information on the lysis conditions for the various IPs is unclear. There is a section on &quot;Isolation of embryos&quot; that explains a single lysis condition. Were these the conditions used for the coIP experiments? This is important for anyone wanting to repeat or extend these figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion and have tried to clarify our methods section. Briefly, the embryo isolates are made the same way for all experiments and stored at -80C. Depending on the nature of the experiment, we then modify the buffer used to dilute the sample or to wash the beads.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along these lines, it would be useful to explain the surprising background precipitation seen in Figures 5B and 6B (for ME31B and ME31B-GFP) and Figure 6C (for Cup) in the IgG control. These non-specific pulldowns of the target proteins suggest lysis or IP conditions might not be very stringent.</p></disp-quote><p>ME31B, Cup, and other RNA binding proteins can be sticky and bind beads non-specifically, and we have occasionally seen low levels of the proteins in our controls even with stringent buffers. Nonetheless, the interaction with RanBPM is specific in 5B, 6B, and 6C. Note that in our standard conditions beads are washed three times and transferred to a new tube (as we describe in our Materials and methods section). That being said, we do find that the interaction between RanBPM and ME31B is weaker than and harsher buffers, such as RIPA, disrupt the interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I thank the authors for considering my comments and for addressing them as well as possible under COVID-19 constraints. Softening the language where experiments were not possible is acceptable under current situation, and including the Cao et al. study and the implications of the Qiao et al. study addressed some of my major concerns. The authors could consider adding brief acknowledgement of limitations such as not knowing extent of depletion in the knockdowns, noting that it was not possible to test this at present.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this suggestion in discussing the results from our screen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The one comment that was not fully addressed was my Minor Comment #1. The authors' response does address my concern about whether Mei31B-GFP is functional. But they still retain imprecise language in the text, using &quot;Mei31B&quot; when what they tested was Mei31B-GFP, or in statements like &quot;We set out to identify E2 conjugating enzymes and E3 ligases responsible for the degradation of ME31B by.… RNAi screen. As before, we monitored ME31B decay by GFP fluorescence&quot;, or re-state clauses like &quot;knockdown of UBC-E2H… blocked degradation of Mei31B…&quot;, when degradation of Mei31B-GFP was what was monitored in the GFP fluorescence assay.
