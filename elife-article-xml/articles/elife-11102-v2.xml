Experiments showed co-contraction of opposing muscle groups, and indicated that symptoms depended on the interaction of brain and spinal cord. SNP mapping and exome sequencing identified the dominant causative mutation in the <italic>Lamb1</italic> gene. Laminins are extracellular matrix proteins, widely expressed but also known to be important in synapse structure and plasticity. In accordance, awake recording in the cerebellum detected abnormal output from a circuit of two <italic>Lamb1</italic>-expressing neurons, Purkinje cells and their deep cerebellar nucleus targets, during abnormal postures. We propose that dystonia-like symptoms result from lapses in descending inhibition, exposing excess activity in intrinsic spinal circuits that coordinate muscles. The mouse is a new model for testing how dysfunction in the CNS causes specific abnormal movements and postures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11102.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11102.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11102.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Dystonia is the third most common disorder affecting movement in humans. People with dystonia periodically experience movements that they can’t control. Sometimes the movements are repetitive, for example, abnormal or spasmodic blinking. At other times, two sets of muscles that work against each other become active at the same time, which causes the body to assume a strange position. The symptoms are sometimes painful and they tend to be worse in times of stress. But many individuals with dystonia are able to develop tricks to control their symptoms. For example, some find they can stop the unwanted movements by touching their face or by walking backwards.</p><p>Researchers believe that various parts of the brain fail to communicate properly in patients with dystonia. Additionally, it is thought that the connections between nerve cells called synapses become hyperactive in these individuals. However, it is not clear exactly how these abnormalities are able to circumvent the systems that usually act to suppress unnecessary movements.</p><p>Now, Liu et al. have discovered a mutation in mice that causes dystonia-like symptoms. When the mice first wake up, or when they are placed in a new environment, one or both of their hind legs become over extended. The mice walk and climb normally when they are in their usual cage and after they have been awake for longer periods. In the experiments, the mice underwent a series of tests to determine what caused these intermittent symptoms. The experiments suggested that hyperactive synapses in the spinal cord trigger the movements, but that the brain is often able to counteract them.</p><p>Genetic experiments revealed that the mice have a mutation in the <italic>Lamb1</italic> gene, which encodes a protein that forms a structural support in the synapse. Next, Liu et al. examined synapses in some parts of the brain of the mutant mice. During normal movements, the levels of synapse activity in these mice were similar to those observed in normal mice. However, when abnormal movements occurred in the mutant mice, their synapses produced irregular patterns of activity. Further studies of these mice should help researchers to better understand what goes wrong in human patients with dystonia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11102.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11102.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>movement disorder</kwd><kwd>exome sequencing</kwd><kwd>spinal cord circuits</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>laminin</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS058949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brashear</surname><given-names>Allison</given-names></name><name><surname>Ozelius</surname><given-names>Laurie J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sweadner</surname><given-names>Kathleen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS058949S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brashear</surname><given-names>Allison</given-names></name><name><surname>Ozelius</surname><given-names>Laurie J</given-names></name><name><surname>Khodakhah</surname><given-names>Kamran</given-names></name><name><surname>Sweadner</surname><given-names>Kathleen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS050808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khodakhah</surname><given-names>Kamran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS079750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khodakhah</surname><given-names>Kamran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PR100747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sweadner</surname><given-names>Kathleen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS081558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sweadner</surname><given-names>Kathleen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mouse with a defined mutation in an extracellular matrix protein that is expressed in selected neurons sheds light on circuit abnormalities producing transient hyperkinetic movements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dystonia, the third-most common human movement disorder, involves 'sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive movements, postures or both' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albanese et al., 2013</xref>). There is strong evidence that dystonia is a circuit disorder involving various brain regions, including sensory input, premotor and motor cortex, striatum and globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus and parts of the thalamus, cerebellum, and the tracts connecting them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berardelli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breakefield et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lehéricy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neychev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quartarone and Hallett, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). There is also decreased inhibition and a bias toward potentiation in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hallett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quartarone and Pisani, 2011</xref>). However, there is little certainty about exactly how circuit and synaptic abnormalities produce the persistent overflow of motor control, often involving only certain muscle groups and the co-contraction of opposing muscles. Until recently, there has been a lack of a phenotypically penetrant genetically defined mouse model, where circuit hypotheses for mechanisms of dystonia can be tested in the context of abnormal movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weisheit and Dauer, 2015</xref>). The lamb1t mouse introduced here exhibits late postnatal/young adult onset of dystonia-like hindlimb movements and postures, and it has high viability, gene penetrance, and inter-individual consistency. Several aspects of its biology have parallels with dystonia, such as post-developmental onset, an ability to overcome the symptoms, and slow progression. However, the mutant mouse also has symptoms exposed by sleep and anesthesia, and these led to the demonstration that there are circuit abnormalities in the spinal cord.</p><p>The strategy was to characterize the genetic inheritance and behavior of the mouse; do diagnostic experiments to narrow down the neural substrates; map the gene’s locus and identify the mutation; and check expression of mutant protein. A dominantly-inherited <italic>Lamb1</italic> mutation was found. Laminins are present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding neurons where they bind to synaptic proteins, and have been implicated in synaptic and neuromuscular junction structure and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dityatev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wlodarczyk et al., 2011</xref>). The mechanistic hypothesis was tested that there is altered synaptic activity in identified laminin β1-positive neurons in the CNS of the mutant mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Origin and motor behavior</title><p>The lamb1t mouse arose spontaneously in a WT C57Bl/6N mouse. It showed dominant inheritance: 140 out of 272 (51.5%) mice with one WT parent were symptomatic. Awakening or novel environment typically elicited dystonic movements. The most prominent was hyperextension of one or both hindlimbs that was clearly hyperkinetic. Movement and postural abnormalities also included wide-spread (extended) legs during sitting, transiently curvy tail, strong hyperextension response to swimming, and abnormal tail suspension reflexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Motor behavior in novel or stressful environments (unfamiliar tray; elevated rack) is shown in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>. When unstressed in the home cage, however, the mutant mice could walk normally, climb available structures, rear up while touching the side of the cage, and climb upside down on the food rack.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11102.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The mutant mouse had intermittent dystonic behaviors affecting hindlimbs and tail.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) During ambulation, hyperextension could affect either hindlimb or both, sometimes with inversion of the foot. When hyperextension was unilateral, some mice had a preferred side et al. switched sides. Hyperextension of hindlimbs was seen at the youngest age during locomotion, but by 4 months of age was sometimes seen at rest and sometimes was bilateral.

Symptoms normally appeared between 3 and 4 weeks of age. Young mutant mice (1–2 months old) tended to exhibit only slips, while mature mutant mice (3–6 months old) tended to have a mix of foot slips, hyperextension, and full control, and often could not stay on the beam. Traverse time and foot slip data from trials where a mouse fell were not included in the calculations, and the mouse was given another trial. (Numbers completing the task: at 4 weeks, WT 13, mutant 7; 6 and 8 weeks, WT 14, mutant 7; 12 weeks, WT 13, mutant 1; 16 weeks, WT 13, mutant 3; 23 weeks, WT 10, mutant 4.) There was no significant difference between WT and mutant in time to cross at any age (p ranged from 0.28 to 0.76). However, the data showed a significant difference in the number of foot slips during beam traverse.

In multiple comparisons, all differences were significant except male affected vs. female affected mice.

(<bold><bold>C</bold></bold>) Weight gain was initially normal in lamb1t mice, but they plateaued at 3–4 months, likely due to the metabolic demands of elevated muscle activity. Weight as a confounding variable is not often considered in rotarod testing. Plotting the rotarod data against weight showed it to be a continuous independent variable in WT males (linear regression for WT males had a significant slope [R square = 0.6299, F = 24.99, p = 0.0002]; slopes in the other groups tested non-significant).

The spinal cord has local neuronal circuits (central pattern generators) required for locomotor coordination, muscle synergy, and posture. During sleep, pons and medulla normally activate inhibitors in the spinal cord, and volatile anesthetics like isoflurane activate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The EMG activity exposed by sleep and anesthesia suggests two alternative hypotheses: that in lamb1t, the mutation results in the disinhibition of stimulatory signals descending from the brain, or that there is insufficient inhibition (descending from the brain or from spinal interneurons) to control overactive local spinal circuits.</p><p>Spinal transection under anesthesia was used to determine whether signals descending from the brain elicited or reduced the twitching and its underlying co-contraction. We performed this on six lamb1t mice and four WT.

The fact that the relaxed awake lamb1t mouse can suppress abnormalities and that arousal and stress produce dystonia-like symptoms shows that the brain’s ability to suppress or enhance the activity of spinal cord intrinsic circuits may be a fundamental feature of dystonia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Identification of the gene</title><p>Locus mapping was done in hybrids between C57Bl/6N and FVB strains using SNP markers to detect recombination events.

Like in the DCN, average rate was higher in lamb1t during normal postures, but was similar to WT, not lower, when abnormal postures were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).

Laminins are important system-wide for adhesion, migration, differentiation, and structural integrity, and they activate cell-surface integrins, syndecan, dystroglycan, and other signaling proteins via the α subunit C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hohenester and Yurchenco, 2013</xref>). System-wide and developmental effects of the dominant heterozygous mutation in lamb1t have not been detected. Any effects in heterozygotes must be subtle because of the robust health and longevity of the mouse, the post-developmental onset of motor symptoms, and their intermittent nature. Here, we discuss the significance of the genetic and structural features of the mutation; potential roles of C-terminal laminin mutations in synapses; and the implications of the results for movement disorder circuitry.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Genotype, structure, and inheritance</title><p>The 57 amino acid truncation mutation produces a dominantly inherited phenotype with ~100% penetrance. A phenotype was not exhibited by heterozygous <italic>Lamb1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yin et al., 2003</xref>). Since the heterozygotes of the knockouts and lamb1t were on the same strain background, the dominant phenotype of lamb1t must be due to assembly of altered protein rather than haploinsufficiency, suggesting a gain of function. Based on the analysis of coiled-coil propensity, the sequence predicts that the small truncation of β1 should assemble with α and γ subunits because the coiled-coil domain required for trimerization is almost intact (including residues for interchain disulfide bonds). Agrin, another important synapse-organizing ECM protein, binds to a central portion of laminin’s coiled-coil domain, and interacts with γ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kammerer et al., 1999</xref>), and that interaction may be preserved. The β1 truncation is unlikely to impair laminin trimer integration into ECM, because integration utilizes the self-polymerization domains at the N-termini of the three subunits. However, like the <italic>Lamb1</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miner et al., 2004</xref>), lamb1t mice were embryonic lethal when homozygous, so it is essential to have one good copy in early development.</p><p>Lamb1t’s mutation is at the receptor-binding end of the laminin complex, and there are some precedents for the kinds of effects it may have. Deletion of just three amino acids from the C-terminus of either γ1 or γ2 abrogated binding of laminin to the receptor integrin, as did substitution of glutamine for glutamate at the -3 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ido et al., 2007</xref>). Chimeras of the last 20 residues of laminin β1 and β2 determined selectivity among different integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). Synaptic localization of muscle-secreted laminin β2 was determined to be controlled by a 16 amino acid motif 100 residues upstream of the C-terminus, which may still be exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, the 57-residue truncation in lamb1t may alter association with cell-surface receptors and affect signaling, without necessarily affecting the structural properties of laminin in the ECM. Alternatively, the truncation may destabilize the coiled-coil domain of the complex enough to make it more sensitive to regulated extracellular proteases, changing the kinetics of protease-mediated synaptic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dityatev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wlodarczyk et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Two <italic>LAMB1</italic> mutations in humans show a genotype-structure-phenotype relationship that contrasts with lamb1t. The mutations in two consanguineous families were recessive and produced a severe developmental brain disorder when homozygous, cobblestone lissencephaly (COB), caused by defective basement lamina at the pial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Radmanesh et al., 2013</xref>). This outcome was less severe than the in utero lethality of homozygous lamb1t mutation, but similar brain dysplasia was seen in homozygous mouse knockouts of <italic>Lamb2</italic> and <italic>Lamc3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Radner et al., 2013</xref>). The COB mutations had much larger truncations (via frameshifts) than lamb1t’s, which eliminated the coiled-coil domain and would prevent trimerization if expressed. The frameshifts should also trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012</xref>), which in homozygous patients would be equivalent to knockout of <italic>LAMB1</italic>. Either problem would explain the fact that COB gene carriers in the families were asymptomatic, like the asymptomatic heterozygous <italic>Lamb1</italic> knockout mice. Given the high level of mRNA for <italic>Lamb1</italic> in choroid plexus of mice, it is of interest that the <italic>LAMB1</italic> homozygous COB patients also had hydrocephalus, likely due to impaired ECM structural integrity in the choroid plexus. We predict that if laminin mutations functionally equivalent to lamb1t are eventually found in patients, they should be limited to residues that interfere with receptor binding, but not with laminin assembly and ECM integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Laminin’s roles in synapses</title><p>ECM is a degradable structure that stabilizes neuronal circuitry, is present in the synapse, and is actively remodeled to facilitate plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dityatev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wlodarczyk et al., 2011</xref>). Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation mediated by the expansion of spines, entails remodeling of the ECM via regulated proteases. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is secreted; then plasmin cleaves laminin and activates matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9); then MMP-9 digests a laminin receptor, dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wlodarczyk et al., 2011</xref>). If this is facilitated by the lamb1t mutation, it may support evidence that synaptic plasticity is increased in dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quartarone and Pisani, 2011</xref>)</p><p>Laminin is well-studied for its role in controlling neuromuscular junction formation and ultrastructure at least partly through the receptor-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishimune et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Singhal and Martin, 2011</xref>). For example, laminins with β2 (<italic>Lamb2</italic>) complex with voltage-gated calcium channels to organize active zones, and signal through dystroglycan to modify neuromuscular junction structure and stability. Much is still to be learned about laminin β1 in the CNS, but synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2) is a presynaptic ECM receptor, and binds laminins with β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Son et al., 2000</xref>). One lab has produced mechanistic evidence for a role for laminin β1 in synaptic plasticity. Molecular mechanisms of learning and memory were investigated by gene manipulation in vivo in rat hippocampus in combination with water maze testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Maze learning decreased laminin β1, and conversely laminin β1 overexpression impaired maze performance. Pertinent to the signaling function of laminins, laminin β1 impaired learning through activation of ERK/MAPK and SGK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). A plasticity cascade entails JAK/STAT activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nicolas et al., 2012</xref>). Maze learning downregulated STAT1, and STAT1 overexpression impaired maze learning while strongly upregulating <italic>Lamb1</italic>. In a crucial experiment, the effect of STAT1 on maze performance was blocked by siRNA for <italic>Lamb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>). Changes in NMDA receptor subunits were upstream of STAT1. This predicts that laminin β1 is in the middle or end of a synaptic plasticity cascade.</p><p>The evidence in this report does not prove that the C-terminal truncation in laminin β1 affects synaptic plasticity; however, the altered firing patterns detected in deep nuclei in the cerebellum provide strong cellular evidence for an effect on synapse function or organization. Very similar irregular firing was seen in both DCN and Purkinje cells in a pharmacological model of <italic>ATP1A3</italic> dystonia (Dyt12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fremont et al., 2014</xref>). DCN neurons also had neuropathology in rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism specimens (<italic>ATP1A3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oblak et al., 2014</xref>), and they are the source of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical tracts that show alterations in <italic>TOR1A, THAP1,</italic> and <italic>ATP1A3</italic> dystonia patients by diffusion tensor imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Argyelan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lehéricy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whitlow et al., 2012</xref>). In lamb1t, the irregular firing of DCN neurons could be caused by an increase in the efficacy of inhibitory Purkinje cell-to-DCN synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Angelo, 2014</xref>). The detected abnormalities of a synapse in lamb1t support a role for cerebellar abnormalities in dystonic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fremont et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson and Hess, 2013</xref>).

Identification of <italic>Lamb1</italic>-positive neurons and their interactions will be a first step to investigating the underlying mechanisms, as begun here with cerebellar recordings.</p><p>Do the dystonia-like symptoms of lamb1t represent dystonia as understood clinically? Four theoretical frameworks coexist in human and animal dystonia research: roles for the basal ganglia, cerebellum, motor areas and the pathways that connect them; alterations in sensorimotor integration; reductions in neuronal inhibition; and increases in the potentiation side of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berardelli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breakefield et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lehéricy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neychev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quartarone and Hallett, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quartarone and Pisani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanabe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). None of these mechanistic aspects can be ruled out in the lamb1t mouse, and the possibility that the laminin β1 truncation affects synapse organization and plasticity is compatible with all. The post-development onset, slow progression, and plateau of symptoms resembles progression and stabilization in human dystonias. The ability to overcome symptoms resembles the human ability to use sensory tricks, such as touching the face, to temporarily overcome dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramos et al., 2014</xref>). However, in dystonic humans, a rapid alternation of affected muscle groups is unlikely, as seen here when mice switch affected hindlimbs. Furthermore, while electromyographic (EMG) activity persists in sleep in a few forms of human dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sforza et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stamelou et al., 2012</xref>), it is not typical. Research on focal dystonia patients suggests altered spinal reflexes and failure of reciprocal inhibition in spinal circuits as the immediate cause of co-contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berardelli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Panizza et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sabbahi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanabe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). Patient research also indicates a role for the brain to supply inhibitory instructions to spinal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berardelli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hallett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quartarone and Hallett, 2013</xref>). These aspects are consistent with traits of the lamb1t mouse, and share with it the convergence of abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord. However, CNS lesions causing human secondary dystonia tend to be in basal ganglia and their connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). This would be conceptually consistent with the lamb1t mouse’s characteristics if typical dystonia-causing human lesions damage the ability of the brain to control (inhibit) circuits in the spinal cord.</p><p>The hindlimb locus of lamb1t symptoms may be characteristic of the species: hindlimbs have a dominant place in sensorimotor cerebellar integration in mice compared to primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Logan and Robertson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raike et al., 2013</xref>), and hindlimb symptoms are also prominent in other rodent non-paroxysmal dystonia models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">LeDoux, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanabe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weisheit and Dauer, 2015</xref>). The lack of overt dystonic symptoms in mouse models with engineered dominantly inherited human dystonia mutations may be also influenced by a higher level of automaticity of the control of spinal cord in rodents relative to primates, requiring a stronger spinal physiological abnormality to allow manifestation of symptoms more obvious than hindlimb slips.</p><p>The presence of <italic>Lamb1</italic>-expressing neurons in the spinal cord presumably underlies the observed abnormal spinal circuit activity. Neurons that express <italic>Lamb1</italic> in dorsal horn may mediate sensory input, or may regulate propriospinal circuits that produce reflexes, coordinate muscles, or stabilize posture. If DRG neurons express <italic>Lamb1</italic> in adults, aberrant sensory input could also have a role. Caution should be used before assuming that the causative functional defect is in the spinal cord, however, because one fundamental way that motor output is controlled is gradual enhancement of spinal reflex strength by the brain via descending signals, causing long-term scaling changes in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Spinal circuit abnormalities might accrue slowly secondary to a primary defect in the brain. This would be congruent with slow symptom progression in the mouse, and brain–spinal cord interaction might underlie the slow therapeutic response to deep brain stimulation in patients.</p><p>Available data ruled out other diagnoses such as myotonia, neuromyotonia, neuropathy, or muscular dystrophy. The features of lamb1t mice are <italic>ab initio</italic> different from spasticity (a form of hypertonicity, clinically defined as velocity-dependent resistance to muscle stretch). In spinal injury or upper motor neuron disease, spasticity results from spinal reflex changes secondary to missing input from upper motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheean, 2002</xref>). Here, there was never paralysis preceding onset of dystonic symptoms; the mice could run voluntarily; and the symptoms were intermittent. It remains to be seen, however, whether abnormalities in descending inhibition, for example in the output of the pontine inhibitory region, can elicit spasticity-like changes in the spinal cord. Changes in spinal circuits (such as the serotonin supersensitivity of coordinated muscle activation by central pattern generators in spasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Husch et al., 2012</xref>]) could be endophenotypes that are actually shared by dystonia and spasticity, globally or focally. Clinical spasticity can also be accompanied by spasms of muscle contraction, which are potentially related to the motor unit-driven twitches seen in lamb1t under sleep and anesthesia. At this stage, the relationship of the lamb1t mouse to human dystonia is tentative, but supported by a compatible distribution of gene expression in subcortical motor circuits (and not in motor neurons), and by empirical similarities that are likely to reflect shared cellular mechanisms.</p><p>There is a common premise that basal ganglia and brainstem select the muscles that co-contract in dystonia, for example by reducing the inhibition of competing pattern generators in pallidum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mink, 2003</xref>), but this mouse presents evidence for a modified perspective. Although the basal ganglia may control the inhibition of unwanted activity, overactive pattern generators in the spinal cord appear to be the proximal cause of co-contraction in lamb1t. It is likely that some spinal central pattern generator circuits normally generate co-contraction, such as for postural control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blood, 2008</xref>), just as others generate alternating contraction for locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Lamb1t’s aberrant spinal activity may be essential for its manifestation of dystonic movements and postures. In awake lamb1t mice, we predict that the lapses in motor control that produce dystonic movements are failures (due to mutation) of supraspinal inhibitory control originating in familiar dystonia circuits, and modulated by arousal or stress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Origin and breeding</title><p>All animal research followed the NRC <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> and the policies of the Massachusetts General Hospital or Albert Einstein College of Medicine: MGH IACUC approved protocol 2011N000108, and Albert Einstein approved protocol 20130801. The lamb1t mouse arose in a colony carrying a knockout allele for an unrelated gene, <italic>Fxyd2</italic>. The strain (B6N.129(Cg)-Fxyd2<sup>tm1Kdr</sup>) had been obtained from G.M. Kidder (Univ. of Western Ontario) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). We had back-crossed the colony to C57BL/6NCrl (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) for six generations (currently 12 generations) and het x het matings produced WT, het, and <italic>Fxyd2</italic> KO littermates. The lamb1t proband was WT for <italic>Fxyd2</italic>, and was the only symptomatic mouse among 29 siblings. We segregated the dystonic proband and descendants as a separate colony without the <italic>Fxyd2</italic> gene modification. Dominant inheritance was readily established by breeding with WT C57Bl/6NCrl mice. Every new generation was produced from colony members mated with WTs obtained from the supplier, and because penetrance remained 100% through six generations, it is evident that the phenotype is monogenic on the C57Bl/6NCrl background. The strain name for lamb1t is proposed to be B6N-Lamb1<sup>tr57/Swea</sup>.</p><p>Mice were housed in ventilated racks on a 12-hr light-dark cycle. Ear punches were collected under isoflurane anesthesia at weaning both to mark individuals and as a source of DNA for genotyping. Both sexes bred with a success rate equivalent to other C57Bl/6 colonies housed in the same room, in contrast with the reduced breeding success of the <italic>Fxyd2</italic> strain, which has pancreatic islet β cell hyperplasia and elevated insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arystarkhova et al., 2013</xref>). Longevity was not affected by the mutation: we observed the proband and two male sibs for 2 ½ years, and others for &gt;12 months.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral tests</title><p>All behavioral tests were approved by the IACUC of the Massachusetts General Hospital. We performed all experiments between 2 pm and 7 pm except sleep observations, which were from 8 am to 3 pm. For gait analysis, a DigiGait apparatus (Mouse Specifics, Framingham, MA) was used for ventral plane videography of mouse gait kinematics on a moving transparent treadmill belt. Mice were tested in late afternoon close to the beginning of the active period. Each mouse was given 4–6 trials at 15 cm/s, a relatively slow treadmill speed even compared to mice with ethanol or basal ganglia toxin-induced gait impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amende et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kale et al., 2004</xref>). The balance beam was a 120 cm rectangular rod 1.6 cm in width held 30 cm above the padded surface, resting at one end on the edge of the home cage, which was shaded with a dark box. The accelerating Rotarod test (Rotamex, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) entailed accelerating the rod from 4 rpm to 40 rpm over 180 s. Mice were trained for 2 days, 2 trials per day, with a 5-min break between trials. The results of the two trials were recorded on the third day. To test swimming speed, we developed a test that was named Olympic pool. A 86 x 46 cm plastic storage box (Sterilite 1764; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) was divided into four equal lanes with opaque plastic dividers, and a 5-cm-wide submerged Styrofoam platform was fastened at one end of each lane. The pool was filled with room temperature water 20 cm deep, just over the platform. The starting point was marked so that the total length for mice to swim was 71 cm (28”). Training consisted of putting the mouse in the water at the opposite end once and allowing it to find the platform. On subsequent trials they would swim to it in seconds, and the measured parameter was swimming speed. For activity analysis, we used an OPTO-Varimex Minor activity meter (Columbus Instruments) to monitor activity for 10 min by optical beam-breaks, using an empty rat cage (37 x 25 x 19 cm) as the chamber. Mice were introduced to the activity chamber as a novel environment, and beam-breaks were recorded for the first 10 min. The groups were matched for average age (WT average 130 ± 27 days; mutant 127 ± 28). WT mice were 11% heavier than lamb1t in males and 5% heavier in females. To detect impairment of forelimb function, the adhesive removal test was performed, in which a sticky square (5 mm squares of Post-it) was applied to the forehead. The time to brush it off was recorded (with a 60 s cut-off), and two trials were averaged. Replicate trials of individuals were combined and averaged. To assess grip strength and skill, a food rack from a rat cage was prepared by covering the edges with a 3-cm-wide masking tape to prevent mice from climbing to the top. Each mouse was placed in the middle and the rack was shaken laterally three times to make them grip it well. It was then inverted 30 cm above a well-padded surface. The time spent clinging to (or climbing around on) the rack was recorded, and the test was terminated after 60 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA). Genetics data were parametric and analyzed by Student’s two-tailed t-test. Behavioral experiments were not designed a priori for parametric statistical analysis because, besides normal sources of variance, there was additional variance stemming from lamb1t’s responses to stress and their ability to also bring motor behavior under control. The behavioral performance of the mutant was sometimes neither normally distributed nor of equal variance compared to WT, often in the tests measuring obvious abnormalities. All the available mice of appropriate age were tested since there was no ethical reason to limit group size. Statistical significance was estimated using two-way ANOVA followed by software-provided post-hoc multiple comparison tests, or two-tailed independent Student’s t-test, and considered significant at p&lt;0.05. Where error bars are shown, compiled data are reported as means ± SEM. Where variance was large, the data are shown as scatter plots. No outlying data points were excluded except in two cases: when a mouse was unable to stay on the elevated beam at all, and on the rotarod, when a mouse turned around to face the wrong way. All replicates were biological replicates; when duplicate trials of individuals were averaged and used as single data points, it is stated in the legend. Because the lamb1t symptoms in the C57Bl/6N strain background are obvious, it was not possible to perform behavioral tests blinded. Although we used many of the behavioral tests on B6/FVB hybrids to assess phenotype, only C57Bl/6N strain results are presented here, except that hybrids were also included for observations of hindlimb activity during sleep. Cerebellar neuron firing rates were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test, and data are reported as mean ± SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Genetics</title><p>For mapping the locus of the gene, we generated hybrids between mouse strains. FVB/NCrl (Charles River Laboratories) was selected because of an adequate number of different SNPs, and FVB's robust breeding ability. N1 hybrids were generated using either female or male B6 mutants paired with FVB mates. Following that, symptomatic hybrids were bred successively to FVB mice, producing N2 to N4 generations. In addition, N3 mice were intercrossed (N3F1) and backcrossed again (N3F1N1).</p><p>In the hybrids, symptoms were not as easy to detect, and so they were subjected to a battery of tests from 3 to 8 weeks of age, and scored for the presence and repeatability of symptoms. The criteria were display of symptoms upon awakening; during tail suspension; on the balance beam; during sleep; during isoflurane anesthesia; during a 30 s swim; and after vibration of the knee joint. Vibration was administered with a battery-operated fingernail polisher (Nail Wizard) with plastic tubing to cushion the tip. Cumulative scores were used to rank hybrid mice as moderately affected, weakly affected, or no detectable symptoms.</p><p>We submitted DNA from symptomatic hybrids (17 N2 and 7 N3F1N1 individuals) for SNP mapping to identify the locus. SNP mapping of recombinations was performed on the Illumina mouse medium density linkage panel of 1449 SNPs at the Centre for Applied Genomics at SickKids, University of Toronto. 833 of the SNPs on the panel differed between C57Bl/6 and FVB strains. Through six successive generations of backcross to FVB, 157 out of 302 mice on the hybrid background were <italic>Lamb1</italic> mutant as determined by SNP mapping or AS-PCR, indicating no in utero lethality for heterozygotes.</p><p>Exome sequencing was performed to detect variants (point mutations and small indels) that might be causative. Genomic DNA was purified with the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit. Exome DNA was captured with the Agilent SureSelect Mouse All Exon system, and exome sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. Variants were called using GATK software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DePristo et al., 2011</xref>). Post-sequence analysis and variant calling was conducted by ContigExpress (New York, NY). Sequence surrounding the only non-synonymous coding variant in the locus was captured by PCR from each candidate mouse separately with the following primers: F- GCAGACTCTAGATGGCGAACTT, R- TGTAGATGACTGCCTCGGTTT, and purified with the Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification kit. Sanger sequencing was performed at the DNA Core of the Center for Computational and Integrative Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital. Note that an upstream methionine in the reference sequence NM_008482 may be incorrectly identified as the initiation methionine; we numbered the residues from the second methionine corresponding with other species.</p><p>Allele-specific PCR primers for <italic>Lamb1</italic> mutation at T5460A were designed with the help of BatchPrimer3 V. 1.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://probes.pw.usda.gov/batchprimer3/">http://probes.pw.usda.gov/batchprimer3/</ext-link>). Allele-specific primers utilized 26 bases upstream and 20 bases downstream of the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The genotyping PCR reaction was done with ear punch or tail tip tissue, using the REDExtract-N-Amp tissue PCR kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with half the recommended volumes. Thermal cycling was in thin-walled tubes (Molecular BioProducts, Fisher Scientific) capped with mineral oil, in an MJ Research PTC-100 thermal cycler. The conditions were 3 min 95<sup>o</sup>C, 32 cycles of 30 s 95<sup>o</sup>C denaturation, 30 s 63<sup>o</sup>C annealing, 30 s 72<sup>o</sup>C extension, and 2 min 72<sup>o</sup>C, and the products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gels. Relatively high annealing temperature was essential for allele specificity, although it reduced yield. The primer set used for routine genotyping of litters with WT and obligatory heterozygote pups were F-outside, GCCCAAGTACTTTGATATTCCTC; R-outside, TTTCACAAGTTCATCTCCACAGA, and R-mutant, GCTTGCTGTTAGCTTGAGCCT. Reactions of (F-outside + R-outside) and (F-outside + R-mutant) were run in separate tubes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Protein analysis</title><p>Choroid plexus was dissected under a microscope from brains submerged in ice-cold Dulbecco’s PBS. It was taken from lateral ventricle using #5 forceps after dorsal incision through the corpus callosum to access the ventricles, and from 4<sup>th</sup> ventricle by rostrally folding the cerebellum back from the brainstem. Because laminin is an ECM protein, crude homogenates of the choroid plexus, cerebellum, and sciatic nerve were used for analysis of the protein on immunoblots. The buffer was 250 mM sucrose, 20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2 containing 1 Roche protease inhibitor tablet per 50 ml, and homogenization was with a small Tenbroeck homogenizer on ice. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Gel electrophoresis was with NuPage 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient MES gels (Life Technologies). Twenty-five microgam of protein was loaded per lane from WT or lamb1t. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and stained with laminin β1-specific antibody (LTE) from NeoMarkers at a dilution of 1:500, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.

Nerve conduction velocity was measured in mice anesthetized using a constant inhaled mixture of oxygen and isoflurane administered by a VetEquip instrument through a nose cone. Animals were placed on a heating pad to maintain their core temperature at 37°C. Hind legs were shaved with a razor and then cleaned using alcohol pads. A pair of monopolar disposable 28G needle electrodes and ring electrodes (CareFusion) were lightly coated with electrode gel (SignaGel) and used for stimulation and recording, respectively. The active recording ring electrode was placed over the gastrocnemius muscle, with the reference electrode over the tendon. The stimulating cathode was placed 5 mm proximal to the recording electrode in the midline of the posterior thigh. The anode was placed subcutaneously in the midline over the sacrum. A surface electrode (CareFusion) was grounded on the mouse’s tail. We performed the studies using a portable electrodiagnostic system (Cardinal Synergy). For the motor nerve conduction studies, the low-pass filter was set at 30 Hz, and the high-pass filter was set at 10 kHz. The nerve was stimulated with single square-wave pulses of 0.1 ms duration. Supramaximal responses were gradually generated, and maximal responses were obtained with stimulus currents &lt;20 mA (most often &lt;10 mA). The distance between distal and proximal stimulation sites was measured with a millimeter-graduated tape measure. Data were acquired with a sensitivity of 20 mV/division and sweep speed of 3 ms/division. The distal latency, distal and proximal compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitudes, distal and proximal CMAP durations (measured from onset of initial negative deflection to initial return to baseline), and conduction velocity were determined for each nerve studied.</p><p>A tail immersion test was used to assess the nociceptive reflex. Naive mice were held above a water bath at 51<sup>o</sup>C, sitting unrestrained on the top of the hand with the tail pointing down and held in position between two fingers. Then, 1.5–2 cm of the tail was immersed, and the latency to flick it out of the water was recorded.</p><p>Sections of sciatic nerve were fixed in fresh periodate-lysine-paraformaldehye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McLean and Nakane, 1974</xref>), washed with Dulbecco’s PBS and infiltrated with 30% sucrose (30 g up to 100 ml), cut with a cryostat, then stained with 0.2% toluidine blue and examined with a Nikon Diaphot inverted phase-contrast microscope without phase ring. Additional samples were fixed with formalin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin with comparable results.</p><p>Two-needle EMG was performed in anesthetized mice as described above for nerve conduction velocity. A ground self-adhesive gelled surface electrode was placed over the tail. Potentials were recorded from several sites of the hindlimb muscles with concentric needle electrodes (30G) using a gain of 50 µV/division and a band-pass filter with low and high cut-off frequency settings of 10 or 20 and 10,000 Hz, respectively. The entire recording process took 20–30 min per mouse. EMG recordings were done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xia et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Spinal transection was performed under continuous controlled isoflurane/oxygen anesthesia as above. The top of the spine was exposed by dissection, a laminectomy was performed at L1 to L3 with sharp scissors, and the spinal cord was transected with a narrow scalpel. Motor responses under constant anesthesia were observed and filmed for up to 2 min, and euthanasia was then performed by increasing the isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation. We verified completeness of the transection by inspection after death.</p><p>For in vivo electrophysiology, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and implanted with a custom-made L-shaped metal bracket fixed onto the skull with three bone screws (Plastics one Inc.) and dental cement (M&amp;S Dental Supply). A recording area 2 mm wide was drilled in the skull on top of the cerebellum at AP: −6.25 mm; ML: ± 1.7 mm. The recording area was surrounded with dental cement and covered with surgifoam and bone wax (Ethicon). Mice were allowed to recover 24 hr before recording sessions. For recordings, the mouse was immobilized by fixing the head bracket with a screw attached to the stereotaxic frame. The bone wax and surgifoam were removed from the recording area. Single-unit neural activity was recorded extracellularly in awake head-restrained mice using a carbon fiber electrode (Kation Scientific, 0.4–1.2 MΩ). The electrode was advanced into the cerebellum to target the Purkinje cells and neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Cell types were identified based on location and the presence of complex spikes in Purkinje cells. Signals were band-pass filtered (200 Hz-20 kHz), amplified (2000 x), and digitized (20 kHz). Waveforms were sorted offline (Plexon) using principal component analysis. During recordings the mouse was closely monitored. Abnormal postures could clearly be seen and these periods were noted. Cells recorded during these episodes were noted as 'abnormal postures', while all other cells recorded when the mouse did not show abnormal postures were categorized as 'no postures'.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Supported by US Department of Defense grant PR100747 and US National Institutes of Health grant NS081558 to K.J.S.; NS050808 and NS079750 to K.K.; and NS058949 and NS058949S1 to A.B., K.J.S., L.J.O., and K.K..

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we are unable to publish your work in its current form but we are open to publishing the paper if you address the key points raised by the reviewers. We realize that the issues raised should be straightforward to address but they are likely to take more than the two months that we usually allow for revisions.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors propose a new mutant mouse model of dystonia-like symptoms. Mapping and exome sequencing revealed a mutation in the <italic>Lamb1</italic> gene. They provide extensive behavioral phenotyping of the mice. Electrophysiological experiments detected irregular firing from a circuit of 2 <italic>Lamb1</italic>-expressing neurons, Purkinje cells and their deep cerebellar nucleus targets.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This mouse seems to be a good model for dystonia-like symptoms. A fair amount is known about <italic>lamb1</italic> including it's having a role in synapse structure and plasticity. The reviewers appreciate the important work included in this manuscript but felt that additional electrophysiological data or molecular data would significantly strengthen the paper. In the spirit of not asking for extensive additional experiments, discussion between reviewers led to a consensus that one of the following would be sufficient:</p><p>1) Physiology: Recording of activity of DCN and Purkinje neurons while the animals were experiencing dystonic symptoms and to correlate the physiological findings with the behavior. This could provide some cellular insight in the described dysfunction.</p><p>2) Molecular: Providing direct evidence that any of observed features are related to impaired integrin signaling/adhesion to integrin receptors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> The authors describe a new mutant mouse, <italic>lamb1</italic>, which has multiple motor abnormalities, many if not most of which are typically associated with dystonia. The model has many parallels to the human disorder of dystonia, with childhood onset, initially progressive then later stable symptoms, stress and action-induced symptoms, and gait abnormalities. The manuscript's strengths include the large number of behavioral assays included, the relatively large number of animals used in these assays, controls for peripheral nervous system involvement, and the inclusion of very helpful videos.</p><p>1) The article is written clearly, but in clinical language that might be harder for a non-clinician basic scientist to understand or appreciate. I think the gestalt of the phenotype (multiple motor manifestations of involuntary movement) is more important to convey than the nitty-gritty details of the clinical phenotype. Though it is important to mention the lack of certain features (neuropathy, myotonia), these terms could alienate the non-clinician and prevent them from understanding the gestalt.</p><p>2) While the relatively conservative interpretations provided by the authors are very reasonable, in many places the results could be framed in a larger context (even without overinterpretation of the data) and thus make the findings more interesting and thought-provoking to other scientists in the field, especially to those trying to understand the normal function of motor circuitry (such as basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem/spinal cord).</p><p>3) The authors could convey the importance of this work better by highlighting the lack of phenotypically penetrant mouse models of dystonia. This model would provide one of the very few available to test circuit and cellular/molecular hypotheses regarding the mechanism of dystonia generation. The Introduction would benefit from putting their discoveries in this context. It also would be useful to put some of the material currently in the Discussion into the Introduction instead (i.e. some of the basic information regarding laminin and its role in synapses) so as to give the basic scientist a larger framework for interpreting their data.</p><p>4) The beam test in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> was presented very well, showing the development of the phenotype with age. However, the authors do not mention or include in the figure whether the phenotype is present even earlier, as in 2 weeks of age. If this data was collected, it would be very interesting to include.</p><p>5) I found the reproduction of expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas odd. I think this previous work could either be cited in the text or the authors could reproduce the key findings themselves in their model. The authors could instead schematize the high-expression regions if they think it is important to show this visually. Also, the authors make vague statements about the striatal expression of <italic>lamb1</italic> – in what interneuron population do they believe it is expressed? If they have a hypothesis, they should test this directly by colabeling for the standard interneuron markers (NPY, parvalbumin, SST, calretinin, choline acetyltransferase).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> This study describes a mouse mutant with truncated beta1 laminin. Mice exhibit intermittent dystonic hindlimb movements and postures. The authors ruled out other diagnoses such as myotonia, neuromyotonia, neuropathy, muscular dystrophy, and spasticity. Recordings in awake mice revealed irregular firing from deep cerebellar nucleus neurons.</p><p>Although this study is very interesting from phenomenological point of view and clinical relevance, and offers a stimulating discussion of possible molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these phenomena, it does not address any mechanisms. The impact of study could be significantly increased (in a short time) by providing direct evidence that any of observed features are related to impaired integrin signaling/adhesion to integrin receptors and/or by demonstration of altered synaptic plasticity at synapses between Purkinje cells and their deep cerebellar nucleus targets.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> The authors developed and proposed a new <italic>Lamb1</italic> mouse for dystonia-like movement disorder model. Motor behavior tests were well performed and showed dystonic behaviors in <italic>Lamb1</italic> mice; however, mutant mice do not demonstrate some typical abnormal myotonia. The conclusions drawn from the results are a bit unclear. A comparative immunohistochemistry of <italic>Lamb1</italic> between WT and mutant mice is highly recommended, not just reproduced. Without IHC results of mutant mice, value of this paper will be largely diminished. The manuscript should also be reconstructed to avoid mix-up results, figure legends and discussions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11102.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>For essential revisions, we addressed point 1, Physiology. We now present electrophysiological recordings of the mutant mice while they were and were not experiencing dystonic symptoms. This showed that the abnormal firing occurred during the symptoms and not in their absence. As a result, the corresponding figure was completely restructured, and we have added a table so that the reader can more readily compare and evaluate the expanded data and statistics. The figure shows box and whisker plots with medians, as suggested by a reviewer, while the table presents the means.

Also ABA data sometimes disappears, to be replaced by new samples, and some of those are not as good.

Laminin IHC is also notoriously hard to obtain for two reasons: the native protein is not very immunogenic because the exposed structures are extracellular, and staining is diffuse, again because laminin is secreted and deployed to the matrix between cells. The published work (L Gudas) used a beta-galactosidase-expressing mouse that does not exist anymore. What we plan going forward is to utilize genetically-modified mice to label the neurons for experiments to identify subclasses of neurons that express laminin β1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
