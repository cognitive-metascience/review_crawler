The Golgi apparatus is the central sorting and modification station of transmembrane and secretory proteins and has a perinuclear localization in interphase mammalian cells. The integrity and position of the Golgi complex are primarily governed by the microtubule network, with a smaller contribution of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allan et al., 2002</xref>). Microtubules are also implicated in the transport of vesicles from the Golgi and localized exocytosis. Furthermore, during directed migration of cells, microtubule remodeling positions the Golgi complex towards the leading edge to support polarized transport and is further required for the rapid turnover of focal adhesions (FAs) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaverina and Straube, 2011</xref>]). The crosstalk between microtubules and the Golgi complex is coordinated by signaling factors including small GTPases such as Cdc42, Arf1, and Rho and their respective GEF and GAP proteins (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Millarte and Farhan, 2012</xref>]). For example, Arf1-mediated recruitment of the Cdc42-specific GAP ARHGAP21 (ARHGAP10) to Golgi membranes controls Cdc42 activity and microtubule-dependent positioning of the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubois et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hehnly et al., 2010</xref>). Although Rho hyperactivation has been reported to lead to Golgi complex fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zilberman et al., 2011</xref>), the physiological relevance of this observation is not clear. ARHGEF2/GEF-H1 is a RhoGEF that is sequestered by microtubules and it is further regulated downstream of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meiri et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2014</xref>) and ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guilluy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kakiashvili et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scott et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waheed et al., 2010</xref>). GEF-H1 has been involved in exocytosis at the plasma membrane, FA turnover, response to mechanical forces, cell migration, and cell polarity (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pathak and Dermardirossian, 2013</xref>]), however, so far it has not been connected to vesicle fission at the Golgi complex.</p><p>The protein kinase D (PKD) family of serine/threonine kinases consisting of PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 in mammals is enriched at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) where it coordinates the fission of vesicles destined for the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liljedahl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malhotra and Campelo, 2011</xref>). PKD is recruited to and activated at the TGN by the interaction with diacylglycerol (DAG) and Arf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baron and Malhotra, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pusapati et al., 2010</xref>) and through direct phosphorylation by PKCη (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Díaz Añel and Malhotra, 2005</xref>). Because the level of DAG in TGN membranes controls the localization and activity of PKD, the pathways contributing to the local production of DAG are critical regulators of PKD-dependent transport carrier formation. For example, PKD phosphorylates and activates the lipid kinase PI4KIIIβ thereby increasing PtdIns(4)P levels at the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hausser et al., 2005</xref>). This, in turn, recruits the ceramide transfer protein CERT from the ER to the Golgi membranes, where CERT contributes to PKD activation by providing ceramide as a precursor for further DAG production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fugmann et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, the family of PI-PLC enzymes, which generate DAG and inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) through the hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,<italic>5</italic>)P<sub>2</sub>, are implicated in PKD activation downstream of Gβγ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bard and Malhotra, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Díaz Añel, 2007</xref>). We previously reported that Golgi-localized PKD activity is enhanced by drug-induced microtubule depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuchs et al., 2009</xref>) but how the microtubule network signaled to the TGN remained elusive. Here, we identify GEF-H1 to mediate PKD activation at the TGN upon nocodazole-induced release from microtubules. We provide evidence that GEF-H1 signals through RhoA and PLCε to control steady state and also G-Protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-induced activity of PKD at the TGN membranes. Most importantly, we show that at the TGN, PKD activated downstream of Rho stimulates the fission of Rab6-positive exocytic carriers delivering cargo to FAs. Consequently, through GEF-H1, the microtubule network controls anterograde trafficking from the TGN.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RhoA activates PKD at the TGN</title><p>Nocodazole is a strong activator of PKD at TGN membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuchs et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the microtubule network not only plays a structural role in maintaining Golgi complex position and shape but also signals to the Golgi complex to coordinate its function. Microtubule disruption was described to release the microtubule-associated RhoGEF GEF-H1 leading to the activation of the Rho GTPases RhoA and RhoB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnette et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore first analyzed whether RhoA can activate PKD at the TGN. To do so, we employed a Golgi-localized PKD activity reporter previously developed in our lab, termed G-PKDrep, which specifically detects PKD activity at the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuchs et al., 2009</xref>). When cells expressed constitutive active RhoA Q63L, the reporter phosphorylation and thus PKD activity significantly increased up to twofold (0.2284 (median control)) versus 0.4826 (median RhoA Q63L)) whereas expression of wild type (wt) RhoA had no effect compared to the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). As reported previously, expression of RhoA Q63L resulted in Golgi fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zilberman et al., 2011</xref>) and stress fiber formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). In support of a local role for RhoA in the activation of PKD we could detect GFP-tagged RhoA Q63L at TGN membranes indicated by the co-localization with the trans-Golgi marker p230 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, active RhoB Q63L localized to the TGN and activated PKD at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). We further quantified the co-localization of RhoA and RhoB with Rab6, a TGN-localized Rab GTPase involved in the fission of transport carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miserey-Lenkei et al., 2010</xref>), using the Manders’ coefficient. Indeed, the co-localization of constitutive active RhoA and RhoB with Rab6 was significantly higher when compared to their wild-type counterparts, further supporting a role for active Rho at TGN membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35907.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RhoA activates PKD at the TGN.</title><p>HeLa cells were transfected with G-PKDrep plus control vector, or a plasmid encoding HA-tagged RhoA wt or RhoA Q63L.

With increasing microtubule depolymerization, GEF-H1 is released and free to activate Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnette et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2008</xref>). To examine whether GEF-H1 is responsible for mediating PKD activation downstream of RhoA, we knocked down GEF-H1 using two independent siRNAs. Indeed, in GEF-H1-depleted cells nocodazole-induced PKD activation was strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). GEF-H1 can be activated downstream of ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fujishiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guilluy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kakiashvili et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waheed et al., 2010</xref>). In HEK293T cells, nocodazole treatment strongly induced the MAPK pathway. Simultaneous MEK1/2 inhibition, however, did not impair phosphorylation of PKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) proving that GEF-H1-mediated PKD activation is independent of ERK. In agreement with our GEF-H1 depletion results, expression of GEF-H1 wt and GEF-H1 C53R, a mutant that does not bind microtubules and is thus constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krendel et al., 2002</xref>), was sufficient to activate PKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Of note, GEF-H1 C53R induced PKD activation was stronger compared to GEF-H1 wt. Analogous to the expression of active RhoA, expression of GEF-H1 C53R induced fragmentation of the Golgi complex whereas in cells expressing GEF-H1 wt the Golgi complex remained compact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To corroborate the GEF-H1-induced PKD activation at the TGN we again used G-PKDrep. In cells expressing GEF-H1 wt, the reporter phosphorylation was significantly enhanced compared to the control cells without ectopic GEF-H1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In agreement with the quantitative Western Blot results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), reporter phosphorylation was stronger in the case of GEF-H1 C53R expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35907.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nocodazole-mediated PKD activation at the TGN requires GEF-H1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK293T cells were transfected with spGEF-H1, spNT was used as a control.

We thus investigated whether PLCε was involved in PKD activation. Indeed, depletion of PLCε using independent siRNAs significantly reduced RhoA-mediated PKD activation at the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A and B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, in cells depleted of PLCε, nocodazole treatment no longer resulted in the PKD activation seen in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that PLCε is downstream of RhoA in PKD activation at Golgi membranes. To address whether the GEF-H1 dependent PKD activation requires PLCε, we expressed GEF-H1 C53R in cells depleted of PLCε and monitored PKD activity by Western blot analysis. In control cells, GEF-H1 C53R potently activated PKD whereas the loss of PLCε diminished the GEF-H1 C53R-mediated PKD activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Because PLCε is responsible for the production of DAG, we reasoned that PLCε should also be involved in the maintenance of basal PKD activity at Golgi membranes. To test this assumption, we quantitatively analyzed the subcellular localization of a kinase-dead PKD1-GFP fusion protein commonly used as a sensor for DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baron and Malhotra, 2002</xref>) by measuring its fluorescence intensity at the Golgi complex and in the cytoplasm. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (top), PKD1kd was enriched at Golgi membranes and a smaller portion was also present in the cytosol. Quantification revealed that in cells depleted of PLCε, the amount of PKD1kd at Golgi membranes was reduced compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom). This suggests that the loss of PLCε decreases DAG at and thus PKD localization to Golgi membranes. Consequently, basal PKD activity should be dependent on PLCε as well. Indeed, quantitative measurement of G-PKDrep phosphorylation revealed that PLCε depletion led to a modest but significant reduction in PKD activity at TGN membranes compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).

The docking and fusion of Rab6 vesicles within the plasma membrane occurred preferentially near FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stehbens et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, Rab6-positive vesicles exit the Golgi at fission hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miserey-Lenkei et al., 2017</xref>). We thus speculated that the Rho-PKD signaling pathway might control the exit of Rab6 vesicles from the TGN and thus the localized delivery of these vesicles to FAs. To address this we performed TIRF analysis of HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged Rab6A and DsRed2-tagged paxillin. We monitored the arrival of Rab6A vesicles in the vicinity of DsRed2-paxillin in cells transfected with a control siRNA (spNT), and in cells depleted of GEF-H1, PLCε, and PKD2 together with PKD3, respectively. As previously reported, in control cells Rab6A vesicles arrived at membrane domains proximal to FAs, stalled for a short period of time and then rapidly disappeared. Loss of GEF-H1, PLCε, or PKD2/PKD3, however, significantly decreased the number of Rab6A-positive vesicles arriving at FAs, with cells depleted of the two PKD isoforms showing the strongest effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—Video 1</xref>). Of note, the total number of FAs per cell was not affected by the loss of any of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, the depletion of GEF-H1 resulted in an upregulation of PLCε mRNA levels supporting the molecular connection of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Whether protein levels are also enhanced remains unknown because we could not detect PLCε by Western blot analysis. Notably, depletion of DLC3 slightly decreased the number of vesicles arriving at FAs compared to control cells although PKD activity was increased under these conditions (data not shown). However, as DLC3 depletion induced the fragmentation of the Golgi complex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 2015</xref>]) it is likely that the polarized delivery of Rab6 vesicles to FAs is negatively affected. This also supports the hypothesis that Rho levels at the Golgi complex have to be tightly regulated to ensure proper vesicular trafficking. To connect GPCR signaling with the FA-directed exocytotic pathway, we stimulated control and PKD2/3 depleted HeLa cells with thrombin and quantified the Rab6 vesicles arriving at paxillin-positive FA over time by TIRF kymography. Our data clearly show that thrombin stimulation significantly increased the number of Rab6 vesicles arriving at FAs in control but not in PKD2/3 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). We thus demonstrate that activation of PARs induces PKD-dependent localized exocytosis. We also followed the dynamic movement of CLIP170, a microtubule plus end tip, in HeLa cells expressing DsRed2-paxillin. As shown by the kymographs, in PLCε-depleted cells microtubule plus ends contacted FAs as efficiently as in control cells, proving that the loss of the Rho effector PLCε does not interfere with the microtubule-FA interaction per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We thus conclude that perturbations of the GEF-H1/Rho/PLCε/PKD signaling axis affect Rab6 vesicles already at the level of the TGN.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35907.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>GEF-H1, PLCε and PKD are required for localized delivery of Rab6 to FAs.</title><p>(<bold>A, B, C, D, E</bold>) Cells were transfected with spRNAs as indicated.

In this system, secretory cargo is retained in the ER through streptavidin-based retention and released to the secretory pathway upon biotin addition. Since TNFα was shown to be transported in Rab6 vesicles from the TGN to the plasma membrane ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Micaroni et al., 2013</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) and is exocytosed at FAs (personal correspondence F.

To do so, we expressed Str-KDEL-TNFα-SBP-mCherry in HeLa cells and analyzed the post-Golgi transport in fixed samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>) and by live cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). While TNFα-SBP-mCherry clearly left the Golgi and reached the plasma membrane after biotin addition in control cells, GEF-H1, PLCε, and PKD2/3 knockdown caused a substantial block in transport of TNFα-SBP-mCherry from the TGN to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8—Video 1</xref>).

DAG recruits and activates nPKCs and PKD, which gets further activated by nPKC-mediated phosphorylation. The activation of PKD by RhoA is counterbalanced by the RhoGAP DLC3.

Specifically, we demonstrate that GEF-H1, when released from microtubules, enhances cellular RhoA activity, which in turn promotes PKD activation at the TGN through the Rho effector PLCε, ultimately leading to the fission of Rab6-positive vesicles that move towards FAs.</p><p>The RhoGEF GEF-H1 is crucial for the coupling of microtubule dynamics to Rho GTPase activation in several biological situations such as cell polarization and motility and cell cycle regulation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birkenfeld et al., 2008</xref>]). GEF-H1 is a well-known activator of RhoA but it can also act as a GEF for RhoB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnette et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vega et al., 2012</xref>). Release and activation of GEF-H1 can be achieved by disrupting polymerized microtubules through pharmacological compounds or, independent of microtubule disassembly, through GPCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meiri et al., 2014</xref>). Here we show that both modes of GEF-H1 activation, nocodazole treatment and trypsin or thrombin-induced GPCR stimulation, initiate a Rho signaling cascade leading to PKD activation and the fission of vesicles at TGN membranes. Previous studies have demonstrated a role for GEF-H1 in vesicular trafficking: Bokoch and co-workers showed that GEF-H1 interacts with the exocyst component Sec5 leading to local RhoA activation thereby promoting exocyst assembly and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, the targeted trafficking of c-Src–associated endosomes to the cell periphery was reported to depend on the GEF-H1-mediated activation of endosomal RhoB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnette et al., 2016</xref>). It is thus evident that the subcellular localization of the microtubule-regulated GEF-H1 determines the spatio-temporal activation of specific Rho pools and Rho isoforms. In general, the spatial distribution of GEF-H1 is regulated by protein interactions. For example, the junctional adaptor cingulin recruits GEF-H1 to tight junctions thereby inactivating its GEF activity and inhibiting Rho signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aijaz et al., 2005</xref>). By contrast, the interaction of GEF-H1 with Sec5 promotes RhoA activation at the exocyst complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>) and is important for GEF-H1 localization to FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, plasma membrane associated active RhoA was demonstrated to recruit GEF-H1 thereby promoting a self-amplification loop. At the same time, active RhoA was also shown to inhibit itself by the local recruitment of the actomyosin-associated RhoGAP Myo9b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graessl et al., 2017</xref>). A similar autoregulatory loop involving GEF-H1, Rho and the RhoGAP DLC3 might drive the self-limiting fission of exocytic vesicles at the TGN. Although previous reports demonstrated GEF-H1 localization to Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birkenfeld et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Callow et al., 2005</xref>), we were not able to detect endogenous or ectopically expressed GEF-H1 at the TGN. The question of whether GEF-H1 activates Rho directly at the TGN or whether Rho is activated elsewhere and then recruited to Golgi membranes thus remains open.</p><p>Hyperactivation of Rho has been linked to Golgi complex fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zilberman et al., 2011</xref>). Zilberman and colleagues identified the Rho effector mDia1 to be responsible for the RhoA-induced Golgi fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zilberman et al., 2011</xref>). Although the inhibition or loss of PKD delayed nocodazole-induced Golgi fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuchs et al., 2009</xref>), we show here that mDia1 is not responsible for PKD activation downstream of Rho. In hippocampal neurons, PKD1 activation at the Golgi occurs via a RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway and is required for the formation of Golgi outposts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Quassollo et al., 2015</xref>). In HeLa cells ROCK1 and 2 were dispensable for RhoA-mediated PKD activation, instead, we identified PLCε as the key Rho effector. The reason(s) underlying the differential regulation of PKD downstream of RhoA in HeLa cells and neurons is not clear at present. Within the PI-PLC family, PLCε has an outstanding role because it is an effector of the small GTPases Rho and Ras and further acts as a GEF protein for Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dusaban and Brown, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wing et al., 2003a</xref>). Stimulated by the direct binding to RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC, PLCε hydrolyzes PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to generate DAG and IP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wing et al., 2003b</xref>). In cardiac myocytes PLCε is localized to a perinuclear compartment through binding to a muscle-specific A-kinase anchoring protein β (mAKAPβ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2013</xref>) and hydrolyzes PtdIns(4)P to generate DAG and IP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Subsequently, the PLCε/DAG-activated PKD translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of hypertrophic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, PLCε mediates sustained signaling by driving a positive feedback loop through the small GTPase Rap1. Smrcka and colleagues suggested a model in which Rap1 recruits PLCε to the Golgi complex. PLCε in turn activates Rap1, which strengthens the PLCε association with Golgi membranes thereby maintaining local DAG levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smrcka et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, Gβγ signaling at the Golgi complex triggered PLCε activation in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), however, so far this has not been connected to Rho and/or PKD-dependent vesicle fission at this compartment. Based on our findings we conclude that the DAG pool produced by PLCε is also required for basal and GPCR-induced PKD activity at the TGN, thereby linking GEF-H1-controlled Rho activity with Golgi function and transport.</p><p>Thus far, DLC3 is the only RhoGAP protein that has been associated with Golgi membranes. Depletion of DLC3 resulted in Golgi fragmentation, most likely due to enhanced local Rho activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 2015</xref>). We now provide evidence that DLC3 counteracts GEF-H1-mediated Rho and consequently PKD activation at TGN membranes. Furthermore, DLC3 is required for the integrity of the Rab8 compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 2015</xref>). Loss of DLC3 and therefore increased Rho activity impaired the tubule-like distribution of Rab8 and converted it to a vesicular phenotype with enhanced perinuclear localization. This is consistent with observations by Hattula et al. showing that RhoA G14V expression or nocodazole treatment redistributed Rab8 to the perinuclear region. Remarkably, we observed a similar Rab8 phenotype upon expression of active PKD1 or PKD2 demonstrating that PKD is upstream of Rab8 localization. Rab6 and Rab8 localize to the same Golgi-derived exocytic carriers, with Rab6 controlling Rab8 localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grigoriev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jones et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wakana et al., 2012</xref>). We thus hypothesize that PKD is not only required for the fission of these carriers but also responsible for the proper assembly of Rab8 at the TGN. Whether PKD is upstream of Rab6 activity in this process needs to be addressed in the future.</p><p>We further provide evidence for the Rho- and PKD-dependent trafficking of TNFα in Rab6 positive vesicles. Our data are thus in line with a previous study showing that Rab6 acts on TNFα trafficking at the level of TGN exit and is required for the efficient post-Golgi transport of TNFα in inflammatory macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Micaroni et al., 2013</xref>). In inflammatory macrophages and monocytes, TNFα secretion is induced by lipopolysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Micaroni et al., 2013</xref>) and further augmented by thrombin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoffman and Cooper, 1995</xref>), respectively, supporting our data that connect GPCR signaling with PKD activation at the TGN. Notably, the exocytosis of TNFα is restricted to FAs (personal correspondence F. Perez (Institute Curie, Paris), November, 2017). Likewise, Rab6-positive vesicles have been associated with the exocytosis of MT1-MMP near FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stehbens et al., 2014</xref>) and a recent report showed for the first time the targeted delivery of integrin-rich vesicles to FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huet-Calderwood et al., 2017</xref>) establishing these structures as cellular hot spots of secretion.</p><p>Constitutively active RhoA was reported to augment the production of Rab6-positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zilberman et al., 2011</xref>) and Rab6-positive vesicles were shown to move along microtubules targeting FAs, thereby contributing to FA turnover during directed cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stehbens et al., 2014</xref>). We show here that GEF-H1, PLCε, or PKD are required for the formation and transport of these vesicles. Our results thus provide an explanation for the previously reported effects of GEF-H1 loss on cell spreading and FA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nalbant et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vega et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, extracellular matrix stiffness was found to destabilize microtubules, releasing GEF-H1, which was required for the invasion of breast cancer cells through 3D matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heck et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, future studies should address whether microtubules, through Rho-mediated activation of Golgi-localized PKD, sense extracellular matrix density to coordinate Golgi secretory function with the increased demand for factors such as proteases or cytokines required for ECM remodeling during invasive 3D migration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Cell lines were authenticated using Multiplex Cell Authentication by Multiplexion (Heidelberg, Germany) as described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castro et al., 2013</xref>). The SNP profiles matched known profiles or were unique. Cells were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert (Lonza, Switzerland). For transient plasmid transfections, HEK293T cells were transfected with TransIT-293 (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI, USA). HeLa cells were transfected with TransIT-HeLaMONSTER (Mirus Bio) or in case of RUSH experiments with FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In the case of siRNA oligonucleotides, HEK293T and HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAimax (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 hr, siRNA-transfected cells were further transfected with plasmid DNA and analyzed 24 hr later. As a negative control (termed spNT), ON-TARGETplus non-targeting control pool D-001810–10 from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA) was used. siRNAs used were: spDLC3 (siGENOME SMARTpool human STARD8 M-010254), spmDia1 (ON-Target plus SMARTpool human DIAPH1, L-010347), spGEF-H1 (ON-Target plus SMARTpool human ARHGEF2 L-009883), spPLCε(ON-Target plus SMARTpool human PLCE1 J-004201), spPKD2 (ON-Target plus SMARTpool human PRKD2 L-004197, spPKD3 (ON-Target plus SMARTpool human PRKD3 L-005029), spROCK1 (ON-Target plus SMARTpool human ROCK1 L-003536), and spROCK2 (ON-Target plus SMARTpool human ROCK2 L-004610). All smartpools were obtained from Dharmacon. The following single siRNAs were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific: siPLCε (Silencer Select s27660) and siGEF-H1 (Silencer Select s17546). Flp-In T-REx-293 cells (Life Technologies) and Flp-In T-REx-HeLa cells (generated by Elena Dobrikova and Matthias Gromeier, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA) were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml zeocin and 15 μg/ml (293) or 10 µg/ml blasticidin (HeLa). These cells stably express the Tet repressor, contain a single Flp Recombination Target (FRT) site and were used to generate the Flp-In-T-REx-EGFP-GEF-H1- lines. Cells were cotransfected with pcDNA5/FRT/TO-EGFP-GEF-H1 wt or C53R and the Flp recombinase expression plasmid pOG44 at a ratio of 1:10 and then selected with 100 μg/ml (293) or 500 µg/ml (HeLa) hygromycin B. Induction of protein expression with doxycycline was at 10 ng/ml. Treatment of cells with nocodazole was at 5 µg/ml, trypsin and thrombin were used at 10 nM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantitative one-step real-time PCR</title><p>RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy plus Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturers’ instructions. 100 ng RNA were used for the real-time PCR reaction using the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit from Qiagen following the manufacturer’s instructions. Analysis was performed using the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). The following QuantiTect primers were used: Hs_GAPDH_2_SG , Hs_PLCE1_1_SG, Hs_ARHGEF2_1_SG, Hs_PRKD2_1_SG, Hs_PRKD3_1_SG, and Hs_ACTB_2_SG (all obtained from Qiagen).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy</title><p>Cells grown on glass coverslips coated with 2,5 µg/ml collagen R (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) were fixed for 15 min with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde. After washes in PBS, cells were incubated for 5 min with 1 M glycine in PBS and permeabilized for 2 min with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. Blocking was performed with 5% (v/v) bovine serum (PAN) in PBS for 30 min. Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 2 hr at room temperature. Following three washing steps with PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa-Fluor-(488, 546 or 633)-labeled secondary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 hr at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All samples were analyzed at room temperature using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 710, Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Plan Apochromat 63x/1.40 DIC M27 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) oil-immersion objective. GFP was excited with the 488 nm line of an Argon laser, its emission was detected from 496 to 553 nm. Alexa546 was excited with a 561 nm DPSS laser, its emission was detected from 566 to 622 nm. In case of Phalloidin-Alexa633 staining, Alexa633 was excited with a 633 nm HeNe laser, its emission was detected from 638 to 740 nm. Image acquisition for G-PKDrep ratiometric imaging was done as follows: z-stacks of 0.5 µm intervals were acquired throughout the cell and maximum intensity projections were calculated. GFP and Alexa546 channels were hereby acquired with the same pinhole setting that was adjusted to 1 AU in the Alexa 546 channel. Laser powers were adjusted to prevent fluorophore saturation and identical photomultiplier tube and laser settings were maintained throughout the whole experiment. Image processing and analysis was performed with Zen black 2.1 software. Regions of interest of identical Golgi areas of reporter expressing cells were selected in the GFP channel, mean pixel intensity values of the selected areas in both channels were measured and the Alexa546 to GFP ratio was calculated. In the case of the Cherry-tagged G-PKDrep construct, staining of the pSer294 signal was performed using an Alexa633-conjugated secondary antibody. Image acquisition was done in the Cherry and Alexa633 channels as described above. Alexa633 pixel intensity was corrected for background signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>FRET imaging</title><p>FRET studies with the RhoA activity biosensor were performed on a Zeiss Axio Observer Spinning Disc microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 Oil DIC objective and a Photometrix Evolve 512 EMCCD camera. CFP and FRET channels were acquired with a 445 nm diode excitation laser combined with 485/30 nm (CFP) and 562/45 nm (FRET) emission filters. mRuby was acquired using a 561 nm diode excitation laser combined with a 600/50 nm emission filter. Images were acquired at 37°C every 60 s for one hour at a resolution of 512 × 512 Px. Focus was stabilized using the Definite Focus 2 autofocus device. Nocodazole was added 10 min after start of image acquisition. Image analysis was done with Zen blue 2.3 software. After background subtraction the mean FRET/CFP (Y/C) emission ratio was calculated for every time point. In order to measure RhoA activity specifically at the Golgi complex, a ROI was drawn around the Golgi compartment (identified through the mRuby-Golgi7 signal). The mean FRET/CFP emission ratio of the ROI of multiple cells was normalized to its values in unstimulated state and plotted against the time. In parallel, ratio images that reflect the RhoA activation state throughout the cell were generated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>TIRF microscopy</title><p>TIRF images were acquired on the same Zeiss Axio Observer microscope stand used for FRET imaging, additionally equipped with a motorized TIRF illuminator (Laser TIRF 3), an EMCCD camera (Photometrics Evolve 512) and an alpha Plan-Apochromat 100x/1.46 NA Oil objective at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in phenolred-free RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS. In case of the basal localized delivery experiment, TIRF-images of GFP-Rab6 and DsRed2-Paxillin were acquired every second for a time interval of two minutes. Image processing was done with the Zen 2.1 blue software. All channels were filtered with a Low-pass filter followed by an unsharp-masking in order to reduce pixel noise and enhance the contrast of dim structures. In case of the thrombin stimulation, cells were serum starved for 30 min prior to image acquisition. TIRF images were acquired every two seconds for a time interval of 35 min. Thrombin was added after 5 min. Control cells received PBS. Kymographs were generated using Zen 2.3 blue software. For each cell, three to five kymographs were generated. At least 10 focal adhesions per cell were analyzed for vesicle arrival.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>3D time lapse</title><p>3D time lapse studies were performed on the Zeiss Axio Observer Spinning Disc system equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 Oil DIC objective and two Axiocam 503 mono CCD cameras. GFP-Rab6A and DsRed2-Paxillin images were acquired simultaneously in Dual-camera mode using a 560 nm beamsplitter. The following excitation lasers and emission filters were used: GFP, 488 nm diode laser, 525/50 nm filter, RFP, 561 nm (RFP) diode laser, 600/50 nm filter. Z-Stacks with a 500 nm interval were acquired every second for two minutes. 3D time lapse sequences were rendered using the Zen blue 2.1 3d VisArt module.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Golgi localization analysis</title><p>Images for Golgi localization analysis were acquired on the LSM710 microscope equipped with an EC-Plan Neofluar 40x/1.30 NA Oil DIC objective. GFP and Alexa 546 images were acquired with the same settings as described confocal microscopy section. Quantitative image analysis was done with CellProfiler version 2.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kamentsky et al., 2011</xref>). Ten confocal overview images (zoom factor 0.6) were analyzed per condition. The Golgi complex and the cytoplasm were segmented using the p230 staining and its background, respectively. The mean intensity of the GFP signal was measured under both segmentation masks and the Golgi/Cytoplasm ratio was generated for every cell representing the PKD1kd-GFP distribution throughout the cell. GFP-negative cells were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Kymography</title><p>Microtubuli polymerization studies were performed on the Zeiss Axio Observer Spinning Disc system equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 Oil DIC objective and two Axiocam 503 mono CCD cameras. Clip170-GFP and DsRed2-Paxillin were acquired sequentially every second for 2 min using an automated emission filter wheel for CSU-X1. The following excitation lasers and emission filters were used: GFP, 488 nm diode laser, 525/50 nm filter, RFP, 561 nm (RFP) diode laser, 600/50 nm filter. Kymographs were generated in the Zen blue 2.1 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Golgi co-localization analysis</title><p>For the Rab6 and Rab8 Golgi co-localization analysis, HeLa control- and siRNA knockdown cells, overexpressing GFP or a GFP-tagged version of PKD1 or PKD2 were plated on coverslips, fixed and stained for p230 and Rab6 or Rab8 according to the protocol described in the immunofluorescence staining section. For image acquisition, overview images with maximal field of view were taken at a resolution of 2048 × 2048 on the LSM710 microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC objective. GFP, Alexa 546 and Alexa 633 channels were acquired with the same settings as described in the confocal microscopy section. The quantitative object-based co-localization analysis was done using CellProfiler version 2.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kamentsky et al., 2011</xref>). In brief, Golgi complexes were segmented and measured for GFP and Rab6 or Rab8 staining intensities. Each Golgi was then classified in order to be positive or negative for PKD and/or Rab6 and Rab8 using a threshold based cut-off line. For co-localization analysis of RhoA and RhoB with Rab6, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a GFP-tagged version of RhoA/B wt or Q63L. Cells were plated on coverslips, fixed and stained for Rab6 (Alexa 633) as described in the immunofluorescence staining section. Optical slices were acquired at the LSM710 confocal microscope in all four channels as described in the confocal microscopy section. The quantitative co-localization analysis was performed with CellProfiler software (version 3.0.0). First, single cells were segmented based on the GFP image. Afterwards, Manders’ coefficient (Costes automated threshold) was determined for the GFP and Alexa633 overlap in each cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>RUSH (Retention using selective hooks) trafficking assay</title><p>HeLa cells were maintained in biotin-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. SiRNA-transfected cells were plated on glass coverslips and transiently co-transfected with a plasmid encoding Str-KDEL-TNFα-SBP-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>) together with Rab6-GFP at a ratio of 4:1 using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer´s protocol. After biotin-induced release of the TNFα-mCherry cargo from the ER, cells were incubated for 60 min at 19°C to block cargo exit from the Golgi complex. Cargo was released from the Golgi through a temperature shift to 37°C using pre-warmed medium. Cells were fixed at time points 0 and 35 min after release. Samples were stained for the TGN marker p230 using an Alexa405-labelled secondary antibody. Images were acquired at the AxioObserver SD described above. Z-Stacks were acquired with the 63x objective in 405, GFP and Cherry channels at a 500 nm interval and maximum intensity projections were calculated. Only cells expressing Rab6-GFP and TNFα-mCherry at a moderate level were analyzed. The trafficking status of TNFα-mCherry was analyzed and thereby each cell was classified in two categories: 1. ‘Golgi’ cells, in which the TNF-cargo remained partially at the Golgi compartment. 2. ‘Traffic’ cells, in which the TNF-cargo exited the Golgi completely. For live cell imaging siRNA-transfected cells were plated in 35 mm glass bottom petri dishes and transiently transfected with the Str-KDEL-TNFα-SBP-mCherry plasmid using FuGENE HD transfection reagent. Cells were imaged in FluoroBrite DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FCS. Time series of images were acquired at the AxioObserver SD described above equipped with an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA). Z-Stacks were acquired with the 63x objective in the Cherry channel at a 500 nm interval every minute for 2 hr. Cargo release from the ER was induced by the addition of biotin at 40 µM after 10 cycles. For image analysis maximum intensity projections were calculated and the mean intensity in the Golgi region was measured over time. The obtained intensities were normalized to the highest value that was considered as the starting point to observe the Golgi traffic to the plasma membrane for each cell.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Attila Ignacz (Eötvös Lorand University Budapest, Hungary) for help in designing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.

While RhoA has been observed at the Golgi over a decade, it has not been clear what this small GTPase is doing at this location. The current work establishes a RhoA-PLCε-PKD signaling cascade that operates at the Golgi and is important for maintaining Golgi structure and for the export of Rab6 carriers from this organelle. The work is important but the following issues should be addressed before publication can be recommended.</p><p>1) The most important concern is whether the pathway studied is truly physiological. For example, the experiment in Figure 4C, in which PKD activity is assessed under basal conditions (i.e., not treated with nocodazole, trypsin, or GTP-locked RhoA), indicates that PLCε plays only a very minor role in basal PKD activity. Does PAR activation actually alter secretion level (e.g. of TNFα)? If so, then to what extent is the level changed? And, what is a likely physiological context for this regulation? There are many papers showing the impact of altering intracellular signaling factors (including the ones studied here) on secretory pathway organization and/or function. What is missing is a demonstration that these changes occur in a physiologically relevant signaling condition with the expected changes in output (i.e. added ligand X causing a Y-fold change in localized secretion of Z). Here, we believe it would greatly improve the impact of the study to at least quantify PKD-dependent secretion of TNFα in response to activation of a PAR (one wishes something more selective than trypsin could be used for the activation).</p><p>2) The FRET experiment in Figure 2D shows that depletion of GEF-H1 results in a reduction in the total cellular activity of RhoA (lower panel). Therefore, GEF-H1 does not seem to be a Golgi-specific regulator of RhoA. In the upper row of the same panel, treatment with nocodazole also increases total cellular RhoA FRET (i.e. activity). It is hard to see the Golgi in this image, most likely because of fragmentation induced my microtubule depolymerization. It is hard to see Golgi-localized FRET signals in the images provided, even zoomed in. Based on this experiment it is not possible to say that GEF-H1 regulates RhoA activity at the Golgi. Rather, GEF-H1 regulates the total cellular pool of active RhoA, including the Golgi pool.</p><p>3) Is GEF-H1 localized at the Golgi? Also, in Figure 1C, the GFP-RhoA-Q63L image shows that this fusion protein localizes to the Golgi in only a subset of the cells. The extent of Golgi localization should be quantified and reported. It appears that the corresponding RhoB construct has much better Golgi localization.</p><p>4) The G-PKDrep reporter is heavily utilized in this work, and has been previously validated. However, when new treatments are used that have not previously been validated, it is important to verify that the reporter is indeed reporting PKD activity, as it is easy to imagine that another kinase could phosphorylate the reporter. For example, how do we know that GTP-locked RhoA does not activate another kinase that is able to phosphorylate the G-PKDrep reporter? Or that Trypsin treatment doesn't activate another kinase that will phosphorylate the reporter? Therefore, for any new experimental treatments involving this reporter, the authors need to do a control where they demonstrate PKD-dependence of the observed increase in reporter signal by including a PKD-knockdown control.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A Rho signaling network links microtubules to PKD controlled carrier transport to focal adhesions&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

There are several pathways, e.g. ceramide transfer from the ER or the PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PI4P or PI4,5P2 that contribute to the DAG level at this organelle. These different sources of DAG provide an explanation for the modest but significant contribution of PLCε to basal PKD activity as shown in Figure 4C.</p><p>To use a more selective and physiological stimulus for the PAR receptors, in the revised manuscript, we treated cells expressing the PKD reporter with thrombin. Our data clearly show that thrombin activates PKD at the Golgi complex (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Most importantly, using TIRF kymography, we show that thrombin stimulates the localized exocytosis of Rab6 vesicles at FA in a PKD-dependent manner (new Figure 7E). Previous reports describing thrombin-induced, Rab6-dependent stimulation of TNFα secretion in monocytes support the physiological relevance of a pathway that links PAR signaling with GEF-H1-dependent PKD activation at the TGN (see Discussion of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The FRET experiment in Figure 2D shows that depletion of GEF-H1 results in a reduction in the total cellular activity of RhoA (lower panel).

We also mention this in the manuscript. We agree with the reviewers that GEF-H1 seems to regulate different Rho pools and have thus changed the phrasing in the Results section. We have also included this point in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is GEF-H1 localized at the Golgi?

However, active RhoA and RhoB show significantly higher co-localization compared to their wt counterparts. This also supports a role for active Rho at TGN membranes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The G-PKDrep reporter is heavily utilized in this work, and has been previously validated.

The greater variance in the signal compared to pharmacological inhibition can be explained by the different transfection efficiency of the siRNAs.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We would like to publish your paper but one reviewer wrote,&quot;… in their response to point 2, they claim that they have toned down the message that GEF-H1 mediates activation of RhoA at the Golgi.
