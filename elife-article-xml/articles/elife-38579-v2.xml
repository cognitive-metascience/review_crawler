Loss of the pulmonary lineage specifier NKX2-1 augments the growth of KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma and causes pulmonary to gastric transdifferentiation. Here, we show that the transcription factors FoxA1 and FoxA2 are required for initiation of mucinous NKX2-1-negative lung adenocarcinomas in the mouse and for activation of their gastric differentiation program. <italic>Foxa1/2</italic> deletion severely impairs tumor initiation and causes a proximal shift in cellular identity, yielding tumors expressing markers of the squamocolumnar junction of the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, we observe downregulation of FoxA1/2 expression in the squamous component of both murine and human lung adenosquamous carcinoma. Using sequential in vivo recombination, we find that FoxA1/2 loss in established KRAS-driven neoplasia originating from SPC-positive alveolar cells induces keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2 coordinately regulate the growth and identity of lung cancer in a context-specific manner.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38579.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Among all cancers, lung cancers cause the most deaths worldwide. There are many different types of lung cancer, each of which contain lung cancer cells that look different. As a general rule, lung cancer cells that look the most like healthy lung cells are the least aggressive. Cancer cells that take on the appearance of other tissues in the body are more aggressive and often respond poorly to treatment. In one uncommon type of lung cancer called invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA, for short), the cancer cells start to resemble the cells that line the inside of the stomach. For example, these lung cancer cells activate genes more typically active in stomach cells, and they start to make a lot of mucus.</p><p>Previous studies with mice showed that losing a single protein called NKX2-1 can cause this switch from lung to stomach cell identity. However, it is not clear exactly how this switch happens and which other proteins are involved. Camolotto et al. have now addressed these issues by studying two DNA-binding proteins called FoxA1 and FoxA2. There were two main reasons for choosing these specific proteins. First, they can physically interact with the NKX2-1 protein, so losing NKX2-1 affects how FoxA1 and FoxA2 interact with DNA. Second, the two proteins switch on many of the stomach-related genes that are also activated in IMA.</p><p>Camolotto et al. activated a gene that commonly drives lung cancer and deleted the gene for NKX2-1 in the lungs of mice, mimicking IMA. As expected, these mice developed lung tumors that resembled stomach tissue. When the genes for FoxA1 and FoxA2 were deleted at the same time, the tumors stopped producing the mucus-related proteins. Further experiments showed that these cancer cells adopt a different cell identity also found in the digestive tract. Mice with tumors lacking both FoxA1 and FoxA2 survived for longer than those still containing these proteins. Lastly, when the genes for NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2 were deleted later, in lung tumors that had already formed, the outcome was a more aggressive type of lung cancer that also occurs in human patients.</p><p>These experiments demonstrate that losing FoxA1 and FoxA2 at different times affects what kind of lung tumor can grow. Future studies will need to examine how these different lung cancer types respond to therapy and whether lung cancer cells switch identities to evade therapy. This knowledge may eventually lead to new treatments for lung cancer patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FoxA1</kwd><kwd>FoxA2</kwd><kwd>NKX2-1</kwd><kwd>lineage switching</kwd><kwd>lung cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01212415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snyder</surname><given-names>Eric L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Award for Medical Scientists</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snyder</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001368</institution-id><institution>V Foundation for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snyder</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lineage specifiers FoxA1 and FoxA2 control lung cancer growth and identity by activating gastric differentiation and suppressing squamous cell carcinoma transdifferentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer progression is often accompanied by profound changes in cellular identity. Cellular identity, or differentiation state, influences not only intrinsic malignant potential, but also response to therapy, even in tumors harboring the same targetable mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cohen and Settleman, 2014</xref>). Although tissue of origin is a major determinant of cancer cell identity, cancer cells can also undergo lineage switching in the course of their natural history and in response to the selective pressure of targeted therapy. In lung adenocarcinoma, absence of the pulmonary lineage specifier NKX2-1/TTF1 correlates with non-pulmonary cellular identities and poor prognosis compared with NKX2-1-positive tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barletta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cardnell et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, lung adenocarcinomas can undergo lineage switching during the evolution of drug resistance that reduces their dependence on the oncogenic signaling pathway being targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rotow and Bivona, 2017</xref>). Taken together, these observations indicate that there is a need to understand the critical regulators of cancer cell identity.</p><p>In previous work, we and others have shown that loss of NKX2-1 is sufficient to cause lineage switching in a mouse model of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>-driven lung adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Snyder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tata et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> deletion in established tumors causes cancer cells to shed their pulmonary identity and adopt a gastric-like differentiation state characterized by extensive mucin production and expression of multiple gastrointestinal markers, including HNF4α and Gastrokine 1. These tumors morphologically resemble a subtype of human lung cancer called invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA), which also expresses gastrointestinal markers and is predominantly driven by <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Approximately 10–15% of human lung adenocarcinomas express HNF4α with no detectable NKX2-1 (9), including both IMAs and more moderately differentiated tumors. In many of these tumors, the <italic>NKX2-1</italic> gene appears to be silenced by genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hwang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matsubara et al., 2017</xref>). Aside from NKX2-1 itself, the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) appears to play a role in suppressing mucinous differentiation in KRAS-driven, p53-deficient lung adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Serresi et al., 2016</xref>). However, the precise mechanisms by which a gastric gene expression program is activated in NKX2-1-deficient tumors remain to be fully elucidated.</p><p>Many of the gastrointestinal transcripts expressed in IMA are known targets of the forkhead box transcription factors FoxA1 and FoxA2 (FoxA1/2). These transcription factors govern the development of a variety of tissues and are expressed in both the adult lung and GI tract (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Golson and Kaestner, 2016</xref>). FoxA1/2 are also expressed in both murine and human IMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). We previously found that <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> deletion in autochthonous lung tumors caused FoxA1/2 to re-localize from the regulatory elements of pulmonary-specific genes (such as <italic>Sftpa1</italic>) to those of genes (such as <italic>Hnf4a</italic>) that are expressed in both the GI tract and IMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Snyder et al., 2013</xref>). Given that NKX2-1 physically interacts with FoxA1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Snyder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Minoo et al., 2007</xref>), we hypothesized that NKX2-1 promotes FoxA1/2 interaction with regulatory elements of the pulmonary differentiation program at the expense of those governing gastric identity. However, these data did not demonstrate a functional role for FoxA1/2 in the activation of the gastric program in these tumors. To address this question directly, we used conditional alleles of <italic>Foxa1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2008</xref>) and <italic>Foxa2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sund et al., 2000</xref>) to abrogate their function in an autochthonous mouse model of NKX2-1-negative lung adenocarcinoma. We found that FoxA1/2 are critical and redundant regulators of both the gastric differentiation program and growth of NKX2-1-negative tumors. Moreover, we found that the cellular identity adopted by tumors was highly dependent on the context in which FoxA1/2 activity is lost, suggesting that a cell’s baseline epigenetic state can influence the identity it adopts in response to changes in lineage specifier expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38579.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FoxA1 and FoxA2 are required for mucinous lung adenocarcinoma formation.</title><p>Photomicrographs of lung neoplasia arising 11 weeks after initiation with PGK-Cre lentivirus.

Initial evaluation by morphology (H and E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that tumors lacking either FoxA1 or FoxA2 were indistinguishable from control tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In sharp contrast, concomitant deletion of <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> led to the emergence of small neoplastic lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right column) in the alveoli that were completely devoid of the glandular architecture and mucin production that characterizes NKX2-1-deficient tumors. Absence of mucin production was apparent by H and E staining and further demonstrated by Alcian Blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and IHC for Muc5AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Given the dramatic change in the morphology of lung neoplasia lacking NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2, we used IHC to assess the differentiation state of these lesions. Cytokeratin 8 (CK8) was expressed in lesions arising in mice of all genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), showing that cells lacking all three transcription factors retained an epithelial identity and did not undergo a complete epithelial to mesenchymal transition. HNF4α and PDX1 are transcription factors that regulate gastrointestinal differentiation and are expressed in human invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma and mouse models of this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Snyder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Skoulidis et al., 2015</xref>). Both transcription factors, as well as the HNF4α target PK-L, were undetectable in FoxA1/2-deficient neoplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additional markers of gastrointestinal differentiation, including Gastrokine 1, Cathepsin E and Galectin 4, were also not expressed in these lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). All these markers were retained in lesions lacking either FoxA1 or FoxA2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken together, these data show that FoxA1 and FoxA2 are required for mucin production and key elements of the gastrointestinal differentiation program in NKX2-1-negative lung tumors in a functionally redundant manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FoxA1 and FoxA2 are required at initiation for growth and proliferation of NKX2-1-negative lung adenocarcinoma</title><p>Most lesions in <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/+</sup>; Nkx2-1<sup>F/F</sup>; Foxa1<sup>F/F</sup>; Foxa2<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice exhibited complete loss of FoxA1/2 expression when analyzed at 11 weeks post-infection. However, these mice also harbored a variable but substantial quantity of tumors (‘incomplete recombinants’) that retained FoxA1 or FoxA2 as well as targets such as HNF4α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Since incomplete recombinants were often larger than the lesions lacking NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2 (i.e. ‘complete recombinants’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we speculated that they might have gradually outgrown the complete recombinants over time. Consistent with this possibility, we found that 5 weeks after tumor initiation, incomplete recombinants comprised a much smaller proportion of overall tumor burden than at 11 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).</p><p>Based on these data, we chose the 5-week timepoint to quantitate tumor burden and proliferation rates among the different genotypes.

Using the SC3 package, we identified marker genes for this cluster (defined as 'genes that are highly expressed in only one of the clusters and are able to distinguish one cluster from all the remaining ones’). These included canonical NKX2-1 target genes <italic>Sftpa1</italic> and <italic>Sftpb</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). From these data, we infer that C1 represents tumor cells that are phenotypically NKX2-1-positive.

Numerous gastrointestinal transcripts were identified as marker genes for this cluster, including <italic>Hnf4a</italic>, <italic>Gkn1</italic>, <italic>Lgals4</italic> and <italic>Ctse</italic>. Thus, C2 appears to include incomplete recombinants from <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/+</sup>; Nkx2-1<sup>F/F</sup>; Foxa1<sup>F/F</sup>; Foxa2<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice that express sufficient levels of FoxA1 and/or FoxA2 to maintain a gastric differentiation state.

First, we identified differentially expressed genes between C1 and C2 using an independent software package (SCDE) and found that many pulmonary and gastric transcripts were differentially expressed between the two clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We then performed RNA-Seq on sorted bulk tumor cells from <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/+</sup>; Nkx2-1<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice (n = 3 each, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) and found a strong correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.62) between the differentially expressed genes identified in single cell and bulk analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also compared our single-cell datasets with published data from other groups. We found that normal murine type two pneumocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>), which are the presumed cell of origin for NKX2-1-positive tumor cells, clustered with presumptive NKX2-1-positive C1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also used principal component analysis (PCA) to compare our single-cell data with a gene signature of human IMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). In this analysis, the IMA signature caused C2 cells to cluster separately from the other cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This shows that C2 cells are more similar to IMA than C1 and C3, as would be expected if they represent the NKX2-1-negative tumor cell population.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NKX2-1; FoxA1/2-deficient tumor cells express markers of the squamocolumnar junctional epithelium of the GI tract</title><p>To characterize the identity of our tumor cells in a global manner, we compared our single-cell RNA-Seq data with total RNA-Seq data from a panel of mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). The 50 genes in each tissue with the highest expression compared to the other tissues in the panel were identified. Expression data for this set of genes was extracted from the single cell and tissue datasets and evaluated using two approaches: tSNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which combines PCA, hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. In both approaches, we found that C1 was most similar to normal lung, and that C2 was most similar to glandular stomach. C3 cells clustered near the upper GI tract, in particular the forestomach and esophagus. However, cosine similarity analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) showed that C3 cells are not as closely related to esophagus/forestomach as C1 and C2 are to lung and glandular stomach, respectively. This bioinformatic analysis is in consonance with microscopic evaluation of complete recombinants, which lack morphological features of a multi-layered, keratinizing squamous epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that is found in the normal esophagus and forestomach. Moreover, the vast majority of complete recombinants cells do not express ΔNp63, a master regulator of squamous differentiation, or the squamous marker cytokeratin 5 (CK5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, complete ablation of NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2 causes lung tumor cells to adopt an identity that is neither pulmonary nor gastric, but also is not fully squamous. Indeed, it appears that the exact differentiation state adopted by these cells is not well represented in the panel of tissues evaluated.</p><p>Recent studies have described a small but discrete transitional zone at the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, just proximal to the glandular stomach, which is not included as a discrete entity in our tissue panel. This transitional zone consists of a bilayered epithelium expressing high levels of cytokeratin 7 (CK7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), including a ΔNp63/CK5-positive basal layer and a ΔNp63/CK5-negative luminal layer. Intriguingly, complete recombinants in <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/+</sup>; Nkx2-1<sup>F/F</sup>; Foxa1<sup>F/F</sup>; Foxa2<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice have uniformly high levels of CK7 protein that are comparable to the SCJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Manual inspection of genes specifically expressed in C3 vs. both C1 and C2 (using both SC3 and SCDE) revealed that several of these genes are expressed at high levels at the SCJ of the GI tract and/or the cervix. These genes include <italic>Chil4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nio et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>Gda</italic> and <italic>Mmp7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herfs et al., 2012</xref>), and <italic>Vcam1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Both FoxA1 and FoxA2 are expressed in the glandular stomach. Interestingly, FoxA2 expression ends at the SCJ and is absent throughout the squamous forestomach and esophagus. In contrast, FoxA1 levels are very low but detectable at the SCJ then increase in the proximal forestomach and esophagus. Thus, overall FoxA1/2 levels appear to reach their nadir at the SCJ and distal forestomach of the normal murine GI tract. Taken together, our data show that FoxA1/2 are required for NKX2-1-deficient lung tumor cells to adopt a gastric identity. Moreover, concomitant loss of NKX2-1 and FoxA1/2 activity at tumor initiation leads to a distinct differentiation state characterized by expression of multiple markers of the transitional epithelium normally found at the SCJ of the GI tract.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>FoxA1/2 are downregulated in the squamous component of murine and human adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung</title><p>Although <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/+</sup>; Nkx2-1<sup>F/F</sup>; Foxa1<sup>F/F</sup></italic> and <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/+</sup>; Nkx2-1<sup>F/F</sup>; Foxa2<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice exhibited minimal obvious phenotypes at early timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), we found that a subset of these mice developed macroscopic adenosquamous carcinomas (AdSCCs) at 20 weeks post-initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This stochastic loss of FoxA activity is associated with a profound change in differentiation state, with FoxA1/2-negative cells upregulating a keratinizing squamous differentiation program. This is in sharp contrast to the differentiation state of tumor cells in which FoxA1/2 loss was engineered at the time of tumor initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which led to an SCJ-like phenotype.

In half of the cases, FoxA1 and FoxA2 were both downregulated in the squamous component (n = 5 cases with complete loss of expression and n = 1 case with detectable but diminished expression). In the other half, either FoxA1 (n = 5) or FoxA2 (n = 1) exhibited downregulation in the squamous component. Thus, half of the human AdSCC examined exhibit the same pattern of FoxA1/2 downregulation that we observe in our mouse model. Moreover, all cases exhibit at least partial reduction in expression of FoxA1 or FoxA2 in the squamous component.

We have previously shown that engineered loss of the pulmonary lineage specifier NKX2-1 causes lung adenocarcinoma cells to shed their pulmonary identity and adopt a gastric differentiation state that is also observed in human IMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Snyder et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that FoxA1 and FoxA2 are required for lung adenocarcinomas to adopt a mucinous, gastric differentiation state in the absence of NKX2-1. Although FoxA1/2 can regulate lung adenocarcinoma biology individually in some contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2015</xref>), their functional redundancy in IMA is consistent with their frequently redundant role in endodermal tissue specification (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Golson and Kaestner, 2016</xref>). The precise mechanisms by which FoxA1/2 specifically activate a gastric program in NKX2-1 negative lung cancer, as opposed to other potential endodermal differentiation states (e.g. hepatic, pancreatic, lower GI tract etc.), remain to be determined. However, it appears likely that FoxA1/2 regulate gastrointestinal differentiation programs in other types of cancer. For example, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and its precursors often express many of the same foregut markers as NKX2-1-negative lung adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prasad et al., 2005</xref>). FoxA1/2 levels are much higher in the subset of PDAC expressing a foregut differentiation program than in those tumors with a more mesenchymal/squamous differentiation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, aberrant activation of a gastrointestinal differentiation program in prostate cancer, which can mediate castration resistance, is driven by HNF4γ in cooperation with FoxA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shukla et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the precise consequences of FoxA1/2 loss in lung cancer are highly dependent on the specific context in which it occurs (model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). When <italic>Nkx2-1</italic>, <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> are deleted at tumor initiation, the resulting lung lesions lacked evidence of either pulmonary or gastric differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Instead, complete recombinants expressed several genes enriched at the SCJ of the GI tract, which contains a small but distinct non-keratinized transitional columnar epithelium marked by high levels of CK7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). The transitional epithelium consists of a ΔNp63-positive basal progenitor layer, which can give rise to Barrett’s metaplasia, and a differentiated ΔNp63-negative luminal layer. Thus, in the absence of FoxA1/2 activity, <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> deletion causes normal lung epithelial cells to adopt a cell fate resembling the transitional epithelium that localizes immediately proximal to the glandular stomach. Given the lack of ΔNp63 expression in complete recombinants, we speculate that these tumor cells more closely resemble the luminal cells of the transitional epithelium, which may account in part for their limited proliferative capacity.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38579.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of context-specific regulation of lung cancer identity by NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2.</title><p>SCJ: squamocolumnar junction of GI tract.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-38579-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In contrast, both stochastic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and engineered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) loss of FoxA1/2 in established KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>-driven lesions initiated in SPC-positive cells was accompanied by activation of a robust squamous differentiation program, as evidenced by a stratified multi-layered epithelium with extensive keratinization and expression of ΔNp63 and CK5. These data suggest that signaling from KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> enhances the capacity of SPC-positive cells to activate a squamous differentiation program in the absence of NKX2-1 and FoxA1/2. Additional studies will be needed to determine the mechanism(s) that account for this enhanced propensity for squamous differentiation. ΔNp63 is an activator of squamous differentiation and is generally thought to function as an oncogene in SCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>), so the increased levels of ΔNp63 when <italic>Nkx2-1;Foxa1/2</italic> deletion occurs in established lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) vs. at tumor initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) are likely to be one major factor that dictates whether cells adopt an SCJ-like vs. SCC fate. We speculate that signaling from KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> either alters the epigenetic state of elements regulating ΔNp63 directly, or influences the activity of its numerous upstream regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoh and Prywes, 2015</xref>). It is also unclear why SPC-positive cells adopt two distinct fates in our sequential mutagenesis experiments (SCJ-like vs SCC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Intrinsic heterogeneity of the SPC-positive population (prior to KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> expression) could account for this observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nabhan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zacharias et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, heterogeneous response to KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> signaling could also play a role. Proliferation rate can influence changes in cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soufi and Dalton, 2016</xref>), and it is possible that only a subset of SPC-positive cells are actively cycling one week after KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> expression.

In <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>; Lkb1</italic> conditional mice CC10-positive lung epithelial cells are the predominant cell of origin for adenosquamous carcinomas, whereas SPC-positive cells mainly give rise to adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagaraj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).

We have previously shown that <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> deletion augments KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>-driven tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Snyder et al., 2013</xref>). Concomitant <italic>Foxa1/2</italic> deletion at initiation reverses this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), showing that when FoxA1/2 are absent at tumor initiation, NKX2-1-negative lesions equilibrate to a low proliferation state that never progresses to macroscopic disease. However, the stochastic emergence of macroscopic FoxA1/2-negative AdSCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) argues that there is a selective advantage to loss of FoxA1/2 in some established lung neoplasia. This is further reinforced by the observation that a subset of human AdSCCs downregulate FoxA1/2 in their squamous component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). An apparently dichotomous and context-specific contribution of FoxA1/2 to malignant potential has been observed in tumors from other tissues (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Golson and Kaestner, 2016</xref>). For example, one study of human lung SCC reported that 43% of cases lacked FoxA1 expression by IHC, and that FoxA1 positivity was significantly correlated with unfavorable survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deutsch et al., 2012</xref>). In PDAC, FoxA1 can promote metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roe et al., 2017</xref>), despite the fact low levels of FoxA1/2 (as well as other lineage specifiers associated with endodermal differentiation) are found in the subtype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that confers the worst prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>). A comprehensive evaluation of FoxA1/2 loss at distinct stages of tumorigenesis will be needed to delineate fully its context-specific role in lung tumor growth.</p><p>In summary, this work expands our understanding of the lineage specifiers that coordinately regulate the growth and identity of lung adenocarcinoma. We show that FoxA1 and FoxA2 regulate the growth and gastric identity of NKX2-1-negative lung adenocarcinoma. In the absence of FoxA1/2 activity, NKX2-1-negative tumor cells adopt a more proximal cell fate with features of either the transitional epithelium of the SCJ or the squamous epithelium of the forestomach/esophagus, depending on the context of FoxA1/2 loss. Squamous transdifferentiation has been linked to drug resistance in human lung adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou et al., 2017</xref>), and it will be interesting to determine whether FoxA1/2 downregulation plays a role in this process. More broadly, our results show that the effects of lineage specifier inactivation in cancer can be highly context-dependent, and provide an experimental system for future work to elucidate the mechanistic basis for this specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Reads were aligned to the index using the following parameters: outFilterType BySJout, outFilterMultimapNmax 20, outFilterMismatchNmax 999, outFilterMismatchNoverReadLmax 0.04, alignIntronMin 20, alignIntronMax 1000000, alignMatesGapMax 1000000, alignSJoverhangMin 8, alignSJDBoverhangMin 1, sjdbScore 1, outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate, quantMode TranscriptomeSAM.</p><p>The RSEM (v1.2.19) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>) reference was created using the rsem-prepare-reference command. Gene estimates were generated by running rsem-calculate-expression on the STAR alignments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Clustering</title><p>The gene count estimates from RSEM were loaded into a scater (v1.2.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCarthy et al., 2017</xref>) SCESet object. Genes with log2(CPM) &gt;2 in at least 10 cells were retained in the analysis. Cells with greater than 20% mitochondrial reads, less than 500 thousand alignments, less than 500 measurable genes or less than 20% mRNA bases were removed from the analysis. SC3 (v1.3.18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kiselev et al., 2017</xref>) was run on the filtered SCESet object using k = 3 and gene filtering turned off.

RSEM gene count estimates from cells passing filtering were used in this analysis. Genes were retained if there were 10 or more counts in at least 10 cells. Error models were fit using the ‘scde.error.models’ function, expression magnitude priors for the genes were generated using the ‘scde.expression.prior’ function and differential expression was determined with the ‘scde.expression.difference’ function set to 100 randomizations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>Correlation with bulk RNA-Seq data</title><p>The differential expression results from the bulk cell and single cell analyses were intersected. Genes with an average count less than 1000 in the bulk cell samples were removed. The log2 fold change values from both analyses were plotted using ggplot2 (v2.2.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">ggplot, 2009</xref>).

The FactoMineR (v1.39) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le et al., 2008</xref>) function ‘PCA’ was run on the log-transformed TPM values and the first two components were plotted using ggplot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-6"><title>Normal tissue classification</title><p>TPM values were generated for each cluster by summing gene counts across the members of the cluster and dividing by the RSEM estimated gene length in kilobases to get the counts per base rate of each gene. These rates are divided by the sum of all rates and scaled by a million to get TPM. The TPM values for each cluster were then intersected with bulk cell TPM and normal tissue TPM downloaded from Encode (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Gene were restricted to those classified as ‘protein coding’ by Ensembl and had at least 10 counts in 10 or more cells.</p><p>High-expressing genes for each normal tissue were selected by first calculating the average tissue log2 CPM for each gene, which were then mean-centered across all tissues. The tissue with the highest expression was assigned its own mean-centered expression value. Once all genes were processed, the assigned genes in each tissue were ranked by expression and the top 70 were reported.</p><p>The Rtnse (v0.13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krijthe, 2018</xref>) function ‘Rtsne’ was used to generate a tSNE plot on the log2 TPM values of the tissue enriched genes. The perplexity was set to 13 and the initial dimensions was set to 5.</p><p>The FactoMineR function ‘PCA’ was run on the log2 TPM values with scaling turned off and five dimensions. The FactorMineR function ‘HCPC’ was then used perform a hierarchical clustering on principle component (HCPC) analysis on the PCA result.</p><p>Cosine similarity was calculated using the lsa (v0.73.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wild, 2015</xref>) function ‘cosine’.

RSEM and the Bowtie 1.0.1 aligner were used to map reads and estimate transcripts and gene counts using rsem-calculate-expression with the forward-prob 0 option for reversely stranded Illumina reads. The expected gene counts were filtered to remove 12371 features with zero counts and 10100 features with fewer than 10 reads in any sample.

Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation was overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>As you will see below, each of the reviewers was generally enthusiastic about the fundamental observations you made about FoxA genes in lung cancer.

Based on this, what I would request is that you look over the critiques below and provide a detailed plan for what you think you could achieve to address them within a two month window.

They conclude that both <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> are required for the maintenance of the adenocarcinoma phenotype. Interestingly, the timing of <italic>Foxa1/2</italic> inactivation determined the outcome of the eventual tumor phenotype.</p><p>The study is carefully executed and employs state-of-the-art approaches such a series of elegant genetically engineered mouse models as well as single-cell mRNA sequencing. The manuscript is well-written and the data are clearly presented. The manuscript is important, providing mechanistic insight into how cellular identity is transcriptionally regulated. The manuscript motivates further studies into identifying how epigenetic and genetic states dictate the outcome of lineage-determining transcription factors.</p><p>Major concern</p><p>The genetic evidence for the role of <italic>Foxa1/2</italic> in preserving lung adenocarcinoma identity in the mouse model is clear. However, the manuscript would greatly benefit from a comparison with human adenosquamous lung cancers. In human IMA, Nkx2.1 is often inactivated through point mutations that do not necessarily inactivate all functions of the protein (DNA binding, <italic>Foxa1/2</italic> binding, association with upstream regulators). In contrast, the mouse model produces a full deletion of both copies of Nkx2-1, leading to complete absence of the protein. Thus, the mechanism by which adenosquamous tumors arise may be different. At least computational analyses or additional discussion should be provided.</p><p>Overall, this is a high quality study and appropriate for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript Camolotto et al. provide evidence for <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> activating the expression of gastrointestinal genes in <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Nkx2-1<sup>F/F</sup></italic> driven ADC lesions in mice carrying either <italic>Foxa1/2</italic> deletions. It has been previously described that normal and neoplastic epithelial cells adopt a gastric differentiation state after <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> deletion and that the re-localization of the transcription factors <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> from pulmonary to gastrointestinal genes is the mechanism responsible for this change in differentiation (Snyder et al., 2013).</p><p>The authors show that <italic>Foxa1/2</italic> deletions correlates, in some cases, with squamous differentiation of tumor lesions. Since lung SCC is found adjacent to lung ADC (Adenosquamous lesions) in mice genetically proficient for either <italic>Foxa1</italic> or <italic>Foxa2</italic>, but actually negative for the expression of both, they suggest that only when the expression of one of the two genes is stochastically lost, mice develop SCC. In contrast, when both <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> are genetically deleted from the beginning, mice develop ADC expressing markers of the squamo-columnar junction of the gastrointestinal tract. They suggest that this difference is attributable to a different context in which the lineage specifier is lost.</p><p>In general, the idea that the effects of lineage specifier inactivation in cancer can be highly context-dependent is intriguing. However, the experiments as described lack important controls and quantifications to firmly conclude this.</p><p>Point by point discussion:</p><p>In invasive mucinous ADC (IMA) (Guo et al., 2017) <italic>Foxa2</italic> is not found commonly upregulated. However, <italic>Foxa3</italic> is, and it produces mucinous ADC in transgenic mouse models. Actually, <italic>Foxa3</italic> and 1 are the commonly upregulated genes in human and mouse IMA (Guo M). Does the expression of <italic>Foxa3</italic> change in mice upon <italic>Foxa1/2</italic> deletion? Can the authors exclude that HNF4α expression in <italic>Foxa1/2<sup>F/F</sup></italic>mice is activated by <italic>Foxa3</italic>? To confirm that <italic>Foxa1/2</italic> are indeed re-localized upon <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> deletion, include <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/+</sup></italic> mice proficient for <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> in the IHC panel of Figure 1. Add <italic>Foxa3</italic> staining.</p><p>The authors report a &quot;variable but substantial&quot; quantity of &quot;incomplete recombinants&quot; when they refer to mice carrying the double conditional deletion of <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic>. This needs substantiation at the different time points. If incomplete recombination is responsible for the tumor outgrowth one would expect regions that are highly positive for either FoxA1 or A2 (as seen in the <italic>Foxa1</italic> or <italic>Foxa2</italic> single knockouts). However, the staining is rather dispersed as if deletion of non-recombined alleles continues. How do the authors reconcile this with the prolific outgrowth of partial recombinants? If recombination does indeed proceed (through lentiviral Cre expression) this then should promote squamous differentiation according to the model the authors propose but this does not occur.</p><p>Can the authors formally exclude that instead of incomplete recombination, the result is due to the fact that <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> deletion is just not sufficient to suppress the gastric differentiation? What about FoxA3?</p><p>The authors use subsequently 2 different models to support the context-dependence of LCC development: i) <italic>Kras<sup>FSF-G12D/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Rosa<sup>FSF-CreERT2</sup>; Nkx2-1<sup>F/F</sup></italic>; <italic>Foxa1F/F; FoxaF/F</italic> mice in which mutant <italic>Kras</italic> is first activated via Ad5CMV-FlpO, and one week later, tamoxifen is administered to activate <italic>Foxa1/2</italic> deletions. The sequential introduction of these lesions results in LSCC which is already detectable at 5 weeks. ii) <italic>KrasG12D /+; Nkx2-1F/F</italic>; <italic>Foxa1F/F; FoxaF/F</italic> mice infected with Ad5-CMV-Cre; at 5 weeks no LSCC is found. They conclude that in the context in which mutant <italic>Kras</italic> is already activated, <italic>Foxa1/2</italic> deletion gives rise to SCC; when mutations occur at the same time, mice develop ADC. This possible, but this requires better control of the experiment. They need to assess potential effects of tamoxifen treatment (e.g. by giving Tamoxifen also in the model in &quot;ii&quot;. They should also analyze mice after a longer period.</p><p>Can the authors exclude that markers for the squamo-columnar junction cells of the gastrointestinal tract, are shared with precursors of lung SCC? It would help to include other markers of SCC, such as K5, K14, SOX2, which are also robust markers and are already expressed in intermediate lesions committed to squamous differentiation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Camolotta and colleagues examine the consequences of deleting <italic>Nkx2-1, Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> in the <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> lung adenocarcinoma model. Previously, they had shown that deletion of <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> in <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> -driven lung adenocarcinoma results in mucinous conversion with corresponding molecular switch from lung to gastric epithelial identity. Here, they report that deletion of <italic>Nkx2-1, Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> following <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> initiation results in squamous transdifferentiation with lack of gastric marker expression. However, when the factors are deleted concomitant with <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> induction, a different tumor phenotype results and cells have molecular features of the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) of the GI tract. The authors speculate that the differential effect from sequential manipulation results from epigenetic changes induced by Kras activity.</p><p>The main conclusion of the work and title of the manuscript, that it is <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> that mediate the gastric differentiation in <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> negative lung adenocarcinoma, is entirely unsurprising. <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> are already known to directly regulate expression of gastric target genes, so clearly their deletion in <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> deficient tumor cells should compromise expression of gastric markers. This finding by itself does not really represent a significant advance in the field.</p><p>The different phenotypes resulting from concurrent deletion and activation of <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> versus deletion seven days after induction of <italic>Kras</italic> is very interesting, but no evidence that this is due to epigenetic changes induced by <italic>Kras</italic> is provided. It seems at least equally plausible that the distinct tumor histology represents transformation of a different (non-AT2) cell type. This alternate model would also explain why there was a reduction in tumor number, since if only the molecular identity and proliferation of recombined AT2 cells were influenced, one might expect the same number of tumors but of smaller size. There were also fewer tumors when only <italic>Foxa1</italic> was deleted, which they did not attempt to explain. Unfortunately, without inducing <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> in a cell type-specific manner, it is impossible to deconvolute the cell of origin retrospectively, particularly when the tumor lacks expression of lung cell type markers. So, I don't feel there is really any reasonably supported explanation for this important finding, and whether it results from an epigenetic effect versus a different cell of origin would drastically alter the model.</p><p>Regarding the possibility that the molecular phenotype of these small tumors is of SCJ cells, it is unclear why this would be the case, since SCJ cells apparently express <italic>Foxa1</italic>. Wouldn't deletion of <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> thus be more likely to induce a SCJ identity than deletion of all three factors? So, without further exploration this interpretation seems provisional.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38579.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As you will see below, each of the reviewers was generally enthusiastic about the fundamental observations you made about FoxA genes in lung cancer.

We are excited to report that we have been able to develop a novel adenovirus that allows us to address the major concern about cell of origin enumerated in the summary letter. In brief, we now show that SPC-positive lung epithelial cells can give rise to squamous cell carcinoma upon loss of NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2. Please see below for detailed response to each reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The genetic evidence for the role of Foxa1/2 in preserving lung adenocarcinoma identity in the mouse model is clear.

To address this question, we have obtained tissue sections from 12 primary human AdSCC cases in which levels of both FoxA1 and FoxA2 could be evaluated by IHC in both the adenocarcinoma (ACA) and squamous (SCC) components. In six cases, FoxA1 and FoxA2 were both downregulated in the SCC component compared with the ACA component. In five cases, only FoxA2 was downregulated in the SCC (FoxA1 was expressed in both components) and in one case, FoxA1 was downregulated in SCC (FoxA2 was expressed in both components). We have added a graph and representative images (Figure 4D-E) reflecting these new data. These data show that FoxA1/2 downregulation is associated with squamous differentiation in human AdSCC. Human cancers are more heterogeneous than any given mouse model, so it is not surprising that we observe more than one distinct pattern of changes in FoxA1/2 levels in these cases. Nevertheless, the fact that all cases exhibited lower levels of FoxA1 and/or FoxA2 in the SCC component suggests that our results are highly relevant to the human disease, and that loss of these transcription factors may also be causative for adenosquamous transdifferentiation in human lung cancer. Although we don’t have access to genetic analysis of these samples, we predict that mutational spectrum and/or cell of origin may dictate whether loss of one or both FoxA transcription factors is sufficient for squamous transdifferentiation in this disease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, this is a high quality study and appropriate for the readership of eLife.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] In general, the idea that the effects of lineage specifier inactivation in cancer can be highly context-dependent is intriguing.

Add Foxa3 staining.</italic> </p><p>Although <italic>Foxa2</italic> is not commonly upregulated at the mRNA level in human IMA, it is readily detectable at the protein level in this disease (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Our single cell RNA-Seq data (Supplementary file 3) shows that <italic>Foxa3</italic> is more highly expressed in cluster C2 (KN) than C3 (KNF1F2) or C1 (K), demonstrating that FoxA1/2 drive <italic>Foxa3</italic> expression in NKX2-1-negative tumors. (<italic>Foxa3</italic> is also higher in KN vs. K tumors in our total RNA-Seq analysis, Supplementary file 4). Unfortunately, we were not able to identify commercially available IHC-quality antibody to characterize FoxA3 at the protein level. Review of the literature indicates that the polyclonal antibody sc-5361 has been used by other authors in IHC. However, this antibody has been discontinued by the manufacturer (Santa Cruz). Nevertheless, it is clear from our RNA-Seq data that FoxA1/2 are required for expression of both HNF4α and FoxA3. The experiments in this manuscript are not designed to test the regulatory interaction between HNF4α and FoxA3. There are several lineage specifiers regulated by FoxA1/2 in NKX2-1-negative lung adenocarcinoma (including PDX1, HNF4γ and HNF1α), and in future work it would be interesting to define their hierarchical regulatory interactions. We do not believe it is necessary to include IHC on NKX2-1 positive tumors because they have been shown to lack gastric markers in Snyder et al., 2013 and Maeda et al. JCI 2012. This is further demonstrated by the RNA-seq data presented in this manuscript (Supplementary files 3-4). We also extensively characterized FoxA1/2 re-localization by ChIP-seq in Snyder et al., 2013.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors report a &quot;variable but substantial&quot; quantity of &quot;incomplete recombinants&quot; when they refer to mice carrying the double conditional deletion of Foxa1 and Foxa2.

In this graph, we show that the proportion of HNF4α-positive incomplete recombinants increases over time, consistent with the growth advantage we would expect from the data presented in Figure 2. These HNF4α-positive incomplete recombinants always retain either FoxA1 and/or FoxA2 expression. Thus, we infer that expression of Cre has been lost in these lesions. This is an expected result since lentiviral integration into the genome is random and genes delivered by the lentivirus can be readily downregulated. We have added a photomicrograph of an incomplete recombinant to further illustrate this point (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>In response to the comment: “the staining is rather dispersed as if deletion of non-recombined alleles continues”.If thisrefers to Figure 1, we want to clarify that the photomicrographs in this figure all show complete recombinants.

The SPC promoter has previously been used by Anton Berns and others to drive Cre expression specifically in SPC-positive type 2 pneumocytes of the lung (Sutherland et al., 2011). We used this virus to specifically target SPC-positive cells in <italic>Kras<sup>FSF-G12D/+</sup>; Rosa<sup>FSF-CreERT2</sup>; Nkx2-1<sup>F/F</sup>; Foxa1<sup>F/F</sup>; Foxa2<sup>F/F</sup></italic>mice. As shown in the new Figure 6, infection with Ad-SPC-FlpO followed by tamoxifen 1 week later leads to the development of both keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma lesions and SCJ-like lesions at the 5 week timepoint (similar to the phenotypes we observed with the CMV-FlpO adenovirus, Figure 5). Thus, SCC can arise from SPC-positive cells. The fact that SPC-positive cells can frequently give rise to SCC in this experiment is particularly surprising given recent work (Nagaraj et al., 2017) showing that squamous lesions in <italic>Kras; Lkb1</italic> conditional mice arise almost exclusively from CC10-positive cells rather than SPC-positive cells. These data suggest an unexpected degree of lineage plasticity within the SPC-positive population.</p><p>Although these data show that loss of three lineage specifiers (NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2) is sufficient for SCC formation in SPC-positive cells, they also raise the question of why SPC-positive cells can give rise to two distinct phenotypes upon the same genetic manipulation (CK5-positive SCC vs. CK7-positive SCJ-like lesions). In the Discussion, we point to various potential sources of this heterogeneity, including cell cycle status at the time of lineage specifier deletion, heterogeneity within the SPC-positive population, or even purely stochastic elements. Investigating these alternatives will likely form the basis of a future manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the possibility that the molecular phenotype of these small tumors is of SCJ cells, it is unclear why this would be the case, since SCJ cells apparently express Foxa1.

So, without further exploration this interpretation seems provisional.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that cancer cells are fundamentally sui generis and have tried not to overinterpret the data or argue that they are exactly the same as any normal cell type. Nevertheless, it is striking that many SCJ markers are upregulated in cancer cells that concomitantly lose NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2. Moreover, these tumor cells still cluster with the normal upper GI tract in our bioinformatic analysis. Taken together, these data suggest that they are more like SCJ cells than any other discrete cell type we have been able to identify. We respectfully disagree with the argument that deletion of <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> would be more likely to induce an SCJ-like identity. Through careful titration of FoxA1 IHC, we have found that FoxA1 levels at the SCJ are extremely low (much lower than FoxA1 levels in <italic>Nkx2-1/Foxa2</italic> deleted tumors) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F vs. Figure 1). We have added arrows to this figure to make this point clear. Thus, we would argue that overall FoxA1/2 activity at the SCJ is likely to be much lower than in <italic>Nkx2-1/Foxa2</italic> deleted tumors. Unfortunately, there is no publicly available gene expression data for the recently described KRT7-positive SCJ cells identified by Jiang et al. (Jiang et al., 2017), and we do not have the tools to isolate these cells ourselves.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“There were also fewer tumors when only Foxa1 was deleted, which they did not attempt to explain.”</p></disp-quote><p>Although <italic>Foxa1</italic> deletion had a mild effect on tumor burden, it had no effect on proliferation rate or overall survival. Indeed, the most striking effect of <italic>Foxa1</italic> deletion was enhanced mucin secretion at late timepoints (Figure 2—figure supplement 1I). Although we suspect that FoxA1 and FoxA2 have some non-redundant functions in NKX2-1-negative tumors, we found that deleting both led to much more significant phenotypes, and thus we prioritized the analysis of complete FoxA1/2 loss as being the most impactful area of investigation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
