However, how TARPs modulate AMPA receptor gating remains poorly understood. We built structural models of TARP-AMPA receptor complexes for TARPs γ2 and γ8, combining recent structural studies and de novo structure predictions. These models, combined with peptide binding assays, provide evidence for multiple interactions between GluA2 and variable extracellular loops of TARPs. Substitutions and deletions of these loops had surprisingly rich effects on the kinetics of glutamate-activated currents, without any effect on assembly. Critically, by altering the two interacting loops of γ2 and γ8, we could entirely remove all allosteric modulation of GluA2, without affecting formation of AMPA receptor-TARP complexes. Likewise, substitutions in the linker domains of GluA2 completely removed any effect of γ2 on receptor kinetics, indicating a dominant role for this previously overlooked site proximal to the AMPA receptor channel gate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>receptor kinetics</kwd><kwd>modulation</kwd><kwd>superactivation</kwd><kwd>desensitization</kwd><kwd>glutamate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship and studentship Cluster of Excellence NeuroCure EXC-257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carbone</surname><given-names>Anna L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Erwin-Schrödinger Postdoctoral Fellowship J3682-B21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eibl</surname><given-names>Clarissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Group Dynion FOR 2518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plested</surname><given-names>Andrew JR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Heisenberg Professor</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plested</surname><given-names>Andrew JR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Glutamate receptor auxiliary proteins exert their effects on receptor gating through two divergent extracellular loops, explaining subunit specificity and allowing the construction of null versions that form complexes normally but do not modify receptor gating.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the identification of the protein Stargazin, also known as γ2, as the prototype transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein (TARP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2000</xref>), several families of auxiliary proteins for the AMPA receptor have been described that include TARPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwenk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tomita et al., 2003</xref>), cornichons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwenk et al., 2009</xref>), GSG1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shanks et al., 2012</xref>) and CKAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Engelhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>). These proteins play an essential role in tethering AMPA-type glutamate receptors at the synapse, and also exert complex control over surface expression of functional receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dakoji et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamazaki et al., 2010</xref>). Auxiliary proteins regulate the function of AMPA receptors, with both positive and negative modulation of gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Engelhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Priel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rouach et al., 2005</xref>), as well as control over permeation and block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Soto et al., 2007</xref>). The range of auxiliary subunit influence over synaptic transmission is compounded by striking regional and cell-type specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tomita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kato et al., 2007</xref>), and a patchwork of interaction patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bats et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kato et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>TARPs and other auxiliary proteins modify the gating and pharmacology of synaptic AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudkkazi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Milstein et al., 2007</xref>). The physiological importance of modulation is likely to be the specialization of particular codes of short-term plasticity, in the hippocampus and cerebellum at least (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Engelhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khodosevich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devi et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, antagonists of AMPA receptors that target GluA2–γ8 complexes were described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2016</xref>), further enhancing interest in the molecular basis of complexes of GluA subunits and their auxiliary proteins as potential drug targets.</p><p>Previous studies showed that some of the effects of auxiliary proteins on receptor gating were due to the extracellular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tomita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tomita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2007</xref>). However, several of these studies made use of chimeras with γ5, which was presumed to be a null subunit, but which was subsequently shown to modulate gating and conductance of GluA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soto et al., 2009</xref>). The results obtained from these studies are therefore difficult to interpret because modulatory effects observed could have been mediated by either of the TARPs forming the chimera. Although some mutations in extracellular portions of TARPs were reported that affect TARP activity, there is no clear indication that these TARPs formed complexes with GluA subunits as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cais et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, some studies of assembly made use of functional tests to assess the strength of interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shi et al., 2009</xref>). Given the variable stoichiometry of assembly between different TARP isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hastie et al., 2013</xref>), interpreting these data, which combine the strength of association, expression and modulation into a single metric, is difficult. Very recently, a chimeric approach confirmed impressions from structural studies that transmembrane interactions are important for proper assembly, with the TM3 and TM4 segments of γ2 and the M1-M3 helices of the AMPA receptor determining complex assembly. However, the C-termini of both the AMPA receptor and TARPs also appear to be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Yaacov et al., 2017</xref>). Despite these insights, there is very little information about the extent to which different domains contribute to gating of complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Twomey et al., 2017a</xref>), and no information about the structural basis of slow modulation, superactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbone and Plested, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Two of the predominant TARPs in the brain are the auxiliary proteins γ2 and γ8. In this work, we isolate the extracellular segments of γ2 and γ8 that are responsible for modulation of gating, and show that these segments act on the receptor via the linkers connecting the ligand binding domain (LBD) and the transmembrane domain (TMD). In so doing, we were able to produce ‘null’ TARPs, which assemble normally but show no modulation of gating. Hereby, we establish mechanisms for the subunit specific modulation of AMPA receptors by auxiliary proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A model of auxiliary protein interactions</title><p>Previous studies of TARP modulation of AMPA receptors have identified extracellular regions as potential interaction motifs.

More recently, cryo-EM/single particle analysis of GluA2-TARP complexes allowed unambiguous positioning of TARPs at the periphery of the GluA2 pore, and partially resolved the extracellular domains of TARPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Twomey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>).

Based on the crystal structure of the related claudin15 (PDB code: 4P79) we first generated structural models of TARP γ2 and γ8 including the presumably flexible loop 1, which is not resolved in the cryo-EM AMPA-γ2 complex structures (PDB code: 5KBU and 5KK2). To ensure that the models obeyed good stereochemistry, we analyzed them with MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). The analysis of the in silico models revealed bad bonds and angles of 0.3% and 1.4% for γ2 and 0.2% and 1.6% for γ8. These TARP models were superposed onto the γ2 chains in the cryo-EM GluA2-γ2 complex (PDB code: 5KK2). L1 had to be repositioned in order to avoid a steric clash with the LBD. We show two extreme conformations of L1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, purely to illustrate the reach of L1, which seems likely a function of its length (compare L1 of γ2 and γ8). The principal advantage of building these models was to enable us to concentrate on a range of physically-plausible interactions at the linkers and the lower regions of the LBD layer, and effectively rule out ATD contacts, because the unstructured loops are too short.</p><p>Comparing these hybrid models to CryoEM electron density maps suggested that a range of interaction sites with the LBD-TMD linkers and D2 domains of the LBD are possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Whereas TARP loop 2 (L2) could engage in the receptor’s pore four-fold symmetry, loop 1 (L1) reaches up to the two-fold symmetry of the LBD layer. In other words, while L2 can interact four times in the same way with the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), L1 has at least two distinct modes of interaction depending on to which receptor subunits the TARP is adjacent (subunit A-D and B-C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, or A-B and C-D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The variable loop 1 is not resolved in structures to date, consistent with it being a flexible modulatory element. Superactivation of GluA2 receptors resembles strongly the slow modulation of AMPA receptors by particular allosteric modulators that bind at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbone and Plested, 2016</xref>). We reasoned that extracellular loop interactions that stabilized the superactive state could preferentially target the GluA2 LBD dimer. To test this hypothesis of direct interactions between loop 1 and the GluA2 LBDs, we composed an overlapping library of hexameric peptides encompassing the extracellular sections of TARPs, targeting primarily the long loop 1 of γ2 and γ8, and other potential interacting sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Because the active dimer of LBDs ought to be intact for superactivation, we compared the interactions of our peptide library, which was spotted onto cellulose membranes and then either incubated with the monomeric GluA2 LBD (flip form) or LBDs harboring the L483Y substitution, which greatly increases dimer formation in solution (compare left and right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Repeated peptide mapping array assays indicated no clear preference for either monomeric or dimeric GluA2 LBD. However, in accordance with our hypothesis the majority of the L1 of both γ2 and γ8 contain hits (dark spots within the purple boxes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) in the peptide mapping array, indicating direct interaction with the receptor LBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), albeit in conditions lacking the usual steric constraints of the complex. In the recent cryo-EM structures of the GluA2-TARP complex a possible interaction between a conserved negatively charged region (negative patch, NP) located on the TARP β4-TM2 loop and the KGK motif in the lower lobe of the GluA2 LBD was predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Twomey et al., 2016</xref>). Thus we also tested for this potential interaction in the peptide mapping array but found no hits. A functional test of neutralizing three of the six acidic residues in this patch (D88G, E90S, D92G) made γ2 into a much stronger modulator of AMPAR gating, with the steady-state current and superactivation both doubled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result suggested that if interactions of the TARP negative patch with the receptor alter function, they actually inhibit the action of γ2. However, other sites have a dominant effect in the positive modulation of gating.</p><p>We also tested L2 of γ2 and γ8 in the peptide mapping array for possible interactions with the LBDs because of its conserved charged features (4 and 7 charges), which are less prominent in γ5 and γ7 (3 and 1 charges respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Considering L2 being positioned distant underneath the LBD (around 15 Å, measured between Cα of GluA2 Pro717 and γ2 Lys170 in the complex from PDB code: 5KBU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Twomey et al., 2016</xref>]) in the cryo-EM structures, it was not surprising that we found no interaction between L2 peptides and the GluA2 LBD. According to our GluA2-TARP models, in both γ2 and γ8, L2 is adjacent to the receptor S1-M1 and S2-M4 linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), which are outside the realms of our LBD construct.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Modulation of fast AMPA receptor gating by TARP L1 and L2 segments</title><p>To investigate the role of the extracellular domain of TARPs in controlling AMPA receptor activation, we made a series of chimeras and deletion mutants between γ2 and γ8. We first targeted the long loop in the first extracellular segment L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that has markedly different lengths and sequence content across the TARP family and its homologs. We also investigated the role of the shorter unstructured region in the second extracellular segment L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which is poised to interact with the LBD-TMD linkers of the AMPA receptor.</p><p>We first swapped L1 between γ2 and γ8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), and assessed effects on desensitization.

These chimeras exhibited asymmetric effects on desensitization. When activated by 10 mM glutamate, the chimera of γ2 with L1 from γ8 had steady-state current of 50 ± 5% (<italic>n</italic> = 30; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), twice as large as γ2 alone (25 ± 2%, <italic>n</italic> = 24 patches), and the rate of entry to desensitization was approximately halved (35 ± 5 s<sup>−1</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 30; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

To assess these possibilities, we measured the G-V relations for all the chimeras and deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, all mutants gave responses that were strongly reduced in rectification, indicating that complex formation between mutant TARPs and AMPAR subunits was normal. Broadly, each chimera closely followed the polyamine relief induced by the parent TARP, with γ2 chimeras producing populations of receptors that exhibited a greater rectification index than those based on γ8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). A complication is that modulation of gating and block could depend differently on TARP content within complexes. These results do not address the question of stoichiometry but do strongly suggest that the mutations we made did not change the propensity of γ2 and γ8 to form complexes with AMPAR subunits.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Superactivation of AMPA-TARP complexes</title><p>TARPs induce a subtype-specific superactivation of the GluA2 homomeric receptor. γ8 is a much stronger modifier of this slow gating mode than γ2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">(Kato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbone and Plested, 2016</xref>). We investigated the role of the extracellular domain in superactivation using the same set of TARP mutants, but using 7 s applications of glutamate to measure the equilibrium level reached following superactivation.

With the caveat that we can at best measure a level of current of about 1% of the peak current, limiting the resolution of the reduction in current upon mutation, we could detect only weak coupling for the steady-state current, but coupling of approximately 4.5 kJ/Mol in the case of superactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To discern whether the loss of modulation occurred because the linker sites are the primary interaction site, or whether the linkers both interact with TARPs and transmit upstream modulation from sites in the LBD, we assessed modulation by γ8 and related chimeras. The propensity of γ8 to modulate gating of the double linker mutant (GluA2 GAG/GSG) was reduced, but robust superactivation could still be observed (25 ± 5%, <italic>n</italic> = 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Given this result, which suggested that L1 could still modulate gating of complexes, we hypothesized that the γ2 chimera incorporating the L1 of γ8 should also modulate the double linker mutant.

Therefore, in the absence of the long L1, γ8 fails to modulate GluA2 when the S1-M1 and S2-M4 linker interaction sites are removed (again consistent with its cousin lacking L2 interaction sites, the L1 γ2 in γ8 L2_GS variant; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these results indicate that the long loop of γ8 L1 is still able to modulate complexes at extracellular sites with the receptor linker sites disrupted, supporting the idea that the linkers do not function primarily to transduce distant TARP modulation. Rather, the LBD-TMD linkers are the primary modulatory site for both γ8 and γ2. The latter has a short L1 loop, and cannot modulate receptors if the L2 interaction is absent. However, γ8 combines the longer L1 and the L2 site to modulate receptor properties more effectively, in a compound fashion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results we present here offer several new insights into TARP function. First of all, extracellular sites account for all the modification of AMPA receptor gating by TARPs. Previous work showed that L1 could transfer aspects of modulation between TARPs, but our experiments indicate that the second short extracellular segment (L2), which varies strongly in sequence between TARPs, is dominant. Further work will be required to establish the generality of this modulatory mechanism.</p><p>Secondly, these same sites do not have any appreciable role in determining assembly of TARP-AMPA receptor complexes. Interactions between transmembrane segments and intracellular regions are responsible for assembly and modulation of polyamine block. We speculate that this division of roles arises because state-dependent gating modification results from transient interactions on a timescale far faster than receptor assembly. Long-lived molecular interactions (~10 s and above) could also underlie modification of gating, but it seems unlikely that fast conformational changes regulate assembly of complexes.</p><p>Thirdly, we show that the linkers to the transmembrane domain are key sites for modulation of AMPA receptor gating by auxiliary proteins, and provide insights into the molecular basis of this interaction. The identified sites in the LBD-TMD linkers are highly conserved among all AMPA receptor subunits but not present in the related NMDA and kainate receptors, which are not modulated by TARPs. However, for native receptors, other motifs probably prohibit assembly of TARPs into complexes with these subtypes before the question of modulation is pertinent. Previous work suggested ATD interactions and prominent roles for the LBD in modulation of AMPARs by TARPs, but the interactions we demonstrate here are much more proximal to the channel gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cais et al., 2014</xref>). We could show a very close functional confluence between modifying the receptor itself and modifying each TARP, at an interaction site predicted from structural modeling. The elimination of modulation by nullifying L2 of γ2, or by mutating residues in the LBD-TMD linkers of GluA2, strongly implicates this site as a pivotal interaction underlying modulation. Putative electrostatic interactions posited from structural studies require a large conformational change (between 13 Å and 25 Å depending on the TARP’s position in the complex; measured between C-alpha atoms from GluA2 K699 and γ2 D92 in cryo-EM complexes 5kbu and 5kk2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Twomey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). A key point here is that these interactions are secondary to those involving L2 at the AMPAR linkers. These interactions should occur readily for each auxiliary protein subunit, allowing a maximal 4:4 stoichiometry with minimal conformational change for γ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). For other auxiliary proteins, for example γ8, the stoichiometry of the L2-linker interaction would vary with the number of associated TARPs, but will not be limited by position of the TARP within the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Finally, neutralization of the major part of the acidic patch strongly enhanced modulation of gating by γ2, ruling out that negative charges here have a dominant role in modulation.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28680.023</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism of AMPA modulation by TARPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of a AMPA-γ2 complex in front view (<italic>left</italic>) and top view (<italic>right</italic>).

The receptor is colored in grey (pore forming M3 domain depicted in dark grey). γ8 is colored as in panel B, with the acidic patch omitted. In the resting state (indicated by a red, closed pore) L2 is positioned in close proximity to the LBD-TMD connecting linkers. Once glutamate binds to the LBD, the resulting conformational change is transduced via the LBD-TMD linkers to open the pore (olive green, open state). During this transition L2 could wedge between the S1-M1 and S2-M4 linkers to modulate the receptor gating. The concerted action of L1 and L2 is necessary for superactivation of the receptor (dark green, high open probability state), most likely via L1 to stabilizing the LBDs layer.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28680-fig8-v2"/></fig><p>Fourth, we show that the long extracellular loop 1 of γ8 is a very strong positive modulator of AMPA receptor gating, whose influence is likely held in check by the substoichiometric combination of γ8 with the AMPA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hastie et al., 2013</xref>). The subunit γ8 slows receptor desensitization via L1. This loop can produce a profound block of desensitization when transplanted to γ2, and probably interacts state-specifically with the LBD dimer because of its substantial reach (for examples see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Previous kinetic measurements suggest that superactivation is adopted by a minor population of receptors in equilibrium with saturating glutamate, speaking in favor of a weak interaction that is boosted by the high effective concentration of L1 close to its site of action in the receptor complex.</p><p>Our approach to fit Claudins with modeled loops from TARPs into the best resolution cryoEM reconstruction available (5KK2, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>]) has clear implications for modulation. Our model, when compared to the independently derived model of TARP-AMPA modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Twomey et al., 2016</xref>), presents the TARPs oriented at a subtly different angle. Therefore, our model predicted the L2 interaction on the basis of one set of CryoEM data. We could not adequately incorporate the loops and the original structures of the receptor linkers in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whilst this problem could be due to deficits in our model, another explanation is that the linkers (S1-M1 and S2-M4) are disrupted from their basal positions, and that the L2 loop can wedge between them. Upon activation, it is expected that the linkers will move away from the overall pore axis, which could permit further state-dependent interactions (See cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p><p>Future structural studies may permit a more detailed view into the interactions between L2 and the linker domains of AMPAR. Although Claudin structures allowed positioning of auxiliary proteins with high confidence within CryoEM reconstructions, the loops that we have investigated here are not resolved within these structures, possibly because they interact transiently and are otherwise disordered. Although our peptide array suggested that stretches of L1 interact with the LBD, we were not able to obtain co-crystal structures of peptides with monomeric or dimeric forms of the GluA2 LBD. Nonetheless, knowledge of Claudin structures enabled us to make structurally sympathetic substitutions into TARPs for functional experiments that did not disrupt expression or assembly of complexes. These approaches are in contrast with most previous work which simply swapped extracellular portions, including mismatching the folded portions of the TARP extracellular domain. Two observations highlight the importance of sympathetic exchanges. First, some naive deletions would be expected to alter TARP structure. The simple deletion of L2 would severely disrupt the extracellular domain of γ2 or γ8, because this segment connects structured regions separated by about 10 Å. Second, some deletion chimeras we made retained modulation, with the most striking example being γ8 ∆L1 L2_GS, which retained a substantial steady state current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The residual modulation could be related to the presence of a few residues from L1 in the γ8 ∆L1 L2_GS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Without maintaining these residues, the chimera did not express. This observation illustrates the sensitivity of domain boundaries in TARPs.</p><p>Because our observations suggest that the AMPA receptor linkers are key to TARP modulation, it is likely that chimeric receptors with altered linkers that exhibit constitutive gating are bad reporters of the TARP-GluA modulation, although they clearly delineate assembly motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Yaacov et al., 2017</xref>). The molecular nature of the interactions we have identified here raise the intriguing possibility that acute disassembly of complexes, rather than modulation, might be the target of recent subtype specific drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our results allow us to construct a tentative model for the distinct forms of modulation that TARPs produce (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The slow increase in glutamate efficacy, which we term superactivation, is specified by the combination of L1 and L2, whereas the basal increase in steady state current arises from L2 alone. We previously modeled the modulatory interaction between TARPs and the AMPA receptor with single conformational change, but did not consider desensitization. The concerted involvement of multiple loops suggests multiple conformational states are required to describe the interaction, most notably in the case of γ8. The greater conformational space that can be explored by loop 1, and its strong connection to superactivation, indicate that these conformational changes could relate to the slow transitions represented in the model of superactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbone and Plested, 2016</xref>). In contrast, conformational changes of the linker region of the AMPA receptor upon opening will naturally lead to a state-dependent interaction with L2 of γ2 or γ8, because of the direct proximity. A further level of complexity is that an intact L2 segment is required for the strong superactivation induced by γ8, but is not required at all for slow desensitization behavior that the long L1 loop of γ8 can produce. Because in these experiments, slow desensitization occurs when occupancy of superactive states is low, we can quite reasonably assume that L1 adopts multiple conformations to stabilize separate functional states of the receptor, and that some functional signatures require a concerted action of both loops. Additional stabilization of desensitized states by the variable loop 1 is also likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Twomey et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>This work has produced mutant TARPs and AMPA receptors that both lack modulatory properties, and also those that have greatly enhanced modulation. Both these signatures of activity should be useful tools for investigating TARP action in synapses, including understanding the relative importance of assembly into complexes for anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Opazo et al., 2010</xref>) as opposed to kinetic modulation, for clarifying the consequences of TARP modulation for short term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devi et al., 2016</xref>), and for better identifying TARPs in ternary complexes with other auxiliary subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khodosevich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herring et al., 2013</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Note</title><p>Whilst this manuscript was being revised, an open AMPAR structure in complex with TARP γ2 was released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Twomey et al., 2017b</xref>).

Superactivation was measured during a 7 s application of glutamate and was defined as the excess steady-state amplitude following the desensitization trough, normalized to the peak current. The GV relationships were calculated as the ratio between the current amplitude and the voltage step at which it was measured (−80 /+120), normalized against the value obtained at −80 mV.

A triple exponential function was used to fit the slowly augmenting current of superactivation measurements. To account for possible variability in the response and expression of the complexes, we tried to record at least 5–6 patches from at least three different transfections for each condition. For experiments with very low success rates (that is, worse than 1 patch in 20 giving an acceptable recording), in the presence of γ8, at least three patches were collected.

The spot array consisted of hexameric overlapping peptides shifted by one residue. Peptide spotted membranes were rinsed with ethanol for 5 min, following three times 10 min washing with TBS and incubation with blocking buffer (Casein Blocking buffer (Sigma B6429), 150 mM Saccharose, in TBS) for 3 hr at RT. The blocking buffer was removed by three wash steps with TBS before the membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with either 50 µg/ml His-tagged protein (GluA2_LBD or GluA2_LBD_LY) in blocking buffer or blocking buffer only for control (to exclude non-specific binding from the antibodies to the peptides).

The peptide spot array is a semiquantitative method to determine binding affinities in the range from nM to higher µM values (the darker the spots the stronger the interaction). As the His-tagged protein is applied in casein containing blocking buffer the detected signals from the His-tagged protein must be higher affine than the unspecific binding from casein to the peptides. Hits from peptides located within β-sheets were taken to be false positives, because when isolated these peptides likely form unphysiological β-sheets in a non-specific manner with existing structures in the GluA2 LBD.

Superposing our final TARP models onto the γ2 molecules present in the AMPA-TARP cryo-EM structure (PDB code: 5KK2) in PyMOL (v1.6) yielded in the AMPA-TARP complexes shown in our Figures.

In the present manuscript, the authors use chimeras as well as site specific mutations to identify interactions of the extracellular regions of gamma2 and gamma8, L1 loop and L2 loop, with AMPA receptor subunits. They find that L1 loop, which interacts predominantly with LBD, modulates desensitization properties. On the other hand, L2 loop, which presumably interacts with the LBD-TMD linkers, has much more notable effects on desensitization and superactivation. The authors are also able to generate what they call kinetic null constructs – constructs that show no effect on gating – for either the extracellular loops of gamma2 or gamma8 as well as for LBD-TMD linkers. This is a particularly interesting discovery. Overall, the manuscript is well-written and for the most part data are presented clearly. The results and conclusions are extremely interesting. There was concern with the model because it wasn't clear how it was generated and it has not been validated as far as we could see. The following are essential revisions that the authors should address.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The value and validity of the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is unclear. The authors need to expand on the description of how the model was generated and describe what kind of constraints were added to the loop region. The fact that there is no density in cryo-EM may indicate that the loop is disordered or has too many conformations to be tracked. We think that the quality of the manuscript, which is otherwise excellent, is diminished by this casual web-based model and the extent to which the authors build hypotheses around it. The authors should also try to validate the model, perhaps by calculating rmsd for bond length and bond angle using programs such as Procheck and Molprobity, keeping in mind that this analysis only tests the geometrical parameters of created models and cannot validate the existence of the loop conformations that authors show in their manuscript. We also request that the authors revise the manuscript to diminish the extent to which the model is used to frame hypotheses and perhaps simply state that the &quot;loop is long enough to perhaps transiently interact with AMPAR LBD.&quot;</p><p>2) The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> need to be better introduced and documented by the authors. It is very difficult to know what the authors did here experimentally. Did the authors detect bound LBD tagged with poly histidine tag? It needs some explanations in the figure legend or in the Materials and methods section. The authors also need to justify what they think this assay can tell us. How strong or specific must the interactions be to be detected here? There are multiple controls in these experiments, and the authors should walk the reader through them and explain how they constrain their results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28680.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The value and validity of the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is unclear.

We extended the description on how this model was generated, and included values from the model validation with MolProbity in the second paragraph of the Results subsection “A model of auxiliary protein interactions”. We did not add additional constraints to the loop regions other than those that are used by the model-building servers. It is true that we do not have good information about where loop 1 is. Even in the context of the latest structural data, we have very little information about potential interactions (and nothing for gamma-8). The major aim of the model was to ensure that we know where loop 1 is not. Principally, with this simple model we could limit the physically plausible interacting sites to the LBD, therefore legitimising our peptide screen. Apart from this, we simply took two extreme positions that were possible for the loop 1, taking into account data from Bowie’s lab that the “KGK motif” could be involved somehow. We try to make this rationale clearer in the text now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> need to be better introduced and documented by the authors.

We added more information in the Materials and methods on the specificity and binding strength that is expected in the case of a positive result in this assay (subsection “Structural modeling”). The negative control is also explained. The results were rewritten to better explain that we were probing direct interactions between the receptor LBD and the extra-cellular segment of TARPs. Further changes were made to the figure legend to guide the reader through the experiment. We hope that the text is now clearer, and appropriately describes what can be learned from this experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
