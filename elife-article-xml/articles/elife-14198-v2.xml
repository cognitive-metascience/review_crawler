neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome, caused by mutations in <italic>MECP2</italic>, produces a diverse array of symptoms, including loss of language, motor, and social skills and the development of hand stereotypies, anxiety, tremor, ataxia, respiratory dysrhythmias, and seizures. Surprisingly, despite the diversity of these features, we have found that deleting <italic>Mecp2</italic> only from GABAergic inhibitory neurons in mice replicates most of this phenotype. Here we show that genetically restoring <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression only in GABAergic neurons of male <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice enhanced inhibitory signaling, extended lifespan, and rescued ataxia, apraxia, and social abnormalities but did not rescue tremor or anxiety. Female <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice showed a less dramatic but still substantial rescue. These findings highlight the critical regulatory role of GABAergic neurons in certain behaviors and suggest that modulating the excitatory/inhibitory balance through GABAergic neurons could prove a viable therapeutic option in Rett syndrome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14198.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14198.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14198.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rett syndrome is a childhood brain disorder that mainly affects girls and causes symptoms including anxiety, tremors, uncoordinated movements and breathing difficulties. Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in a gene called <italic>MECP2</italic>, which is found on the X chromosome. Males with <italic>MECP2</italic> mutations are rare but have more severe symptoms and die young. Many researchers who study Rett syndrome use mice as a model of the disorder. In particular, male mice with the mouse equivalent of the human <italic>MECP2</italic> gene switched off in every cell in the body (also known as <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice) show many of the features of Rett syndrome and die at a young age.</p><p>The <italic>MECP2</italic> gene is important for healthy brain activity. The brain contains two major types of neurons: excitatory neurons, which encourage other neurons to be active; and inhibitory neurons, which stop or dampen the activity of other neurons. In 2010, researchers reported that mice lacking <italic>Mecp2</italic> in only their inhibitory neurons develop most of the same problems as those mice with no <italic>Mecp2</italic> at all. This discovery led Ure et al. â including a researcher involved in the 2010 study â to ask if activating <italic>Mecp2</italic> in the same neurons in otherwise <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice was enough to prevent some of their Rett syndrome-like symptoms.</p><p>The experiments showed that male mice that only have <italic>Mecp2</italic> activated in their inhibitory neurons lived several months longer than male <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice. These male ârescue miceâ also moved normally and had a normal body weight, though they still experienced anxiety, tremors and breathing difficulties. Female mice represent a better model of human Rett syndrome patients, and Ure et al. found that female rescue mice showed smaller improvements than the males.</p><p>These data suggest that when a brain is missing <italic>Mecp2</italic> everywhere, as in male <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice, turning on <italic>Mecp2</italic> in inhibitory neurons can make the brain network nearly normal and prevent most Rett-syndrome-like symptoms. However, the brains of female rescue mice contain both normal cells and cells with mutated <italic>Mecp2.</italic> This mixture of normal and abnormal cells appears to cause abnormalities that cannot be overcome by rescuing just the activity of the inhibitory neurons. These findings also highlight the importance of doing future studies in female mice to better understand the development of Rett syndrome.</p><p>The next challenge is to test different ways of activating the inhibitory neurons in the female mouse brain, for example by using drugs that target these neurons. It is hoped these methods will help researchers to refine a path toward potential new treatments for Rett syndrome patients. Finally, in a related study, Meng et al. asked how deleting or activating <italic>Mecp2</italic> only in the excitatory neurons of mice affected Rett-syndrome-like symptoms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14198.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14198.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Rett syndrome</kwd><kwd>GABAergic neurons</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32NS083137-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ure</surname><given-names>Kerstin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007857</institution-id><institution>Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 HD083092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Zhenyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Jianrong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007857</institution-id><institution>Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5P30HD024064-23</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01NS057819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetically restoring Mecp2 expression only in GABAergic neurons in a mouse model of Rett syndrome improves inhibitory signaling, extends lifespan and rescues most but not all behavioral deficits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maintaining a proper ratio of excitation and inhibition throughout the brain is critical to normal neurological function. Alterations in this excitatory/inhibitory balance are postulated to underlie a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autismÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vattikuti and Chow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gogolla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>), schizophreniaÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belforte et al., 2010</xref>), and Rett syndromeÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dani et al., 2005</xref>). Much of the work on this balance has focused on excitatory neurons, which make up the majority of the brainâs neuronal population, yet it has become increasingly clear that inhibitory neurons, which predominantly release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), play important roles in the proper function of entire circuitsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xue et al., 2014</xref>) and in the behaviors regulated by these circuitsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>). Dysfunctional GABAergic signaling has been implicated in multiple neurological and neuropsychiatric disordersÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Siniatchkin and Koepp, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pizzarelli and Cherubini, 2011</xref>), including Rett syndromeÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, deletion of <italic>Mecp2</italic> solely in GABAergic neurons is sufficient to reproduce the majority of the Rett-like features of the constitutive <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mouse, including ataxia, stereotyped behaviors, seizures, breathing abnormalities, and premature deathÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir et al., 1999</xref>), a protein that is highly expressed throughout the brain and involved in chromatin modulationÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>). RTT is notable for the variety of different behaviors it affects: disease-causing <italic>MECP2</italic> mutations cause a rapidly fatal neonatal encephalopathy in human males but allow females to develop normally until around one year of age, at which point they regress developmentally, losing acquired language, social, and motor milestones, and instead develop ataxia, seizures, hand stereotypies, learning and memory deficits, and respiratory abnormalitiesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trevathan and Naidu, 1988</xref>). <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockout mice replicate all these features of the human diseaseÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guy et al., 2001</xref>), with male <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice developing symptoms and dying within the first five months of life. <italic>Mecp2</italic>-heterozygous females develop progressive neurological dysfunction with a later onset, because random X chromosome inactivation preserves expression of wildtype <italic>Mecp2</italic> in more than half of their cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Samaco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Young and Zoghbi, 2004</xref>).</p><p>While <italic>Mecp2</italic>-mutant male and female mice develop profound disabilities, RTT is not a neurodegenerative disorder. <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null neurons are rendered partly dysfunctional but are still present, active, and properly located developmentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2010</xref>); this makes the RTT mouse model ideal for interrogating how certain cell types affect behavior by bypassing the confound of widespread cell death and modeling non-neurodegenerative neuropsychiatric disorders more accurately. This system has already been used to demonstrate the critical role for GABAergic signaling in the pathogenesis of RTTÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2010</xref>), as well as revealing non-overlapping roles for parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SOM)-expressing GABAergic neurons in behaviorÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito-Ishida et al., 2015</xref>), a role in feeding and aggression for <italic>Sim1</italic>-positive hypothalamic neuronsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fyffe et al., 2008</xref>), and a critical role for proper glutamatergic function in anxiety, tremor, and acoustic startle response (see companion paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meng et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, rescue of <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression in certain cell types can indicate whether targeting that cell type has therapeutic potential and can give insight into the interplay between multiple circuits in the diseased brain. Therefore, we genetically re-expressed <italic>Mecp2</italic> solely in GABAergic neurons in a mouse otherwise null for <italic>Mecp2</italic>, restoring <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression and function to inhibitory neurons, and observed profound improvement in both male and female mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Male GABAergic rescue mice have normalized body weight and extended lifespan</title><p>Our lab previously generated a mouse line in which Cre expression is driven by the <italic>Slc32a1</italic> promoter (<italic>Slc32a1</italic>-Cre, referred to as <italic>Viaat</italic>-Cre henceforth), limiting Cre expression to GABAergic and glycinergic neuronsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2010</xref>).

As expected, we observed no colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We also confirmed that there were no YFP+ cells in bone marrow isolated from <italic>Viaat</italic>-Cre;ROSA-YFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

In addition, they were hypersocial when presented with a novel partner mouse in the partition test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and were slower to build nests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). In contrast, the female rescue mice performed similarly to wildtype mice in each of these assays, although the difference from the <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>lox-Stop/+</sup> mice was not statistically significant at early ages because of the latterâs relatively mild impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6EâG</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1DâE</xref>). At 13 months of age, female rescue mice moved noticeably more than the <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>lox-Stop/+</sup> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), were less ataxic by rotarod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), footslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), and dowel walk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1F</xref>), and had better grip strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). On each behavioral metric the performance of female rescue mice at this late age was worse than wildtype but still better than that of <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>lox-Stop/+</sup> mice; interestingly, reexpression of <italic>Mecp2</italic> solely in glutamatergic neurons resulted in a near complete reversal of RTT-like phenotypes (see companion paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meng et al., 2016</xref>), possibly because restoring glutamatergic function in a brain with approximately half of the GABAergic neurons retaining <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression due to random X inactivation more closely approximated a normal excitatory-inhibitory balance. Notably, the GABAergic rescue mice had an observable tremor, but they never developed the hindlimb-clasping characteristic of the <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>lox-Stop/+</sup> mice. The mitigation of the RTT-like phenotype observed in female rescue mice thus persisted well into their second year of life.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Perturbations in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling have been hypothesized to underlie several neuropsychiatric disorders, including autismÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vattikuti and Chow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gogolla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>), schizophreniaÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belforte et al., 2010</xref>), and RTTÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dani et al., 2005</xref>). Artificial elevation of the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory signaling leads to social deficits in mice, an effect that is rescued by an increase of inhibitory circuit activityÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we present evidence that increasing inhibitory activity alone can reverse the majority of symptoms of a mouse model of RTT. Using existing, well-characterized mouse lines, we restored full-length <italic>Mecp2</italic> transcription solely in GABAergic neurons and enhanced inhibitory function in an otherwise <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null brain. This was sufficient to extend lifespan significantly and rescue body weight, ataxia, and apraxia in both male and female rescue mice.</p><p>At the time of this writing, there have been several conditional knockouts of <italic>Mecp2</italic> that target different neuronal subtypes, each replicating a few aspects of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> deletion phenotype: <italic>Sim1</italic> conditional knockout mice are hyperphagic and become obeseÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fyffe et al., 2008</xref>); mice with <italic>Mecp2</italic> deleted from dopaminergic neurons develop some motor deficitsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Samaco et al., 2009</xref>); and conditional knockout of <italic>Mecp2</italic> from basal forebrain cholinergic neurons may result in decreased anxiety and impaired social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Mecp2</italic> from two subtypes of inhibitory neurons, PV- and SOM-expressing neurons, also shortened lifespan and replicated a subset of the phenotypes of global <italic>Mecp2</italic> loss: PV-conditional knockout mice lacked critical period plasticity in the visual cortexÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2014</xref>) and developed motor, learning and memory, and social interaction deficits, while SOM-conditional knockout mice exhibited stereotyped behaviors and seizuresÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito-Ishida et al., 2015</xref>); interestingly, reexpression of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in these individual populations prolongs life and improves disease scores and auditory information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goffin et al., 2014</xref>). Of all the conditional knockouts, however, the GABAergic conditional knockout mouse most closely replicates the effect of global <italic>Mecp2</italic> deletion, with premature lethality, motor dysfunction, learning and memory deficits, and stereotypies. Only the anxiety and the persistent tremor of the <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mouse is not reproducedÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2010</xref>)âbehaviors that are reproduced instead by the glutamatergic conditional knockout, along with motor incoordination, acoustic startle deficits, and early lethality (see companion paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meng et al., 2016</xref>). In parallel, our rescue of <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression solely in GABAergic neurons in otherwise <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null male mice completely reverses hypersociability, ataxia, and apraxia, as well as partially normalizing anxiety, but has no effect on acoustic startle responses or tremor. Meng et alâs glutamatergic rescue of <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression in the same <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null male mice completely normalizes anxiety, tremor, and acoustic startle deficits, as well as reversing hypersociability and extending lifespan, but does not affect motor coordination. This extraordinary complementarity makes it clear that while certain behaviors may be mainly dependent on the proper function of only excitatory neurons (ie acoustic startle response, tremor) or only inhibitory neurons (ataxia), other behaviors are dependent on both populations functioning properly (social behavior). However, caution must be exercised in assessing the exact contributions of each population, as the <italic>Viaat</italic>-Cre allele also expresses in glycinergic neurons, which are important for breathing and proper brainstem function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rahman et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, small populations of neurons in the lateral and medial habenula, the auditory cortex, and possibly in the CA3 release both GABA and glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Root et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Safiulina, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Noh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Uchigashima et al., 2007</xref>), which further complicates the picture. However, inhibitory neurons are found throughout the brain and, due to their exquisite sensitivity to the surrounding circuitry, can influence the behavior of large populations of surrounding neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xue et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonifazi et al., 2009</xref>), while glycinergic and GABA/glutamate-coreleasing neurons are far smaller in number and restricted to discrete regions of the brain. It is thus reasonable to attribute the bulk of the behavioral rescue to the improved inhibitory function we observe in the rescue mice. Thus, the work presented here not only indicates that some behavioral aspects of RTT pathogenesis are modularly regulated by specific populations of neurons but also emphasizes the need for a complete understanding of the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in behavioral outputs.</p><p>It is telling that neither glutamatergic nor GABAergic rescue of <italic>Mecp2</italic> completely rescued premature lethality, although both rescue mice displayed similarly extended lifespans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, also ). A normal lifespan in the male mice is likely particularly dependent on theÂ function of both neuron types. In addition, there may also be a role for glia in RTT pathogenesis, as these cells are critical for neurotransmitter recyclingÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marcaggi and Attwell, 2004</xref>). Notably, reactivation of <italic>Mecp2</italic> transcription solely in GFAP-positive astrocytes rescues the respiratory abnormalities of the <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mouse and extends survivalÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lioy et al., 2011</xref>), whereas our GABAergic rescue mouse showed no clear improvement in breathing. It is therefore conceivable that normal respiration and normal lifespan depend on an interplay between proper excitation, inhibition, and astrocyte function.</p><p>Differences between male and female mice in the GABAergic rescue responses are worth some consideration. In the male rescue mice, inhibitory cells express <italic>Mecp2</italic>, but all excitatory neurons are null for <italic>Mecp2</italic>. When <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression is restored in inhibitory neurons in males, the increase in GABA signaling may effectively counteract much of the deficit resulting from the loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in all excitatory neurons, possibly explaining the profound rescue of disease-related symptoms in the male mice. In the female rescue mice, however, random X-inactivation should allow roughly 50% of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons to retain functional <italic>Mecp2Â </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Young and Zoghbi, 2004</xref>), resulting in a heterogeneity of excitatory neuron activity within the brain of female mice that may neutralize much of the benefit gained by normalizing inhibitory neuron function. This idea is supported by the work of Meng et al., who show that rescue of <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression solely in excitatory neurons confers greater behavioral rescue in females than males. These glutamatergic rescue females benefit from a fully normalized excitatory neuron population as well as normal functioning from approximately 50% of inhibitory neurons, resulting in a strong rescue that is less impeded by heterogeneity. Males, however, are still left with dysfunctional inhibitory circuits and thus experience less benefit from restoration of MeCP2 levels in excitatory neurons. It is clear that inhibitory neurons are a valuable target for future pharmacological studies; future therapies that boost GABAergic function in both wildtype and <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null cells might prove more effective than a treatment targeted to the null cells alone. However, the work presented here and the work of Meng et al. also indicate that to achieve complete reversal of RTT symptoms, it may be necessary to pharmacologically elevate both inhibition and excitation.</p><p>Lastly, the discovery that genetic restoration of <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression solely in GABAergic neurons improves several phenotypes in both male and female mice throughout their lifespans renders this pathway a viable route for modifying disease course, even if only in the first few months to years of the disease. Pharmacological therapies enhancing GABAergic signaling might confer noticeable benefit to RTT syndrome patients, buying time until additional therapies can be added to modulate other pathways such as glutamatergic signaling. However, our findings suggest great care is warranted in the choice of disease model for any future drug trial, as the <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null male and <italic>Mecp2</italic>-heterozygous female mice responded very differently to genetic rescue of <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression. For a therapeutic to be truly translatable to human RTT patients, it must be tested in both models.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse husbandry and handling</title><p>All mouse care and manipulation was approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, Protocol AN-1013).

The glass pipettes were filled with high-Cl<sup>-</sup> intrapipette solution containing (in mM) 145 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP and 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, pH 7.2 (with KOH). Data were discarded when the change in the series resistance was &gt;20% during the course of the experiment or the rest membrane potential was about â60Â mV. The whole-cell recording was performed at 30 (Â±1)Â°C with the help of an automatic temperature controller (Warner Instruments,Â Hamden,Â CT). Summary data are presented as mean Â± S.E.M. and analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukeyâs post hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>8-week-old male mice (n = 6â7 per genotype) were deeply anesthetized with isofluorane, quickly decapitated, and their cerebella dissected and immediately frozen by liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissue was placed in 1âml Purezol (Bio-Rad,Â Hercules,Â CA) on ice and immediately homogenized with aÂ Polytron homogenizer. The dissolved sample was diluted to 2x using Purezol, and 1âml of the solution was processed by Aurum Total RNA Fatty and Fibrous Tissue kit (Bio-Rad) to collect RNA. DNA within the sample was removed with on-column DNase digestion which was included in the kit. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies,Â Carlsbad,Â CA). RT-qPCR was performed using Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time system. The primer sets were designed to amplify target genes using UCSC genome browser and Primer 3.

The top 20 genes altered in opposite directions in the two lines were selected from the microarray results. We checked expression pattern of these genes using the Allen Brain Atlas, and we chose those genes that were clearly expressed in inhibitory neurons in the cerebellum (i.e., either Purkinje cells, stellate cells, or Golgi cells) as candidates. All RT-qPCR reactions were conducted in duplicate, and relative proportions of the cDNA were determined based on the threshold cycle (Ct). The results were averaged for each sample and normalized to the value of <italic>Gapdh</italic>. Relative expression levels of the target genes were determined by normalizing the fold expression level in each sample to the average of the littermate WT controls. Statistical analysis were performed on delta Ct values (i.e., [average Ct of the target gene] â [average Ct of <italic>Gapdh</italic>]), by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukeyâs post hoc test.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Restoration of Mecp2 expression in GABAergic neurons rescues multiple disease features in a mouse model of Rett Syndrome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sacha Nelson (peer reviewer); Lisa Monteggia (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reporting the consequences of selectively rescuing MeCP2 expression in GABAergic neurons is a nice complement to a previous study from the same lab reporting the phenotypic effects of losing MeCP2 in these same neurons. As in all of the studies in this series coming from the Zoghbi group, the behavioral experiments are particularly well controlled for genetic background and important effort is expended to study mosaic female mice as well as the male knockouts, since the females are more relevant to the disease condition.</p><p>A fundamental weakness of the approach is that GABAergic neurons are incredibly diverse and subserve so many functions throughout the brain that we are left with major questions about where the relevant neurons are. The authors have tended to imply that they think important phenotypes arise from cortical/hippocampal interneurons, for example by only assessing physiology in this region, but it is much more likely that all or the vast majority of the behavioural phenotypes arise from subcortical structures including the brainstem, cerebellum and striatum. Overall, with the revisions suggested below, the reviewers think that this is an important piece of work that complements the companion paper and has the potential to move the field forward.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the first paragraph of the subsection âMale GABAergic rescue mice have normalized body weight and extended lifespanâ: &quot;all other cells in the body [â¦] remain null for MeCP2&quot; this is unlikely to be true since glycinergic neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord also expression <italic>Viaat</italic>. This is not a minor point because ablation of VIAAT in glycinergic neurons causes a respiratory phenotype and perinatal death (Rahman et al. 2014). <italic>Slc32a1</italic> is also expressed in important neuronal types that co-release GABA and other transmitters like ACh (Saunders et al. 2015) and glutamate (Root et al. 2014; Shabel et al. 2014).</p><p>Changes to reflect this more nuanced view should also be made to the Discussion. It is not clear that all of the observed effects relate to changes in inhibition as changes in the cholinergic or glutamatergic function could also occur in these mice but were not assessed.</p><p>2) As stated in the review of the companion paper, because there is ample evidence that activity of pyramidal neurons regulates inhibition and the authors have shown that activity is reduced by loss in excitatory neurons, it would be useful to test if the inhibitory rescue animals have seizures or abnormal EEGs.</p><p>3) The complementary nature of the behavioral phenotypes associated with GABAergic versus glutamatergic loss of function models is quite interesting. However, in order to be able to compare and contrast the two studies it is important to document cortical neuron activities (action potentials as well as synaptic input) as they were documented in the companion study. This manuscript shows a regulation of spontaneous miniature IPSCs and EPSCs following Mecp2 loss of function and rescue. However, the functional impact of these changes on neuronal physiology is not explored.</p><p>4) Are the changes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> due to alterations in synapse numbers or functions of synaptic inputs? Earlier work from the same group (Chao et al., 2007) demonstrated an impact of MeCP2 on synapse number, therefore it is important to establish the basis of these observations.</p><p>5) It is surprising that the two studies by Goffin et al. 2014 (PMID 24777420) and He et al. 2014 (PMID 25297674) were not cited or discussed in the current manuscript, especially since the Goffin et al. paper also did selective rescue in the Pv+ population.</p><p>6) The interpretation in the Discussion is too simplistic and does not mesh very well with the companion paper. Examples are below.</p><p>Discussion, second paragraph: The fact that &quot;This initially seems surprising, as excitatory neurons constitute the vast majority of the neuronal population&quot; is based on a corticocentric view which does not hold brain-wide. Something like 97% of the cells in the striatum are GABAergic. In other places GABAergic neurons are key bottlenecks (e.g. Purkinje neurons).</p><p>Discussion, fourth paragraph: &quot;When Mecp2 expression is restored in the entire population of inhibitory neurons in males, the increase in GABA signaling effectively counteracts the deficit resulting from the loss of Mecp2 in all excitatory neurons, possibly explaining the near-complete rescue of disease-related symptoms in the male&quot; this seems excessive given e.g. the reduced lifespan, startle, anxiety, excitatory physiology and respiratory defects. Also key phenotypes were not assessed: learning and seizures stand out.</p><p>Discussion, fourth paragraph: &quot;In the female rescue mice, however, random X-inactivation should allow roughly 50% of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons to retain functional Mecp2(Young and Zoghbi, 2004), resulting in a heterogeneity of excitatory neuron activity within the brain of female mice that may neutralize much of the benefit gained by normalizing inhibitory neuron function. This idea is supported by the work of Meng et al., who show that rescue of Mecp2 expression solely in excitatory neurons confers greater rescue in females than males.â But this ignores the fact that glutamatergic rescue in males dramatically extended lifespan to similar levels to that achieved in the <italic>Viaat</italic> rescue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14198.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) In the first paragraph of the subsection âMale GABAergic rescue mice have normalized body weight and extended lifespanâ: &quot;all other cells in the body [â¦] remain null for MeCP2&quot; this is unlikely to be true since glycinergic neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord also expression Viaat.
