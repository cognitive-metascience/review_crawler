Among the many classes of mobile genetic elements, L1 is the only autonomous retrotransposon that still drives human genomic plasticity today. Through its co-evolution with the human genome, L1 has intertwined itself with host cell biology. However, a clear understanding of L1’s lifecycle and the processes involved in restricting its insertion and intragenomic spread remains elusive. Here we identify modes of L1 proteins’ entrance into the nucleus, a necessary step for L1 proliferation. Using functional, biochemical, and imaging approaches, we also show a clear cell cycle bias for L1 retrotransposition that peaks during the S phase. Our observations provide a basis for novel interpretations about the nature of nuclear and cytoplasmic L1 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and the potential role of DNA replication in L1 retrotransposition.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30058.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Only two percent of our genetic material or genome are occupied by genes, while between 60-70 percent are made up of hundreds of thousands of copies of very similar DNA sequences. These repetitive sequences evolved from genetic elements called transposons.</p><p>Transposons are often referred to as ‘jumping genes’, as they can randomly move within the genome and thereby create dangerous mutations that may lead to cancer or other genetic diseases. LINE-1 is the only remaining active transposon in humans, and it expands by copying and pasting itself to new locations via a process called 'retrotransposition'. To do so, it is first transcribed into RNA – the molecules that help to make proteins – and then converted back into identical DNA sequences.</p><p>Previous research has shown that LINE-1 can form complexes with a series of proteins, including the two encoded by LINE-1 RNA itself: ORF1p and ORF2p. The LINE-1 complexes can enter the nucleus of the cell and insert a new copy of LINE-1 into the genome. However, until now it was not known how they do this. To investigate this further, Mita et al. used human cancer cells grown in the lab and tracked LINE-1 during the different stages of the cell cycle.</p><p>The results showed that LINE-1 enters the nucleus as the cell starts to divide and the membrane of the nucleus breaks down. The LINE-1 complexes are then retained in the nucleus while the membrane of the nucleus reforms. Later, as the cell duplicates its genetic material, LINE-1 starts to copy and paste itself. Mita et al., together with another group of researchers, also found that during this process, only LINE-1 RNA and ORF2p were found in the nucleus.</p><p>This shows that the cell cycle dictates both where the LINE-1 complexes gather and when LINE-1 is active. A next step will be to further investigate how the ‘copy and paste’ mechanisms of LINE-1 and the two LINE-1 proteins are regulated during the cell cycle. In future, this may help to identify LINE-1’s role in processes like aging or in diseases such as cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LINE-1</kwd><kwd>retrotransposition</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>PCNA</kwd><kwd>MCM proteins</kwd><kwd>retrotransposons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50GM107632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boeke</surname><given-names>Jef D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH/NCI P30CA16087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yun</surname><given-names>Chi Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S10OD010582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yun</surname><given-names>Chi Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NYSTEM</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Contract C026719</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yun</surname><given-names>Chi Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of functional, biochemical and imaging studies show that LINE-1/L1 proteins and mRNA enter the nucleus through mitotic nuclear membrane breakdown, interact with components of the DNA replication fork and mediate retrotransposition during S phase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retrotransposons are genetic elements that move within the host genome through a ‘copy and paste’ process utilizing an RNA intermediate. 17% of the human genome is made up of copies of the Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lander et al., 2001</xref>). L1 is the only autonomous human retrotransposon able to ‘jump’ through a process called retrotransposition. The full length, active L1 retrotransposons consists of a 5’ untranslated region (UTR) containing a bidirectional promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Speek, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Swergold, 1990</xref>), two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2, separated by a short inter-ORF region and a 3’ UTR with a weak polyadenylation signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Doucet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dombroski et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burns and Boeke, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burns, 2017</xref>). A short, primate specific, third ORF of unknown function called ORF0 was also described in the 5’UTR of L1 with an antisense orientation compared to ORF1 and ORF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Denli et al., 2015</xref>). Upon transcription by RNA polymerase II, the 6 kb bicistronic L1 mRNA is poly-adenylated and exported into the cytoplasm. LINE-1 exhibits ‘cis-preference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wei et al., 2001</xref>), the mechanism of which is unknown. A popular model posits that newly translated ORF1 and/or ORF2 proteins preferentially bind the mRNA molecule that encoded them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boeke, 1997</xref>). Interestingly, translation of the second ORF, ORF2p, is mediated and regulated by an unconventional process that remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alisch et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>ORF1p is an RNA binding protein with chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martin and Bushman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Khazina et al., 2011</xref>) while ORF2p contains domains with endonuclease (EN) and reverse transcriptase (RT) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Feng et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mathias et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weichenrieder et al., 2004</xref>). It is believed that ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), consisting of many ORF1p molecules, as few as one or two ORF2ps and one L1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Khazina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basame et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dai et al., 2014</xref>) form in the cytoplasm. The RNP is then imported into the nucleus through a still uncharacterized process. L1 RNPs accumulate in cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goodier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>), but the role of these cellular structures in the L1 lifecycle is still controversial. L1 RNPs accumulate mainly in the cytoplasm but nuclear ORF1p was also observed in a certain percentage of cells using cell lines and cancer specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sokolowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doucet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goodier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harris et al., 2010</xref>). While several specific antibodies against ORF1p have been raised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wylie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Doucet-O'Hare et al., 2015</xref>), a highly effective antibody against ORF2 protein that would allow definitive observation of protein localization is still lacking. Antibodies against LINE-1 ORF2p have been recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Luca et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sokolowski et al., 2014</xref>) but the much lower amount of expressed ORF2p compared to ORF1p makes the study of ORF2p expression and localization difficult. To overcome these difficulties, tagged ORF2ps have been employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the nucleus, L1 endonuclease nicks the DNA at A/T rich consensus target sites (5’-TTTT/AA-3’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Feng et al., 1996</xref>) and through a process called TPRT (Target Primed Reverse Transcription)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cost et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luan et al., 1993</xref>) inserts a DNA copy into the new genomic target locus. During TPRT, ORF2p EN domain nicks the DNA and the newly formed 3’OH end is then used by the RT domain of ORF2p to prime the synthesis of a complementary DNA using the L1 mRNA as template. A second strand of cDNA is then synthetized and joined to adjacent genomic DNA.</p><p>L1 lifecycle is extensively entwined with host cellular processes. Several proteins and cellar pathways have been shown to restrict or support L1 retrotransposition and life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goodier, 2016</xref>). RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belancio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dai et al., 2012</xref>), DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Servant et al., 2017</xref>) and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guo et al., 2014</xref>) are a few cellular processes shown to affect LINE-1 retrotransposition. Progression through the cell cycle was shown by several groups to promote L1 retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xie et al., 2013</xref>) but a molecular understanding of this aspect has been elusive. Because of the importance of the cell cycle in efficient retrotransposition, it has been proposed that, as for some exogenous retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Suzuki and Craigie, 2007</xref>), nuclear breakdown during mitosis could represent an opportunity for entrance of L1 into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shi et al., 2007</xref>). This hypothesis, never directly tested previously, was challenged by studies demonstrating effective retrotransposition in non-dividing and terminally differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kubo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Macia et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To shed light on the role of the cell cycle on different aspects of L1 life cycle we explored the nuclear localization of L1 proteins and the retrotransposition efficiency of L1 in different stages of the cell cycle in rapidly dividing cancer cells. Here, we use imaging, genetic and biochemical approaches to show that in these cells, the L1 lifecycle is intimately coordinated with the cell cycle. LINE-1 encoded proteins enter the nucleus during mitosis and retrotransposition appears to occur mainly during S phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis and quantification of ORF1p and ORF2p expression and cellular localization</title><p>Previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doucet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sokolowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goodier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goodier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rodić et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Branciforte and Martin, 1994</xref>) have shown varying localization of ORF1 protein in cells growing in culture or in mammalian specimens from various organs and tumors. In particular, the nuclear localization of LINE-1 encoded proteins has been sparsely studied and the mechanisms driving import of L1 retrotransposition intermediates into the nucleus are largely unknown.</p><p>We therefore set out to characterize the cellular localization of L1 ORF1p and ORF2p in human cells overexpressing recoded (ORFeus) or non-recoded L1 (L1rp) with a 3xFlag tag on the ORF2p C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). Immuno-fluorescence staining of HeLa-M2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hampf and Gossen, 2007</xref>) overexpressing ORFeus, showed clear expression of ORF1p and ORF2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>), ORFeus ORF1p was detected in virtually all the cells (≅ 97%) whereas ORF2p, encoded by the same bicistronic L1 mRNA also expressing ORF1p, was detected in just a subset of cells (≅10% using a rabbit anti-Flag antibody and ≅20% using a more sensitive mouse anti-Flag antibody) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bar graph and inset). This pattern of expression is most likely due to an unknown mechanism controlling ORF2p translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alisch et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, when non-recoded L1 was over-expressed, only 44% of cells displayed ORF1p expression. Overexpression of ORFeus-Hs and L1rp with or without the L1 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR) excluded the possibility that the reduced expression of L1rp compared to ORFeus was due to the presence of the 5’ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Due to the overall lower expression of L1rp, ORF2p was barely observable in cells expressing non-recoded L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). ORF1p was mainly present in the cytoplasm but some cells (≅26%) also showed clear nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, white arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Z-stack movies of cells expressing L1 and stained for recoded and non-recoded ORF1p and ORF2p are also presented (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Confocal images recapitulated our observations and confirmed our conclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, the cells with nuclear ORF1p fluorescence were usually observed as pairs of cells in close proximity. This observation suggested to us that cells with nuclear ORF1p may have undergone mitotic division immediately prior to fixation and observation. In HeLa cells, this observation was made more evident by the fact that daughter cells displaying nuclear ORF1p were sometimes connected by intercellular bridges often containing filaments of DNA and persisting from incomplete cytokinesis during the previous mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lower panels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steigemann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>). To quantify our initial qualitative observation of closer cell proximity for cells displaying nuclear ORF1p, we employed automated image acquisition of HeLa cells expressing recoded L1 and stained for ORF1p (see ‘quantification and statistical analysis’ section). We compared the distance of pairs of cells expressing nuclear ORF1p versus the distance of the same number of cell pairs expressing ORF1p just in the cytoplasm. This ‘proximity analysis’, described in more details in the methods section, clearly shows that cells with nuclear ORF1p are statistically closer to each other than cells expressing ORF1p exclusively in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30058.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>L1 protein expression and localization (<bold>A</bold>) Representative pictures of immunostained HeLa M2 cells expressing a recoded L1 (ORFeus) or a non-recoded L1 (L1rp).</title><p>Antibody target names are reported atop the corresponding pictures and colored according to the colors used in the merged pictures.

The formation of these foci is particularly enhanced by L1 overexpression. The nature and role of these cytoplasmic structures is still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goodier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin and Branciforte, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guo et al., 2014</xref>) and in our system they may be induced by non-physiological expression levels of ORF1p. We therefore performed the localization experiments reported here using Tet-inducible constructs, and we induced L1 expression at lower concentrations of doxycycline (0.1 μg/ml) compared to the concentrations typically used to induce full induction of retrotransposition or production of RNP intermediates for proteomic studies (1 μg/ml) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). We observed very heterogeneous localization of ORF1p and ORF2p in cells overexpressing L1 upon treatment with 0.1 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 hr. ORF1p is observed to be only cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> top panel), or both cytoplasmic and nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top panel) but is never exclusively nuclear when immunostaining is performed using 4H1, 4632 and JH74 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). ORF2p also had heterogeneous nuclear/cytoplasmic localization with cells displaying ORF2p only in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> middle panel), only in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top panel) or in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lower panel). Nuclear ORF2p had a punctate pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> top panel) and nuclear ORF1p was usually excluded from nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, arrowheads). Also, a small population of cells (usually less than 0.1% of L1 expressing cells) showed a strong and clear nuclear signal of ORF2p in the absence of nuclear ORF1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) consistent with a possible nuclear form of L1 RNPs that lacks ORF1p (see also accompanying paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). On the contrary, in the cytoplasm, ORF2p always co-localized with ORF1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>).</p><p>We compared several antibodies against ORF1p that confirmed a consistent pattern of nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of ORF1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The corresponding secondary-only controls and IF staining of cells not expressing L1 are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. The mouse 4H1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognizing the N-terminus of ORF1p and the rabbit JH74 antibody against the C-terminus of ORF1p have an identical pattern. The polyclonal 4632 antibody (pAb) displayed a high nuclear non-specific signal that renders this antibody less sensitive than 4H1 and JH74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). The JH73g rabbit Ab was distinct from the other antibodies and recognized mainly nuclear ORF1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This nuclear form of ORF1p is also recognized by 4H1 and JH74 antibodies but is much more easily observed using JH73g because of its higher affinity for nuclear ORF1p and much lower affinity for cytoplasmic ORF1p. Indeed, quantification of nuclear ORF1p upon staining with JH74 and JH73g revealed a comparable percentage of cells displaying nuclear ORF1p using the two antibodies (≅14–17%). The percentage of cells detected overall as expressing ORF1p using JH73g Ab is much lower than the percentage recognized as ORF1p expressing cells by JH74 Ab (37% versus 93% respectively) because JH73g is able to recognize mainly the nuclear form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This unusual staining pattern suggests that the nuclear form of ORF1p may be highly enriched for a conformation specifically recognized by JH73g. Staining of L1rp expressing cells, on the other hand, reveals a lower threshold of sensitivity for the JH73g antibody that is unable to detect the lower amount of non-recoded ORF1p. Interestingly, ORF1p immunoprecipitated with JH73g Ab is impaired in binding to ORF2p protein, consistent with the possibility that most of the nuclear ORF1p species fail to bind ORF2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ORF1p enters the nucleus during mitosis</title><p>Our immunofluorescence staining of ORF1p and ORF2p suggests that L1 RNPs enter the nucleus during mitosis, when the nuclear membrane breaks down. To better explore this hypothesis, previously put forward by other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xie et al., 2013</xref>), we exploited well-characterized markers of the cell cycle: geminin, expressed only in S/G2/M phases, and Cdt1, which specifically marks the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arias and Walter, 2007</xref>). Co-staining of ORF1p with geminin and Cdt1 clearly showed that ORF1p is nuclear in cells expressing Cdt1 (G1 phase), and completely cytoplasmic in cells expressing geminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and quantification in B). Confocal images of Cdt1, geminin and ORF1p staining confirmed our conclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also verified these results using the FUCCI system (Fluorescent Ubiquitin Cell Cycle Indicator), that exploits Cdt1 and geminin fragments fused to mAG and mKO2 (Monomeric Azami-Green and Monomeric Kusabira-Orange 2 fluorescent proteins) respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</xref>). Expression of an ORF1p-HaloTag7 in HeLa.S-FUCCI cells treated with the Halo tag ligand JF646, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>) shows that ORF1p is nuclear only in cells in G1 phase with orange nuclei resulting from expression of mKO2-tagged Cdt1 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In this setting, no instances of cells with nuclear ORF1p-Halo and green nucleus (cells in S/G2/M) were observed (total number of cells counted = 3309; cells with nuclear ORF1p and green nuclei = 0; cells with nuclear ORF1p and red nuclei = 80). ORF2p-Halo was expressed in cells scattered throughout the cell cycle that displayed either orange (Cdt1 expressing) or green (geminin expressing) nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result suggests that ORF2p expression is not cell cycle regulated. Overall, our analyses strongly suggest that ORF1p, most likely together with ORF2p, enters into the nucleus during mitosis and is retained there when the nuclear membrane reforms after cell division.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30058.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ORF1p localizes inside the nucleus immediately after mitosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative pictures of co-immunostaining of ORF1p with Cdt1 (marker of G1 phase) or geminin (marker of S/G2/M phase).

These stringent parameters were necessary to avoid interference of the strong ORF1p cytoplasmic signal with the measurement of nuclear ORF1p signal. The analysis of ORF1p nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution surprisingly showed that the percentage of cells with nuclear ORF1p does not increase but actually decreases after 48 hr of L1 induction compared to the 24 hr time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The decrease in nuclear ORF1p after 48 hr induction is probably due to the decreased growth rate of a more confluent cell population. The absence of an increase of cells with nuclear ORF1p with increased time of L1 induction, suggests that, after entering the nucleus in M phase, nuclear ORF1p is either degraded and/or exported from the nucleus during or after G1 phase.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30058.018</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>ORF1p nuclear localization upon leptomycin treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa M2 cells expressing a recoded L1 (ORFeus) with Flag tagged ORF2p were treated for 24 or 48 hr with or without 0.1 μg/ml doxycycline on chamber slides.

Following early G1, ORF1p is then exported to the cytoplasm through a CRM1 dependent mechanism. We therefore asked whether L1 retrotransposition occurred in a cell cycle-dependent manner and more specifically during M phase or G1 phase, when we observed ORF1p in the nucleus and when chromatin is accessible to L1 RNPs. To answer this question we performed retrotransposition assays using a previously described ORFeus-GFP-AI reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2011</xref>). HeLa cells expressing the retrotransposition reporter were treated for increasing times with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), a cell cycle inhibitor that blocks cells in M phase interfering with microtubule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma and Poon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rosner et al., 2013</xref>). Treatments were performed for no longer than 21 hr, a time sufficient to allow cells passage through just one cell cycle. Increased time of nocodazole treatment, and therefore longer time in M phase, fails to increase the percentage of M phase green cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), suggesting that L1 retrotransposition does not occur during M phase. Longer times of nocodazole treatment (21 hr) increased cell death, detected by an increase of propidium iodide-positive cells, and a consequent decrease in retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, dotted line). Similar experiments were also performed using thymidine and mimosine treatments to interrogate possible biases of L1 retrotransposition toward G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambrozy, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lalande, 1990</xref>).

Treatment with excess thymidine inhibits DNA synthesis blocking cells in late G1. As with nocodazole treatments, cells treated with thymidine, showed no increase in GFP positive cells compared to untreated cells, suggesting that L1 does not preferentially retrotranspose in late G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Mimosine treatments, also did not increase retrotransposition but actually decreased L1 hopping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Mimosine is a non-protein amino acid that potently inhibits cell cycle. Despite mimosine’s well-established role in blocking cells in late G1/early S phase, the molecular mechanisms affected by mimosine to induce cell cycle arrest are still debated. Mimosine was shown to affect both DNA synthesis initiation and elongation and to induce depletion of deoxynucleotides through chelation of iron and consequent inhibition of ribonucleotide reductases (RNR) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Mimosine was also shown to inhibit viral replication consistent with a general metabolic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nguyen and Tawata, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kalejta and Hamlin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Park et al., 2012</xref>).

To this end, we utilized the previously characterized monomeric fluorescent timers (FT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Subach et al., 2009</xref>). These derivatives of mCherry change their fluorescence emission from blue to red over 2 to 3 hr (fast-FT). We introduced an antisense intron within the coding region of the ‘fast-FT’ and inserted this cassette in the 3’UTR of a recoded L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Transfection of the L1-fastFT-AI construct into HeLa cells allowed us to identify cells that underwent retrotransposition within a ~ 3 hr period preceding the analysis, as reported by previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Subach et al., 2009</xref>). Our quantification also supports the previously reported timing of FT maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Subach et al., 2009</xref>) with an average conversion time from blue to red of 2.35 ± 0.52 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Immediately after L1-fastFT-AI retrotransposition, the fast FT is expressed and the cells emit blue fluorescence. Upon translation the blue proteins begin turning red in less than 3 hr. To roughly quantify the time needed for the visualization of a fluorescent protein after induction of transcription, we measured GFP expression upon doxycycline induction. Quantification of cells expressing GFP under control of a Tet CMV-inducible promoter revealed that 50% of the cells expressed visible GFP at 2.71 ± 0.46 hr and 90% of the cells expressed visible GFP within 8.01 ± 0.63 hr of doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We therefore followed up on these previous findings investigating the interactome of the ORF2p-PCNA complex specifically. To this end, we engineered a V5-tag at the N-terminus of PCNA in HCT116 cells stably expressing a doxycycline inducible ORFeus. HCT116 cells were chosen because of their near-diploid number of chromosomes compared to HeLa cells, characterized by unstable karyotype.

This lack of insight about L1 retrotransposons in human cells is unsurprising considering that many technical challenges hinder studies of this highly repetitive but poorly expressed element, which is effectively repressed by host somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goodier, 2016</xref>) and therefore overexpression approaches can reveal otherwise hidden pathways.</p><p>It makes sense that nuclear localization of a L1 RNP particle comprising at least ORF2p, with EN and RT activity, bound to L1 mRNA, is essential for L1 retrotransposition to gain access to its target, genomic DNA. Despite this obvious observation, the nature of nuclear L1 RNPs and the process by which L1 gains entry into the nucleus are unknown. No functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) has been identified in the two L1 proteins ORF1p and ORF2p suggesting that their import into the nucleus is either mediated by interacting partners or by cellular processes such as the cell cycle and progression through mitosis during which the nuclear membrane breaks down, allowing the possible entrance of L1 RNPs into the nucleus. The former hypothesis is supported by several studies that show an essential role of cell division on retrotransposition and retrotransposition rate in tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shi et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, other work showed the possibility of L1 retrotransposition in differentiated and non-dividing cells such as human neurons and glioma cells, albeit at substantially lower rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Macia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kubo et al., 2006</xref>). These seeming incongruities may be explained with a possible major mechanism of entry into the nucleus during mitosis and a less frequent mode of nuclear localization for L1 RNPs that is independent of the cell cycle and specific for some cellular state or cell type. Other possible explanations for the discrepancies between our conclusions and works showing retrotransposition in non-dividing cells, are potential cell cycle artifacts caused by the adenovirus vectors or the low rate of proliferation of the cells used.</p><p>Through imaging, genetic and biochemical approaches, we show that L1 nuclear import as well as L1 retrotransposition has a strong cell cycle bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). We also show that ORF1p and L1mRNA, probably in a complex with ORF2p, enters the nucleus during mitosis, accumulating in cells in the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The nuclear localization of L1 RNPs upon transition through mitosis may be due to simple diffusion of L1 RNPs in the nuclear proximity and subsequent sequestration of the particles into the nucleus upon nuclear membrane formation. Another interesting possibility, is that, during mitosis, the L1 RNPs may weakly interact with chromatin, most likely through the positively charged ORF1p. These interactions could increase the chances of L1 RNPs being ‘trapped’ in the nucleus after reformation of the nuclear membrane. This hypothesis is supported by our unpublished observations that GFP-tagged ORF1p strongly interact with chromatin during metaphase and this process seems to increase the amount of ORF1p observed into the nucleus in early G1. Moreover, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, we always observe ORF1p in chromatin fractions even in the absence of ORF2p (unpublished data). This observation strongly suggests interaction of ORF1p with chromatin independent of retrotransposition itself.</p><p>We observe a CRM1 mediated/leptomycin sensitive nuclear export of ORF1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) that keeps the nuclear level of ORF1p low and helps explain the observation that ORF1p is always mostly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Future studies will need to explore the CRM1/ORF1p interaction and the role of this interaction in L1 RNP cellular dynamics and retrotransposition. The decoupling of the CRM1 role on the cell cycle from its importance on L1 cellular localization will be challenging but essential for the understanding of ORF1p nuclear export. We also show that even if L1 enters the nucleus in M phase, retrotransposition does not happen during cell division (M phase) but it is during the following S phase in which retrotransposition peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The finding that L1 retrotransposition has a strong bias for S phase is, in retrospect, not entirely surprising considering that deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), critically necessary for reverse transcription, are at high levels during the S phase and are greatly restricted during the other cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stillman, 2013</xref>). This layer of metabolic regulation may reflect an ancient adaptation to limit the proliferation of retroelements. dNTP concentration is tightly controlled by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), the enzyme that converts ribonucleotide diphosphates (rNDPs) into dNDPs and by SAMHD1 (sterile alpha motif and HD-domain containing protein 1) that cleaves dNTPs to deoxynucleosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stillman, 2013</xref>). Indeed, SAMHD1 expression was found to restrict replication of lentiviruses such as HIV, by restricting availability of dNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hrecka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goldstone et al., 2011</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that SAMHD1 was also shown to restrict LINE-1 retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>) directly supporting the idea that dNTP concentration can profoundly limit L1 jumping. Interestingly, we also found that mimosine, a compound that blocks the cell cycle in G1/early S and that inhibits RNR, also strongly inhibits L1 retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our findings suggest that inhibition of L1 retrotransposition mediated by mimosine involves multiple mechanisms other than cell cycle inhibition. It is possible that the depletion of dNTPs by mimosine further mediates inhibition of L1 retrotransposition. In complete accord with these observations is our finding that retrotransposition happens in S phase, during which dNTP concentration peaks, allowing efficient reverse transcription and thus L1 retrotransposition. This may thus be viewed as an adaptation of the retroelement to a host defense.</p><p>Our functional studies showing S phase bias of L1 retrotransposition are also corroborated by our biochemical observations that show that ORF2p is recruited to chromatin during S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and suggest that ORF2p is recruited to a subset of sites of DNA replication with PCNA and MCM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed interaction of the previously described PCNA/ORF2p complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>) with TOP1, RPA1 and PARP1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>) all of which associate with replication forks. Interestingly, the PARP1 interaction suggests that L1 specifically interacts with stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berti et al., 2013</xref>). Our co-localization of PCNA and ORF2p also supports the presence of ORF2p at potential sites of DNA replication, marked by PCNA staining during the S phase. PCNA and ORF2p immunofluorescence revealed that only some PCNA foci of replication overlap with ORF2p nuclear foci, suggesting that, at least in some instances, L1, possibly engaged in TPRT, may specifically interact with a subset of perhaps stalled replication forks. Our data do not clarify whether the replication fork stall is caused by ORF2p nicking of the DNA or alternatively, whether the retrotransposing L1 complex is recruited specifically to previously stalled replication forks. Conversely, not all ORF2p nuclear foci overlap with PCNA sites, supporting a model in which L1 interaction with the replication fork may represent just one of several modes used by L1 to select a DNA target site and retrotranspose. Our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>) showed that PCNA does not interact with ORF2p mutated in its endonuclease (EN<sup>-</sup>) or reverse transcriptase (RT-) domain. These observations led us to hypothesize that PCNA is recruited by ORF2p after the first steps of TPRT (nicking of genomic DNA and beginning of L1 mRNA reverse transcription), and not vice-versa (chromatin recruitment of ORF2p by PCNA). Together with the observations presented in this manuscript we envision a model in which L1 RNPs, comprising at least ORF2p and L1mRNA, are recruited to replication forks in S phase during DNA replication. A subset L1 RNPs subsequently mediate productive retrotransposition into target loci, perhaps aided by stalling of the replication fork. During TPRT, PCNA, readily available at the site of DNA replication, can be recruited in the latter steps of retrotransposition perhaps to mediate repair of the newly synthesized L1 cDNA/genomic DNA junctions. It is intriguing to postulate that ligases involved in DNA replication such as ligase 1 (LIG1) may also help seal the final nicks in L1 retrotransposition events. An alternative model that could, at least partially, explain our data hypothesizes that a replication fork collides with a nicked DNA formed by retrotransposing L1. In this latter model, the co-localization of ORF2p with PCNA and MCM proteins would happen after endonuclease cut and initiation of RT by ORF2p. Future work, most likely based on single molecule observation of the retrotransposing L1 RNPs, will be needed to validate this still speculative models.</p><p>Interestingly, our observations on ORF1p cytoplasmic/nuclear dynamic suggest deeper implications. The fact that ORF1p is exported from the nucleus before S phase, leads to the conclusion that retrotransposition, happening mainly during DNA replication, is mediated by RNPs depleted of ORF1p and constituted only or predominantly by ORF2p and L1 mRNA, a conclusion also supported by data presented by Taylor et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). In vitro studies of TPRT show that the first and presumably critical steps in retrotransposition can efficiently occur in vitro in the absence of ORF1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cost et al., 2002</xref>). The hypothesis that ORF1p is dispensable for the actual DNA cutting and reverse transcription steps in vivo, is supported by our observation that nuclear ORF1p can be specifically recognized by one of our antibodies (JH73g). We interpret this observation to mean that this antibody recognizes a specific conformational state of ORF1p unique to the nucleus. Not surprisingly, the nuclear form of ORF1p that is recognized by the JH73g Ab, has impaired binding to ORF2p, suggesting that once inside the nucleus, ORF1p may dissociate from the L1 RNPs destined to carry out the critical endonuclease/reverse transcription steps of retrotransposition during S phase. Moreover, most of the ORF1p does not interact with PCNA and MCM6 that, instead, interact mainly with ORF2p. We also observed (rare) instances of cells clearly expressing ORF2p in the nucleus in the absence of detectable ORF1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>)). Finally, observations of HeLa.S-FUCCI cells expressing Halo tagged ORF1p show that ORF1p is never nuclear in cells in the S/G2/M phase. Halo tagged ORF2p, in contrast, was observed in the nucleus of certain cells in S/G2/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggesting that, during these cell cycle stages, ORF2p is in the nucleus without ORF1p. Overall, these data suggest that chromatin bound and retrotransposition-competent L1 particles are depleted of ORF1p and mainly consist of ORF2p in complex with L1 mRNA and host factors involved in retrotransposition. Future studies are necessary to better understand the differences of nuclear and cytoplasmic ORF1p and the molecular processes that may mediate ORF1p depletion from L1 RNPs. An attractive possibility is that ORF1p dissociation from L1 RNPs might be associated with delivering an ORF2-RNA RNP to chromatin, although we do not have direct evidence for this. It is tempting to imagine that in the nucleus, the absence of ORF1p trimers, thought to bind L1 mRNA every 50 nucleotides in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Khazina et al., 2011</xref>), may promote ORF2p’s unhindered movement during reverse transcription of L1 mRNA in the process of TPRT. This hypothesis will need to be better explored in future studies, by examining ORF2p and L1 mRNA dynamics during the cell cycle. The lack of a sensitive Ab against ORF2p, the fact that most cells expressing ORF1p do not express ORF2p due to an unknown post-transcriptional mechanism controlling ORF2p expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alisch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Luke et al., 2013</xref>) and the difficulties of detecting ORF2p even in the context of overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doucet et al., 2016</xref>), continue to technically challenge the study of L1 cellular dynamics.</p><p>More recent advances in the study of L1 retrotransposon, such as the construction and characterization of ORFeus with its increased expression and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Han and Boeke, 2004</xref>), the use of smaller and brighter fluorescent tags that allow the exploration of the temporal axis of retrotransposition and the implementation of sensitive biochemical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Subach et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>) enabled us to discover new and unexpected interactions between L1 and the ‘host’ cell. It is not surprising that retrotransposons, evolved within the human genome for millions of years, have ‘learned’ to leverage important cellular pathways, such as the cell cycle and DNA replication, for their own purpose of spreading and increasing their genomic content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boissinot et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boissinot and Sookdeo, 2016</xref>).

For each experiment, LED intensity, camera gain and exposure were kept constant and set so that background fluorescence was negligible using a negative control sample (cells not expressing L1) that will have no signal using the chosen setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>For quantification reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, HeLa cells expressing ORFeus were plated on eight wells chamber, induced with doxycycline, fixed and stained as described in the method section. Images of cells stained with JH74 antibody against ORF1p and Alexa 647 conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen, prod. number A32733), were collected with the Arrayscan VTI and quantified using the Compartmental Analysis Bioapplication. Briefly, 16 fields per treatment were acquired at 20x magnification and 2 × 2 binning (1104 × 1104 resolution). DAPI positive nuclei were identified using the dynamic isodata thresholding algorithm after minimal background subtraction. DAPI images were used to identify cell nuclei and to delineate the nuclear edges (x = 0). A ‘circle’ smaller than the nucleus (x=-4) was used to identify cells with nuclear ORF1p and a ‘ring’ outside the nucleus (1 &lt; x &gt; 8) was used to identify cells expressing cytoplasmic ORF1p. Limits of fluorescence were set so that no cells were considered positive for preparations of cells not treated with doxycycline (negative control). The reported parameters are explained below:</p><p>Total = total number of DAPI nuclei counted;</p><p>Nuclear ORF1p=cells with fluorescence signal inside the circle (x=-4) higher than the limit (higher fluorescence signal of the circle in the negative control)</p><p>Cytoplasmic/total ORF1p=cells with fluorescence signal inside the ring (1 &lt; x &gt; 8) higher than the limit (higher fluorescence signal of the ring in the negative control).</p><p>Because all cells expressing L1 show expression of ORF1p in the cytoplasm, the number of cells with cytoplasmic ORF1p was considered as the number of total cells expressing ORF1p. The percentage of cells with nuclear ORF1p was calculated as:</p><p>(number of cells with nuclear ORF1p)*100/(number of cells with cytoplasmic ORF1p=total number of cells expressing ORF1p).</p><p>All results are reported as mean and the error calculated as standard deviation (S.D.) or standard error of the mean (S.E.M). Data are considered to be statistically significant when p&lt;0.05 by two-tailed Student’s T test. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, asterisks denote statistical significance as calculated by Student’s T test (*p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Proximity analysis</title><p>HeLa M2 cells expressing ORFeus for 24 hr were plated on fibronectin treated chamber-slides, treated with 0.1 μg/ml doxycycline, fixed and stained using JH74 rabbit primary antibody against ORF1p, Alexa 647 conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and DAPI as described in the method section. Images were collected with the Arrayscan VTI system and cell positions within each slide obtained using the Compartmental Analysis Bioapplication. To quantify if cells with nuclear ORF1 are significantly closer to each other compared to random cells, we first calculated the shortest distance for each nuclear ORF1 cell to another nuclear ORF1 cell. Next, we randomly and repeatedly (n = 1000) select the same number of cells as there are nuclear ORF1 cells and obtain the distribution of distances that correspond to random localization of non-nuclear ORF1 cells. We used the random distribution to calculate the p-value and a false discovery rate (FDR). Finally, we compared the distribution of distances for nuclear ORF1 cells that are significantly closer to each other (p-value=0.1) with the distribution of a random sample that did not express nuclear ORF1 using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Data and software availability</title><p>Mass spectrometry data for ORF2p and V5-PCNA sequential IP presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> have been deposited in MassIVE archive under submission number MSV000081124 and in ProteomeXchange archive under submission number PXD006628.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH grant P50GM107632 to JDB.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;LINE-1 and the cell cycle: protein localization and functional dynamics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Suzanne Sandmeyer (Reviewer #2); Geoffrey Faulkner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work presented in the paper addresses an issue in the retrotransposition field that is of long standing, of much interest to other areas (the cell cycle field), and of much significance in understanding aspects of trafficking and nucleic acid sensing. The major conclusion is that LINE1/L1 &quot;hop&quot; frequencies are affected by the cell cycle. Numerous readouts of L1 components are assayed and localized across the cell cycle, under various manipulations of the cycle.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper was uniformly viewed by the three reviewers as being of much interest and value. All three had very specific issues that they felt needed to be addressed/corrected before the paper would be suitable for acceptance. I include all their reviews with this response because I think their full comments will be valuable. With respect to their comments, the most important could be summarized here:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1 suggests adding more assays of the L1 nucleic acids, admitting that this is a major undertaking. I agree that this is probably too much to ask, though certainly any information the authors have available in this area would strengthen the paper.</p><p>The other issues here should be readily addressed, mostly by softening claims or interpretations.</p><p>Interpreting the cell cycle status seems to need revising.</p><p>The significance of the Orf2-containing complexes seems to need softening -- the assumptions about their position in the life cycle of retrotransposition need to be revised.</p><p>2) Reviewer 2:</p><p>The Orf1 localization, and again the significance and the basis of that localization, seem to be in question. Likely the conclusions here need to be softened, or at least better justified. An alternative explanation should be discussed, or the reasons for not doing so, should be offered.</p><p>The effects of synchrony on transposition have an alternative explanation that, again, should be addressed or dismissed, if there is a reason to do so.</p><p>The other requests for clarification should be addressed by revisions.</p><p>3) Reviewer 3:</p><p>All the requests for clarification here seem appropriate and can be addressed by revisions. Points 10 and 12 are more demanding. Point 10 in particular asks for more data, and I agree this would be attractive but may require much work. Likely this point can be handled by softening the interpretations, or offering alternatives. Point 12 is an issue of much interest to me, and I hope can be addressed in detail -- the timing of appearance of the readout is key, and needs to be brought up (probably right away in the description of the experiments).</p><p>We look forward to a revision addressing as many of the comments of the reviewers as possible.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript was submitted as a companion to Malloy et al. although they are related and could possibly be merged into a single perhaps more robust report, I agree that as written these two co submitted datasets tell two separate but complementary stories that are strong enough to stand alone; this study provides exciting new information that addresses a controversy in the literature about whether LINE-1 retrotransposes in dividing or non-dividing cells and reports novel findings about the timing of different L1 intermediates across the cell cycle. The only major concern is that this work would be strengthened by co-identification/localization of L1 nucleic acid intermediates, ideally both RNA and cDNA, although this addition would be a major undertaking and should not be required before this substantial advance to the field can be shared. However, the lack of this information impacts and to some extent invalidates the conclusions as stated. My concerns are largely about the authors' interpretations and conclusions, and not the quality or robustness of the data which are excellent.</p><p>In descriptions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it appears that nuclear ORF2p has a punctate pattern in the top panel, but a uniform distribution in the bottom panel, or if punctate, co localizing with ORF1p which also appears faintly punctate in the bottom panel nuclear staining. Also, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>igure with JH73 seems to show more punctate nuclear ORF1p staining, as does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and the first movie. Either better images are required or the text needs to back off from the claim that there is only uniform, non-punctate ORF1p nuclear staining and that this is completely distinct from the pattern of ORF2p staining.</p><p>In light of the accompanying manuscript by Malloy, the conclusion (subsection “Analysis and quantification of ORF1p and ORF2p expression and cellular Localization”) &quot;impaired in binding to ORF2p….most of the nuclear ORF1p species fail to bind ORF2p&quot; is somewhat misleading – most of the ORF2p detected overall is not bound to ORF1p in the absence of RNA and the RNA is a crucial transposition intermediate.</p><p>Some of the cell cycle interpretations are questionable because: Cyclebase3.0 indicates that Cdt1 is max at the G1/S boundary, not G1 (as repeatedly noted), and geminin increases at the beginning of S but is maximal beginning mid-S through midG2, then declines again. Also, the effects of leptomycin treatment are less than 2x. These kinetics and results call into question the interpretation in subsection “LINE-1 retrotransposition peaks during S phase” &quot;Following early G1, ORF1p is then exported to the cytoplasm.&quot; Maybe instead TPRT occurs immediately prior to release of the cell cycle G1/S block (no reason to assume that block prevents ORF2 endo or RT function), ORF1p is displaced as RNA is copied to cDNA and then exported/degraded. This scenario is also consistent with the findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> with the nocodazole block.</p><p>Major concerns regarding the conclusions of subsection “ORF2p binds chromatin and localizes at replication forks with PCNA during S Phase” &quot;Interestingly, as expected from our previous observations revealing that ORF1p is not necessarily in the complex(es) with chromatin bound retrotransposing L1RNPs, immunoprecipitation of ORF1p pulled down only a small amount of ORF2p, and also a smaller amount of MCM6 and PCNA proteins. These observations suggest that the retrotransposing L1 complex containing ORF2p, PCNA and components of the replication fork such as MCM6, are depleted of ORF1 proteins&quot;. What is the evidence that the ORF2p-PCNA complex is a &quot;retrotransposing L1 complex&quot;? Minimally it is necessary to show that L1 RNA is there since that is a key intermediate in the complex undergoing active retrotransposition. Perhaps the ORF2 that lingers on the DNA with PCNA is simply stable with an interference complex, or a repair complex after all of the key tprt steps (cleavage of target and reverse transcription of the RNA) are completed. What evidence eliminates either a pre-tprt non-productive interference complex or a post-tprt repair complex as an alternative explanation for the stable ORF2p nuclear complexes? The PCNA foci along with ORF2p could reflect the end repair required to complete insertion /heal the broken backbone presumably left by tprt-long after L1 RNA and (ORF1p) are gone. This concern also applies to the fifth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p>The fourth paragraph in the Discussion section suggests that there are at least two distinct complexes with ORF2p in the nucleus. &quot;Conversely, not all ORF2p nuclear foci overlap with PCNA sites, suggesting that L1 interaction with the replication fork may represent just one of several modes used by L1 to select a DNA target site and retrotranspose.&quot; It is not clear why presume this (or &quot;at least in some instances, retrotransposing L1 may specifically interact with a subset of perhaps stalled replication forks&quot;), since it is a well-established feature of DNA repair that single strand breaks in DNA (as caused by tprt) stall replication forks. Thus, the observed association seems more likely to be a consequence of nearly completed tprt than &quot;retrotransposing L1 specifically interacting with stalled forks during replication&quot;.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>L1 elements represent about 20% of the human genome and yet we still do not completely understand the formation of L1 RNPs and how the integration complex accesses the chromosomal DNA. The questions addressed in this ms are germane and the answers interesting. The Boeke laboratory is a leader in L1 biochemistry. Here they specifically address two key issues-the mechanism of localization of the L1 proteins encoded in the first and second open reading frames (ORFs) during the cell cycle in cells undergoing retrotransposition and the timing of retrotransposition itself. While the authors achieve a high level of reasonableness in their conclusions some rest on inferences from essentially negative results. Unfortunately, as authors note early in the manuscript, for technical reasons their conclusions may be most relevant to cells over-expressing L1 rather than cells in which native retrotransposition is occurring.</p><p>1) L1 encoded proteins bypass active nuclear import during M phase. ORF1 is enriched in the nucleus in cells expressing the Cdt1 G1 marker, but is weakly detected and diffuse in cells expressing the geminin S/G2/M marker. Based on this the authors argue that if ORF1 is high in G1 and lower in G2/S/M then it must enter the nucleus in M. However, it appears concentrated rather than simply partitioned. This suggests that ORF1 actively associates with chromatin, an idea that is actually supported by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (IP). If ORf1 does not localize to nucleus by binding chromatin, authors should explain how M phase actually partitions ORF1 to the G1 nucleus over the cytoplasm. Given the reliance on IF, authors should include negative controls under experimental conditions for cells not expressing ORF1 and ORF2. These could be included in Supplemental.</p><p>Authors then investigate the decrease in nuclear ORF1 from G1 to G2/S/M. Initially they propose ORF1 could be degraded or exported. They inhibit CRM1 with leptomycin and see an increase in nuclear ORF1. They conclude that CRM1 export of ORF1 is responsible for the lower level of nuclear ORF1 in cells in S/G2/M compared to G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). There are several problems with this conclusion: (1) there is no attempt to be quantitative, or show a NES, or a control exported protein, so this leaves room for protein turnover to explain the observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; (2) it is notable that authors ignore a possible converse mechanism for high levels of nuclear ORF1 in G1, ie. low CRM1 activity (this could be tested with leptomycin treatment of cells blocked in G1-S-if reduced CRM1 activity is not involved ORF1 by IF should remain the same); (3) finally, although IF suggests a drop in nuclear ORF1 with progression from G1, the IP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> does not seem to support that as it shows nuclear ORF1 seeming to increase slightly or remain constant. Authors please comment.</p><p>2) Retrotransposition peaks in S. Here authors initially present three possibilities: retrotransposition could occur in M, S, or G2, but only directly arrest cells for testing in M phase. Authors please clarify interpretation of the M phase arrest experiment. If retrotransposition is induced prior to arrest and occurs in the course of their experiment (Figure 4AB), assuming no retrotransposition in M phase cells, there should be decreasing retrotransposition with increasing time of arrest across the histogram chart in 4B from 0 to 21 h. Instead, retrotransposition remains constant or increases slightly with longer nocodazole arrest.</p><p>Authors use doxy induction followed by nocodazole/shakeoff to synchronize cells to initiate the cell cycle in M phase and then test for correlation between cell cycle and retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-F</xref>). In this experiment the authors argue if there is no effect of cell cycle, then there will be a constant increase in retrotransposed cells and conversely if there is an effect, then retrotransposition will occur synchronously in the permissive phase of the cell cycle leading to a peak in the rate of accumulation of retrotransposed cells. However, there is no specific control for the effect of synchronous induction of L1 or the level of intermediates upon release from nocodazole arrest (ie. synchrony at the beginning could lead to synchrony at the time taken to complete retrotransposition). Implicit in authors' argument is that intermediates have accumulated starting with nocodazole arrest and are poised to integrate. It should be simple to show that RNA and proteins are accumulating from 0 to 12 (during M, G0, G1) in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> experiment. One possibility is that they are at some equilibrium level obviating the synchronous induction problem.</p><p>The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> experiment is clever and convincing but conclusions should be more clearly stated. This experiment shows a peak of newly-expressed reporter (blue) in S, but it is difficult to ignore what appear to be significant shoulders in G2/M. Authors emphasize the S phase peak. For example, in the Discussion section they state &quot;.it is during the following S phase in which retrotransposition peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The finding that L1 retrotransposition has a strong bias for S phase is not surprising&quot; and the Abstract concludes similarly that retrotransposition &quot;peaks during S phase&quot;. Readers might take from this that retrotransposition is restricted to S when in fact authors are only concluding that it peaks in S. There are several reasons to be careful about leaving readers with this impression. These authors have previously shown that L1 mutants affected in RT activity do not co-IP with PCNA, so that association with targets could occur before PCNA is present (ie not necessarily at replication forks). Also, PCNA is known to associate with repair sites as well as replication forks, so that the association with targets might not require an active replication fork. Consistent with that, in NHEJ mutants there are differences in L1 integration, consistent with L1 integration possibly occurring in association with DNA repair, potentially in G2. I think Goodier et al. did not identify PCNA in their MS report on the L1 interactome. Please comment on experimental conditions if known that could explain why Goodier did not see PCNA (or correct this impression!), given the justifiable importance placed on PCNA.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. Authors, please explain why nuclear ORF1 is not decreased in S and G2/M and why proteins are not increasing throughout since they are induced to be expressed and other proteins are presumably at steady state. Please comment on the significance of the fuzzy ORF1 band in nuclear soluble material. Is soluble ORF1 modified?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. MS data are presented to support the interaction between ORF2 and PCNA and indirectly the argument for S phase. However, according to Materials and methods section, 279 proteins that were identified for query in the STRING database were searched &quot; to identify known protein-protein interactions between these candidates&quot;. This sounds as though <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> only shows proteins known to interact with PCNA. In addition, two peptides allowing one or two missed sites is stated as the threshold, but MS data could better be presented as a probability to account for differences in recovery of peptides based on the size of the protein as well as the efficiency of recovery of larger peptides. This presentation of the data seems to have been somewhat filtered to support the PCNA replication fork thesis. Authors should better justify the threshold for reporting and at least in Supplemental show a ranked list of the 279 proteins identified in the two step IP-MS.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Mita et al. make some interesting observations regarding the dynamic nature of L1 retrotransposition during the cell cycle. Although these data are potentially of importance to the field, their presentation could be substantially improved and clarified, and it is necessary to avoid over-interpretation. Use of qualitative phrases like &quot;ORF1p is always mostly cytoplasmic&quot; and generalizations like &quot;ORF1p is never nuclear in cells in S/G2/M phase&quot;-the language is simultaneously too strong yet inexact.

The only major concern is that this work would be strengthened by co-identification/localization of L1 nucleic acid intermediates, ideally both RNA and cDNA, although this addition would be a major undertaking and should not be required before this substantial advance to the field can be shared. However, the lack of this information impacts and to some extent invalidates the conclusions as stated. My concerns are largely about the authors' interpretations and conclusions, and not the quality or robustness of the data which are excellent.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful and positive comments.

Our IF staining and IPs with JH73g (that recognizes a nuclear form of ORF1p) and Molloy’s GO term analysis of ORF2p not bound to ORF1p (and most likely still bound to L1 mRNA) both support the idea that the ORF2p-only fraction is nuclear. These points are emphasized in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the cell cycle interpretations are questionable because: Cyclebase3.0 indicates that Cdt1 is max at the G1/S boundary, not G1 (as repeatedly noted), and geminin increases at the beginning of S but is maximal beginning mid-S through midG2, then declines again.</p></disp-quote><p>Many works have now used Cdt1 and geminin as markers of G1 and S/G2/M phase respectively (Aizer et al., 2013; Coleman et al., 2015; Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008; Shiomi et al., 2014; Truong and Wu, 2011; Wohlschlegel et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2014). Mechanistically, it is now known that Cdt1 is a key licensing factor that must be rapidly destroyed upon initiation of DNA replication. Geminin (GMNN) is a DNA Replication inhibitor that, together with absence of Cdt1, prevents spurious re-initiation of DNA replication during S/G2/M phase. Cdt1 and Geminin are highly regulated in the cell by post-translational modification and degradation by the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C) in the case of Geminin and SCF-Skp2 complex in the case of Cdt1. Therefore, the critical factor is the protein (not mRNA) levels of Cdt1 and Geminin. We did check Cyclebase 3.0 for <italic>CDT1</italic> and <italic>GMNN</italic> (geminin) (we thank the reviewer for introducing us to this valuable resource) but found relevant data only on GMNN. Geminin transcripts, as mentioned by the reviewer, peak at early S, but the protein is expressed from late G1 to the end of mitosis rendering it a perfect marker for S/G2/M phases. The use of Geminin and Cdt1 as markers of S/G2/M and G1 are strongly corroborated by data on FUCCI cell lines (Bajar et al., 2016; Mechali and Lutzmann, 2008; Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008; Sakaue-Sawano and Miyawaki, 2014). FUCCI cell lines use the “destruction” peptides from Cdt1 and Geminin conjugated to fluorophores for easy visualization of G1 and S/G2/M cell cycle stages respectively. We verified the expression of the proteins with live cell imaging and confirmed the previously published data. We are therefore confident that cells positively stained for Cdt1 are in G1 while cells positively stained for Geminin are in S/G2/M.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the effects of leptomycin treatment are less than 2x. These kinetics and results call into question the interpretation on p7 &quot;Following early G1, ORF1p is then exported to the cytoplasm.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the differences observed with leptomycin treatments are small but they are highly reproducible and have been repeated with several antibodies as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We attribute this absence of bigger effects to possible indirect roles of CRM1 in ORF1p nuclear export or the possible existence of multiple pathways for ORF1p export and/or degradation. Also, the technical difficulties of this type of experiment, i.e., treatment with low concentrations of leptomycin for a time allowing cells to go through at least one mitosis present a challenge. Treatments with higher concentrations of leptomycin induce inhibition of cell cycle progression and prevent cells from entering and exiting from mitosis that we know to be essential for entrance of L1 RNPs into the nucleus. We now present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), controls (MEK1-GFP) showing the effectiveness of this leptomycin regimen, as also requested by reviewer #2. Finally, we stress another point strongly supporting our hypothesis that nuclear ORF1p cycles during the cell cycle. We have very clear results using FUCCI cell lines that show that no cells 4 in S phase present nuclear ORF1p staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and subsection “Analysis and quantification of ORF1p and ORF2p expression and cellular localization”). This outcome would be impossible if ORF1p did not cycle into the cytoplasm (and/or get degraded in the nucleus) after G1 phase in populations of cycling cells induced to express L1 for more than 24 hrs. Indeed, if nuclear ORF1p is not degraded or exported back into the cytoplasm after one cell cycle (&lt; 24h in HeLa cells) the protein localization of ORF1p would soon reach steady state and all cells would present nuclear ORF1p. This is clearly not the case (see Table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Maybe instead TPRT occurs immediately prior to release of the cell cycle G1/S block (no reason to assume that block prevents ORF2 endo or RT function), ORF1p is displaced as RNA is copied to cDNA and then exported/degraded. This scenario is also consistent with the findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> with the nocodazole block.</p></disp-quote><p>To make sure that retrotransposition did not initiate in late G1 we performed similar experiments to the one presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref> but instead of using nocodazole we treated cells with mimosine or thymidine to analyze the effect of arrest at the G1/S boundary. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>/D show no increase of retrotransposition with increasing time in late G1 supporting our idea that retrotransposition happens during S phase proper. This is also when PCNA joins the MCM complex to the replication fork. Interestingly, we observed a decrease in retrotransposition upon treatment with mimosine suggesting additional modes of L1 inhibition by this compound (see answer 7 to reviewer #2).</p><p>Moreover, we know from sequencing of L1 insertions into the genome, that the number of successful retrotranspositions per cell are few (one-two per cell over a period of days). Follow up experiments to the data presented here have led us to believe that most of the L1 recruited to DNA produces “aborted” retrotransposition due to action of homologous recombination repair machinery and/or other inhibitors. Recruitment of L1 RNP to DNA is a distinct step that is necessary but not sufficient for successful TPRT. We therefore argue that if ORF1p leaves the L1 RNP only during productive TPRT, undetectably few molecules would exit the nucleus or be degraded. We don’t think we could visualize that with standard fluorescence microscopy techniques such as those implemented here. Finally, if the reviewer’s hypothesis were true, in cells presenting high nuclear ORF2p and no nuclear ORF1p as for the cell shown in the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, all L1 RNPs should have gone through TPRT or at least one RT reaction to allow all ORF1p to be degraded or exported from the nucleus. This scenario seems unlikely given the overall inefficiency of retrotransposition. In our opinion, our results taken as a whole, are more easily explained by a general loss of ORF1p from nuclear L1 RNPs that is not directly linked to TPRT and probably precedes that step. This interpretation is strongly supported by the staining with JH73g antibody described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. This antibody more specifically recognizes nuclear ORF1p that interacts less with ORF2p, supporting the existence of some still unknown difference between nuclear and cytoplasmic ORF1</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns regarding the conclusions of subsection “ORF2p binds chromatin and localizes at replication forks with PCNA during S</p><p>Phase” &quot;Interestingly, as expected from our previous observations revealing that ORF1p is not necessarily in the complex(es) with chromatin bound retrotransposing L1RNPs, immunoprecipitation of ORF1p pulled down only a small amount of ORF2p, and also a smaller amount of MCM6 and PCNA proteins. These observations suggest that the retrotransposing L1 complex containing ORF2p, PCNA and components of the replication fork such as MCM6, are depleted of ORF1 proteins&quot;. What is the evidence that the ORF2p-PCNA complex is a &quot;retrotransposing L1 complex&quot;? Minimally it is necessary to show that L1 RNA is there since that is a key intermediate in the complex undergoing active retrotransposition.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly points out that we lack direct data to unequivocally confirm that the PCNA-ORF2p complex is the L1 retrotransposing complex. We perhaps prematurely “labeled” this complex as the retrotransposing complex for the following reasons:</p><p>- ORF2p bound to PCNA is found on chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and unpublished data from our laboratory aimed to identify ORF2p interacting proteins from cellular chromatin fractions using mass spectrometry analysis)</p><p>- ORF2p with mutated PIP domain is retrotransposition incompetent (Taylor et al., 2013)</p><p>- L1 RNPs isolated by ORF2p IP co-immunoprecipitating PCNA, are competent for in vitro LEAP and RT activity (Taylor et al., 2013)</p><p>- As our new results show, the PCNA-ORF2p complex also contains L1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>)</p><p>Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there is no published <italic>in-vivo</italic> or <italic>in-vitro</italic> method to demonstrate that the PCNA-ORF2p complex is the actual complex involved in TPRT. Our laboratory is heavily invested in trying to develop an in vitro TPRT assay that would measure the ability of a specific ORF2p complex to cut a target DNA, retro-transcribe L1 mRNA, and reinsert its cDNA into the target DNA. Despite some advances toward this goal we are currently unable to definitively and directly assay the “TPRT capability” of a specific protein complex in vitro or in vivo. Based on the available data previously published and presented in this manuscript and in the Molloy et al. co-submitted manuscript, the most likely complex to be a retrotransposing complex is one comprising ORF2p, L1 RNA and PCNA. We agree with the reviewer that, technically, defining the PCNA-ORF2p complex as the “L1 retrotransposing complex” is premature and therefore we changed our wording to “retrotransposition-competent complex” in the Discussion section and to “nuclear complex” in subsection “ORF2p binds chromatin and localizes at replication forks with PCNA during S phase” and “L1 possibly engaged in TPRT” in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps the ORF2 that lingers on the DNA with PCNA is simply stable with an interference complex, or a repair complex after all of the key tprt steps (cleavage of target and reverse transcription of the RNA) are completed. What evidence eliminates either a pre-tprt non-productive interference complex or a post-tprt repair complex as an alternative explanation for the stable ORF2p nuclear complexes? The PCNA foci along with ORF2p could reflect the end repair required to complete insertion /heal the broken backbone presumably left by tprt-long after L1 RNA and (ORF1p) are gone. This concern also applies to the fifth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks an excellent question that we would also re-phrase as: “is ORF2p recruited to chromatin by PCNA or is PCNA recruited to the site of retrotransposition by ORF2p?”. In our previous work (Taylor et al., 2013) we showed that ORF2p EN or RT mutants do not interact directly with PCNA. Our unpublished data also show that the ORF2p PIP mutant, incapable of interacting with PCNA (Taylor et al., 2013) is still able to bind chromatin. These data suggest that retrotransposing ORF2p recruits PCNA to the 6 DNA. Then how do we justify ORF2p binding to the MCM complex? It is possible that ORF2p is recruited to the replication fork through another mechanism, and that after the initial steps of TPRT, interaction with PCNA, readily available at the replication fork, becomes essential for the completion/repair of the L1 reinsertion in the genome. Supporting this idea, we find ligase 1/LIG1 (that interacts with PCNA on replication fork and mediates ligation of the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand) as an ORF2p interactor in chromatin bound fractions from cycling HeLa cells (unpublished data). We therefore hypothesize that PCNA is recruited to ORF2p after the endonuclease cleavage and right after RT engagement with L1 mRNA template but before completion of TPRT and final ligation of L1 cDNA into the genome. This would justify the fact that many molecules of PCNA strongly interact with ORF2p as judged by co-IP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Throughout the manuscript we never mentioned whether ORF2p is recruited by PCNA onto chromatin (or vice versa) because the model explained above is, in our opinion, still too speculative. We realize though that this approach may mislead the readers and therefore, to incorporate these more speculative aspects of our model, we added a paragraph to the Discussion section about this subject. We also modified our graphical abstract eliminating the arrow depicting retrotransposition that might mislead the readers into thinking that retrotransposition happened via PCNA-mediated recruitment of L1 onto host DNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The fourth paragraph in the Discussion section suggests that there are at least two distinct complexes with ORF2p in the nucleus. &quot;Conversely, not all ORF2p nuclear foci overlap with PCNA sites, suggesting that L1 interaction with the replication fork may represent just one of several modes used by L1 to select a DNA target site and retrotranspose.&quot; It is not clear why presume this (or &quot;at least in some instances, retrotransposing L1 may specifically interact with a subset of perhaps stalled replication forks&quot;), since it is a well-established feature of DNA repair that single strand breaks in DNA (as caused by tprt) stall replication forks. Thus, the observed association seems more likely to be a consequence of nearly completed tprt than &quot;retrotransposing L1 specifically interacting with stalled forks during replication&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised, again, a very interesting point that we are still investigating in our follow up work to this manuscript. Is ORF2p recruited specifically to stalled replication forks or is it the DNA nick made by ORF2p endonuclease that stalls the replication fork? In our present model both possibilities are plausible. The sentences in the manuscript cited by the reviewer only aim to explain why not all ORF2p chromatin foci observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref> coincide with a PCNA focus. We have softened and clarified the concepts in the text (Discussion section).</p><p>We lean towards a model in which L1 RNPs are recruited to stalled replication forks, and not vice-versa, because of an experiment we performed treating cells with low concentrations of aphydicolin, a compound that induces stalling of replication forks. Upon treatment, retrotransposition is increased suggesting that the stalling caused retrotransposition and not that retrotransposition caused the stalling. One interpretation of these experiment is that L1 RNPs, dragged along with the replication fork, may use 7 stalling as a signal to start retrotransposition. This hypothesis would also explain the strong interaction between ORF2p, PCNA and MCM proteins reported here. In our opinion, collision of the replication fork to retrotransposing ORF2p seems less likely to survive two sequential IPs as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p>The question, however, remains still open to future investigations.</p><p>We added more details about our model and about L1 chromatin recruitment in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>L1 elements represent about 20% of the human genome and yet we still do not completely understand the formation of L1 RNPs and how the integration complex accesses the chromosomal DNA. The questions addressed in this ms are germane and the answers interesting. The Boeke laboratory is a leader in L1 biochemistry. Here they specifically address two key issues-the mechanism of localization of the L1 proteins encoded in the first and second open reading frames (ORFs) during the cell cycle in cells undergoing retrotransposition and the timing of retrotransposition itself. While the authors achieve a high level of reasonableness in their conclusions some rest on inferences from essentially negative results. Unfortunately, as authors note early in the manuscript, for technical reasons their conclusions may be most relevant to cells over-expressing L1 rather than cells in which native retrotransposition is occurring.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments and for acknowledging the contribution of our manuscript. We gave extensive explanations about the logic that lead to our conclusions that we hope will convince the reviewer of the validity of our model. We also integrated several paragraphs in the main text to clarify our views as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) L1 encoded proteins bypass active nuclear import during M phase. ORF1 is enriched in the nucleus in cells expressing the Cdt1 G1 marker, but is weakly detected and diffuse in cells expressing the geminin S/G2/M marker. Based on this the authors argue that if ORF1 is high in G1 and lower in G2/S/M then it must enter the nucleus in M. However, it appears concentrated rather than simply partitioned. This suggests that ORF1 actively associates with chromatin, an idea that is actually supported by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (IP). If ORf1 does not localize to nucleus by binding chromatin, authors should explain how M phase actually partitions ORF1 to the G1 nucleus over the cytoplasm.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a very interesting point that we partially explored. ORF1p is a highly positively charged protein (unsurprising considering it is an RNA binding protein) and it likely engages in at least weak interaction with chromatin during M phase when ORF1p has access to DNA. Interestingly, a low percentage of L1 expressing cells transitioning through M phase shows a strong chromatin recruitment of ORF1p during metaphase. A distortion caused by a C-terminal GFP-tag on ORF1p strongly enhances such chromatin recruitment (unpublished data). Moreover, as the reviewer already noticed, we always observe chromatin recruitment of ORF1p upon cellular fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We can see recruitment of ORF1p on chromatin even in the absence of ORF2p (expressing constructs lacking ORF2p) suggesting that ORF1p chromatin recruitment is independent of ORF2p and retrotransposition (unpublished data). We therefore lean towards the possibility that ORF1p has weak interactions with chromatin that facilitate the localization of L1 RNPs onto chromatin and the post-mitotic nuclear localization of L1. But the nuclear import of proteins lacking a nuclear localization signal is still poorly understood. It is accepted that proteins can be “trapped” in the nucleus during mitosis and after nuclear membrane reformation.</p><p>We added a paragraph about these interesting hypotheses in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the reliance on IF, authors should include negative controls under experimental conditions for cells not expressing ORF1 and ORF2. These could be included in Supplemental.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a new Supplementary figure to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) presenting the negative controls for our IF staining: secondary only controls and staining of non-expressing cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors then investigate the decrease in nuclear ORF1 from G1 to G2/S/M. Initially they propose ORF1 could be degraded or exported. They inhibit CRM1 with leptomycin and see an increase in nuclear ORF1. They conclude that CRM1 export of ORF1 is responsible for the lower level of nuclear ORF1 in cells in S/G2/M compared to G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). There are several problems with this conclusion: (1) there is no attempt to be quantitative, or show a NES, or a control exported protein, so this leaves room for protein turnover to explain the observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>;</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer we added a Supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) showing nuclear retention of a known CRM1 regulated protein (MEK1-GFP) in HeLa-M2 cells treated with leptomycin for different amounts of time. This serves as control showing that treatment of cells with leptomycin induces nuclear retention of CRM1 regulated proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) it is notable that authors ignore a possible converse mechanism for high levels of nuclear ORF1 in G1, ie. low CRM1 activity (this could be tested with leptomycin treatment of cells blocked in G1-S-if reduced CRM1 activity is not involved ORF1 by IF should remain the same);</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer suggests that CRM1 levels and activity during the cell cycle may be responsible for the increased ORF1p we observed during early G1. We are not aware of CRM1 activity or cellular expression fluctuation during the cell cycle. Cyclebase 3.0 (Santos et al., 2015) reports CRM1/XPO1 mRNA expression peaking at the boundary of M / G1 and decreasing in late G1 /early S (a behavior opposite of what one would imagine if CRM1 level was regulating nuclear export of ORF1p in late G1/S). Also, protein expression of CRM1 is reported as high and constant during the whole cell cycles showing no fluctuation, suggesting that CRM1 cellular expression is probably not involved in ORF1p (and other proteins) nuclear localization.</p><p>Moreover, we are quite confident that the increased ORF1p in early G1 results from L1 RNPs entering the nucleus during mitosis. Several evidence types support this:</p><p>- cells with high nuclear ORF1p staining are closer together compared to cells with cytoplasmic ORF1p suggesting that these cells recently exited mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>- our unpublished data on live cell imaging tracking ORF1p tagged with GFP clearly showed that ORF1p can get “trapped” in the nucleus upon transition through mitosis. Unfortunately, GFP seems to exacerbate ORF1p chromatin binding (see answer to question 1) rendering these results, in our opinion, less convincing than the ones presented in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) finally, although IF suggests a drop in nuclear ORF1 with progression from G1, the IP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> does not seem to support that as it shows nuclear ORF1 seeming to increase slightly or remain constant. Authors please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to question 9 of this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Retrotransposition peaks in S. Here authors initially present three possibilities: retrotransposition could occur in M, S, or G2, but only directly arrest cells for testing in M phase. Authors please clarify interpretation of the M phase arrest experiment. If retrotransposition is induced prior to arrest and occurs in the course of their experiment (Figure 4AB), assuming no retrotransposition in M phase cells, there should be decreasing retrotransposition with increasing time of arrest across the histogram chart in 4B from 0 to 21 h. Instead, retrotransposition remains constant or increases slightly with longer nocodazole arrest.</p></disp-quote><p>The cells treated with nocodazole are initially asynchronous (usually starting at about 40-50% G1, 20-30% S and 20-30% G2/M). Upon nocodazole treatment, cells in mitosis (about 10%) arrest while the rest proceed through the cell cycle to stop at mitosis. Mitotic cells are then collected by mechanical shake off (this point is now clarified in the Materials and methods section and the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and analyzed for% of GFP+ cells. In the 21 hrs considered for this experiment there is no time for a cell to go through more than one cell cycle (and thus through &gt;1 S phase) even in the case of no nocodazole treatment. This means that the presented experiment is assessing only retrotransposition in cells that spent increasing times in M phase upon nocodazole treatment going through just one S phase. If the experiments could be extended for more than 21 hrs (already a 11 time point showing increased cell death) retrotransposition would decrease compared to the control cycling population.</p><p>We also added to the revised manuscript similar analysis for cells synchronized in G1 phase by treatment with mimosine 1mM and thymidine 4mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors use doxy induction followed by nocodazole/shakeoff to synchronize cells to initiate the cell cycle in M phase and then test for correlation between cell cycle and retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-F</xref>). In this experiment the authors argue if there is no effect of cell cycle, then there will be a constant increase in retrotransposed cells and conversely if there is an effect, then retrotransposition will occur synchronously in the permissive phase of the cell cycle leading to a peak in the rate of accumulation of retrotransposed cells. However, there is no specific control for the effect of synchronous induction of L1 or the level of intermediates upon release from nocodazole arrest (ie. synchrony at the beginning could lead to synchrony at the time taken to complete retrotransposition). Implicit in authors' argument is that intermediates have accumulated starting with nocodazole arrest and are poised to integrate. It should be simple to show that RNA and proteins are accumulating from 0 to 12 (during M, G0, G1) in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> experiment. One possibility is that they are at some equilibrium level obviating the synchronous induction problem.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has concerns about possible effects of synchronization per se on retrotransposition. This was our concern when we designed experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> that analyzes cycling pools of cells without needing synchronization. The results obtained with the use of fluorescent timer-AI constructs, mirrored the results obtained synchronizing the cells with nocodazole so we deemed these latter experiments worthy of publication. A (less elegant) alternative would have been the use of other synchronization methods. Unfortunately, the only other synchronization methods that we are aware of are not as effective as nocodazole, allowing many cells to escape the block. Other approaches require sequential synchronizations and are not easily adapted to our retrotransposition assay.</p><p>Finally, we have no reason to believe that the expression of L1 (ORF1p) under the Tet-promoter is regulated by the cell cycle. We also show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref> that ORF2p is expressed equally in G1 or S/G2/M cells. We therefore exclude a cell cycle effect on ORF2p translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> experiment is clever and convincing but conclusions should be more clearly stated. This experiment shows a peak of newly-expressed reporter (blue) in S, but it is difficult to ignore what appear to be significant shoulders in G2/M.</p></disp-quote><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) we presented two experiments using cells expressing an ORFeus L1 with a fluorescent timer-AI cassette in its 3’UTR. Cells were treated for 24 h with doxycycline to induce expression of L1. In panel B, blue only cells (blue shaded histogram) and unstained cells from the same population (black and white histogram) were sorted and directly fixed in ethanol. The cells were then post-stained with propidium iodide to analyze the cell cycle stage of these cells. The result showed that blue-only cells (cells that completed retrotransposed within 3 hrs preceding sorting) accumulate mainly in S phase. In this setting we also observed a big shoulder of cells in G2/M phase as 12 pointed out by the reviewer. Therefore, we decided to use an experimental setting that does not require fixation and sorting but relies on the direct measurement of the cell cycle stage of different populations: non-fluorescent cells (black and white line), blue-only cells (blue shaded histogram) and blue cells with a very low red fluorescence (red shaded histogram). Using SYTO61 dye, that does not interfere with the fluorescent timer fluorescence, for the analysis of the cell cycle allowed us to easily gate the different cell populations and get a deeper insight into the big peak observed in panel A. We found that the peak shown in panel B actually consists of two sub-peaks: a peak of cells that are pure blue and in S phase and a peak of cells that progressed further into the cell cycle after retrotransposition and therefore display a blue/low red signal usually hidden by the background in analysis like the one shown in panel B. We therefore confirmed that retrotransposing cells are mainly in S phase.</p><p>To help clarify the logic behind the experimental design of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>/B) we added a few lines to the description of the figure in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors emphasize the S phase peak. For example, in the Discussion section they state &quot;.it is during the following S phase in which retrotransposition peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The finding that L1 retrotransposition has a strong bias for S phase is not surprising&quot; and the Abstract concludes similarly that retrotransposition &quot;peaks during S phase&quot;. Readers might take from this that retrotransposition is restricted to S when in fact authors are only concluding that it peaks in S. There are several reasons to be careful about leaving readers with this impression. These authors have previously shown that L1 mutants affected in RT activity do not co-IP with PCNA, so that association with targets could occur before PCNA is present (ie not necessarily at replication forks). Also, PCNA is known to associate with repair sites as well as replication forks, so that the association with targets might not require an active replication fork. Consistent with that, in NHEJ mutants there are differences in L1 integration, consistent with L1 integration possibly occurring in association with DNA repair, potentially in G2</p></disp-quote><p>Like reviewer #1, this reviewer raises a very interesting point: is L1 recruited on chromatin by PCNA or, vice-versa, PCNA is recruited by L1 on the site of retrotransposition. We think that PCNA is recruited to the L1 complex bound to chromatin in late stages of TPRT after genomic DNA cut and initiation of L1 RT (please see response 7 to reviewer 1).</p><p>We do not think that the MCM proteins are found in complex with ORF2p and PCNA simply because of collision of the replication fork with the site of DNA damage created by L1 as already discussed in the responses to reviewer 1 (please see response 8 to reviewer 1).

Is soluble ORF1 modified?</p></disp-quote><p>Nuclear fractionations (nuclei isolated and pelleted from low detergent or hypotonic buffer treated cells) are not as clean as chromatin fractions (proteins released from chromatin after micrococcal nuclease treatment). We therefore do not think that conventional fractionations can efficiently separate nuclear ORF1p from cytoplasmic ORF1p. We observed pelleting of cytoplasmic stress granules containing large amounts of ORF1p during nuclear fractionation, as shown by the G3BP1 marker in the chromatin fraction presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">figure 6</xref> the nuclear fraction was presented for comparison with the chromatin fraction used for analysis. This is probably the reason why we could not observe differences in nuclear and cytoplasmic amount of ORF1p during the cell cycle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). A short explanation has now been added to the main text (subsection “LINE-1 retrotransposition peaks during S phase”).</p><p>The presented blots show the expression of ORF2p, ORF1p and other proteins in two cellular fractions (chromatin and nuclear fraction) throughout one cell cycle. Other fractions have not been analyzed (cytoplasmic, membrane and “pellet” fraction). To analyze changes in overall expression of ORF1p and ORF2p all of the fractions should be summed or a total lysed fraction needs to be considered. Moreover, at time zero the cells have been already treated with doxycycline for 19 hours. In our experience, upon doxycycline treatment, the overall expression of L1 proteins reaches steady state after 20-24 hrs and therefore we don’t think that differences in total expression would be observed in our experiment.</p><p>The apparent fuzziness of ORF1p in nuclear fractions comes from the fact that we presented a “low exposure” blot because of the very high expression of ORF1p in the nuclear fraction compared to chromatin fraction. We preferred to present a “lower exposure” to better show possible differences in ORF1p nuclear fractions throughout the cell cycle. We clarify also that we use measurement of direct band fluorescence with LiCor CLx to quantify our blots. This analysis is completely independent of “exposure” and therefore, how to present the considered blot, is simply a “stylistic decision”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. MS data are presented to support the interaction between ORF2 and PCNA and indirectly the argument for S phase. However, according to Materials and methods section, 279 proteins that were identified for query in the STRING database were searched &quot; to identify known protein-protein interactions between these candidates&quot;. This sounds as though <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> only shows proteins known to interact with PCNA. In addition, two peptides allowing one or two missed sites is stated as the threshold, but MS data could better be presented as a probability to account for differences in recovery of peptides based on the size of the protein as well as the efficiency of recovery of larger peptides. This presentation of the data seems to have been somewhat filtered to support the PCNA replication fork thesis. Authors should better justify the threshold for reporting and at least in Supplemental show a ranked list of the 279 proteins identified in the two step IP-MS.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously demonstrated the direct interaction of ORF2p with PCNA through the PIP domain of ORF2p (Taylor et al., 2013). The Mass spectrometry analysis presented here was performed to identify additional proteins interacting specifically with the ORF2p/PCNA complex. Our main objective in performing this analysis was to better understand the role of PCNA in the L1 RNPs. As the reviewer mentioned, PCNA plays an important role in both DNA repair and DNA replication so we wanted to understand whether the ORF2p/PCNA complex had anything to do with DNA damage, DNA replication, both or neither. Therefore, we specifically looked in the obtained lists of ORF2p/PCNA interactors for proteins known to interact with PCNA leading us to a specific localization of the L1 RNP on chromatin. It was pretty clear to us, from the identification of the proteins reported in reviewed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> and from the validations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and E</xref>, that other replication fork proteins are associated, suggesting that the fork itself plays a role in the L1 life-cycle. We therefore validated the interaction of MCM6 to L1 proteins by conventional IP-Western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Our finding, of L1 interacting with the replication fork fits well with data showing retrotransposition occurs mainly during S.</p><p>The peptide and protein IDs were filtered using a 1% peptide and protein False discovery rate (FDR) when searched against a decoy database as specified in the Materials and methods section. In addition, we added an extra filter and required at least 2 unique peptides per protein before we considered it ID’d. This is an established standard in the mass spectrometry field. Likewise, using spectral counts as a measure of the relative abundance of a protein in 2 different samples is common practice in the field as accepted for comparative proteomics.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be beneficial to show all the data and therefore attached a new supplementary file (Supplementary file 2) that shows the result output for all 4 affinity purifications.

The samples are therefore all dox-treated, collected and analyzed together at the end of the experiment. Consequently, having an untreated well for each time point would have resulted in having 6 different replicate wells untreated with synchronization agent at the moment of analysis.

We wanted to show that, given a successful retrotransposition, transcription and translation of a fluorescent reporter can occur within less than 3 h, maning retrotransposition was completed within the past 3 hours. With the presented measurements we showed that the expression from the CMV promoter is fast enough to allow detection of FT proteins still emitting blue light because they did not yet mature into red emitting proteins. In other experiments we used a weaker promoter (UBC) to drive the expression of the FT-AI in the L1-FT-AI constructs. Using these constructs, we were unable to identify blue cells. Only red cells were found in the L1 expressing and retrotransposing cell population, suggesting that the time necessary for the retrotransposed FT-AI gene to be transcribed, translated and accumulate to a measurable amount was longer than 3 h (the time of 19 maturation of the FT proteins from blue to red). These experiments also suggest that the strength of the promoter used to drive the AI reporter is an important parameter to consider if studying time of retrotransposition. We rewrote the paragraph to clarify the logic behind measurements of timing of GFP expression (subsection “LINE-1 retrotransposition peaks during S phase”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) How long does it take for a newly-integrated engineered L1 insertion to result in detectable GFP (or FT) expression? If TPRT occurs during S-phase, would the cell actually &quot;turn green&quot; during S-phase? The kinetics of doxycycline-induced GFP expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> suggest that it takes around 3 hours from the time reporter gene expression is induced to achieve detectable expression in 50% of cells, and 8 hours to get detectable expression in 90% of cells. It seems that a similar delay would apply to expression of a reporter gene delivered by L1 retrotransposition.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes! As mentioned in the previous response we measured GFP expression timing to try to quantify the time needed for a newly-integrated engineered L1 insertion to result in detectable GFP (or FT) expression. The mere fact we are able to observe blue-only cells demonstrates that translation and accumulation of protein from a retrotransposed FT gene occurred within less than 3 hrs. Our experiments using Tet-CMV-GFP expression show that transcription, translation and accumulation of GFP can occur in less than 3 hrs. As reported #11 above, to observe blue-only cells, use of a strong promoter such as CMV to drive FT is necessary and our measurements of FT expression timing indicate that transcription from CMV is fast enough to produce visible proteins &lt;3 h. Our measurement upon nocodazole synchronization and release show that cells transition through S in about 5-6 h. Considering our new experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) showing that increasing the time the cells spend in G1 (or G1/S boundary) does not increase retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), we conclude that retrotransposition and the events necessary for its detection (transcription, translation and accumulation of the fluorescent-AI reporter) can all occur in S phase.</p></body></sub-article></article>
