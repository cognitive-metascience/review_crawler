Here, we examine how progenitor cell migration impacts regionally induced commitment within the nephrogenic niche in mice. We identify a subset of cells that express <italic>Wnt4</italic>, an early marker of nephron commitment, but migrate back into the progenitor population where they accumulate over time. Single cell RNA-seq and computational modelling of returning cells reveals that nephron progenitors can traverse the transcriptional hierarchy between self-renewal and commitment in either direction.

Nephron progenitor cells play a central role in this process, signalling to the tips of the ureteric epithelium to promote branching morphogenesis, and providing a pool of cells from which nephron formation can be induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Combes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costantini and Kopan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi et al., 2008</xref>). Iterative rounds of ureteric branching and nephron induction continue until the nephron progenitor population differentiates near the end of gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rumballe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>). The resulting complement of nephrons underpins renal function in adult life.</p><p>Much progress has recently been made in understanding the signals that regulate nephron progenitor fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Combes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2007</xref>). It is less clear how individual nephron progenitors interact with these signals in a three dimensional context. Nephron progenitor cells surround the tips of the ureteric epithelium forming a âcap mesenchymeâ domain that is embedded within, but distinct from cortical stroma and vasculature. Together these populations form the nephrogenic niche, with the least committed nephron progenitor cells at the âtopâ of the tip and nephron formation occurring at the âbottomâ, in the junction between tip and stalk of the ureteric epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mugford et al., 2009</xref>). The spatial segregation of uncommitted and committing nephron progenitor cells is thought to be dictated by differences in signalling activity in the tip versus the stalk of the ureteric epithelium. Tips produce WNT11, BMP7, FGF9 and WNT9B, which act to maintain progenitor self-renewal and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Majumdar et al., 2003</xref>). Canonical Wnt signalling, involving WNT9B from the ureteric epithelium, is critical to induce the epithelialisation of nephron progenitor cells to form nephrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramalingam et al., 2018</xref>). The prevailing model of nephron progenitor differentiation is that cells close to the tip-stalk junction receive higher levels of WNT9B and initiate commitment by upregulating further genes required for nephron initiation such as <italic>Wnt4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kispert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stark et al., 1994</xref>). Prior to epithelialisation, nephron progenitors coalesce to form a pretubular aggregate (PTA), which is characterised as a cluster of cells in the tip-stalk junction, defined by expression of <italic>Wnt4, Fgf8, Pax8,</italic> and <italic>Lhx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Georgas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stark et al., 1994</xref>). Detailed studies of cell polarity and lumen formation in the early nephron identify PTAs as groups of cells within the tip-stalk junction that do not have a lumen or defined apical-basal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Cells within the PTA transition to a primitive renal vesicle (RV), defined as having one or two apical foci containing polarity proteins such as aPKC and PAR3. These foci connect to form a single continuous lumen in a mature renal vesicle, which now represents an epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Patterning and specification of nephron segment identity starts during the formation of these early nephron structures to eventually result in a mature segmented nephron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Georgas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">LindstrÃ¶m et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>Clonal lineage tracing of nephron progenitor cells suggests that one sibling can remain in the progenitor domain while another contributes to a nephron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi et al., 2008</xref>). How one sibling cell commits while the other self-renews is not understood. At a population level, there is support for division of nephron progenitor cells into spatially restricted subdomains that reflect a linear progression in commitment from a self-renewing (<italic>Six2Â +Cited1+</italic>), to a primed (<italic>Six2+</italic>), and committed state (<italic>Wnt4Â +Lef1+</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mugford et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2007</xref>). As such, we might expect that individual progenitors undergo a sequential restriction in potential as they gradually move towards the site of nephron formation and ultimately contribute to an epithelializing PTA. Counter to this model, our own live imaging of 852 individual nephron progenitor cells over 18 hr revealed substantial cell migration within the cap mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Combes et al., 2016</xref>). Nephron progenitor cells moved randomly within and between niches, with this movement influenced by attraction, repulsion, and adhesion to the ureteric tip. Far from a population gradually transitioning through static subdomains, some cells made large movements from the âself-renewingâ to the âcommittingâ region and vice versa, potentially crossing previously proposed domain boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Combes et al., 2016</xref>). These stochastic migration events likely vary the exposure of individual nephron progenitor cells to signalling environments within the niche, raising the question of how cell fate is controlled in such a dynamic environment.</p><p>In this study, we re-examine nephron progenitor commitment using lineage tracing, live imaging, and computational modelling to reconcile the spatially restricted process of commitment with a motile nephron progenitor population. Using an inducible <italic>Wnt4</italic>-Cre, we find that onset of <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression in the early stages of nephron formation does not always trigger differentiation. A subset of cells that express <italic>Wnt4</italic> at the tip-stalk junction migrate out of this region to re-enter the nephron progenitor domain. While these cells have expressed <italic>Wnt4</italic>, they cease to do so after returning to the progenitor domain and may remain within this region long-term, returning to a transcriptional state equivalent to uncommitted nephron progenitor cells. In contrast, the first commitment events in the developing kidney generate a population of cells that can remain in the tip-stalk region and contribute to multiple nephrons. Integrating the observed nephron progenitor migration and plasticity, we define a model of commitment where stochastic cell movement influences exposure to differentiation cues and determines whether cells remain captured within the nephron induction zone or âescapeâ back to the cap mesenchyme. This insight provides a mechanism to explain how a swarm of motile progenitors can both maintain ureteric branching and give rise to committing cells in a manner that is spatially defined and sensitive to changing niche cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Wnt4</italic> lineage tracing labels a population of nephron progenitor cells across time</title><p>Nephron progenitors are assumed differentiate in a linear fashion from an uncommitted, to a primed then committed state.

Our lineage tracing studies suggest that nephron commitment is not a unidirectional process. Some cells are induced to express <italic>Wnt4</italic>, but then reintegrate into the cap mesenchyme. Why then do some cells commit, while others do not? Though the precise events that dictate individual progenitor fate are not known, it is clear that regionally restricted cues trigger commitment at the site of nephron formation. One possibility is that commitment is dependent on the duration of exposure to inductive cues. To investigate this scenario further, we developed a computer simulation of nephron progenitor commitment in a motile, proliferating population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>, Methods). In this model, cells are represented as points that migrate randomly while responding to attraction and repulsion cues from a simulated three-dimensional tip surface. Any cell entering a spatially restricted âinduction zoneâ in the lower region of the tip receives an inductive signal proportional to the time spent in the zone. Cells that reach a threshold level of inductive signal âcommitâ and stop migrating, emulating an epithelialization event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

How this balance is regulated to ensure optimal organ growth and eventual cessation is unresolved. Our previous observations that nephron progenitors behave as a motile swarm, responding to contradictory signals from the adjacent tip, were difficult to reconcile with the established view of a linear, sequential process of commitment. In this study, we have used <italic>Wnt4</italic> lineage tracing to investigate the process of nephron commitment at higher resolution. Contrary to expectation, not all cells that enter the zone of nephron formation commit.</p><p>Based on timelapse imaging, computational modelling, and scRNA-seq, we propose a refined model of nephron progenitor commitment in which cell fate is dependent on the duration of exposure to spatially-restricted inductive cues, with this being influenced by random cell migration. This model predicts that <italic>Wnt4</italic> expressing cells in the lower cap are in a plastic state. Depending on the duration of exposure they may either commit to forming a nephron or re-enter the progenitor pool. Under this model, a population of swarming progenitors gives rise to a constant pool of committing cells. This reconciles the dynamic behaviour that we have previously reported in the developing kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Combes et al., 2016</xref>) with the established notion of spatially restricted inductive cues.</p><p>Our data support that <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression immediately precedes the formation of a committed aggregate. Though we observe considerable motility in <italic>Wnt4</italic>-lineage-labelled cells we cannot distinguish between motile cells at the tip-stalk junction that have initiated <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression but have yet to form an aggregate, and those that may have migrated out of a partially aggregated group of cells. Given that most cells within the PTA region go on to form nephrons we predict that the ability to undergo cap re-entry is quickly lost as cells aggregate. Thus, re-entry events may be restricted to cells that are excluded as an aggregate forms. This is consistent with our model, whereby the fate of progenitors in the tip-stalk junction depends on migration events that occur immediately prior to the switch to a non-motile state. The events that define the point at which cap re-entry is no longer possible are not well understood and may involve a gradual increase in adhesion, or a sharp switch from motile individual cells to an aggregated state.</p><p>The WNT9B-mediated induction of <italic>Wnt4</italic> has been regarded as essential for commitment of SIX2<sup>+</sup>nephron progenitor cells to nephron formation for more than a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kispert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stark et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>Wnt9b</italic> expression is seen within the ureteric tip and while both nephron progenitor turnover and induction is regarded as a WNT9B-mediated canonical Wnt signalling event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramalingam et al., 2018</xref>), the receptor complexes involved are not defined. Phosphorylated SMAD1/5-mediated BMP signalling has been identified as a factor required to transition nephron progenitor cells into a state where they are receptive to inductive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies would suggest a capacity for Notch activation to induce nephron commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2017</xref>), consistent with the commitment of all nephron progenitors after targeted activation of Notch signalling within the cap mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyle et al., 2011</xref>). A number of other observations also suggest that the spatially regulated positioning of nephron formation may involve more than one initiating signal. These include subtle differences in phenotype between <italic>Fgf8</italic> and <italic>Wnt4</italic> mutant kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perantoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stark et al., 1994</xref>) and evidence for stromal-derived signals regulating commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fetting et al., 2014</xref>). Our observation of cells which receive a trigger to initiate <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression but fail to commit may indicate a requirement for prolonged induction or a second, as yet undefined, consolidating trigger. The point at which this cascade of events passes a âpoint of no returnâ is unknown, though the physical constraint of epithelialisation likely prevents return to the progenitor population. These data predict that lineage tracing using a later marker of commitment (eg <italic>Jag1</italic>, <italic>Lhx1</italic>) would not give rise to cells that re-enter the nephron progenitor population.</p><p>Single cell transcriptional profiling revealed that <italic>Wnt4</italic> lineage cells that re-enter the cap mesenchyme become indistinguishable from the remaining progenitor pool. Although the absence of a unique transcriptional profile for the <italic>Wnt4</italic> labelled nephron progenitor âescapersâ may be due to a lack of transcriptional depth in the single cell approach, there was sufficient depth to place these cells within cap mesenchyme clusters. Previous heterochronic transplantation studies have suggested that there is a transcriptional signature related to cap mesenchyme âagingâ but that placing an âoldâ nephron progenitor back within a âyoungâ niche extended the time across which this cell would remain a nephron progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). We found no evidence for differential expression of markers associated with nephron progenitor aging in <italic>Wnt4</italic>-Cre-labelled vs unlabelled progenitors. However, our data are consistent with the proposed influence of surrounding cells on the transcriptional state of any individual nephron progenitor cell within the niche. In our âreturn to ground stateâ model, individual nephron progenitor cell fate depends on migration events that modulate exposure to niche cues, yet the nephron progenitor population as a whole reaches an equilibrium for a given set of values. Thus, in our paradigm, cells from an older population with a greater proportion of induced cells may adjust to match the equilibrium of a âyoungâ niche state given appropriate instructive cues.</p><p>Computational simulations of our stochastic model are consistent with eventual cessation of nephrogenesis. We propose that the duration of inductive signal required for commitment could remain steady, with a reduction in niche size shifting the equilibrium toward a more primed population as cells spend more time in zones of induction and less time in receipt of tip signals promoting progenitor maintenance. This mechanism may provide a means to couple cessation of nephron formation with organ growth, invoking only a relatively simple set of niche behaviours. Observations that cap mesenchyme cell cycle length, and hence proliferation rate, reduces with developmental time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Short et al., 2014</xref>) and that cap populations represent a more committed state with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) are consistent with this model of stochastic commitment in a shrinking niche. Indeed, we have also previously shown in mouse that around birth there is a simultaneous induction of nephrons all the way around the terminal ureteric tips with all remaining surrounding cells forming RVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rumballe et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides an alternate model to explain the balance between nephron progenitor maintenance and nephron commitment. This model is consistent with both the conventional anatomical positioning of nephron formation and our documented evidence of a motile cap mesenchyme population. It also implies a requirement for a prolonged or additional signal to nephron progenitors to ensure commitment to epithelialisation as well as predicting that stochastic commitment influenced by cell migration can explain cap mesenchyme exhaustion. This revised view of how nephron formation and cessation is controlled may have implications for understanding nephron deficit observed in response to both genetic and environmental cues.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Wnt4</italic><sup>GCE</sup>; <italic>Wnt4-</italic>GFP-CreER<sup>T2</sup></td><td>PMID: 18682239</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:032489">IMSR_JAX:032489</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato</italic></td><td>PMID: 20023653</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007909">IMSR_JAX:007909</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Hoxb7</italic>-GFP</td><td>PMID: 10322632</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:016251">IMSR_JAX:016251</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Wnt4-</italic>GFP-Cre</td><td>PMID: 19591821</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:032490">IMSR_JAX:032490</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Rosa26-LSL-YFP</td><td>PMID: 20023653</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007903">IMSR_JAX:007903</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Six2</italic><sup>GCE</sup>; <italic>Six2-</italic>GFP-CreER<sup>T2</sup></td><td>PMID: 18682239</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:009600">IMSR_JAX:009600</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Pdgfra</italic>CreER</td><td>PMID: 23335233</td><td>CDB0674K RIKEN Center <break/>for Life Science Technologies</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.clst.riken.jp/arg/mutant%20mice%20list.html">More information</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains and tissue collection</title><p>Mouse experiments were conducted with approval of the Murdoch Childrenâs Research Institute Animal Ethics Committee, or the Cincinnati Childrenâs Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) animal studies committee. <italic>Wnt4</italic> lineage tracing experiments were performed by mating <italic>Wnt4</italic><sup>GCE/+</sup> (<italic>Wnt4</italic>tm2(EGFP/cre/ERT2)Amc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi et al., 2008</xref>); Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato (Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>) males to C57BL/6 females.

Comparisons of the proportion of uninduced progenitors were based on the mean and standard deviation obtained from 10 simulations per condition. See Source Code File one for full implementation of the model. We developed a model to test the hypothesis that random migration with spatially defined commitment is sufficient to give rise to spatially restricted nephrogenesis. Cells are represented as single points in space that are positioned around a central âtip centreâ (0,0,0) in 3D space. As time progresses in âstepsâ cells either make movements, or commit, based on a set of parameters described below:</p><p><bold>Random migration</bold>:Â Each cells displacement has a random contribution that is dependent on a displacement value sampled from a distribution with mean 0, standard deviation equal to the <italic>random migration value</italic> and a random direction which is determined by the unit vector in the direction (x,y,z) where each component is sampled from the range â1, 1.</p><p><bold>TipÂ attraction</bold>:Â Each cell is attracted toward the tip centre with a magnitude defined by a <italic>tip attraction value</italic> x (<italic>tip_size</italic> ^ 2 / (<italic>distance to tip</italic>) ^ 2), for <italic>distance to tip</italic>Â &gt;=Â <italic>tip size.</italic></p><p><bold>Tip repulsion</bold>:Â At close range, where distance to tipÂ &lt;<italic>tip size</italic> cells are repelled from the tip with a magnitude of <italic>tip attraction</italic> value.</p><p><bold>Cell type</bold>:Â Cells are defined as either âcapâ, or âcommittedâ.</p><p><bold>Induction cutoff</bold>:Â Cells within the induction zone, defined as all yÂ &lt;Â induction cutoff, have state count increased by one per step.</p><p><bold>State threshold</bold>:Â Once cells reach the state threshold value they shift from âcapâ toâ committedâ type and cease moving.</p><p><bold>Cell division:Â </bold>A proportion, defined by mitotic index, of cells of type âcapâ are randomly selected and duplicated per step (unless stated, the mitotic index value is 0.01)</p><p><bold>Cap re-entry</bold>:Â Cells with some accumulated state count have this reduced by <italic>re-entry</italic> value for each step that they are outside the induction zone.</p><p><bold>Scaling</bold>:Â Both tip size and induction cutoff are multiplied by the <italic>niche scale factor</italic>, allowing the entire niche architecture to be scaled down in size.</p><p>Simulation values for the âprimedâ model were:Â <italic>Tip sizeÂ =Â 5, Induction cutoff = â2, Distance to tipÂ =Â Euclidian 3D distance from the position of each cell to the tip centre, Tip attraction valueÂ =Â 0.5, Random migration valueÂ =Â 0.5, State thresholdÂ =Â 30, Mitotic indexÂ =Â 0.01, re-entry valueÂ =Â 0, Time stepsÂ =Â 400, Niche scale factorÂ =Â 1.0.</italic> Simulation values for the âreturnâ to ground model: <italic>As above, except that re-entry valueÂ =Â 1.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Whole mount image analysis</title><p>Image quantification was performed using Fiji and R. Customs scripts employing the Laplacian of Gaussian based spot detector in the Trackmate library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>) of Fiji (with median filtering, sub pixel localisation and threshold of 3000) were used to detect the approximate position of each tdTomato<sup>+</sup> (radiusÂ =Â 5.0), or SIX2<sup>+</sup> (radiusÂ =Â 4.0) cell. This method resulted in robust detection of labelled cells, while excluding large labelled objects in the mature nephron. Signal intensity for each channel within the neighbourhood of each spot was outputted and imported into R for further analysis.</p><p>The proportion of tdTomato-labelled nephron progenitor cells was calculated by comparing tdTomato spot data with SIX2 spot data that had been filtered to remove cells with scaled value less than 0. Filtered datasets consisted thousands of spots per image (mean 15000 spots per image, minimum 6140). Nearest neighbour analysis in 3D space was used to identify the nearest neighbouring SIX2 spot for each tdTomato spot detection. tdTomato cells with a nearest neighbour SIX2 spot within 8 Âµm, and <italic>Wnt4</italic>-GFP signal less than 10000 were classed as being SIX2Â +cap cells. This definition captured cells with high SIX2 intensity as well as including cap cells deeper in the sample with reduced SIX2 intensity due to imaging depth, but located close to a SIX2 spot detection. The proportion of labelled progenitors was defined as the number of SIX2Â +labelled cap cells as a proportion of the number of filtered SIX2<sup>+</sup>Â spot detections. For each time point between 3 and 5 wholemount kidneys from different embryos were quantified, except E14.5 labelling/E15.5 collection where two kidneys from different embryos were quantified.</p><p>For constitutive <italic>Wnt4</italic>-Cre labelling experiments YFP labelling was not sufficiently sparse to obtain satisfactory spot-based analysis. Instead we used the spot detection approach described above to quantify the entire population of SIX2<sup>+</sup>Â nuclei. These data were filtered to remove bright spurious detections (log SIX2 signal greater than 10). To define parameters for classification we visually marked the position ofÂ ~100â200 YFP labelled cap cells per dataset using Mamut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wolff et al., 2018</xref>) and identified the same positions in automated spot count data based on nearest neighbour distance less than three microns. These manual reference points were used to calculate a nuclear (Draq5) cutoff value (minimum nuclear value in the manual dataset), SIX2 cutoff (minimum SIX2 value in the manual dataset) and YFP cutoff (Mean YFP value in the manual dataset, minus one standard deviation). Spots below the nuclear and SIX2 cutoff values were filtered, and remaining spots were classified as labelled vs unlabelled cap based on YFP cutoff value. For display SIX2 and GFP values were normalised to the 99<sup>th</sup> quantile value within each population. Analysis was performed on seven wholemount kidney datasets, from 7 embryos across two litters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Time lapse image analysis</title><p>Migration of <italic>Wnt4</italic><sup>GCE</sup> (nÂ =Â 6 datasets) or Six2<sup>GCE</sup> (nÂ =Â 4 datasets) labelled cells in time lapse images were analysed using Fiji with the Trackmate plugin.

Initially Mamut was used to manually track a landmark within the <italic>HoxB7</italic>-GFP ureteric epithelium, typically a tip, for each region of interest. Mamut was used to extract sub-volumes centered around the tracked <italic>HoxB7</italic>-GFP landmark, ensuring cell movement was viewed corrected for tip/sample movement and to provide a reference for concatenating time lapses where the microscope stage position had been adjusted. Sub-volumes were further analysed in Mamut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), or Imaris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) to manually track cell movement and generate visualisations. The final identity of tracked cells or regions was confirmed by examining IF staining of samples fixed immediately at the completion of live imaging.

Differentially expressed marker genes of each cluster were identified in Seurat (Wilcoxon rank sum test) and used to assign clustering identify based on GO analysis (ToppFunn) and known canonical markers of each compartment. Markers that define change from progenitor to committed state were identified as the 30 most significantly differentially expressed between progenitor clusters (cluster 0, 1) and committed nephron clusters (cluster 2, 3, 5). tdTomato expressing cells were defined as those expressing greater than 0.5 log normalised counts using standard normalisation in Seurat.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Prof Andrew McMahon for access to the <italic>Wnt4</italic><sup>GCE</sup> line and Dr Hiroshi Kataoka, Prof Richard Harvey, Dr Aude Dorison for access to the <italic>Pdgfra</italic>CreER line.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.

Please aim to submit the revised version within two months.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work proposes an intriguing model to describe maintenance of the nephron progenitor cell niche during kidney development. Specifically, a combination of genetic lineage mapping and 3D cell movement analysis allow the authors to conclude that cells reaching the renal vesicle can return back to the cap mesenchyme. Furthermore, the data also point to an intermediate state in differentiation in which cells can commit to epithelial differentiation over a much longer period than previously thought. The study extends previous work describing the migration of cells within cap mesenchyme and adds the essential dimension of genetic lineage marking. This work supports a highly dynamic model for nephron progenitor differentiation than was previously appreciated, and it will provoke some reevaluation of our interpretation of cell signaling in this niche.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see from the combined comments of the reviewers below, both agree that this is a valuable study, but have expressed concerns that the data in its current form does not definitively support the conclusion that <italic>Wnt4</italic> lineage-marked cells from an epithelial PTA to the cap contributes to the nephron progenitor pool (Figure 3 and Supplemental Videos 2 and 3) or that the cells from a single &quot;aggregate (i.e., PTA) can contribute to multiple nephrons (Figure 6 and Supplemental Video 5). This is explicitly pointed out in the points raised below. We would be pleased to consider a revised version of your manuscript that includes better movies (and corresponding figures) that show cells actually starting in a PTA and ending up in cap mesenchyme (or multiple nephrons).</p><p>In revising your manuscript can you also attend to the large number of points raised by the reviewers, many of which are minor.</p><p><italic>Major points Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) While the data in Figures 1 and 2 convincingly show that tdTomato+, <italic>Wnt4</italic> lineage-labeled cells, presumably labeled in the PTA, are later found in the SIX2+ cap mesenchyme (nephron progenitor population), the time lapse imaging in Figure 3 and Supplemental Videos 2 and 3 does not support this conclusion. In Video 2, none of the cells are marked and it is not clear which cells the reader is meant to follow. In Video 3, and the corresponding Figure 3C and D, several cells are tracked, but it does not seem to me that they start in a PTA, as the authors claim. They start near a UB tip, but what is the evidence that they are in a PTA? If these are the best examples they can find, it casts some doubt on the conclusion.</p><p>2) The difference in mean migration speed of Six2Cre-labeled cells and <italic>Wnt4</italic>-Cre-labeled cells may be statistically significant, but the difference of the mean speeds is so small (and the variance so large) that I doubt its biological significance. Also, the data are corrected &quot;for the movement of the adjacent GFP-marked epithelial tip&quot; â since the tip is a structure that is growing and changing shape, I'm not sure that this is a valid correction.</p><p>3) I find the model in Figure 4 to be very confusing (particularly for the general scientific audience of <italic>eLife</italic>). It adds little to the paper and the authors should consider greatly simplifying or removing it.</p><p>4) Figure 6 and Supplemental Video 5 are intended to show that <italic>Wnt4</italic>-lineage labeled &quot;cells from these initial aggregates contributed to several adjacent nephrons, counter to the established understanding that a single induction event gives rise to a single nephron&quot;. This would be a surprising result, but it is not supported by the data. When I examined the starting Tomato+ cells that are tracked in Figure 6B-F and Video 5, the tracks do not start out in a single aggregate but in a broad region surrounding one of the ureteric bud tips. The same is true of the experiment shown in Figure 6A â the starting cells at 0 hrs (shown in the inset) do not appear to be only in PTAs, but are widely dispersed around the ureteric tips. It is likely that some of these cells are NP cells in the cap mesenchyme at the start of the movie, and it is not surprising that they later contribute to multiple nephrons. The authors write &quot;Groups of <italic>Wnt4</italic> lineage cells that were immediate neighbours at the onset of imaging ultimately contributed to multiple adjacent nephrons&quot;. However, the cells shown in the figures were not &quot;immediate neighbours&quot; but were widely dispersed around one or more tips.</p><p><italic>Major Points: Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>1) Overall, the description of the localization of <italic>Wnt4</italic>-GFP-creERT localization is insufficient. For example, ISH shows strong expression of <italic>Wnt4</italic> in stroma and the authors comment on discrepancies with <italic>Wnt4-</italic>Cre in the text. Without having a better understanding of whether or not expression is limited to the PTA/RV, it is not possible to be definitive about where the labeled cells that enter the cap are coming from. In the RNA-Seq section, the authors mention that they see cells co-expressing <italic>Cited1</italic> and <italic>Wnt4</italic> and interpret this as cells that are in transition between states. This is an assumption that rests on the immunostaining data, and highlights a potential confounder in the experiment: Could the tdTomato labeling in the cap mesenchyme be partly or entirely due to transitory <italic>Wnt4</italic>-cre expression in cap mesenchyme cells that is insufficient to cause them to fluoresce? In the quantitative analysis there are quite a number of Tomato+ SIX2+ cells only 24 hours after tamoxifen pulse (Figure 2A). This point needs to be addressed and it really needs to be discussed at the very beginning of the manuscript because it is foundational for the whole interpretation.</p><p>2) The E10.5 pulse chase data are difficult to understand because it appears incomplete. In which cells is <italic>Wnt4</italic>-cre expressed at E10.5? Marker co-staining would be required to define the cell types(s) in which expression is seen. 2H-J: it is not possible from the data presented to conclude that labeling is seen in PTA and RV; the red cells do not look epithelial and they mostly appear to localize outside the GFP+ clusters in 2I. Related to this, the inclusion of a tamoxifen-treatment at E10.5 for the RNA-seq experiment is problematic in my opinion because we do not know the identity of cells labeled at this stage. Could the authors explain the motivation behind labeling at a stage when there is no PTA/RV for a study of the characteristics of cells that recirculate from the PTA/RV?</p><p>3) The <italic>Wnt4</italic>-cre data gives an idea of the magnitude of recirculation of RV/PTA cells back to the cap mesenchyme. But it is hard to interpret because the staining cannot distinguish between active <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression (GFP) and historical <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression (YFP). Could the authors please show the staining in <italic>Wnt4-</italic>Cre kidneys without the YFP reporter?</p><p>4) Regarding the time-lapse data, the authors mention in the text that the GFP signal from the <italic>Wnt4</italic>-cre is too weak to detect, and the GFP seen in the pictures is only from the <italic>Hoxb7</italic>-GFP. It is therefore very difficult to orient the 3D pictures, especially the movies which are very helpful to understand cell migration. Could the authors provide some landmarks for orientation?</p><p>5) During the past few years many investigators have shown strong effects of tamoxifen on various aspects of cell biology and it is not out of the question that it could be influencing migratory behavior in the cap mesenchyme. It would be valuable to control for this by comparing the effect of tamoxifen treatment versus vehicle (especially the repeated doses used in some experiments) on recirculation of <italic>Wnt4-</italic>Cre-labeled cells back into cap mesenchyme.</p><p>6) The language used to describe magnitudes is very vague in places, so it is difficult for the reader to interpret the importance of the findings. For example &quot;several&quot; Tomato+ cells express <italic>Six2</italic> but not <italic>Wnt4</italic>. This is not very helpful and a percentage would be appropriate here.</p><p>7) For the E11.5 explant labeling in Figure 6, it is quite difficult from the text to understand exactly what the authors have done. Also, the referenced Supplemental Video 6 is missing. There is no marker for cap mesenchyme and the explant morphology is not similar to in vivo kidney, so the statement that Tomato+ cells contribute to cap mesenchyme is not supported. The central data here is the assignment of cells to a particular PTA/RV and then the tracing of those cells back out to multiple RVs, but those data are not presented so it is not possible to evaluate this experiment.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Nephron progenitor commitment is a stochastic process influenced by cell migration&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The issue concerns the definition of a PTA, and whether cells actually leave a PTA to migrate and revert to the NP state. The traditional view of a PTA is a cluster of cells in the process of aggregating to form an RV â not yet epithelial, but more closely aggregated than NP cells and committed to forming the RV. In your manuscript you clearly suggest that some cells leave the PTA. The reviewers propose an alternative model that you might like to consider. They note that most of the <italic>Wnt4</italic>+ cells under the UB tip aggregate to form the PTA, and this is an irreversible step, but a few closely neighboring <italic>Wnt4</italic>+ cells don't incorporate into the aggregate allowing them to migrate away and revert to the NP state. The <italic>Wnt4</italic>-GFP positive cells in Figure 1G-K seem to be mostly aggregated, but there seem to be a few <italic>Wnt4</italic>+ cells around the periphery of the PTA that may not be part of the aggregate. Accordingly the data don't support the interpretation that cells clearly in an aggregate are the ones that revert to NP. While we note this is a subtle point, it is important for the definition of a pretubular aggregate.

We would be pleased to consider a revised version of your manuscript that includes better movies (and corresponding figures) that show cells actually starting in a PTA and ending up in cap mesenchyme (or multiple nephrons).</p><p>In revising your manuscript can you also attend to the large number of points raised by the reviewers, many of which are minor.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments. We would start, however, by noting that the pretubular aggregate is not an epithelial structure and that this assumption significantly impacts on the interpretation of our data and proposed model. To make this point and to respond to these major concerns, we have generated new data and cite additional sources to clarify that a pretubular aggregate (PTA) is a cluster of cells, located at the tip-stalk junction of the ureteric epithelium that express key markers including <italic>Wnt4</italic>, and lack definitive epithelial properties such as polarised distribution of aPKC (Figure 1). We hope that this clearly makes the point that we are not claiming that cells can escape from an epithelial structure such as a renal vesicle. We have also added more data to show that labelling of <italic>Wnt4</italic>-expressing cells only occurs in the PTA and not in the cap mesenchyme but that escaping cells can repopulate the cap mesenchyme niche over time (Figures 1 and 2). New, higher resolution, live and fixed data has been generated to support the movement of cells from the region where <italic>Wnt4</italic> is expressed and nephrons form, back into the nephron progenitor pool (Figure 3). We have also clarified the eventual contribution of primed cells to multiple nephrons in the early developing kidney (Figure 6) as detailed below. Principally, these data demonstrate that nephron progenitor commitment is not unidirectional and unveils a greater plasticity in this dynamic population than was previously appreciated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points Reviewer 1:</p><p>1) While the data in Figures 1 and 2 convincingly show that tdTomato+, Wnt4 lineage-labeled cells, presumably labeled in the PTA, are later found in the SIX2+ cap mesenchyme (nephron progenitor population), the time lapse imaging in Figure 3 and Supplemental Videos 2 and 3 does not support this conclusion. In Video 2, none of the cells are marked and it is not clear which cells the reader is meant to follow. In Video 3, and the corresponding Figure 3C and D, several cells are tracked, but it does not seem to me that they start in a PTA, as the authors claim. They start near a UB tip, but what is the evidence that they are in a PTA? If these are the best examples they can find, it casts some doubt on the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We present a substantially revised dataset including new videos, more support and more careful description of where cells start and end.</p><p>We interpret a PTA as a group of cells located at the tip-stalk junction, that express <italic>Wnt4</italic> and other key markers. We draw on detailed studies of early nephron epithelialisation, classic and recent papers describing PTAs to support this interpretation. As such, a cell that is located under the tip and expresses <italic>Wnt4</italic> is arguably in a PTA, or a further stage of commitment towards an epithelial nephron.</p><p>As acknowledged, we have presented fixed imaging in Figures 1-3 and supplements to support that nephron lineage <italic>Wnt4</italic>-expressing cells are labelled in the PTA/tip-stalk junction, not in the nephron progenitor population, and that these cells appear in the cap mesenchyme over time. These in vivo lineage tracing data are then supported by our live imaging, which observes part of that journey in real time.</p><p>We present a revised Figure 3 and accompanying text that illustrates analogous initial labelling of early committing nephron structures in vivo (Figure 3C-E) and in our culture system (Figure 3F). In live imaging of similar samples over 24 hours we show <italic>Wnt4</italic>-lineage cells moving from the region under the tip to the top or end of a tip (Figure 3G, J). Fixed analysis of these samples after live imaging shows that the tdTomato-labelled cells have migrated back into the cap mesenchyme and are surrounded by unlabelled SIX2-expressing cells (Figure 3H, K). The region under the tip that these cells migrated from contains a population of cells that have more prominent basolateral localisation of NCAM and lower levels of SIX2, suggesting those cells are undergoing the early stages of epithelialisation to form a nephron, similar to what we would expect in a PTA progressing to a primitive renal vesicle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The difference in mean migration speed of Six2Cre-labeled cells and Wnt4-Cre-labeled cells may be statistically significant, but the difference of the mean speeds is so small (and the variance so large) that I doubt its biological significance. Also, the data are corrected &quot;for the movement of the adjacent GFP-marked epithelial tip&quot; â since the tip is a structure that is growing and changing shape, I'm not sure that this is a valid correction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the difference is small and have revised the corresponding text to reflect this. These figure panels now form a figure supplement for Figure 3.</p><p>Regarding the second point, assessing cell movement relative to the ureteric tip is necessary to distinguish between displacement caused by cell migration and that caused by bulk tissue movement. This is a common practice in tracking cell movement in developing tissues and has been published previously for the developing kidney (Combes et al., 2016). For example, consider the movement of a nephron progenitor cell that is attached to the ureteric tip through cell-cell adhesion. When the ureteric tip grows and branches the nephron progenitor cell will be moving simply because it is attached to the tip epithelium. This gives the impression of cell movement when, relative to the tip, the nephron progenitor cell has not moved at all.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I find the model in Figure 4 to be very confusing (particularly for the general scientific audience of eLife). It adds little to the paper and the authors should consider greatly simplifying or removing it.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the text describing this model and the conclusions arising from it. We believe this is a valuable addition to the manuscript and that modelling complements and extends experimental studies. <italic>eLife</italic> frequently publishes articles that integrate computational biology and development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 6 and Supplemental Video 5 are intended to show that Wnt4-lineage labeled &quot;cells from these initial aggregates contributed to several adjacent nephrons, counter to the established understanding that a single induction event gives rise to a single nephron&quot;. This would be a surprising result, but it is not supported by the data. When I examined the starting Tomato+ cells that are tracked in Figure 6B-F and Video 5, the tracks do not start out in a single aggregate but in a broad region surrounding one of the ureteric bud tips. The same is true of the experiment shown in Figure 6A â the starting cells at 0 hrs (shown in the inset) do not appear to be only in PTAs, but are widely dispersed around the ureteric tips. It is likely that some of these cells are NP cells in the cap mesenchyme at the start of the movie, and it is not surprising that they later contribute to multiple nephrons. The authors write &quot;Groups of Wnt4 lineage cells that were immediate neighbours at the onset of imaging ultimately contributed to multiple adjacent nephrons&quot;. However, the cells shown in the figures were not &quot;immediate neighbours&quot; but were widely dispersed around one or more tips.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the presentation of these data to focus on a group of six cells that are initially 1-3 cell diameters apart and located under the ureteric tip in a field of <italic>Wnt4</italic>-labelled cells. The spacing between these cells could reflect partial labelling of a broader domain of <italic>Wnt4</italic>-expressing cells; we rarely see expected domains of <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression being completely labelled. We provide unambiguous tracking of these six cells with the context of a rendered tip surface to show that they remain under the tip, near the region that an early nephron would form. Instead of forming a renal vesicle in place, these six <italic>Wnt4</italic>-lineage cells end up contributing to three distinct nephrons. As such, these data do support that a single induction event can lead to a partially committed population that can seed multiple nephrons. As stated by the reviewer this is a surprising result as we would expect all labelled cells to immediately progress to form a nephron. Any new nephrons would presumably arise from new commitment events that would occur after the tamoxifen has washed out, and therefore should not be labelled. However, we now qualify these results, acknowledging that they arise from E11.5 kidneys, which have large domains of <italic>Wn4</italic> expression and large tips. The dynamics of nephron induction and commitment may be different at later stages of development, which will be tested in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Points: Reviewer 2:</p><p>1) Overall, the description of the localization of Wnt4-GFP-creERT localization is insufficient. For example, ISH shows strong expression of Wnt4 in stroma and the authors comment on discrepancies with Wnt4-Cre in the text. Without having a better understanding of whether or not expression is limited to the PTA/RV, it is not possible to be definitive about where the labeled cells that enter the cap are coming from. In the RNA-Seq section, the authors mention that they see cells co-expressing Cited1 and Wnt4 and interpret this as cells that are in transition between states. This is an assumption that rests on the immunostaining data, and highlights a potential confounder in the experiment: Could the tdTomato labeling in the cap mesenchyme be partly or entirely due to transitory Wnt4-cre expression in cap mesenchyme cells that is insufficient to cause them to fluoresce? In the quantitative analysis there are quite a number of Tomato+ SIX2+ cells only 24 hours after tamoxifen pulse (Figure 2A). This point needs to be addressed and it really needs to be discussed at the very beginning of the manuscript because it is foundational for the whole interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>The localisation of the <italic>Wnt4</italic>GFPCreERT2 is consistent with the established sites of expression of <italic>Wnt4</italic> â i.e. highest in the early committing nephron (PTA/RV), and expressed at lower levels in some stromal cells, particularly in the medulla (Georgas et al., 2009). We have added new data to Figure1âfigure supplement 1 to illustrate the sites of expression in the inducible <italic>Wnt4</italic><sup>GCE</sup> line. The cell labelling driven by this Cre preferences labelling in pretubular aggregates and renal vesicles, and only labels stromal cells with higher doses of tamoxifen. To address whether stromal <italic>Wnt4</italic>-lineage cells contribute to the nephron progenitor population we performed lineage tracing with an inducible <italic>Pdgfra</italic> cre. <italic>Pdgfra</italic> is expressed in all stromal cells in the developing kidney, including those that express <italic>Wnt4</italic> (DiRocco et al., 2013). Lineage tracing with this inducible Cre results in extensive stromal labelling but does not result in labelled cells within the cap mesenchyme. As such, we are sure that these <italic>Wnt4</italic>-labelled cells arise in the PTA, not from the stroma. We now include this additional lineage tracing data in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>With regard to the possibility of a transient pulse of <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression in nephron progenitor cells- we considered this and carefully looked for such events. We comprehensively analysed the location of tdTomato labelled cells 24 hours after addition of tamoxifen at E12.5 or E14.5. As reported, labelled cells were always observed within clusters of <italic>Wnt4</italic>-GFP expressing cells at the tip-stalk junction. No labelled nephron progenitor cells were observed in the upper region of the cap at 24 hours after induction suggesting that these cells are not being labelled directly. We have example images to support this conclusion in Figures 1, 2, 3 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>The data in revised Figure 2C shows that ~1% of the tdTomato labelled cells express low levels of SIX2. This is generated from quantitative analysis of wholemount immunofluorescence data. When we visualise these SIX2<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the 3D data, they are located in in the early committing nephron. This is consistent with the immunofluorescence we show in Figure 1G and Figure 2B, where labelled SIX2<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>+</sup> cells can be seen at the tip-stalk junction in early committing nephron structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The E10.5 pulse chase data are difficult to understand because it appears incomplete. In which cells is Wnt4-cre expressed at E10.5? Marker co-staining would be required to define the cell types(s) in which expression is seen. 2H-J: it is not possible from the data presented to conclude that labeling is seen in PTA and RV; the red cells do not look epithelial and they mostly appear to localize outside the GFP+ clusters in 2I. Related to this, the inclusion of a tamoxifen-treatment at E10.5 for the RNA-seq experiment is problematic in my opinion because we do not know the identity of cells labeled at this stage. Could the authors explain the motivation behind labeling at a stage when there is no PTA/RV for a study of the characteristics of cells that recirculate from the PTA/RV?</p></disp-quote><p>In our revision we have removed focus from the E10.5 labelling as it is not central to the main messages of the paper. These data are now presented as a figure supplement.</p><p>To address the questions: SIX2+ cells are specified in the intermediate mesoderm around E8.5 (Taguchi et al., Cell Stem Cell 2014) and there is no published data to suggest the contribution of additional cell types to the <italic>Six2</italic> lineage after this stage, although this remains a possibility. Lineage tracing from an inducible <italic>Six2</italic>Cre suggests the nephron progenitor population self-renews from E10.5 onwards with no additional input from any other cell population (Kobayashi et al.,2008). Within this context, our results suggest <italic>Wnt4</italic> is expressed in nephron progenitor cells within the metanephric mesenchyme at E10.5 because cells labelled from induction at that time co-express nephron progenitor marker SIX2 and <italic>Wnt4</italic>-GFP at E11.5 (Figure 2âfigure supplement 3).</p><p>Regarding the localisation of cells in the previous version of Figure 2H-J; we agree that several labelled cells are not contained within RV or PTA structures in this image, however many cells are contained within clusters of cells expressing <italic>Wnt4</italic>-GFP under the ureteric tip that resemble PTA and epithelializing structures.</p><p>Including E10.5 labelling in the scRNA-Seq experiment aimed to maximize the number of cells labelled for analysis. As explained above, the E10.5 induction primarily labelled <italic>Wnt4</italic>-GFP+ SIX2+ cells at E11.5, allowing us to interrogate the early stages of nephron formation. This study has focussed on how nephron progenitor cells commit to form a nephron. We show that not all cells that are induced to express <italic>Wnt4</italic> undergo epithelialisation or integrate into a nephron. This early stage is part of an experiment to determine whether cells that have previously expressed <italic>Wnt4</italic> have any lasting transcriptional changes associated with that event. We delivered tamoxifen at 10.5, 11.5, 12.5 and 13.5 to label cells across this developmental range. The cells arising from the 10.5 labelling make up a fraction of the final population that was analysed but still serve to support the conclusion that nephron progenitor cells can return to an uncommitted state after being induced to express <italic>Wnt4</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Wnt4-cre data gives an idea of the magnitude of recirculation of RV/PTA cells back to the cap mesenchyme. But it is hard to interpret because the staining cannot distinguish between active Wnt4 expression (GFP) and historical Wnt4 expression (YFP). Could the authors please show the staining in Wnt4-Cre kidneys without the YFP reporter?</p></disp-quote><p>The expected expression pattern in all mouse lines is illustrated by in situhybridisation results shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 and prior publications (Georgas et al., 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Regarding the time-lapse data, the authors mention in the text that the GFP signal from the Wnt4-cre is too weak to detect, and the GFP seen in the pictures is only from the Hoxb7-GFP. It is therefore very difficult to orient the 3D pictures, especially the movies which are very helpful to understand cell migration. Could the authors provide some landmarks for orientation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional images, labels and descriptions to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) During the past few years many investigators have shown strong effects of tamoxifen on various aspects of cell biology and it is not out of the question that it could be influencing migratory behavior in the cap mesenchyme. It would be valuable to control for this by comparing the effect of tamoxifen treatment versus vehicle (especially the repeated doses used in some experiments) on recirculation of Wnt4-Cre-labeled cells back into cap mesenchyme.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unable to control for the effect of tamoxifen in our experiments with the inducible Cre as we rely on this compound to induce labelling of the cells to monitor. However, we observe cells reintegrating into the nephron progenitor domain using a constitutive <italic>Wnt4</italic>-Cre (Figure 2), which does not rely on tamoxifen. The number of cells that reintegrate into the niche in the constitutive <italic>Wnt4</italic>-Cre is higher than that of the tamoxifen labelled samples, presumably because it is continuously active.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The language used to describe magnitudes is very vague in places, so it is difficult for the reader to interpret the importance of the findings. For example &quot;several&quot; Tomato+ cells express Six2 but not Wnt4. This is not very helpful and a percentage would be appropriate here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a quantitative measure as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For the E11.5 explant labeling in Figure 6, it is quite difficult from the text to understand exactly what the authors have done. Also, the referenced Supplemental Video 6 is missing. There is no marker for cap mesenchyme and the explant morphology is not similar to in vivo kidney, so the statement that Tomato+ cells contribute to cap mesenchyme is not supported. The central data here is the assignment of cells to a particular PTA/RV and then the tracing of those cells back out to multiple RVs, but those data are not presented so it is not possible to evaluate this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>As per response 4, we have revised the presentation of these data in Figure 6.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The issue concerns the definition of a PTA, and whether cells actually leave a PTA to migrate and revert to the NP state. The traditional view of a PTA is a cluster of cells in the process of aggregating to form an RV â not yet epithelial, but more closely aggregated than NP cells and committed to forming the RV. In your manuscript you clearly suggest that some cells leave the PTA. The reviewers propose an alternative model that you might like to consider. They note that most of the Wnt4+ cells under the UB tip aggregate to form the PTA, and this is an irreversible step, but a few closely neighboring Wnt4+ cells don't incorporate into the aggregate allowing them to migrate away and revert to the NP state. The Wnt4-GFP positive cells in Figure 1G-K seem to be mostly aggregated, but there seem to be a few Wnt4+ cells around the periphery of the PTA that may not be part of the aggregate. Accordingly the data don't support the interpretation that cells clearly in an aggregate are the ones that revert to NP. While we note this is a subtle point, it is important for the definition of a pretubular aggregate. Hopefully you can tweak the final version of the text accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the feedback and opportunity to revise our work. We have included an additional paragraph in the Discussion incorporating the possibility that cells which return to the cap have been excluded from forming an aggregate. Our team had discussed this possibility previously but did not include it in the manuscript. The new paragraph is copied below.</p><p>&quot;Our data support that Wnt4 expression immediately precedes the formation of a committed aggregate. [â¦] The events that define the point at which cap re-entry is no longer possible are not well understood and may involve a gradual increase in adhesion, or a sharp switch from motile individual cells to an aggregated state.&quot;</p><p>We have carefully checked the rest of the paper and believe that there are no statements that explicitly say that cells from the PTA return to the NP population. As such we believe that the additional paragraph should satisfy the reviewerâs feedback.</p></body></sub-article></article>
