six-subunit assembly that promotes replisome formation on chromosomal origins. Despite extant homology between certain subunits, the degree of structural and organizational overlap between budding yeast and metazoan ORC has been unclear. Using 3D electron microscopy, we determined the subunit organization of metazoan ORC, revealing that it adopts a global architecture very similar to the budding yeast complex. Bioinformatic analysis extends this conservation to Orc6, a subunit of somewhat enigmatic function. Unexpectedly, a mutation in the Orc6 C-terminus linked to Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a dwarfism disorder, impedes proper recruitment of Orc6 into ORC; biochemical studies reveal that this region of Orc6 associates with a previously uncharacterized domain of Orc3 and is required for ORC function and MCM2–7 loading in vivo. Together, our results suggest that Meier-Gorlin syndrome mutations in Orc6 impair the formation of ORC hexamers, interfering with appropriate ORC functions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00882.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00882.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00882.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cell division is essential for organisms to be able to grow, to repair tissues and to proliferate. However, cells can only divide once they have successfully replicated their DNA. Many different molecules are involved in these two processes, including a large multi-protein assembly called the origin recognition complex that helps to start the process of DNA replication.</p><p>This complex contains six proteins but relatively little is known about its structure. It is also unclear how much origin recognition complexes (ORCs) differ between species. Now, Bleichert et al. have found a way to stabilize a specific conformation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORC, and have gone on to determine its structure at a higher resolution than was previously possible.</p><p>This approach revealed that the arrangement of protein subunits in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORC is similar to that found in yeast ORC. Most of the ORC subunits have similar amino acid sequences in both species. However, the Orc6 subunit was regarded a notable exception for a long time, with the yeast and Drosophila versions of this subunit having different sequences of amino acids. Bleichert et al. show that the Orc6 subunits actually have important similarities, both in sequence and in function. In particular, the C-terminus of the Orc6 protein contains similar amino acids in both yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Moreover, it performs the same role—binding to another subunit—in both yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>As well as being important for cell division, human ORC has been implicated in Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a type of dwarfism. Mutations in three of the six ORC subunits, including Orc6, have been found in people with Meier-Gorlin syndrome. The mutations in Orc6 that are associated with this syndrome are in the C-terminus, which suggests that some symptoms of the syndrome may be caused by DNA replication not being initiated correctly. Consistent with this idea, Bleichert et al. show that the introduction of the Meier-Gorlin syndrome mutation into Orc6 prevents this subunit from binding to the rest of ORC, and similar mutations do not support DNA replication in in vivo experiments. These results should increase our understanding of the function of Orc6 and its role in Meier-Gorlin syndrome, and also provide new insights into the changes in ORC architecture that have occurred during evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00882.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00882.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ORC</kwd><kwd>Meier-Gorlin syndrome</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>origin recognition complex</kwd><kwd>origin licensing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM071747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bleichert</surname><given-names>Franziska</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 30490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Botchan</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM097052</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chesnokov</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electron microscopy uncovers the structure of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in metazoans, and reveals how mutations in the ORC6 subunit lead to Meier-Gorlin syndrome in humans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The faithful inheritance of genetic information depends on the precise replication of DNA; errors such as under- or over-replication of DNA can lead to genetic instabilities, malignant transformation, or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klingseisen and Jackson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2013</xref>).

How individual ORC subunits co-assemble with each other and the nature of the structural transitions that occur within ORC and other pre-RC components during nucleotide-dependent initiation steps are ill-defined, in part due to a paucity of structures for key ORC reaction states. Electron microscopy (EM) studies have provided medium-to-low resolution pictures of the general architecture of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORC, and subunit positions within ORC further have been systematically mapped for the yeast complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Speck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2013</xref>); however, poor similarity between the 3D reconstructions obtained for the different species, combined with conflicting biochemical data on ORC subunit interactions, have led to different models of subunit arrangement and DNA engagement for the two eukaryotic initiators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vashee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kneissl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsuda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Siddiqui and Stillman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li and Stillman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Whether these differences reflect true differences in structure, or potentially distinct functional states, remains unclear.</p><p>Recently, mutations in genes encoding the pre-RC components Orc1, Orc4, Orc6, Cdc6, and Cdt1 have been linked to Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by primordial dwarfism, small ears and aplastic or hypoplastic patella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guernsey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bicknell et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">b</xref>). Based on the fact that MGS mutations cluster in pre-RC components, it has been suggested that the clinical phenotype is caused by defects in DNA replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guernsey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bicknell et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">b</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, cells derived from MGS patients with mutations in Orc1 show reduced recruitment of ORC subunits and replicative helicase components to chromatin, and are compromised in their ability to replicate plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bicknell et al., 2011b</xref>); recent work has also shown a link between origin licensing factors and non-replicative cellular processes, such as centrosome duplication and cilia formation, in MGS patient cells and in cells depleted of licensing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hossain and Stillman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stiff et al., 2013</xref>). Most MGS mutations in Orc1 lie in the N-terminal domain, which is not part of the central core of ORC, and have been implicated interfering with Orc1’s Cyclin E-CDK2 inhibitory function of centrosome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hossain and Stillman, 2012</xref>). By contrast, the means by which certain mutations in Orc4 and Orc6 result in an MGS phenotype has yet to be determined. Orc6 is particularly enigmatic in this regard: unlike Orc1–Orc5, Orc6 is poorly conserved between budding yeast and metazoans, both in sequence and in aspects of its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee and Bell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chesnokov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prasanth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chesnokov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Semple et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duncker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernal and Venkitaraman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Bell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takara and Bell, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here we investigate the structural organization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORC (<italic>Dm</italic>ORC) and how Orc6 is recruited into this complex in metazoans. Using EM we find that apo-<italic>Dm</italic>ORC is conformationally heterogeneous, but that the non-hydrolysable nucleotide analog ATPγS locks the complex in a specific conformation that permitted the determination of its 3D structure to 22 Å resolution. Experimental localization of all subunits reveals that the subunit architecture of <italic>Dm</italic>ORC is preserved compared to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ORC (<italic>Sc</italic>ORC), reconciling different models proposed previously for the two systems. Interestingly, sequence analyses show that this similarity extends to the domain structure of Orc6, suggesting analogous functions for Orc6 from yeast and metazoans. Consistent with this notion, we find that recruitment of Orc6 into ORC across multiple species is aided by the interaction of its C-terminus with a novel domain that resides between the AAA<sup>+</sup>-like and winged-helix domains of Orc3. Strikingly, a mutation found in patients with Meier-Gorlin syndrome maps to a highly-conserved C-terminal segment in Orc6, destabilizing the interaction of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human Orc6 with both Orc3 alone and with the core Orc1–5 subcomplex. Orc6 transgenes containing mutations in the conserved C-terminal tail fail to incorporate into <italic>Dm</italic>ORC in vivo, and do not complement an <italic>orc6</italic>-null allele when introduced into flies. Taken together, these results suggest that the MGS mutation in Orc6 directly affects the integrity of ORC, and indicate that destabilization of ORC contributes to the pathogenesis of Meier-Gorlin syndrome caused by mutations in Orc6, ultimately interfering with pre-RC assembly and origin licensing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Improved resolution EM structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORC</title><p>EM reconstructions of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ORC and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORC have been determined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Speck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2013</xref>), and have allowed individual subunits to be localized in budding yeast ORC. Unfortunately, the modest resolution of these structures, together with the poor resemblance between the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ORC models, have made it difficult to extrapolate the yeast subunit order into metazoan ORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Speck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarey et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2012</xref>).

In addition, the Orc6 C-terminal region co-purified with ORC1–5 during several chromatography steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, lane 5), and when examined by EM, an MBP-fusion of the C-terminal domain of Orc6 localized to the same region as full-length Orc6 in 2D class averages of ORC, indicating that Orc6 did not dissociate from ORC at concentrations used for EM (30 nM ORC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Orc6 is recruited into ORC via interaction of its C-terminal domain with Orc3, and not through its TFIIB-like domains.</p><p>We next asked which region of Orc3 interacts with Orc6. In comparing Orc3 protein sequences from various eukaryotes with archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 proteins, we noticed that Orc3 contains an additional domain inserted between its AAA<sup>+</sup>-like and winged-helix domains that is not found in archaeal homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This insertion is conserved across eukaryotic Orc3 orthologs, varies in length from 70 amino acids in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to 190 amino acids in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and is not found in Orc1, Orc2, Orc4, or Orc5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since this extra domain is specific to Orc3, we hypothesized that it might interact with Orc6, specifically with the Orc6 C-terminus. To test this premise, we co-expressed the Orc3 insertion as an MBP fusion protein with full-length or truncated Orc6 and performed pull-down experiments. The Orc3 insertion was able to interact with both full-length Orc6 and all N-terminal Orc6 truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Conversely, truncating the C-terminus of Orc6 abolished the interaction with the Orc3 insertion. These results mirror our observations with both full-length Orc3 and with ORC1–5, and further demonstrate that the C-terminus of Orc6 helps to tether Orc6 to ORC. Moreover, whereas full-length Orc3 was able to interact with Orc2 in addition to Orc6, the Orc3 insertion was unable to do so, suggesting the Orc2–Orc3 interaction is mediated through the two subunits’ AAA<sup>+</sup>-like and/or winged-helix domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00882.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A conserved domain inserted between the AAA<sup>+</sup>-like domain and the winged helix (WH) domain of Orc3 binds the C-terminal domain of Orc6 and recruits Orc6 into ORC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic domain organization of Orc3.

Intriguingly, the MGS mutation in human Orc6 is a missense alteration that maps to the protein’s C-terminal domain, changing a tyrosine at position 232 to serine.

We next tested whether a mutation of the conserved MGS tyrosine to serine (Y418S) could support the binding of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6 to Orc3 (the MGS tyrosine in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6 highlighted by our alignment differs from that proposed previously [Tyr277], due to a misalignment of the region in the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bicknell et al., 2011a</xref>]). Strikingly, the MGS-like mutation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6 abolished the interaction with Orc3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). However, in contrast to what we observed with <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human proteins, the MGS-like mutation was not sufficient to prevent Orc6 binding to the Orc2–Orc3 subcomplex or to ORC1–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D</xref>). Because Orc6 has been previously reported to interact with Orc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2012</xref>), our result suggests that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6 is cooperatively recruited into ORC through interaction with both Orc2 and Orc3. In agreement with this interpretation, Orc6 was still recruited into ORC lacking the Orc2 subunit, albeit at reduced levels, whereas Orc6 recruitment was completely lost in the absence of Orc3 (omission of Orc3 further led to concomitant loss of Orc2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Thus, unlike in metazoans, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ORC appears to possess two Orc6 binding sites, one in Orc2 and one in Orc3. Although the interaction with Orc3 is mediated by the C-terminal domain of Orc6, it is not clear which domain is responsible for binding to Orc2. However, since the Orc2–Orc6 interaction appears unique to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig8 fig9">Figures 3B, 8 and 9</xref>), we propose this contact may be mediated by a yeast-specific domain inserted between the two TFIIB-like domains of Orc6, which may in turn bind to the non-conserved N-terminal domain of yeast Orc2 that has been implicated previously in Orc6 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with our interpretation, an MGS-like mutation in yeast Orc6 supports yeast growth, whereas premature stop codons that result in C-terminally truncated Orc6 proteins do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, our results reconcile previously conflicting data regarding Orc6 recruitment into ORC and highlight the importance of the conserved C-terminal segment of Orc6 in the formation of the hexameric ORC assembly through Orc6 binding to Orc3. This interaction appears functionally relevant, as Orc6 C-terminal amino acid residues are required for yeast viablility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Bell, 2011</xref>), and yeast Cdt1 fused to the C-terminal domain of Orc6 alone is able to load MCM2–7 to replication origins in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00882.020</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The C-terminal domain in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6 interacts with Orc3 and an MGS-like mutation abrogates this interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6 binds Orc3.

Characteristics observed in the current structure, but not in previous ones, include a more featured AAA<sup>+</sup>-ring and likely subunit borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, this new EM structure of ATPγS-bound <italic>Dm</italic>ORC is more similar to budding yeast ORC EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Speck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2013</xref>), although the fly complex displays more surface features and is thicker when viewed from the lateral edge of the AAA<sup>+</sup> core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).

Our pull-down data suggest that the more stable conformation seen for budding yeast Orc6 may be due to the existence of binding sites for the subunit on both Orc2 and Orc3 within ORC1–5, as opposed to just Orc3 in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A replicative function for the conserved C-terminal helix in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Orc6</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Orc6 is an essential protein, with reduced Orc6 levels resulting in reduced DNA replication in both cell culture and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chesnokov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balasov et al., 2009</xref>). Replicative functions have been attributed to the N-terminal TFIIB-like region of Orc6, whereas the C-terminal domain is required for cytokinesis and interacts with the septin Pnut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chesnokov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasov et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huijbregts et al., 2009</xref>). Our results here show that the C-terminus of Orc6 is also critical for DNA replication. Orc6 is a stable component of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORC, and ORC lacking Orc6 cannot support DNA replication in vitro in ORC-depleted <italic>Drosophila</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chesnokov et al., 2001</xref>). Since the C-terminus of Orc6 mediates the association of Orc6 with ORC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 4–7</xref>), we predict that truncations or mutations abrogating this interaction should impair DNA replication. Indeed, the expression of C-terminally truncated or mutated Orc6 transgenes in <italic>orc6</italic>-null flies results in reduced levels of Mcm4 associated with chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), consistent with reduced levels of replicative helicase loading. These observations may explain the previously described cell-cycle arrest in mitosis that coincides with broken and uncondensed chromosomes, as well as reduced BrdU incorporation in neuroblasts observed in these fly strains, suggesting DNA is underreplicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balasov et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, Orc6 constructs lacking part of the C-terminal domain are compromised for initiating DNA replication in <italic>Drosophila</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasov et al., 2007</xref>). Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for these observations: since Orc6 contributes to recruitment of ORC to chromatin through the binding of its TFIIB-like domains to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasov et al., 2007</xref>), loss of the interaction between Orc6 and ORC1–5 likely reduces the levels of chromatin-associated ORC and impairs ORC-dependent pre-RC assembly. The more moderate replicative phenotype of Orc6 mutations that affect Orc6 recruitment into ORC, compared to Orc6 mutations that affect the DNA binding activity of Orc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasov et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2009</xref>), suggests that Orc6 might make contacts with non-ORC pre-RC components that help recruit ORC to DNA during pre-RC assembly. Since a majority of ORC in fly ovary and embryo extracts is not bound to origins, we could not test if mutant Orc6 is recruited into the pre-RC with our assays.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A molecular link between an MGS mutation in Orc6 and impaired origin licensing</title><p>Orc6 is one of several pre-RC components found mutated in Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS) patients. In certain MGS patients, compound heterozygous mutations inactivate one <italic>ORC6</italic> allele and introduce a missense mutation in the other allele that substitutes serine for tyrosine in a conserved C-terminal helix of the Orc6 protein. We show that tyrosine-to-serine mutation reduces the affinity of Orc6 for the core ORC1–5 complex in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig8">Figures 6 and 8</xref>), a finding that would appear to implicate this subunit in the formation of the pre-RC. Interestingly, earlier observations have appeared inconsistent with such a role of Orc6 in some metazoans; for example, in contrast to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system, Orc6 is only loosely or transiently associated with ORC1–5 in humans as well as in other metazoans, while in vitro DNA replication experiments using <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts have suggested that Orc6 may not be required for DNA replication in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chesnokov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dhar and Dutta, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chesnokov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dhar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gillespie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vashee et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giordano-Coltart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ranjan and Gossen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Siddiqui and Stillman, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, evidence is emerging that Orc6 is essential for DNA replication in these species as well. First, depletion of Orc6 in human cell lines causes licensing and DNA replication defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prasanth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stiff et al., 2013</xref>). Second, human Orc6 is required in vitro for efficient DNA replication in Orc6-depleted <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2011</xref>); the initial discrepancies between the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system and other metazoan systems may reflect different extents of immunodepletion of Orc6 from <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts due to the use of different antibodies. Third, tethering of human Orc6 to DNA in human cells creates a functional origin and recruits other factors of the licensing machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thomae et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, immunodepletion of Orc6 from HeLa cell extracts impairs pre-RC assembly on plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thomae et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our data lend credence to the idea that the MGS mutation identified in human Orc6 is hypomorphic, and that the diminished affinity of MGS mutant Orc6 for ORC1–5 compromises pre-RC formation. Consistent with this interpretation, we observe reduced but weak binding of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> Orc6 construct bearing the MGS mutation to either Orc3 or ORC1–5 in equilibrium binding experiments and pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>). Nonetheless, additional interactions of Orc6 with pre-RC components other than ORC subunits during origin licensing could also contribute to Orc6 incorporation into the pre-RC, explaining why the MGS mutation is not lethal in humans. In addition to its canonical function during replication initiation, metazoan Orc6 is also essential for cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prasanth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chesnokov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernal and Venkitaraman, 2011</xref>), helps to control centrosome copy number and, along with other pre-RC components, appears to be essential for formation of primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stiff et al., 2013</xref>). The C-terminal domain of Orc6 harboring the MGS mutation is important for cytokinetic function, both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chesnokov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernal and Venkitaraman, 2011</xref>). At this point it is not known whether the MGS mutation specficially impairs Orc6’s role in cytokinesis, or whether the C-terminal domain of Orc6 is involved in regulating centrosome copy number and cilia formation in humans. In addition, it is not understood how the defects in origin licensing caused by other MGS mutations would feed back to ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stiff et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, given the fact that many independent mutations in different human ORC subunits, where some have been shown to affect replication functions directly, and hypomorphic mutations in the ATR replication check point protein lead to primordial dwarfism, it is hard to escape the inference that loss of ORC replication licensing functions are indeed epistatic to the MGS phenotype. Interestingly, MGS patients do not appear to have an increased predisposition to cancer, suggesting chromosome stability is not compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Munnik et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">b</xref>). How these observations are linked, how they relate to the phenotypes observed in MGS patients, and how specific MGS mutations intercept these processes will be important tasks for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conserved domain organization in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and metazoan Orc6</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6 and metazoan Orc6 have been shown to perform distinct roles in initiating DNA replication: metazoan Orc6 binds DNA through its TFIIB-like domains and helps recruiting ORC to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chesnokov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), while <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6 does not bind DNA but has been shown to be directly essential for the loading step of the MCM double hexamer onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee and Bell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duncker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Remus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gambus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takara and Bell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fernandez-Cid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frigola et al., 2013</xref>). Up to now, this difference has seemed consistent with the apparent lack of significant sequence homology between these proteins. However, we found that the C-terminal helix that is crucial for Orc6 association with metazoan ORC is actually highly conserved in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6, both in sequence and in function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Moreover, we found that the sequence homology between metazoan and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6 extends to the TFIIB-like folds identified in metazoan Orc6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, budding yeast Orc6 lacks multiple basic amino acids that are conserved in metazoan Orc6, resulting in a lower isoelectric point for its TFIIB domains (pI = 7.5) compared to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein (pI = 9.0). This difference in surface charge may explain the distinct DNA binding propensities of metazoan and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee and Bell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, because the TFIIB domains are preserved across eukaryotic Orc6 orthologs, it is tempting to speculate that these folds also play an important conserved function during origin licensing. While recent reports indicate that Orc6 may not be essential for MCM2–7 recruitment to origins, it is essential for loading of MCM double hexamers onto origin DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fernandez-Cid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frigola et al., 2013</xref>). The loading function of Orc6 may involve binding of Cdt1 or another pre-RC component through direct protein interactions, as has been reported for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6 and Cdt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, of the two regions of Orc6 that were shown to independently interact with Cdt1, each contain one of the TFIIB-like domains identified here in yeast Orc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting Cdt1 binding may be conserved in metazoan Orc6 as well. Along these lines, acquisition of the MGS mutation in human Orc6 would be predicted to reduce licensing capacity and MCM loading by impeding Orc6 recruitment into ORC and pre-replicative complex formation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes the structural and molecular analysis of ORC function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The initial portion of the paper derives a higher resolution EM structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORC and map the location of a number of ORC subunits on this structure. This structure helps to resolve previous observed differences between the yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic> EM structure of ORC bringing helpful agreement between the structures. Using protein sequence analysis, the authors suggest that Orc6 has a similar structure across all eukaryotes (previously Orc6 from fungi was thought to be an outlier). More importantly, the authors find that the C-terminal domain of Orc6 binds to a Orc3 via an insertion between canonical AAA<sup>+</sup> motifs that is specific to Orc3. Finally, the authors show that a previously identified Meier-Gorlin mutation in Orc6 interferes with this interaction using fly, human, or yeast proteins.</p><p>The strength of this manuscript is the identification of the primary interaction site between Orc6 and Orc1-5 and the observation that this is conserved in many (if not all) eukaryotic cells. The EM studies also help to bring together the structural studies of ORC performed in yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, although they do not provide any major new insights. One significant weakness is the authors fail to clearly delineate what the defect is when they interfere with the Orc1-5/Orc6 interaction. There is no data in the paper addressing this issue and previous data from one of the authors assessing the function of a mutant that interferes with this interaction was assessed to cause defects in mitosis rather than replication. Despite this, the authors state strongly that the defect is in DNA replication but provide no data to support this conclusion (e.g., measure Mcm2-7 chromatin association). The authors point to reduced BrdU incorporation observed for the mutants in the previous studies as evidence in favor of this interpretation but do not explain why their previous reasoning focused on the arrest point was incorrect. One concern with these analyses overall is that they are looking at terminal phenotypes that could reflect defects in both activities since it is clear that Orc6 participates in both events. Given the data in hand, it would make more sense to be a little less focused on a replication defect.</p><p>When the authors submit a revised manuscript, they must address the following points:</p><p>1) They should provide further evidence for the molecular defect caused when binding of Orc6 to the rest of the complex is disrupted, or at the very least discuss the ambiguities remaining from their current analysis.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, the two mutants of Orc6 are expressed at lower levels than wild type (see input lanes), undermining the conclusion that they are defective for interaction with the ORC complex.</p><p>3) Why did the authors make a double mutation (D224A/Y225A) for the functional analysis in flies (Table 1)?

Specifically, we have examined the association of Mcm4 with chromatin in larval brains expressing either GFP-Orc6 wild type or GFP-Orc6 mutant transgenes. Our results show that the amount of Mcm4 in the insoluble pellet fraction after salt extraction is greatly reduced in <italic>orc6</italic>-null larvae when mutant, but not wild-type Orc6 transgenes, are expressed. These findings suggest that Orc6 mutants that fail to incorporate into ORC also reduce the amount of MCM2-7 complex loaded onto chromatin, supporting our previous conclusion that Orc6 C-terminal mutants impair DNA replication initiation.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref><italic>, the two mutants of Orc6 are expressed at lower levels than wild type (see input lanes), undermining the conclusion that they are defective for interaction with the ORC complex</italic>.</p><p>We acknowledge the reviewers’ concern that the mutants may be expressed at lower levels than the wild type Orc6. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to adjust the levels in ovary IPs, as “mutant ovaries” tend to be smaller in size (likely due to under-replication). We note that the experiment was done with the same number of ovaries per IP per strain. We have repeated the experiment several times; in every case, mutant GFP-Orc6s do not associate with the rest of the complex.</p><p><italic>3) Why did the authors make a double mutation (D224A/Y225A) for the functional analysis in flies (Table 1)? This is now no longer directly comparable to the MGS mutation</italic>.</p><p>We used the double mutants of Orc6 (D224A/Y225A and W228A/K229A) for our experiments because these mutant fly strains were already at hand from previous studies, and because the phenotypes of these strains had been characterized in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balasov et al. 2009</xref>). While only the results for the W228A/K229A mutant were published at that time, the experiments with the D224A/Y225A mutant fly strain were carried out in parallel. We agree that these mutations are not directly comparable to the MGS mutation in humans; however, the main conclusion we draw from these mutants is that conserved residues in the C-terminal region of Orc6 are necessary for Orc6 incorporation into ORC and, as we have now shown, for MCM chromatin loading. We are still in the process of making the Orc6 MGS mutant in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and don’t have the results concerning its phenotype yet. Since we have now shown that the C-terminus of Orc6 stimulates loading of MCMs onto chromatin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and is required for viability in budding yeast (see below), we don’t feel that the MGS mutant fly is critical for our main conclusions.</p><p><italic>4) The MGS mutation (Y418S) should be tested for viability in budding yeast</italic>.</p><p>We have now tested Orc6 (Y418S) as well as several Orc6 constructs lacking amino acid stretches from the C-terminus for complementation in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9– figure supplement 1</xref>). In this experiment, we used a strain in which the chromosomal copy of Orc6 has been fused to an N-terminal degron (a kind gift from SP Bell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al. 2007</xref>). Under non-permissive growth conditions, we observe that wild-type Orc6 expressed from a centromeric plasmid under the control of its own promoter can complement depletion of the endogenous Orc6 protein and that the yeast are viable. Yeast expressing Orc6Y418S grow similarly to Orc6WT cells, suggesting that this point mutation is not sufficient to disrupt the replicative function of yeast Orc6 in our experimental conditions. This result is consistent with our observation (and that of the Stillman lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al. 2012</xref>)) that Orc6 is also recruited into ORC through a yeast-specific interaction with Orc2, a contact that we suggest derives from a pair of domain insertions (one in each protein) that are unique to budding-yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al. 2012</xref>). By contrast, yeast Orc6 lacking as little as 11 amino acids from its C-terminus is not able to complement endogenous Orc6 depletion, and these cells have a severe slow growth phenotype, a finding consistent with prior published studies from the Bell lab showing that a larger deletion from the C-terminus of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc6 is essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Bell 2011</xref>). Since only replicative functions have been found thus far for yeast Orc6, this result strengthens the proposition that the C-terminus of Orc6, and the patch of conserved homology we have called attention to in this paper, is important for initiation.</p><p><italic>5) The previous EM analysis of the</italic> Drosophila <italic>ORC complex reports two structures described as APO and ATP; however the latter was determined in the presence of only 5 μM ATPγS.

Is there anything to be learned regarding conformational changes upon ATP binding from comparing the two, despite the fact that the old structure is at lower resolution</italic>?</p><p>As mentioned in the original manuscript, ATPγS binding appears to trap ORC in a specific conformational state, likely by stabilizing interactions between AAA<sup>+</sup> subunits Orc1, Orc4, and Orc5. This is also evident in class averages in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, which show that the core of ORC is much better defined in the presence of ATP?S. Unfortunately, the resolution of our EM reconstruction is, at 22Å, too low to really pinpoint the nature of the conformational changes in individual ORC subunit (see also response to point #6 below).</p><p><italic>6) No fitting of the archaeal crystal structure to the EM map is described. Has there been any attempt to do it, considering the potential help provided by the localization of the N/C-terminal tags</italic>?</p><p>We have attempted to fit crystal structures of archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 into our EM volume. However, at our current resolution (22Å) the docking results are not unambiguous. This uncertainty is likely due to conformational changes in ORC subunits with respect to the archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 crystal structures (which themselves have been imaged in a variety of conformational states), whereby different subunits adopting different conformations. Along these lines, the flexible nature of the MBP- and GFP-tags, the modest resolution of the EM reconstruction, and the close spatial proximity of the N- and C-termini of archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 (as seen in available crystal structures) preclude us from pinpointing the N-and C-termini of the subunits in the EM volume. We prefer not to include the fitting into the manuscript because, at this point, we cannot be sufficiently confident whether the conformational changes that we impose on archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 crystal structure during fitting truly reflect the domain organization within eukaryotic ORC subunits. Unambiguous fitting will have to await higher resolution EM structures and/or crystal structures of eukaryotic ORC subunits.</p></body></sub-article></article>
