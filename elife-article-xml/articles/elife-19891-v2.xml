events, including B cell receptor (BCR) activation, are hypothesized to be facilitated by domains enriched in specific plasma membrane lipids and proteins that resemble liquid-ordered phase-separated domains in model membranes. This concept remains controversial and lacks direct experimental support in intact cells. Here, we visualize ordered and disordered domains in mouse B lymphoma cell membranes using super-resolution fluorescence localization microscopy, demonstrate that clustered BCR resides within ordered phase-like domains capable of sorting key regulators of BCR activation, and present a minimal, predictive model where clustering receptors leads to their collective activation by stabilizing an extended ordered domain. These results provide evidence for the role of membrane domains in BCR signaling and a plausible mechanism of BCR activation via receptor clustering that could be generalized to other signaling pathways. Overall, these studies demonstrate that lipid mediated forces can bias biochemical networks in ways that broadly impact signal transduction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19891.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19891.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19891.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Membranes made of molecules called lipids surround every living cell to protect the cell's contents. Cells also communicate with the outside environment via their membranes. Proteins in the membrane receive information from the environment and trigger signaling pathways inside the cell to relay this information to the center of cell. The way in which proteins are organized on the membrane has a major influence on their signaling activity.</p><p>Some areas of the membrane are more crowded with certain lipids and signaling proteins than others. Lipid and protein molecules of particular types can come together and form distinct areas called “ordered” and “disordered” domains. The lipids in ordered domains are more tightly packed than disordered domains and it is thought that this difference allows domains to selectively exclude or include certain proteins. Ordered domains are also known as &quot;lipid rafts&quot;. Lipid rafts and disordered domains may help cells to control the activities of signaling pathways, however, technical limitations have made it difficult to study the roles of these domains.</p><p>The membranes surrounding immune cells called B cells contain a protein called the B cell receptor, which engages with proteins from microbes and other foreign invaders. When the B cell receptor binds to a foreign protein it forms clusters with other B cell receptors and becomes active, triggering a signaling pathway that leads to immune responses.</p><p>Stone, Shelby et al. examined lipid rafts and disordered domains in B cells from mice using a technique called super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. The results show that clusters of B cell receptors are present within lipid rafts. These clusters made the lipid rafts larger and more stable. A protein that is needed during the early stages of B cell receptor signaling was also found in the same lipid rafts. Another protein that terminates signaling was excluded because it prefers disordered domains. Together, this provides a local environment in certain areas of the membrane that favors receptor activity and supports the subsequent immune response.</p><p>Future work is needed to understand how cells control the make-up of lipids and proteins within their membranes, and how defects in this regulation can alter signaling activity and lead to disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19891.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19891.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>lipid raft</kwd><kwd>membrane phase seperation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM110052</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veatch</surname><given-names>Sarah L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 1552439</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veatch</surname><given-names>Sarah L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Clustering the B cell receptor generates a membrane domain analogous to the liquid-ordered phase, localizing proteins involved in early receptor activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells interact with their environment through a complex set of biochemical networks that transmit information across the plasma membrane. Often, signal transduction relies on the spatial organization of receptors as well as effector proteins that regulate down-stream signaling activity. In principle, spatial organization in biological membranes can be enforced through varied mechanisms including direct protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Douglass and Vale, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Su et al., 2016b</xref>), dynamic or passive coupling to cytoskeletal elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wülfing and Davis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kaizuka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeMond et al., 2008</xref>), adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis and van der Merwe, 2006</xref>), curvature mediated forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aimon et al., 2014</xref>), or steady state biochemical networks with spatial heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chau et al., 2012</xref>). It is also proposed that plasma membrane lipids contribute to the spatial organization of membrane proteins via the same thermodynamic forces that drive the separation of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases in model membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schroeder et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>). Liquid-ordered like domains are often referred to as lipid rafts or lipid shells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Jacobson, 2002</xref>), and are hypothesized to impact a broad array of signaling cascades that originate at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simons and Toomre, 2000</xref>) including B cell receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 1999</xref>). However, the existence of phase-like membrane domains and their putative roles in signaling pathways remain controversial, largely because the majority of experimental support for this concept is indirect or relies on methodology with well characterized limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heerklotz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Munro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kwik et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kenworthy, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Some of the strongest experimental evidence supporting a heterogeneous plasma membrane comes from Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements between membrane components. This method is sensitive to heterogeneity on length-scales smaller than the Förster distance (~5 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kenworthy and Edidin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Varma and Mayor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pyenta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zacharias et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sharma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rao and Mayor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sengupta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goswami et al., 2008</xref>). While powerful for detecting interactions between proteins and/or lipids that occur on small length-scales, the FRET signal is highly nonlinear with respect to probe separation distance and depends on both donor/acceptor ratio and probe absolute density, which typically vary in experiments. These complications can lead to weak sensitivity of FRET measurements to changes in local concentration and often modeling is required to interpret experimental findings quantitatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kenworthy and Edidin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rao and Mayor, 2005</xref>). Here, we apply super-resolution fluorescence localization imaging to complement these past approaches to directly visualize ordered and disordered-like domains in intact cell plasma membranes. This approach allows us to characterize and quantify, in a model-independent manner, the spatial organization of membrane components on length scales between those accessible by FRET-based techniques and conventional optical microscopy.</p><p>B cells undergo a signaling response when their B cell receptors (BCRs) are engaged by antigen, either in the form of solution-phase multivalent antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Minguet et al., 2010</xref>) or surface-presented monovalent antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batista et al., 2001</xref>), however the molecular mechanisms driving BCR signal initiation are still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Packard and Cambier, 2013</xref>). Notably, simply clustering the BCR with antibodies directed against the receptor initiates phosphorylation by Src family kinases, resulting in the binding of downstream kinases and effectors that amplify and propagate the signaling response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cambier and Ransom, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell and Sefton, 1990</xref>). This supports the idea that, at least in some contexts, the spatial organization of the BCR can function to communicate antigen binding, similar to other transmembrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Metzger, 1992</xref>), as opposed to a mechanism where receptor binding is conveyed solely through ligand-induced conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Humphries, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sounier et al., 2015</xref>). Several mechanistic models have been put forth to explain how BCR clustering could give rise to receptor activation. In one model, BCR clustering initiates signaling via protein-protein interactions between neighboring receptors, such as the transphosphorylation of nearby receptors by receptor-bound kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sotirellis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kurosaki and Kurosaki, 1997</xref>). A second model proposes that antigen binding acts to separate pre-clustered BCR, exposing binding sites to kinases that propagate activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang and Reth, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">2010b</xref>). A third model, which is the focus of investigation here, postulates that clustering BCR acts to stabilize an ordered membrane domain that impacts the receptor-proximal distribution of regulatory proteins involved in initiating or modulating the resulting cellular response. Specifically, ordered membrane domains are predicted to support interactions with activating kinases and suppress interactions with deactivating phosphatases. This hypothesis has been strengthened by experimental support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pierce, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sohn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta and DeFranco, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sohn et al., 2008a</xref>), and among this evidence are observations of changes in FRET upon receptor clustering and activation between BCR and a marker of ordered membrane domains, but not between BCR and a marker of disordered domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sohn et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">2008b</xref>). These studies demonstrated that receptor clustering leads to a transient increase in near-neighbor interactions (within a few lipid diameters) between BCR and order-preferring lipid probes and suggested that these interactions are important for the initiation of BCR activation by the Src family kinase Lyn. Currently, the role of membrane domains in BCR signaling remains a topic of active investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pierce and Liu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horejsi and Hrdinka, 2014</xref>) as the field works to put together a more holistic picture of how interactions between proteins and lipids could support signaling function.</p><p>Here, we use super-resolution fluorescence localization microscopy to characterize the lipid environment around BCR clusters. Using this approach, we directly visualize ordered domains co-localized with clustered BCR. We find that these domains sort key regulatory proteins involved in BCR signaling and provide a local environment that favors tyrosine phosphorylation. We also present a predictive model whereby BCR clustering leads to its phosphorylation through the stabilization of an ordered membrane domain. Our findings suggest that the collective protein-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions responsible for the stabilization of an ordered domain around BCR clusters give rise to emergent signaling function by influencing the local biochemical environment of BCRs within clusters. These measurements detail the molecular redistribution of membrane components around embedded membrane protein clusters, utilizing super-resolution microscopy to gain access to length scales that are smaller than those accessible by conventional microscopy and larger than length scales accessible by FRET. Overall, our imaging studies provide additional direct evidence that clustered BCR associates with a local environment enriched in ordered lipids. Together with our simulation and functional data, this evidence supports a mechanism for clustering-induced activation of BCR that involves lipid-mediated sorting of regulatory proteins. Similar mechanisms may be relevant to other pathways where changes in receptor organization lead to signaling functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phase-like domains observed in intact B cells</title><p>Membrane heterogeneity was probed using established markers of ordered and disordered membrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The left-most images in a and c represent simulation snapshots without additional processing. The remaining images are generated from the same information present in the left-most image, but both colors are filtered (blurred) by a 2D Gaussian function with standard deviation (σ) of 30 nm (second column) or 220 nm (third column) to simulate the finite localization precision of super-resolution microscopy or traditional resolution of diffraction-limited microscopy, respectively.

Without blurring, it is clearly evident that green components are depleted from the local area around proteins (C(r) &lt; 1 for short separation distances (r) in simulations of both clustered and unclustered proteins. Blurring by the super-resolution localization precision (σ = 30 nm) dramatically reduces the magnitude of depletion in the absence of protein clustering (blue points in b), but depletion is still apparent when proteins are clustered (blue points in d). This is because the size of the protein cluster is on the same order as the length scale of the Gaussian blurring. In contrast, no significant depletion is observed when blurring is applied to mimic conventional fluorescence microscopy (σ = 220 nm) because the length scale of blurring is much longer than the size of protein and membrane phase-like structures. These results visually demonstrate that finite resolution limits reduce the magnitude of observed correlations. Also, in all cases, cross-correlation functions tabulated from under-sampled images reproduce those of the fully sampled images within error bounds even though the images are visually very different. We also note that experimental super-resolution images are not able to accurately capture the fraction of the membrane occupied by one type of phase-like domain. For the example of the unclustered receptor with σ = 30 nm, the fully-sampled image gives the false impression that the majority of the frame is occupied by green (disordered) components, even though it is actually only 50% of the total area. In contrast, the under-sampled image gives the visual impression that less than half of the frame is occupied by green disordered components. Both finite lateral resolution and under-sampling in space make it difficult to accurately determine the surface fraction occupied by phase-like domains in experimentally acquired super-resolution images.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19891.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19891.006</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19891-fig1-figsupp3-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig1s4" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19891.007</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</label><caption><title>Correlation functions from individual cells and average curves.</title><p>Colored lines are cross-correlation curves from individual cells that contribute to the average curves presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>.

First, we stabilized a disordered domain in the plasma membrane by clustering transiently expressed TM through the binding of primary and secondary antibodies, then imaged these clusters in combination with transiently expressed PM or GG peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, left panel). Pair cross-correlation functions indicate that TM clusters are enriched in GG and depleted of PM on average compared to the membrane as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, left panel), consistent with the partitioning of these probes into disordered domains in GPMVs. In separate experiments we stabilized an ordered domain by clustering biotinylated CTxB bound to endogenous GM1 with streptavidin, and imaged these clusters in combination with PM or TM peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, right panel). Pair cross-correlation functions indicate that PM is enriched and TM is depleted on average within CTxB clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, right panel), in good agreement with the partitioning of these probes into ordered domains in GPMVs.</p><p>The spatial heterogeneity observed within TM or CTxB clusters is subtle; we observed at most 20% enrichment or depletion of the peptide probes within the clustered protein domains, although this is an underestimate of the actual enrichment or depletion due to the finite lateral resolution of the measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Relevant to this point, we found that TM clusters (68 nm) were on average larger than CTxB clusters (40 nm), which were on the order of our cumulative resolution (40 nm) in the measurements summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>. It is possible that the weaker enrichment and depletion of lipid probes within CTxB clusters as compared to TM clusters is simply due to the limited resolution of these measurements.</p><p>Cross-correlation curves are aggregated from multiple (8-58) single-cell measurements, and error bars on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> indicate the standard error of the mean (SEM) between curves generated from single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Error in these measurements was dominated by probe sampling statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) because the surface density of probes (2–20 μm<sup>−2</sup>) is such that only a few peptides co-localize with nanosized clustered protein domains within an image of a single chemically fixed cell. We note that the apparent surface area occupied by fluorescent peptides is likely a vast under-estimate of the surface area occupied by ordered or disordered phase-like domains since these probes are only one of many membrane components that likely occupy these domains, leading to inherent under-sampling of space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stone et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, incomplete spatial sampling by fluorescent peptides can give rise to the appearance of peptide self-clustering, since a single mEos3.2 fluorophore can reversibly photo-switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Endesfelder et al., 2011</xref>) and therefore is likely detected multiple times over the course of a measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stone et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The cross-correlation analysis used here has advantages over other co-clustering algorithms for images with low spatial sampling, and can detect enrichment or depletion of probes even when this effect is not evident by visual inspection of images, as illustrated in Materials and methods. While in principle the cross-correlation analysis is insensitive to probe surface densities beyond an impact on signal to noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>), we observe a weak expression level dependence of PM recruitment to CTxB clusters, possibly suggesting that probe expression impacts the mixing properties of the plasma membrane as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Both the expression-level dependence of probe partitioning and the small size of CTxB and TM clusters impede us from drawing quantitative conclusions regarding the magnitude of enrichment or depletion of peptides into domains. Instead, we draw conclusions regarding whether probes are enriched or depleted within our sensitivity limits, which is not impacted by either of these factors.</p><p>Taken together, these findings indicate that clustered plasma membrane proteins can stabilize domains spanning both plasma membrane leaflets that sort established markers of ordered and disordered domains in intact cell membranes. Importantly, we observe depletion of markers from domains of the alternate phase, as well as equivalency between order-and disorder-driven sorting. These are properties of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains in phase separated membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Veatch and Keller, 2005</xref>); therefore we refer to them as phase-like domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phase-like domains are stabilized through BCR clustering</title><p>We used similar methods to probe membrane heterogeneity in the vicinity of BCR and BCR receptor clusters. Endogenously expressed BCR was labeled with a biotinylated f(Ab)<sub>1</sub> against IgM, BCR was clustered with streptavidin acting as a generic antigen, and BCR clusters were imaged in combination with transiently expressed PM or TM peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The sorting of phase sensitive peptides with respect to BCR clusters was observed in chemically fixed CH27 B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), live CH27 B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), and chemically fixed primary mouse B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In all cases we found that the PM peptide was enriched and the TM peptide was excluded from BCR clusters. Cross-correlation curves were aggregated from multiple single-cell measurements, and error bars indicate the SEM between curves generated from single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Variance in these measurements is dominated by probe sampling statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and lipid probe expression density only weakly impacts the cross-correlation between BCR and lipid probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Again, we found that the expression level of phase sensitive peptides impacts the magnitude but not the sign of peptide partitioning with respect to clustered BCR, allowing us to determine the type of domain stabilized by BCR clusters if not its quantitative composition. The direct measurements of peptide sorting shown here are generally consistent with past FRET and biochemical isolation measurements that argued that clustered BCR resides within ordered membrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pierce, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sohn et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">2008b</xref>).

It is likely that this extended domain arises from additional signaling structures assembled proximal to BCR, as is observed in other immune-receptor signaling systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balagopalan et al., 2015</xref>). For example, palmitoylated adapter proteins involved in signal transduction such as LAB/LAT2/NTAL may incorporate into activated BCR microclusters and act to extend the domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mutch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Malhotra et al., 2009</xref>). Further, PM enrichment was reduced in cells treated with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 prior to receptor clustering and fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting that ordered domain stabilization is amplified by receptor activation and the recruitment of down-stream signaling partners.</p><p>The same magnitude of PM and TM co-localization with BCR clusters was observed in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) as in chemically fixed cells, indicating that co-localization is not an artifact of chemical fixation.

Interestingly, the magnitude of sorting is increased in primary cells compared to CH27 cells. This may be a biological consequence of the LPS treatment required to maintain cell viability during transient transfection, or due to other differences in membrane composition between these two cell types. PM was also enriched within BCR clusters when CH27 cells were chemically fixed at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>), indicating that ordered domains are formed at growth temperatures, although the magnitude of enrichment is reduced compared to the room temperature examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. We note that BCR clustering elicits a cellular response at both temperatures.</p><p>We additionally observed weak PM enrichment around unclustered BCR in chemically fixed CH27 cells, although the magnitude of this sorting is on the edge of the sensitivity limits of our imaging system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>). This weak signal could indicate reduced partitioning of monomeric or pre-clustered BCR with ordered domains prior to streptavidin-induced clustering, or could simply reflect that domain sizes are at or below the finite lateral resolution of these measurements (~40 nm) (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). At this time, we cannot comment on the oligomerization state of BCR prior to enforced clustering with streptavidin, because single color images of BCR contain over-counting artifacts that render monomers indistinguishable from small oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the magnitude of PM sorting with respect to unclustered BCR is comparable to the sorting of this peptide observed with respect to unclustered CTxB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>). Improved lateral resolution is needed to systematically investigate the lateral organization of receptors and peptides in intact cells without receptor clustering, and may be enabled by recent improvements in fluorophores and imaging modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2016</xref>).</p><p>Together, the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> support the view that BCR clustering locally stabilizes an ordered lipid domain. Sorting of order- and disorder-preferring probes around BCR clusters follows the same trends observed for clusters of an established marker of ordered domains, CTxB, and is consistent in fixed, live, and primary cells. Domains formed around clustered proteins share many of the features of domains observed in model membranes. Individual lipids are free to diffuse into and out of domains, suggesting that these domains are fluid. The amount of enrichment observed in these experiments is also consistent with expectations from ordered-disordered phase fluctuations in model systems above their transition temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Veatch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Machta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>), in contrast to the strong recruitment described in early work on membrane rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>). Finally, the symmetry in the sign of correlations observed for order- and disorder-preferring probes and order- or disorder-preferring protein clusters is also consistent with the two liquid phase regime in model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Machta et al., 2012</xref>). At the same time, the effects of lipid phase-mediated sorting are likely superimposed on other interactions present within the complex milieu of the membrane, such as electrostatic interactions between charged peptides and lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ordered domains sort key regulators of early BCR signaling</title><p>The observed sorting of minimal peptides suggests that the localization of full-length proteins is also impacted by their membrane anchoring motifs. We investigated the role of membrane domains in the localization of two critical regulators of BCR activation, Lyn kinase and CD45 phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dal Porto et al., 2004</xref>), by comparing their spatial distribution around BCR to that of their membrane anchor peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Both CD45 and its minimal anchor peptide CD45<sub>TM</sub> were excluded from BCR clusters to the same extent, indicating that membrane domain interactions are sufficient to drive this partitioning. Lyn kinase was more enriched in BCR clusters than its membrane anchor PM, consistent with the direct binding of Lyn to phosphorylated ITAM sequences on BCR mediated by SH2 interaction domains in full-length Lyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson et al., 1995</xref>). The effective interaction energy between membrane anchors and BCR is given by the potential of mean force (PMF), which is simply obtained from measured cross-correlation functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stone and Veatch, 2015</xref>).

Again we found that CD45 was depleted and Lyn was enriched in these ordered domains. In this case, full-length proteins partitioned similarly to their minimal anchor peptides, as expected since CTxB does not bind directly to either of these proteins.</p><p>The sorting of proteins into ordered membrane domains is also sufficient to locally alter their phosphorylation state. This was seen by visualizing the distribution of phosphorylated protein tyrosine residues (pY) with respect to protein clusters using a generic anti-pY antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). BCR and CTxB clustering both induce local tyrosine phosphorylation co-localized with clusters, while TM clustering does not. This direct observation agrees with previous indirect measures of localized phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harder and Simons, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 1999</xref>). As expected, total pY enrichment was reduced in CTxB clusters compared to BCR clusters, since CTxB itself lacks sites for tyrosine phosphorylation and does not directly bind to additional proteins containing pY. However, enrichment in ordered domains stabilized by CTxB clustering is sufficient for phosphorylation of resident proteins, as is evident from the stronger co-localization of trans-activated (pY397) Lyn with CTxB clusters compared to overall Lyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The membrane remodeling that occurs upon CTxB clustering is also sufficient to trigger a cellular response. In agreement with past reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Francis et al., 1992</xref>), we found that CTxB clustering leads to Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) without significantly altering the distribution of BCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). CTxB binding and clustering also resulted in subtle increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple protein species detected within cellular extracts probed via Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The imaging results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> draw a connection between the lipid-mediated protein sorting observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and signaling function. We showed that ordered domains contribute a substantial fraction of the free energy required to concentrate the kinase Lyn and all of the free energy required to deplete the phosphatase CD45 from BCR clusters. Through this sorting, ordered domains provide a local environment that favors tyrosine phosphorylation, as supported by correlations between CTxB clusters and anti-pY antibodies even in the absence of specific recruitment of signaling machinery through protein-protein interactions. It is reasonable to expect that the ~50% increase in the ratio of Lyn to CD45 due to sorting by ordered domains could cause a significant change in BCR phosphorylation levels if we compare to results obtained for the related T cell receptor (TCR) system. In a reconstituted system, TCR phosphorylation was shown to have switch-like dependence on the relative concentrations of the Src kinase Lck, which is the analog of Lyn in the TCR system, and CD45 at physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hui and Vale, 2014</xref>). As a result, small increases in Lck concentration and decreases in CD45 concentration were shown to produce large shifts in TCR phosphorylation, and this behavior likely also applies to the BCR system investigated here. Additionally, the actual enrichment and depletion of probes around BCR and CTxB is larger than the measured values presented here since the real spatial distributions are convolved with the finite resolution of the measurement to give the observed cross-correlations. Lastly, local activation of Lyn within ordered domains also provides a potential mode of positive regulation. Concentration of Lyn in ordered domains and exclusion of phosphatases would be expected to favor Lyn trans-activation at Y397 and prevent inactivation. This would create an environment within ordered domains where Lyn is not only more concentrated but also more active, as has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Young et al., 2003</xref>) and supported by the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>. Thus, distinct membrane environments could influence both the local concentration and activity of proteins, and these effects may amplify or negate one another to determine an overall signaling outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A minimal model for receptor activation upon clustering in a heterogeneous membrane</title><p>Our observations of protein sorting by ordered domains suggest a mechanism for receptors to become phosphorylated upon clustering via differential partitioning of proteins regulating BCR phosphorylation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> describes a predictive model that reproduced the sorting behavior of kinase and phosphatase anchor peptides observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The model consists of receptors that can be phosphorylated by kinases and dephosphorylated by phosphatases. In addition, activated receptors can phosphorylate other receptors, mimicking the actions of receptor-bound kinases (RBKs) such as Lyn and Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson et al., 1995</xref>). These protein components are embedded in a heterogeneous membrane represented by a 2D Ising model where extended ordered and disordered domains form at equilibrium through interactions between adjacent components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Machta et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2012</xref>). This model represents phase-like heterogeneity as extended composition fluctuations that collectively emerge from weak intermolecular interactions when membranes are positioned near a miscibility critical point, and is supported by experiments in both purified and isolated biological membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Veatch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Honerkamp-Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>).

Through this set of minimal assumptions, receptors became collectively activated upon clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>).

Receptor activation was more subtle in these simulations. This is because only a fraction of receptors reside within the ordered domain at a given time, receptors freely leave the protective environment of the ordered domain, and the local concentration of receptors within the domain is reduced compared to simulations with clustered receptors. In these simulations, we also find that the size of the ordered domain impacts the efficiency of receptor activation. This occurs because the residency time of a receptor within the domain increases with increasing domain size, as does the average number of receptors within the domain. Both of these factors increase the likelihood that the RBK positive feedback will amplify receptor activation.</p><p>This minimal model provides a framework for interpreting our imaging data and for developing hypotheses for the specific role of lipid-mediated sorting in BCR clustering-induced activation. Here, existing small, dynamic phase fluctuations were stabilized through clustering of ordered components to form a larger, stable domain structure of approximately the size of the cluster. This model quantitatively reproduces our imaging measurements of protein sorting by ordered domains, recapitulates clustering-induced BCR activation, and demonstrates that ordered domain formation alone can be sufficient to activate receptors. Further, phase-like heterogeneity is required for robust activation of BCR under these simulation conditions. The dependence of receptor activation on domain size in simulations where ordered domains are formed without BCR clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) highlights the collective nature of interactions that determine the local environment of receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The minimal model is predictive for the case of cholesterol modulation</title><p>In order to demonstrate this model’s predictive power, we ran further simulations to probe receptor phosphorylation as the surface fraction of ordered components was varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

Acute modulation of cholesterol levels in intact cells with methyl β cyclodextrin (MβCD) alters the surface fraction of coexisting ordered and disordered phases in GPMVs imaged at low temperature that were isolated from these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). This occurs without an effect on cell viability as measured via annexin V binding to the extracellular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Past work indicates that this perturbation can also alter domain composition in vesicles at elevated temperature in a way that is quantitatively predicted by our model of membrane heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). In intact B cells, we observed increased calcium mobilization upon BCR clustering when cholesterol levels were acutely lowered with MβCD, in agreement with past work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awasthi-Kalia et al., 2001</xref>). We also observed decreased calcium mobilization upon BCR clustering in cells pretreated with MβCD-cholesterol complexes, which act to increase cellular cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christian et al., 1997</xref>). The observed changes in calcium mobilization are accompanied by changes in PM cross-correlation with BCR clusters that are also in line with model predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). PM is more strongly enriched in BCR clusters in cells pretreated with MβCD than in untreated cells, and less strongly enriched in cells pretreated with MβCD-cholesterol complexes.</p><p>While the model clearly over-simplifies the behavior of the plasma membrane and the complexity of the BCR signaling pathway, it is able to predict both the functional response associated with membrane perturbation and changes in domain-mediated sorting reported by super-resolution imaging experiments. In spite of the acknowledged plieotropic effects of cholesterol modulation with MβCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Munro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kwik et al., 2003</xref>), its effects on the surface fraction of ordered vs. disordered phases in GPMVs and the cross-correlation of PM with BCR clusters mirror the changes in the fraction of ordered and disordered components enforced in simulations. Therefore, we expect that modulating cholesterol levels using MβCD impacts the composition of the plasma membrane of B cells in a way that parallels the changes in our minimal model: by varying the surface fraction of ordered vs. disordered components. This in turn alters peptide sorting around BCR clusters. The striking correspondence of the structural and functional outputs of the simulations to experimental measures of PM partitioning and BCR activation provides validation of the model and its assumptions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we directly observed domains in cellular plasma membranes that resemble liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases in model membranes. In these experiments we visualized both enrichment and, for the first time, depletion of membrane species from phase-like domains in intact cells. This sorting behavior was induced both by clustering generic membrane proteins with known phase partitioning in GPMVs and by clustering BCR. BCR clustering drove spatial co-localization or segregation of minimal membrane anchors from BCR clusters, consistent with the formation of an ordered phase-like domain. These domains also sorted BCR signaling partners into and out of receptor clusters. Experiments that examined functional outcomes of BCR signaling indicated that formation of an ordered domain through protein clustering creates a local membrane environment that favors protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Functional and imaging results are consonant with a simple but predictive model of membrane phase behavior.</p><p>Based on these observations and supported by the predictive model, we propose a mechanism where receptor clustering alone can initiate collective BCR activation by stabilizing an ordered membrane domain. This mechanism is distinct from some historical ideas of how “lipid rafts” have been thought to play a role in BCR signaling, which pose that BCR actively partitions into pre-existing ordered domains upon clustering. Instead, our findings support the idea that receptor clusters template a lipid domain in the membrane by stabilizing existing but very subtle and transient membrane composition fluctuations. In the absence of clustering, the size and dynamics of fluctuations allows positive and negative regulators to mix with BCRs. When BCR is clustered, the effect on downstream signaling depends on the size and stability of the resulting domain, which sets the level of access signaling partners have to resident BCR. As a consequence, the structure of the BCR cluster and surrounding membrane can influence the activation state of individual BCRs. Thus, the entire cluster and associated domain, as opposed to single BCRs, comprise the basic signaling unit for the activation of B cells in this context. Super-resolution microscopy is particularly well-suited to capture this action-at-a-distance because it can measure interactions that span the length scale of the BCR cluster. While BCR activation in vivo by natural antigens likely involves signal integration from multiple sources, our work suggests that formation of phase-like ordered domains through a collective ensemble of relatively weak protein-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions impacts overall signaling outcomes. Thus, we both conclude that lipid-mediated interactions can play a significant role in signal transduction from BCRs activated through protein clustering and can describe a plausible mechanism for their action.</p><p>We suggest that the signaling function conferred by formation of phase-like domains around BCR clusters is an emergent property of a system where signaling molecules are compartmentalized based on their interactions with plasma membrane lipids. By extension, these findings suggest that membrane domains are capable of contributing to a broad array of signal transduction pathways by altering the local concentration of regulatory proteins, shifting the balance of biochemical networks. This compliments existing theories that invoke spatial compartmentalization of receptors and regulatory molecules as a means to control receptor signaling, including size-based exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choudhuri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cordoba et al., 2013</xref>) and 3D protein phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Su et al., 2016a</xref>) and places lipid-mediated interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Machta et al., 2012</xref>) among other canonical forces that dictate protein interactions in membranes, such as electrostatics, curvature, and adhesion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>f(Ab)<sub>1</sub> and antibody modification</title><p>f(Ab)<sub>1</sub> fragment goat antibody to mouse IgM, µ chain specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2338477">AB_2338477</ext-link>) was simultaneously chemically modified with Atto 655 NHS ester (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and biotin-X, SSE, 6-((Biotinoyl)Amino)Hexanoic Acid, Sulfosuccinimidyl Ester, Sodium Salt (Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin) (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY).

Here, labeled molecules are distributed randomly as shown in (<bold>a</bold>). When the localization precision (30 nm) is on the order of the pixel size (25 nm), then it acts to blur the image of molecular centers (<bold>b</bold>). The smooth blurred image represents a fully sampled PSF. In real localization microscopy images, single labeled molecules are typically localized multiple times, but not often enough to fully sample the super-resolved PSF. Instead the distribution represented by the blurred image is under-sampled. The smooth shape of the PSF is still evident when each PSF is sampled many times (c), but images appear more pixelated as this sampling is reduced (d). All of these factors impact the statistics of measured correlation functions. For all conditions indicated, the top panel shows a representative simulation snapshot for the condition indicated (scale-bar = 500 nm) and the two dimensional cross-correlation, C(r, θ), tabulated from this representative image. The next lower panel shows C(r, &lt;θ&gt;) obtained by averaging C(r, θ) over angles (red squares), as well as &lt;C(r)&gt;, the correlation function obtained by averaging over 100 simulation replicates (black circles). Error bars on these curves are either determined from the angular average as described in the main text (red squares, dC(r, &lt;θ&gt;)), or by taking the SEM over 100 simulation replicates to obtain d&lt;C(r)&gt; (black circles). The bottom panels show how the square root of the variance (dC(r)) depends on radius for the conditions indicated. Black circular points show (d&lt;C(r)&gt;). Red squares show the dC(r, &lt;θ&gt;) error averaged over the 100 replicates &lt;dC(r, &lt;θ&gt;)&gt;. The dC<sub>1</sub>(r) and dC<sub>2</sub>(r) points are corrections to dC(r, &lt;θ&gt;) and are calculated as described in Methods.

Excitation of Alexa 532 was accomplished with a 532 nm diode-pumped solid-state laser (Samba 532–150 CW, Cobolt, San Jose, CA). Laser intensities were adjusted such that single fluorophores could be distinguished in individual images, and were generally between 5 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> and 20 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>.

For the purposes of display, localizations were grouped such that probes observed within a small (typically 80 nm) radius in sequential frames were merged and counted as a single localization. Note that this grouping correction does not account for multiple observations of the probe imaged at different times, for example as a result of reversible activation. Histograms of localized positions were blurred as described in figure captions and image contrast was adjusted for display purposes. The resolution of particle localization was close to 30 nm for all probes, determined by correlation-based methods as detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>). This resolution is larger than the localization precision of the Gaussian fits because it includes contributions from other sources of error (e.g. from stage drift).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Cross-correlation analysis in chemically fixed cells</title><p>Regions containing cells were masked by a user-defined region of interest (ROI), and cross correlations were computed from these regions using methodology described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sengupta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stone and Veatch, 2015</xref>) and summarized here. Cross-correlation functions report on the enrichment or depletion of distinguishable probes with respect to one another, normalized by a random co-distribution of probes. Thus, the magnitude of the cross-correlation yields information about interactions of labeled objects with one another that may cause their co-distributions to deviate from a random co-distribution. This methodology is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> using imaging of dually-labeled clathrin coated pits as an example. Clathrin coated pits were imaged in HeLa cells transiently expressing two distinct labeled clathrin heavy chain proteins, one conjugated to mEos3.1 (green) and a second conjugated to GFP that is antibody labeled with Alexa 647 (magenta). Clathrin was chosen for this demonstration because a large number of individual clathrin proteins assemble within clathrin coated pits, which are sparsely distributed within the cell, therefore their co-localization is easily identified when viewing the reconstructed image. A reconstructed image of a HeLa cell showing the distributions of super-resolved localizations arising from both clathrin constructs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>.</p><p>The correlation function can be assembled by tabulating the pair-wise distances between distinguishable probes localized within a masked image, then binning these separation distances to produce the average number of pairs separated by distances between r and r+Δr, where Δr is usually 25 nm in our measurements. The point distribution of distinguishable probes surrounding an example magenta probe is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>. In this case, there are many more green points located at small separation distances from the example magenta point than at large separation distances because the magenta point chosen was located at the center of a clathrin coated structure. These pairwise distances are collected within the radial bins given by the dotted lines. The complete correlation function tabulates these separation distances around all magenta probes in the image. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> shows the histogram describing the distribution of separation distances for all pairs from the cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>. In general, the number of pairs in each bin increases linearly with increasing radius for large separation distances because the area corresponding to each bin also increases linearly, as A ≈ 2πrΔr. These histograms are then normalized by the total number of observations divided by the area of the cell and multiplied by the area of the bins. This normalization is equivalent to the number of observations expected in each bin given a random distribution of pairs across all bins, and is shown as a red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>. Importantly, this normalization simply accounts for variation in expression level between cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and corrects for boundary effects that arise due to the finite extent and shape of the ROI. The cross-correlation function can be equivalently calculated from reconstructed images of all localizations using fast Fourier transforms, as has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stone and Veatch, 2015</xref>). In this case, a two dimensional cross-correlation is tabulated, C(r, θ), and then C(r) is obtained by averaging over angles. Generally, C(r) is tabulated from ungrouped images, meaning that localizations detected within a small radius in sequential frames are counted independently. Ungrouped images are used because cross-correlation functions are not impacted by probe over-counting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>) and this reduces possible errors introduced by the grouping technique. The properly normalized cross-correlation function for this cell is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>.</p><p>Cross-correlation functions only indicate significant correlations when the spatial distribution of one probe influences the spatial distribution of the second probe, even when one or both of the probes are clustered themselves. This effect is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. Error bars on this curve are estimated using the variance within the radial average of the two dimensional C(r, θ), the average lateral resolution of the measurement, and the numbers of probes imaged in each channel, as described in detail below.</p><p>As expected, the cross-correlation function tabulated from the image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> indicates that probes are highly co-localized, where the co-localized density within the first spatial bin (r &lt; 25 nm) is five times higher than randomly co-distributed probes. In this case, C(r) ≈ 1 for separation distances much larger than the size of individual clathrin structures, meaning that the pits themselves are roughly randomly distributed on the cell surface. C(r) is slightly larger than one even at separation distances approaching 1 µm because clathrin structures are more densely localized on the edge of this cell than towards the center. In some instances, we subtract this long distance offset in order to remove long range contributions to C(r) which are not currently under investigation. The vast majority of cross-correlation functions reported in the main text have much smaller amplitudes than the one shown in this example. This is because co-localization is much weaker and/or domains are more numerous. Examples of single cell correlation functions for various probes that co-localize with BCR clusters along with reconstructed images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>A distinct advantage of this cross-correlation function approach is that it involves averaging over multiple domains within an image, and can be further averaged over images. This makes it possible to quantify co-localization that is far too weak or under-sampled to be apparent from visual inspection of images. This is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, which shows a simulated case where the same weak co-distribution of probes is sampled to varying degrees. When the spatial distributions are well-sampled, then co-localization is easily apparent both visually in the image and quantitatively in the tabulated correlation function. When spatial sampling is low, co-localization is no longer apparent in images, and in fact probes can appear anti-correlated because sampling is so sparse that localizations are unlikely to be overlapping. However, cross-correlation functions can still detect co-localization in many cases, although reduced sampling decreases the signal-to-noise.</p><p>ROIs are chosen so that only flat regions of the cell surface are analyzed, which in some cases meant that regions of the cell interior were not included in the ROI when the membrane lifts from the TIR field and membrane components are no longer visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). When included in the ROI, regions of membrane topology produced correlations that extend to large radii (&gt;200 nm) in tabulated cross-correlation functions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4a–b</xref>. This is because both probes are necessarily absent in regions where the membrane has lifted from the glass surface, which makes probes correlated. The normalization of the cross-correlation function properly accounts for complex regions of interest. Significant efforts were made to minimize the impact of membrane topology, but in some cases this was complicated by low spatial sampling of labeled proteins and peptides. Especially in cases where spatial sampling is low, user-defined ROI have the potential to introduce systematic bias that could impact cross-correlation results. In some cases, cells were analyzed without user knowledge of the sample condition, and results were indistinguishable within noise. We also found little user-to-user variation in cross-correlations determined from single cells or averaged over a population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4c–d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Over-counting and estimating protein/peptide surface densities</title><p>One major limitation of the super-resolution methods and probes used here is that it is not possible to simply distinguish multiple observations of the same labeled molecule from a small aggregate of labeled molecules. However, it is possible to estimate the average surface density of labeled molecules for cases where probe blinking follows Poisson statistics and where probes are nearly randomly distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>). This is accomplished by fitting a Gaussian function with standard deviation σ and amplitude A to the autocorrelation function tabulated from a single color image. This single color image is reconstructed from grouped localization data, meaning that localizations detected within a small radius (80nm) in sequential frames are counted as a single localization. Grouping sequential localizations produces images with sampling that better approximates Poison statistics, since localizations are less correlated in time. When labeled proteins are randomly or nearly randomly distributed in space, the area under of the autocorrelation function is inversely proportional to the surface density of labeled proteins according to:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>We expect this to be an accurate estimate of surface density for the majority of mEos3.2 conjugated peptides used in this study, since they are expected to be only subtly self-clustered within the membrane. This estimate will be less accurate for the case of proteins with higher-order structure including extended clusters, such as clustered BCR and CTxB where this density is likely better interpreted as the density of clusters, not individual proteins. We can estimate the average number of times each independent protein or peptide structure is sampled by comparing the average density of localizations to the average surface density of labeled proteins or peptides determined using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>. For the localization data presented in this study, we generally find that independent proteins and peptides are observed between 10 and 50 times over the 5000–10,000 raw acquisition frames imaged. While the cross-correlation obtained between reconstructed images of two different probes is not adversely affected by over-counting, over-counting does impact the observed variance, as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Variance of cross-correlation measurements</title><p>Estimating error bounds on individual fixed cell measurements is complicated by the presence of over-counting of single labeled proteins in combination with finite localization precision. In the absence of these two effects, the variance in C(r) can be simply calculated using Poisson statistics to describe the probability of detecting a certain number of average pairs within some specified area given the cross-correlations observed. This strategy has been applied to estimate error on single live cell cross-correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stone and Veatch, 2015</xref>), but it depends strongly on the average densities of the labeled proteins present. In fixed cells, these numbers can be only estimated due to over-counting as described above. Instead, the variance is estimated by calculating dC(r, &lt;θ&gt;), the standard deviation of the mean obtained when averaging the 2D cross-correlation function C(r, θ) over angles to extract C(r) as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref> and described below.</p><p>In the limit of resolution much smaller than the pixel size, dC(r,&lt;θ&gt;) accurately reproduces the variance obtained by observing many replicates of a simulation where two distinguishable probes are distributed randomly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5a</xref>. When the image resolution is on the order of or larger than the pixel size, then there is smoothing of the image and the resulting C(r, θ). In this case, it is not appropriate to simply tabulate the standard error of the mean of pixel values falling within a separation distance range between r and r+Δr because neighboring pixels in the two-dimensional C(r, θ) are correlated. When the localization precision is known, this effect can be simply corrected using a multiplicative factor that only depends on the localization precision, σ<sub>PSF</sub>, which is the standard deviation of the super-resolved point spread function (PSF):<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>(1+(</mml:mtext><mml:msqrt><mml:mtext>2</mml:mtext></mml:msqrt><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>PSF</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mtext>/</mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mtext>))</mml:mtext><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟨</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In all instances presented here, σ<sub>PSF</sub> is taken to be 30 nm for the sake of this calculation. At radii much larger than σ<sub>PSF</sub>, this factor simply corrects for the fact that correlated pixels in C(r, θ) are contributing to the average over angles, so the number of independent measurements is less than the number of pixels contributing to the average. At short radii, blurring over the super-resolved point spread function also decreases the amplitude of correlations directly, so there is additional under-estimation of variance by the simple angular average method. This correction factor is applied to simulations of blurred randomly distributed points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5b</xref>.</p><p>This multiplicative correction factor of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref> over-estimates the error when the super-resolved point spread function is not well sampled.

This can be corrected further by subtracting a term that depends on the number of observations of each single color label (N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>), the number of labeled proteins in the image (n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub>), and the size of the super-resolved point spread function (σ<sub>PSF</sub>):<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:msqrt><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The pre-factor on this correction term represents how well the area occupied by all probes (4πσ<sub>PSF</sub><sup>2</sup>n) is sampled by pairs of localizations of that color (N<sup>2</sup>). This term becomes negligible when there are many localizations per probe in either channel, as is typical in the fixed cell measurements presented here. For this reason it does not contribute significantly to the results presented. The number of labeled proteins in each channel (n1 and n2) is estimated by fitting the autocorrelation to extract the density of independent objects using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> above and then multiplying this number by the area of the region of interest. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5c</xref> shows that dC<sub>1</sub>(r) is sufficient to describe the simulation-to-simulation variation when objects are sampled 20 times, which is typical of the images investigated in this work. When sampling is lower, this correction is needed to more accurately estimate the the simulation-to-simulation variation as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5d</xref>. The Gaussian shape of this correction is estimated from simulations and may not apply in all contexts.</p><p>In the majority of cases where correlation functions are presented within figures, the values plotted are averaged together across cells of the same treatment and condition to obtain the average correlation function, and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean between cells. The number of cells going into each average is shown in figure captions and figure supplements and, with the exception of the primary cell experiments, includes at least two biological replicates where samples were prepared for imaging on separate days. In all cases we have examined closely, the average error estimated from a single measurement of the cross-correlation function is close to the width of the distribution of single cell cross-correlation values, indicating that the observed variation is dominated by counting statistics and not more systematic differences between cells within the population. Examples demonstrating this point are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Steady-state cross-correlation and step-size analysis in live cells</title><p>Cross-correlations from live cells were calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stone and Veatch, 2015</xref>), where the time evolution of the cross correlation was used to better specify the instantaneous cross-correlation. In brief, cross-correlation functions were computed on a frame-by frame basis from localizations in each channel that occurred in the same frame or in frames separated by a time delay τ. Cross-correlations between frames with time separation of up to 50 frames (0 s &lt; τ &lt; 1 s) did not decay significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) and were therefore averaged to obtain a steady-state cross-correlation for data collected in a time window between 0 and 6 min after clustering with streptavidin. Long-range gradients in labeling density arise in live-cell data because labeled molecules continually diffuse onto the ventral membrane from the dorsal membrane during the imaging experiment. The dorsal membrane is outside the reach of TIRF illumination and away from the high laser power that both converts probes to a fluorescent 'off' state and slowly bleaches them. Therefore, probes near the edges of the cell footprint are more likely to reside in a fluorescent 'on' state, and as a result these areas are more densely sampled. To compensate for the effects of this long-range structure on our measurement, we normalize steady-state cross-correlations by the cross-correlation function of the masked average images from each channel which are first convoluted with a two-dimensional Gaussian function with σ = 1 µm. This treatment filters structure larger than 1 µm in size from the steady-state cross-correlation function.</p><p>For step-size analysis, single molecule trajectories were constructed from super-resolution localizations using a tracking algorithm that searches for localizations within 500 nm in subsequent frames and terminates ambiguous trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shelby et al., 2013</xref>). The step size distribution for BCR-correlated probes is calculated by finding all instances of probe localization within 100 nm of a simultaneous BCR localization, and comparing that position to the location of the probe in immediately preceding and subsequent frames. These step sizes were compiled over tens of thousands of frames from multiple single-cell experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Calcium measurements</title><p>For measurements of calcium mobilization following BCR clustering and activation, 5 million CH27 cells were loaded with 2 µg/mL Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen) for 5 min at room temperature in 1 mL BSS buffer with 0.25 mM sulfinpyrazone.

Total band intensities were normalized by corresponding actin band intensities for each lane.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Plasma membrane vesicle isolation and measurement</title><p>For probe partitioning measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) were made from adherent rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3, ATCC CRL-2256; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0591">CVCL_0591</ext-link>) using established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumgart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Veatch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2013</xref>) with minor modifications. Prior to GPMV isolation, adherent cells were labeled with either 2 µg/mL CTxB conjugated to Alexa 647 (Invitrogen) for 10 min at room temperature or 3 µg/mL DiD C<sub>16</sub> (Invitrogen) in 0.03% methanol for 10 min at room temperature. When both DiD and CTxB were imaged, CTxB conjugated to Alexa 555 (Invitrogen) was used. Cells were rinsed and incubated in a buffer containing dithiothreitol (DTT; 2 mM) and formaldehyde (25 mM) in the presence of calcium (2 mM) at 37°C for 2 hr with gentle rocking. GPMVs were harvested and imaged at low temperature between two coverslips on a home built temperature-controlled stage as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Veatch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2013</xref>). Vesicles were imaged on a separate IX81 inverted microscope (Olympus) using epifluorescence illumination with a Cy3 filter set (Chroma) for CTxB Alexa 555 and a Cy5 filter-set (Chroma) for DiD C<sub>16</sub>. Images were captured on a Neo SCMOS camera (Andor). The partitioning of eGFP-GG and YFP-TM were examined by imaging GPMVs harvested from cells transiently expressing these constructs using a GFP filter cube (Chroma). DiD C<sub>16</sub> was used as a phase marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To examine PM anchor phase partitioning, GPMVs were prepared from cells expressing PM-eGFP as described above except with 4 mM glutathione substituted for DTT as the reducing agent. Glutathione was used as a reducing agent in these measurements because it is not cell permeable and therefore is not expected to directly impact the palmitoylation state of the PM peptide, whereas some reducing agents have been found to perturb protein palmitoylation in GPMVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levental et al., 2010</xref>). We note that GPMVs prepared using glutathione have lower transition temperatures and a larger surface fraction of ordered phase than GPMVs prepared using DTT. Due to the low phase separation temperature of vesicles prepared in this manner, 6 µM hexadecanol was added to raise the phase separation temperature to about 1°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Machta et al., 2016</xref>) so that phase separated vesicles could be observed. GPMVs were imaged as described above.</p><p>To examine how the surface fraction of ordered and disordered phases varies with acute cholesterol variation, adherent CH27 cells were first pre-treated with either 10 mM MβCD or 10 mM MβCD pre-complexed with cholesterol for 10 min. Cells were then labeled with 2 µg/ml DiI-C<sub>12</sub> (Invitrogen) in 0.02% methanol for 10 min at room temperature and GPMVs were prepared and imaged as described above using DTT as the reducing agent. Fewer vesicles were obtained in MβCD or MβCD-chol pretreated cells than in untreated cells, likely because treated cells were less adherent.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Simulations of receptors, kinases, and phosphatases in a heterogeneous membrane</title><p>A conserved order parameter 2D Ising model was simulated on a 256 by 256 square lattice as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Machta et al., 2011</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, components that prefer ordered or disordered regions are represented as pixels that have value of S = +1 and S = -1 respectively. The vast majority of +1 and −1 pixels represent unspecified membrane components (proteins and lipids). In addition, 50 pixels with values of +1 are classified as receptors, 100 pixels with values +1 are classified as kinases, and 100 pixels with values −1 are classified as phosphatases. Receptors are clustered by applying a strong attractive circular field (φ<sup>R</sup>) at the center of the simulation frame that only acts on receptors. The final Hamiltonian is given by:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Φ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The first term sums over the four nearest neighbors (j) surrounding the pixel i and applies to all components.

When an ordered domain is stabilized in the absence of receptor clustering, a similar Hamiltonian is used with an applied field that is felt by all membrane components.

The magnitude of this field was chosen to be equal to a single interaction between components, which is one in these units. This magnitude is sufficient to stabilize a robust domain containing ordered components but does not restrict the motions of individual components within the domain.</p><p>At each update, two random pixels are chosen, the energy cost or gain for exchanging the two pixels is calculated, and the move is either accepted or rejected using a Monte Carlo algorithm that maintains detailed balance. If the resulting configuration is lower or equal in energy, the exchange is always accepted. If the energy is raised, the exchange is accepted stochastically with probability exp(−β∆H) where β is the inverse temperature and ΔH is the change in energy between initial and final states. In this scheme, the critical point occurs at T<sub>C</sub> = 2/ln(1+sqrt(2)). All simulations were run at T = 1.05 × T<sub>C</sub>. One pixel is chosen to represent a 2 nm by 2 nm patch of membrane, so that the correlation length varies with temperature in simulations with equal fractions of ordered and disordered components as observed in experimental observations in isolated plasma membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Veatch et al., 2008</xref>). Most simulations were run such that there were an equal fraction of ordered and disordered unspecified membrane components. In some cases, the fraction of unspecified membrane compositions assigned to be ordered was varied, as indicated in Figure captions. Uniform simulations were run by setting all unspecified membrane components to be disordered.</p><p>One sweep corresponds to the option to exchange each of the pixels on average twice (256<sup>2</sup> pixel swaps are proposed). All simulations are initially run using non-local exchanges to decrease equilibration times. For simulations recording receptor phosphorylation state, exchanges were then restricted to nearest neighbors in order to better mimic diffusive dynamics. Simulation sweeps are converted to time assuming a diffusion coefficient of roughly 4 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, with one sweep corresponding to roughly 1 μs. Most simulations were recorded for 1000 sweeps which corresponds to roughly 1 s.</p><p>If a move is accepted that places a receptor neighboring a kinase, then the receptor is phosphorylated at a low probability (0.1%). If a move is accepted that places a receptor neighboring a phosphatase, then the receptor is dephosphorylated at a high probability (100%). These probabilities are chosen to produce a low level of phosphorylation in simulations that contain an equal number of kinases and phosphatases with unclustered receptors. Higher probability of dephosphorylation is physiologically relevant because phosphatases such as CD45 are expressed in the plasma membranes of lymphocytes at several-fold higher densities than Src kinases (e.g. T cells express between 100,000 and 500,000 CD45 molecules and between 40,000 and 120,000 Lck molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olszowy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hui and Vale, 2014</xref>). In some simulations, receptors have kinase behavior when they are phosphorylated. In this case, a move that places a phosphorylated receptor next to a second receptor results in the second receptor becoming phosphorylated at a low probability (0.1%).</p><p>To mimic the experimental limitation of finite lateral resolution, cross-correlation functions between receptors and membrane components were also tabulated from simulation snapshots that were first filtered with a Gaussian shaped point spread function with the indicated width. This is equivalent to convolving the raw two dimensional C(r, θ) with the autocorrelation of the point spread function g<sub>PSF</sub>(r) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>All analyses were carried out in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Arup Chakraborty (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Michael L Dustin (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have developed a set of mEos probes that show a preference for liquid ordered or liquid disordered lipid phases in giant plasma membrane vesicles. They have expressed these in a B cell in CH27 and allowed these cells to spontaneously adhere to glass surfaces. They perform super-resolution microscopy on the location of the probes in the presence or absence of BCR or cholera toxin binding site cross linking and establish very nice cross correlations between the organic dyes associated with the cross-linked surface receptors and the mEos probes. They find that the LO associated probes correlated with the BCR or CT clusters, whereas the TM, GG or CD45 TM based probes are anti correlated. They develop a model to explain BCR signalling in response to BCR cross linking in terms of phase separation of Src family kinases and CD45 at sites of BCR cross linking induced local lipid phase separation. They demonstrate that these effects are present in primary B cells and robust to the fixation taking place at 37 degrees.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that these results represent the 'first direct visualization of both ordered and disordered domains in intact cells that resemble liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases in model membranes'. However, this does not appear to be the case as nearly all the findings presented here were published using fluorescence resonance energy transfer in living cells to follow the association of the BCR with membrane probes with time after BCR clustering (please see Sohn et al. 2006 PNAS; Sohn et al. 2008 J. Cell Biol.; and Tolar et al. 2005 Nat. Immunol.). In fact, the superresolution imaging is less well suited to the analysis as interactions of the BCRs with lipids are highly dynamic and as opposed to live cell imaging in which the association of the BCRs with lipids can be followed continuously the authors provide data for only two time points. For this manuscript to be considered for publication the authors would need to review the literature on this subject and make it clear what their novel contribution is.</p><p>Addressing this does not require new experiments, but a more explicit effort to put the work in context and clarify the novel aspects.</p><p>2) Making the case for partitioning into or out of lipid domains. In general, the work looks carefully performed. But as the authors admit, the spatial enrichment or depletion is subtle (20% quoted in the text). Thus, arguments validating the results could be stronger and the explanation improved. The results would be more convincing if validated using a structure that displays unambiguous co-localization on a 100 nm length scale.</p><p>A) Most of the images do not show what one would visually consider to be striking co-localization into the same domain and the &quot;selected&quot; boxes for magnification of this co-localization seem to be the minority of the field. The cross-relation function does not require precise overlap, but explores proximity, with correlations falling of at ~200 nm. Why they are not more precisely overlapped may require some explanation. For example, is this a consequence of photoactivation of limited number of fluorophores? How many fluorophores are being imaged in these &quot;spots&quot;? How did the authors define the time and number of fluorophores for activation?</p><p>B) Does the density of fluorophores affect the analysis? The image density looks quite variable. E.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>. Can the authors do a test of various density to determine if this does not affect correlation functions?</p><p>C) It would be useful to validate the method and the scale with a control that one knows is precisely co-localized. A good one might be to transfect cells with two photoactivatable versions (different colors) of the clathrin HC which should precisely co-localize in coated pits.</p><p>D) It would be useful to show all of the dual color images in the supplement. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> show one pair of two or three that were tested in each panel. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, no CD45 image is shown. Seems easy to show all images in a supplement.</p><p>E) The cell-to-cell variable looks considerable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) with some cells not showing effects at all. Is this a concern for interpretation? I would show this cell-by-cell data for all experiments in the paper, not just <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. It would also be good to categorize the variation in the cross-correlation function from cell to cell (e.g. a mean and variance between cells), rather than merge the data together. Also, it was not clear to me whether these were from cells on the same day or from completely different labeling and cell culture set ups. N =2 was described in the Methods, except for primary cells. I would add this info to the figure legends and also increase the N for the primary cells. Also in many cases the number of cells analyzed seems low, given that one can acquire a reasonable number super-resolution images of cells in one day (I would think more than 20 cells would be possible, especially as there are probably more than one cell in a field of view.).</p><p>F) It would be good to have some additional controls. As a computational control, can one randomize the positions of the clusters and then reanalyze? One would expect this to produce a flat correlation of 1. Probably true but would be nice to see. Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, it would be good to do imaging/analysis of the cholera toxin and peptides { ± } streptavidin (i.e. with and without streptavidin mediated clustering.</p><p>G) The authors comment that the co-clustering and exclusion effects are weak- on the order of 20%. However, this is not what the images look like- where the segregation appears to be 100%. The authors should present LUTs maps with the probe/receptor densities indicated against the color scale. Its assumed that this will explain the discrepancy. Some supplemental figures should be presented with the relevant signal presented in full range linear grey scale to show that &quot;actual&quot; surface densities with the actual level of co-clustering of segregation in BCR clusters indicated (perhaps the BCR cluster regions could be circles as they may not be as visible as in the contrast boosted versions. This will be helpful to general readers to understand why this issue has been so difficult to solve. If the CD45 exclusion is only &lt;20% as suggested by the authors, then they should mention that biochemical analysis of 2D reaction from Hui et al., which they cite for different reasons, are consistent with quantitative effects of CD45 exclusion.</p><p>The most important new experiment suggested here is the control based on clathrin coated pits to demonstrate co-localization. The TM probe used by the authors may also be excluded from clathrin coated pits, although this will be a quantitative effect as it can be overcome by a clathrin pit localisation signal in the cytoplasm domain, but potentially also useful to validate that approach. The other points here are mostly related to analysis of existing data or better explanation, which should also be addressed as completely as possible.</p><p>2) Functional data</p><p>A) The main &quot;functional&quot; data is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. However, these experiments are not tied into the earlier part of the paper to see if these cholesterol agents indeed alter correlated or anti-correlated distributions.</p><p>B) An effect on calcium signaling for the cholesterol agents is shown in supplement. Calcium signaling changes might result from general membrane changes and not BCR signaling specifically. Other markers of BCR signaling should be checked (e.g. phosphomarkers). Also, some parameter of &quot;cell health&quot; should be checked as well using these agents to make sure there are no drastic global effects.</p><p>C) Regarding the Cholera Toxin affect on Calcium signaling (although a more minor point in the paper). It looks like many cells are not changing their calcium levels. Can this cell to cell variability be checked? Also, is there a good control- e.g. another lipid binding protein or extracellular Fab antibody to ascertain whether this effect is really due to lipid clustering?</p><p>Experiments to demonstrate that the cholesterol altering treatments actually change the image correlations would be important to demonstrate a stronger correlation with function.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Protein sorting by lipid phase-like domains supports emergent signaling function in B lymphocyte plasma membranes&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Arup Chakraborty (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>One of the reviewers had a remaining concern about the geranylgeranyl reporter. In the first figure you appear to discredit it as a reliable and accurate marker of lipid ordered phase-like domains (with an unsubstantiated explanation of electrostatic interactions). However, you then go on to treat it as a valid tool in subsequent figures, but again with complicated explanations. The GG reporter is usually a back-up for the TM reporter. Since the GG reporter failed in the CTxB tests in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> perhaps it is better to remove it and this would streamline the paper. The GG probe and variants of it could be the subject of a future study that dissects the acidic lipid hypothesis, which is interesting, but here just a distraction.</p><p>Subsection “Phase-like domains observed in intact B cells”, end of fifth paragraph: &quot;…suggesting the probe expression impacts the mixing properties of the plasma membrane as a whole&quot; This is not addressed further, but the two reviewers wonder how probe expression might be influencing many findings in the paper and this deserves some comment. One specific issue is that in most images, the PM, TM and CD45 probes appear to be in non-percolating, finite clusters and perhaps collectively cover &lt;10% of the area. If both PM and TM probes appear to be in clusters, is there a percolating phase and which phase is this? The modelling certainly incorporates this concept, but how does the imaging, which usually shows isolated clusters relate to the modelled areas.

However, this does not appear to be the case as nearly all the findings presented here were published using fluorescence resonance energy transfer in living cells to follow the association of the BCR with membrane probes with time after BCR clustering (please see Sohn et al. 2006 PNAS; Sohn et al. 2008 J. Cell Biol.; and Tolar et al. 2005 Nat. Immunol.). In fact, the superresolution imaging is less well suited to the analysis as interactions of the BCRs with lipids are highly dynamic and as opposed to live cell imaging in which the association of the BCRs with lipids can be followed continuously the authors provide data for only two time points. For this manuscript to be considered for publication the authors would need to review the literature on this subject and make it clear what their novel contribution is.</italic></p><p><italic>Addressing this does not require new experiments, but a more explicit effort to put the work in context and clarify the novel aspects.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and we have made changes to the text, mainly in the Introduction and conclusions sections, in an effort to better place our work in the context of existing literature and define our novel contribution. Specifically, in the Introduction we describe in more detail how FRET has been used to investigate membrane heterogeneity in general and briefly discuss a few relevant drawbacks of FRET techniques:</p><p>“Some of the strongest experimental evidence supporting a heterogeneous plasma membrane comes from Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements between membrane components. […] This approach allows us to characterize and quantify, in a model-independent manner, the spatial organization of membrane components on length scales between those accessible by FRET-based techniques and conventional optical microscopy.”</p><p>We also describe the previous evidence from FRET experiments that association with ordered lipids is important for BCR signaling in particular:</p><p>“A third model, which is the focus of investigation here, postulates that clustering BCR acts to stabilize an ordered membrane domain that impacts the receptor-proximal distribution of regulatory proteins involved in initiating or modulating the resulting cellular response. […] Currently, the role of membrane domains in BCR signaling remains a topic of active investigation (Pierce and Liu 2010; Horejsi and Hrdinka 2014) as the field works to put together a more holistic picture of how interactions between proteins and lipids could support signaling function.”</p><p>We place this theory in the context of other theories of the mechanism of BCR activation in this paragraph of the Introduction. In the last paragraph of the Introduction, we have also expanded upon the description of our novel contribution and have added substantial text to the Conclusions section that addresses this point.</p><p>We now also include citations of Sohn et al. 2006 and 2008 in the discussion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in the Results and Discussion and mention that although transient association between BCR and ordered lipid markers was observed in these FRET measurements, BCR cross-correlations with the PM lipid probe appear to be sustained at least over the 1 to 5 min time window that we probe in these experiments:</p><p>“The direct measurements of peptide sorting shown here are generally consistent with past FRET and biochemical isolation measurements that argued that clustered BCR resides within ordered membrane domains (Cheng et al. 1999; Pierce 2002; Sohn et al. 2006; Sohn et al. 2008b). The association between clustered BCR and the ordered domain marker PM appears more sustained in our imaging measurements than was observed in past reports using FRET (Sohn et al. 2006; Sohn et al. 2008b), possibly due to the different length-scales probed by these methods.”</p><p><italic>2) Making the case for partitioning into or out of lipid domains. In general, the work looks carefully performed. But as the authors admit, the spatial enrichment or depletion is subtle (20% quoted in the text). Thus, arguments validating the results could be stronger and the explanation improved. The results would be more convincing if validated using a structure that displays unambiguous co-localization on a 100 nm length scale.</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript contains a much more extensive discussion of our methods and analysis of the error present in our measurements, and we hope that this will aid readers in interpreting the data. To this end, content has been added to the Materials and methods section including a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and we have also added numerous figure supplements, specified below. As an additional validation of our imaging and analysis methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> includes data from a positive control experiment suggested by reviewers where clathrin was labeled in two color channels by double-transfection with two different clathrin heavy chain fluorescent fusion constructs. This exogenous fluorescent clathrin is incorporated into the same clathrin-coated pit structures and is clearly co-localized in super-resolution images and according to our cross-correlation analysis.</p><p><italic>A) Most of the images do not show what one would visually consider to be striking co-localization into the same domain and the &quot;selected&quot; boxes for magnification of this co-localization seem to be the minority of the field. The cross-relation function does not require precise overlap, but explores proximity, with correlations falling of at ~200 nm. Why they are not more precisely overlapped may require some explanation. For example, is this a consequence of photoactivation of limited number of fluorophores? How many fluorophores are being imaged in these &quot;spots&quot;? How did the authors define the time and number of fluorophores for activation?</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that a visual interpretation of the super-resolution images can seem to contradict the results of the cross-correlation analysis in some cases, but we feel that this is primarily due to the inherent difficulty in interpreting these poorly sampled pointillistic images by eye. In our case, many of the clusters lack of apparent overlap with membrane probes because the underlying distributions of the membrane probe do not sample all space. That is, the labeling density of the membrane probe is sparse compared to the spatial resolution of the measurement. This is mainly due to limits of expression of this exogenous probe. In conventional fluorescence microscopy images, unless labeling density is very low, typically structures are sampled at a density higher than the resolution of the measurement. In other words, labeling density is higher than 1/(250nm)^2 and the labeling of structures appears continuous. This is often not the case for super-resolution microscopy images because the lateral resolution is considerably better. As a result, especially if labels are more or less randomly distributed across the membrane as is the case for the lipid probes, the images give the visual impression that the labels are self-clustered in domains. In fact, individual labels, which are over-counted, are separated from each other by distances greater than the resolution of the measurement but their distribution is still close to random. This can be more easily seen if fixed-cell super resolution images are compared to live cell super-resolution images (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and Figure 2—figure supplement 11). The distributions of lipid probes appear more uniform in live cell measurements because probes are mobile and allowed to sample more lateral space as they reversibly blink on and off, but the cross-correlation curves show nearly the same relative distributions between BCR and lipid probes as in fixed cells. To help illustrate this idea we have also included a figure supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), which shows that decreasing probe density impacts the visual impression of apparent co-localization as well as statistical variation in the correlation function, but does not change the average cross-correlation function.</p><p>The width of the cross-correlation mentioned by the reviewers is determined by the size of the correlated structures, in this case protein clusters and associated membrane domains. The fall-off of the cross-correlation function is gradual because it is an average measurement of all clusters over multiple cells and there can be a range of cluster sizes sampled, and also because the structures are blurred by the limited resolution of the measurement.</p><p><italic>B) Does the density of fluorophores affect the analysis? The image density looks quite variable. E.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>. Can the authors do a test of various density to determine if this does not affect correlation functions?</italic></p><p>As mentioned above, the apparent difference in the density of PM labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> vs. 2C in particular is mostly due to the fact that the cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> was imaged live and the cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> was imaged fixed. In both cases individual mEos3.2 labels are localized multiple times because the probe blinks reversibly. In the case of the live cell, PM-mEos3.2 labels diffuse around the cell footprint as they are imaged, and also exchange between the top and bottom surfaces of the cell. As a result a greater fraction of the cell footprint in “filled in” by PM-mEos3.2 localizations, leading to the impression of a more uniform distribution of mEos3.2 and higher density.</p><p>However, the reviewer is correct that there was a range of labeling densities for the lipid probe in these images due to variation in the expression level of the transfected probe. We find that there are subtle correlations between lipid probe density and the value of the cross-correlation and present this analysis in figure supplements <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>C) It would be useful to validate the method and the scale with a control that one knows is precisely co-localized. A good one might be to transfect cells with two photoactivatable versions (different colors) of the clathrin HC which should precisely co-localize in coated pits.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and think that inclusion of this positive control has improved the clarity of the manuscript. We performed this experiment by co-transfecting HeLa cells with clathrin heavy chain fluorescent constructs and show the super-resolution data and analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. These two orthogonally labeled populations of clathrin are highly cross-correlated by our analysis. STORM images obtained from this data appear highly colocalized in clathrin pits of characteristic size, as expected from previous work. This control data is discussed in detail in the Materials and methods section under the heading “Cross-correlation analysis in chemically fixed cells”.</p><p><italic>D) It would be useful to show all of the dual color images in the supplement. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> show one pair of two or three that were tested in each panel. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, no CD45 image is shown. Seems easy to show all images in a supplement.</italic></p><p>We have added figure supplements that show representative super-resolution images for conditions included in cross-correlation curves but not shown in the main figures. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref> shows representative images for CTxB clusters with GG, CTxB clusters with TM, and TM clusters with GG. New figure supplements include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>, Figure 2—figure supplement 11, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>E) The cell-to-cell variable looks considerable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) with some cells not showing effects at all. Is this a concern for interpretation? I would show this cell-by-cell data for all experiments in the paper, not just <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. It would also be good to categorize the variation in the cross-correlation function from cell to cell (e.g. a mean and variance between cells), rather than merge the data together. Also, it was not clear to me whether these were from cells on the same day or from completely different labeling and cell culture set ups. N =2 was described in the Methods, except for primary cells. I would add this info to the figure legends and also increase the N for the primary cells. Also in many cases the number of cells analyzed seems low, given that one can acquire a reasonable number super-resolution images of cells in one day (I would think more than 20 cells would be possible, especially as there are probably more than one cell in a field of view.).</italic></p><p>To clarify the sample sizes analyzed in imaging experiments, we now state the number of cells included in average cross-correlation curves in the corresponding figure captions and figure supplements. We have also modified the statement in the Materials and methods regarding biological replicates:</p><p>“The number of cells going into each average is shown in figure captions or figure supplements and, with the exception of the primary cell experiment, includes at least two biological replicates where samples were prepared on separate days.”</p><p>We have also characterized the cell-to-cell variation in the cross-correlation function as well as the sources of error present in individual cross-correlation functions much more completely than in the previous version of the manuscript. First, we have developed a better estimate of the variance of an individual cross-correlation measurement derived from a single cell by estimating the total number of independent objects (labeled proteins of interest) in our data using the auto-correlation function. The methodology used for this estimate is described in detail in new additions to the Materials and methods under the headings “Over-counting and estimating protein/peptide surface densities” and “Variance of cross-correlation measurements”, and is shown graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>.</p><p>To better capture the cell-to-cell variation present in the imaging data, we have also included several new figure supplements. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, we plot distributions of C(r&lt;25nm) values from individual cells that are included in the CTxB clustering and BCR clustering experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and 2. We show that the width of these distributions is well matched by the average of the variances expected from individual measurements. This indicates that the bulk of the variation within average cross-correlations can be attributed to variance due to underlying sampling and number statistics present in individual measurements, rather than cell-to-cell variation. Finally, we now show cross-correlation functions from individual cells for both the BCR cluster data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> as well as the CTxB cluster data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. We feel that these efforts add significantly to the quality of this manuscript.</p><p>In its current form, the manuscript describes 41 distinct super-resolution imaging experiments. For cases where the statistics or other experimental issues warranted (see above), up to 50 cells were imaged for a given condition. This level of scrutiny was not required for all measurements, which is why some observations were probed in ~10 cells. Also, because we have limited access to and expertise in performing experiments involving the use of animals, we were not able to easily repeat the primary cell experiment.</p><p><italic>F) It would be good to have some additional controls. As a computational control, can one randomize the positions of the clusters and then reanalyze? One would expect this to produce a flat correlation of 1. Probably true but would be nice to see. Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, it would be good to do imaging/analysis of the cholera toxin and peptides { ± } streptavidin (i.e. with and without streptavidin mediated clustering.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have incorporated additional computational controls as suggested in a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. In this figure we show simulated data and resulting cross-correlation curves when the molecules in each channel have various distributions, and the two channels also have various relative distributions. Here, we show that whenever the distribution of probes in one channel is random with respect to the other channel, the cross-correlation is flat, equal to 1. This occurs regardless of whether the probes in one or both channels are randomly distributed or clustered. When probes in both channels are co-clustered, however, the cross-correlation function reflects this co-localization.</p><p>As mentioned above, we have now included imaging data where unclustered CTxB is imaged in conjunction with PM, TM, and GG peptides in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>. We briefly discuss these results in the context of unclustered BCR data in the Results and Discussion section:</p><p>“We additionally observed weak PM enrichment and GG depletion around unclusterd BCR in chemically fixed CH27 cells, although the magnitude of this sorting is on the edge of the sensitivity limits of our imaging system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>). […] Improved lateral resolution is needed to systematically investigate the lateral organization of receptors and peptides in intact cells without receptor clustering, and may be enabled by recent improvements in fluorophores and imaging modalities (Huang et al. 2013; Grimm et al. 2015; Grimm et al. 2016).”</p><p><italic>G) The authors comment that the co-clustering and exclusion effects are weak- on the order of 20%. However, this is not what the images look like- where the segregation appears to be 100%. The authors should present LUTs maps with the probe/receptor densities indicated against the color scale. Its assumed that this will explain the discrepancy. Some supplemental figures should be presented with the relevant signal presented in full range linear grey scale to show that &quot;actual&quot; surface densities with the actual level of co-clustering of segregation in BCR clusters indicated (perhaps the BCR cluster regions could be circles as they may not be as visible as in the contrast boosted versions. This will be helpful to general readers to understand why this issue has been so difficult to solve.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and we have included colorbars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> in order to show the number of raw localizations in the image more plainly. We would also like to point out that the number of localizations of fluorophore tagging the BCR does not correspond to the density of BCR, rather the number of localizations will scale with the experimental parameters including choices of buffer, number of frames observed, and specific fluorophore used. Here, we estimate the overall density of the unclustered mEos3.2 probe using image autocorrelation analysis, however, this analysis provides an underestimate of the BCR-Atto655 density due to the clustering of BCR. This is now discussed explicitly in a new section of Materials and methods under the heading “Over-counting and estimating protein/peptide surface densities”. As explained in response to A) above, it can be difficult to judge the extent of co-localization in these images by eye because the distributions of proteins of interest under-sample space. This is also the reason why even distributions of probes that are not clustered appear punctate.</p><p><italic>If the CD45 exclusion is only &lt;20% as suggested by the authors, then they should mention that biochemical analysis of 2D reaction from Hui et al., which they cite for different reasons, are consistent with quantitative effects of CD45 exclusion.</italic></p><p>This is an interesting point and a good opportunity to discuss our results in the context of concentration differences that might significantly impact signaling. Hui et al. (Nat. Struct. and Molec. Bio. 2014) showed that, in a reconstituted system, that the phosphorylation state of the CD3ζ subunit of the T cell receptor is “ultrasensitive” to changes in the relative concentrations of Lck and CD45 and displays switch-like behavior in the transition from the inactive to active states at physiological concentrations of both enzymes. They also showed that perturbations that alter the spatial organization of CD3ζ and/or Lck such as receptor clustering could alter the “switch” concentrations at which CD3ζ becomes phosphorylated. We observe not only a depletion of CD45 but also an enrichment of Lyn co-localized with BCR clusters, and if we observe a 20% increase in Lyn due to its lipid anchor and a 20% decrease in CD45 concentrations within BCR domains, this amounts to a 50% change overall in the ratio of Lyn to CD45 attributable to lipid-driven sorting. If we draw a direct analogy with the cooperativity observed in the Lck/CD45/CD3ζ system, a 50% change in Lck/CD45 ratio could at most increase the total fraction of activated BCR by 20%. This difference very well may be sufficient for surpassing some signaling threshold for cell activation, and additional mechanisms of positive feedback (e.g. local regulation of Lyn activity) could amplify the effect.</p><p>We now discuss our results in the context of the Hui et al. paper in the Results and Discussion section:</p><p>“It is reasonable to expect that the ~50% increase in the ratio of Lyn to CD45 due to sorting by ordered domains could cause a significant change in BCR phosphorylation levels if we compare to results obtained for the related T cell receptor (TCR) system. […] Additionally, the actual enrichment and depletion of probes around BCR and CTxB is larger than the measured values presented here since the real spatial distributions are convolved with the finite resolution of the measurement to give the observed cross-correlations.”</p><p><italic>The most important new experiment suggested here is the control based on clathrin coated pits to demonstrate co-localization. The TM probe used by the authors may also be excluded from clathrin coated pits, although this will be a quantitative effect as it can be overcome by a clathrin pit localisation signal in the cytoplasm domain, but potentially also useful to validate that approach. The other points here are mostly related to analysis of existing data or better explanation, which should also be addressed as completely as possible.</italic></p><p>As explained in C) above, we performed the 2-color clathrin control experiment and now show this data both as a validation of our imaging and analysis methods and as a demonstrative example to better explain the method for readers who may not be familiar with super-resolution techniques.</p><p>We hope that the addition of the clathrin control experiment, additions of new data, simulations, and discussion in response to the specific comments above, and our efforts to clarify data analysis methodology with the inclusion of the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, as well as substantial expansion of the Materials and methods will sufficiently validate our approach in the eyes of the reviewers.</p><p><italic>2) Functional data</italic></p><p><italic>A) The main &quot;functional&quot; data is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. However, these experiments are not tied into the earlier part of the paper to see if these cholesterol agents indeed alter correlated or anti-correlated distributions.</italic></p><p>We agree that showing the effects of cholesterol perturbations on BCR/lipid probe cross-correlations would greatly strengthen the connection between the predictions of the model and the effects of cholesterol perturbation on Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in B cells, and we thank the reviewer for encouraging us to conduct this measurement. We performed super resolution imaging experiments where CH27 cells were subjected to cholesterol perturbations and the cross-correlation between clustered BCR and the PM lipid probe was measured. These data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> of the revised manuscript. Our results indicate that cholesterol addition lowers the cross-correlation between BCR and PM, whereas cholesterol removal increases the cross-correlation between BCR and PM. These experimental results are in qualitative agreement with cross-correlation curves generated from simulations where the surface fraction of ordered vs. disordered components was varied, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>B) An effect on calcium signaling for the cholesterol agents is shown in supplement. Calcium signaling changes might result from general membrane changes and not BCR signaling specifically. Other markers of BCR signaling should be checked (e.g. phosphomarkers). Also, some parameter of &quot;cell health&quot; should be checked as well using these agents to make sure there are no drastic global effects.</italic></p><p>We performed viability experiments on cells treated with cholesterol agents to ensure that the effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization that we observed are not attributable to destabilization of the cell membrane alone. We subjected CH27 cells to the same cholesterol perturbations that were used in Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization experiments and used Annexin V labeling of the outer membrane as a marker for PS exposure that occurs during apoptosis. We find no significant differences in membrane binding of Annexin V following treatment of cells with cholesterol agents, indicating that the viability of these cells is not compromised by the cholesterol perturbations used for experiments. These data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> of the revised manuscript. We also conducted western blots using the 4G10 anti-pY antibody in cells with cholesterol perturbations as a second functional assay of BCR signaling. In our hands, these measurements were highly variable and a meaningful trend did not emerge in this large background, therefore were not included in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>C) Regarding the Cholera Toxin affect on Calcium signaling (although a more minor point in the paper). It looks like many cells are not changing their calcium levels. Can this cell to cell variability be checked? Also, is there a good control- e.g. another lipid binding protein or extracellular Fab antibody to ascertain whether this effect is really due to lipid clustering?</italic></p><p>We have altered this figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> of the revised manuscript) in order to show the standard deviation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response of individual cells following CTxB clustering in addition to the average Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. Instead of plotting all of the individual cell traces, which may have obscured the dynamics of individual cells, we also chose to plot a few selected Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces that represent the variation in individual cell responses. To further explore the signaling response in B cells initiated by CTxB, we have also performed western blotting experiments that probed protein phosphorylation following CTxB binding and clustering. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> of the revised manuscript and show that several of the same targets that are phosphorylated as a result of BCR stimulation, including BCR itself, Lyn, and Syk, are also phosphorylated as a result of CTxB clustering. This complements the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, which shows that ordered domains induced by CTxB clusters sort BCR signaling partners and provide an environment that promotes protein phosphorylation, including activation of Lyn kinase. It also complements the new simulations added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> showing that formation of an ordered domain alone is sufficient to cause BCR activation. We feel that the new data and simulations strengthen our conclusion that CTxB clustering, through formation of an ordered domain, creates a local environment that favors BCR activation.</p><p><italic>Experiments to demonstrate that the cholesterol altering treatments actually change the image correlations would be important to demonstrate a stronger correlation with function.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this feedback and have performed the experiments suggested, as detailed in A), above. We have also performed additional functional experiments to expand on existing data, as well as controls testing cell viability. We hope that these changes clarify and strengthen the arguments made in the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>One of the reviewers had a remaining concern about the geranylgeranyl reporter. In the first figure you appear to discredit it as a reliable and accurate marker of lipid ordered phase-like domains (with an unsubstantiated explanation of electrostatic interactions). However, you then go on to treat it as a valid tool in subsequent figures, but again with complicated explanations. The GG reporter is usually a back-up for the TM reporter. Since the GG reporter failed in the CTxB tests in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> perhaps it is better to remove it and this would streamline the paper. The GG probe and variants of it could be the subject of a future study that dissects the acidic lipid hypothesis, which is interesting, but here just a distraction.</italic></p><p>We agree that the inclusion of the GG data complicates the story without substantially adding to the manuscript. As suggested, we have removed these results from the manuscript except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Here, we feel it adds by showing recruitment of a disordered marker to the TM clusters, showing that lipid probe recruitment to disordered clusters is symmetrical but opposite to recruitment of lipid probes to ordered clusters. Unlike BCR or CTxB clusters, we also have no basis to hypothesize that charged lipids are recruited to TM clusters. We do plan on investigating the electrostatic interactions of this probe further and agree that additional experimentation would be required to support the acidic lipid hypothesis surrounding the GG results posed in the previous version.</p><p>Removal of the GG data resulted in modification of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and related supplemental figures, including removal of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> of the previous version of the manuscript, which included cross-correlation functions of BCR with a PH domain. We have also removed two paragraphs from the Results section that provided possible electrostatics-related explanations and context for the GG results. No other substantive changes were made related to the removal of GG data.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Phase-like domains observed in intact B cells”, end of fifth paragraph: &quot;…suggesting the probe expression impacts the mixing properties of the plasma membrane as a whole&quot; This is not addressed further, but the two reviewers wonder how probe expression might be influencing many findings in the paper and this deserves some comment.</italic></p><p>We have now added additional sentences in the text surrounding the discussion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> to directly address this issue:</p><p>“Both the expression-level dependence of probe partitioning and the small size of CTxB and TM clusters impede us from drawing quantitative conclusions regarding the magnitude of enrichment or depletion of peptides into domains. Instead, we draw conclusions regarding whether probes are enriched or depleted within our sensitivity limits which is not impacted by either of these factors.”</p><p>“Again, we find that the expression level of phase sensitive peptides impacts the magnitude but not the sign of peptide partitioning with respect to clustered BCR, allowing us to determine the type of domain stabilized by BCR clusters if not its quantitative composition.”</p><p><italic>One specific issue is that in most images, the PM, TM and CD45 probes appear to be in non-percolating, finite clusters and perhaps collectively cover &lt;10% of the area. If both PM and TM probes appear to be in clusters, is there a percolating phase and which phase is this? The modelling certainly incorporates this concept, but how does the imaging, which usually shows isolated clusters relate to the modelled areas. Do the probes all appear clustered, because like the GG probe, they typically detect at least one other feature, in addition to the lipid order. Or is the appearance of clustering due to membrane topology?</italic></p><p>Thank you for this question that points out a way in which the manuscript was unclear. We have now expanded <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and included a few more comments in the main text to address these issues. We have also recently written a review article that deeply discusses complications that arise in interpreting super-resolution images of membranes including several factors relevant to the points made above. This review article was recently accepted and is now referenced in the revised manuscript.</p><p>First, we cannot comment directly on percolation because our super-resolved images are inherently under-sampled in space. Briefly, the apparent amount of surface area taken up by a peptide probe in super-resolution images is given by its expression level and the resolution of the measurement. This apparent surface fraction does not directly inform the surface fraction taken up by the entire domain or underlying membrane structure that is labeled by the peptide. This is because the labeled peptide is just one of many components that make up the domain, and the average distance between labeled peptides is much larger than the localization precision of the measurement. We now show how this inherent under-sampling of space impacts the visual impression given by reconstructed images and the resulting cross-correlation function within <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. We also added the following text near the beginning of the Results section:</p><p>“We note that the apparent surface area occupied by peptides is likely a vast under-estimate of the surface area occupied by ordered or disordered phase-like domains since peptides are only one of many membrane components that likely occupy these domains, leading to inherent under-sampling of space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).”</p><p>Second, the apparent self-clustering of probes is most likely due to multiple observations of the same fluorophore (over-counting) and not due to any inherent self-clustered structure, with the clear exception of situations where proteins are intentionally clustered such BCR clustered by streptavidin. In these cases where clustering is not enforced, a detailed statistical analysis of our images indicates that each independent labeled protein or peptide is sampled at least 10 times (on average) in a given image, allowing the super-resolved point spread function to be well sampled. While we cannot exclude the possibility that labeled proteins or peptides are not independently distributed due to some strong self-clustering interaction, it is more likely that the appearance of self-clustering comes from multiple observations of the same probe, since we are not attempting to limit the number of times each protein or peptide is observed. In fact, we can be confident that we are observing single BCRs multiple times since we are using a fAb that can bind to multiple sites within single receptors, and multiple fluorophores bind to single fAbs. Also, the fluorophore conjugated to the peptide constructs (mEos3.2) is known to reversibly photo-activate under our imaging conditions, leading to over-counting of mEos3.2 labeled peptides.</p><p>We have added additional text to address this issue early in the main text of the manuscript.</p><p>“In addition, incomplete spatial sampling by fluorescent peptides can give rise to the appearance of peptide self-clustering, since a single mEos3.2 fluorophore can reversibly photo-switch (Endesfelder et al. 2011) and therefore is likely detected multiple times over the course of a measurement (Stone et al. In Press; Veatch et al. 2012).” This concept is addressed in greater detail in Methods and in several figure supplements accompanying <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. As stated above, the manuscript now cites a recently accepted review article by three of the authors that cover these (and other) topics in greater depth.</p><p><italic>The authors should show the real images for CD45 TM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and not in the supplement since this data is important for biological conclusions of the paper.</italic></p><p>We have now added images of BCR/CD45 TM and CTxB CD45 to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.</p><p><italic>In the figure legends describing the simulation results, there should be an explicit description of the white and grey areas.
