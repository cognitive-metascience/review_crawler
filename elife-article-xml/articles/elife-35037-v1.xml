pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35037.001</object-id><p>How multicellular organisms respond to and are impacted by severe hypothermic stress is largely unknown. From <italic>C. elegans</italic> screens for mutants abnormally responding to cold-warming stimuli, we identify a molecular genetic pathway comprising ISY-1, a conserved uncharacterized protein, and ZIP-10, a bZIP-type transcription factor. ISY-1 gatekeeps the ZIP-10 transcriptional program by regulating the microRNA <italic>mir-60</italic>. Downstream of ISY-1 and <italic>mir-60</italic>, <italic>zip-10</italic> levels rapidly and specifically increase upon transient cold-warming exposure. Prolonged <italic>zip-10</italic> up-regulation induces several protease-encoding genes and promotes stress-induced organismic death, or phenoptosis, of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. <italic>zip-10</italic> deficiency confers enhanced resistance to prolonged cold-warming stress, more prominently in adults than larvae. We conclude that the ZIP-10 genetic program mediates cold-warming response and may have evolved to promote wild-population kin selection under resource-limiting and thermal stress conditions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35037.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Life on earth faces constant changes in temperature. Most warm-blooded animals like humans can maintain a fairly stable body temperature, but cold-blooded animals can experience drastic shifts in body temperature.</p><p>For example, the body temperature of the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> can vary greatly depending on its surroundings. This species has evolved an exquisite set of temperature-sensing machineries that can react even to subtle fluctuations, which enables the worm to adjust its behaviour. However, drastic shifts in temperature can cause significant changes within the organism.</p><p>Transient exposure to heat can activate genes that help cells to repair damaged proteins, while cold shock can influence the production of proteins in the cell. Although <italic>C. elegans</italic> can tolerate short periods of stress, an extended exposure to extreme temperatures can kill the worm. Until now, it was not known how <italic>C. elegans</italic> responds to cold shock followed by warmer temperatures, also referred to as cold-warming.</p><p>To address this question, Jiang et al. created random mutations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and isolated the worms that responded to cold-warming differently. The results revealed a molecular pathway that turns on genes in response to cold-warming. Jiang et al. found that two genes and their proteins, ISY-1 and ZIP-10, control which other genes are switched on or off in response to this temperature change.</p><p>When the worms were exposed to cold-warming over a long period, the pathway remained active and many of the worms died, in particular older animals. These findings suggest that this genetic program might have evolved to help younger animals survive better when stress conditions are high and food resources limited.</p><p>More work is needed to explore this new pathway and its implication in the heat-cold shock mechanisms. The affected genes are often the same across different organisms and can therefore be engineered to benefit research and medical applications in unexpected ways. For example, patients suffering a heart attack or brain injury are exposed to colder temperature to prevent the risk of tissue injuries once the blood flow goes back to normal. Therefore, the findings of this study may help us to understand how human cells respond to and are protected by low temperature.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypothermia</kwd><kwd>bZIP transcription factor</kwd><kwd>ISY1 or ISY-1</kwd><kwd>ZIP-10</kwd><kwd>C. elegans screen</kwd><kwd>forward genetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG032435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Yuehua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM117461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Dengke K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pew Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Dengke K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000041</institution-id><institution>American Diabetes Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1–16-IBS-197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Dengke K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Heat shock stimuli activate expression of many heat-shock inducible genes through the sigma-32 factor and the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor HSF (Heat Shock Factor) in bacteria and eukaryotes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomez-Pastor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yura et al., 1993</xref>). Coordinated expression of heat shock-induced chaperone proteins facilitates cellular proteostasis and adaptation to temperature upshift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mahat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Solís et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to heat shock response, how organisms respond to cold shock is still largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Fageeh and Smales, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yenari and Han, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu, 2016</xref>). Although extensive RNA expression profiling studies have identified many protein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs that are regulated by cold shock via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Fageeh and Smales, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giuliodori et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kandror et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), master regulators of cold shock response and cold-regulated genes (counterparts of HSF) have long been elusive and mechanisms of cold shock response in multicellular organisms remain poorly characterized.</p><p>At the organismic level, warm-blooded mammals normally keep body temperature at about 37°C and initiate multiple homeostatic mechanisms to maintain body temperature upon exposure to hypothermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bautista, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morrison, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tansey and Johnson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vriens et al., 2014</xref>). In humans, therapeutic hypothermia (32–34°C) has been widely used to treat ischemic disorders and proposed to activate multifaceted cellular programs to protect against ischemic damages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Polderman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yenari and Han, 2012</xref>). By contrast, cold-blooded animals including most invertebrates experience varying body temperature depending on the environment, but can nonetheless elicit stereotypic behavioral, physiological and transcriptional response to chronic hypothermia or transient cold shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Fageeh and Smales, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garrity et al., 2010</xref>). Like many other types of stress, prolonged severe hypothermia can lead to the death of organisms, in most cases likely because of failure in adapting to the stress, or alternatively through stress-induced phenoptosis, namely genetically programed organismic death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Longo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Skulachev, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2002</xref>). Although phenoptosis has been phenotypically documented in many cases, its evolutionary significance and genetic mechanisms remain unclear and debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Longo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sapolsky, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We previously discovered a <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetic pathway that maintains cell membrane fluidity by regulating lipid desaturation in response to moderate hypothermia (10–15°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan and Evans, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). Expression of the gene <italic>fat-7</italic>, which encodes a lipid desaturase, is transcriptionally induced by 10–15°C but not by more severe hypothermia (i.e. cold shock at 0–4°C), which impairs <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproduction and growth, and elicits distinct physiological and behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garrity et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lyons et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murray et al., 2007</xref>). However, as severe hypothermia arrests most of cell biological processes, strong transcriptional responses to cold shock e.g. 0–4°C likely only manifest during the organismic recovery to normal ambient temperature. We thus hypothesize that a genetic pathway differing from that operating under moderate hypothermia exposure controls the transcriptional response to severe hypothermia/cold shock followed by warming in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>In this work, we performed transcriptome profiling to first identify genes that are regulated by exposure to cold shock followed by recovery at normal temperature. We then used GFP-based transcriptional reporters in large-scale forward genetic screens to identify a genetic pathway consisting of <italic>isy-1</italic> and <italic>zip-10</italic>, the latter of which responds to cold-warming (CW) and mediates transcriptional responses to CW. Unexpectedly, we found strong <italic>zip-10</italic> induction promotes organismal death while deficiency of <italic>zip-10</italic> confers resistance to prolonged CW stress, more prominently in adults than young larvae. We propose that CW activates a ZIP-10 dependent genetic program favoring <italic>C. elegans</italic> phenoptosis and postulate that such programmed organismic death may have evolved to promote wild-population kin selection under thermal stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To identify new mechanisms of <italic>C. elegans</italic> response to severe hypothermia, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations after 2 hrs exposure to 4°C cold shock followed by recovery at 20°C for 1 hr. We used such CW conditions in an attempt to identify genes that specifically and rapidly respond to CW rather than those that respond to general organismic deterioration after long cold exposure. After differential expression analyses of triplicate samples, we identified 604 genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated by such CW conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We generated transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains in which <italic>GFP</italic> is driven by promoters of the top-ranked CW-inducible genes. In this work, we focus on <italic>asp-17</italic> as a robust CW-inducible reporter gene owing to its low baseline expression level and high-fold induction by CW, features that permitted facile isolation of full-penetrance mutants after random mutagenesis (see below) with both abnormal <italic>asp-17p::GFP</italic> expression and altered organismic tolerance to prolonged cold stress.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35037.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>asp-17</italic> is robustly and specifically induced by cold-warming.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volcano plot of RNA-seq showing differentially regulated genes (up-regulated genes in red; down-regulated genes in green; <italic>asp-17</italic> was indicated by purple dot) by cold-warming in wild type <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

A majority of wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> adults died upon prolonged CW stress (e.g. 2–4°C for over 24 hrs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>). We found that <italic>asp-17</italic> or <italic>zip-10</italic> loss-of-function mutants exhibited markedly higher survival rates than wild type under the same prolonged CW stress condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Consistent with a role of wild-type <italic>zip-10</italic> in promoting organismic death, inducible <italic>zip-10</italic> over-expression by mild transient heat shock, mediated by the <italic>hsp-16</italic> promoter, promoted animal death even in the absence of CW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). By contrast, other ectopically induced <italic>zip</italic> genes including <italic>zip-11</italic> and <italic>zip-2</italic> did not affect animal death, while a mutation specifically disrupting the glutamine-rich transactivation domain of ZIP-10 abolished the death-promoting effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2H</xref>). Although <italic>zip-10</italic> is genetically epistatic to <italic>isy-1</italic> in the regulation of <italic>asp-17</italic>, we found that <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants are also markedly resistant to prolonged cold stress. This paradox was resolved after we observed that many downstream target genes of the stress-coping transcription factors HIF-1, HSF-1 and DAF-16 are up-regulated in <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants, and LOF of at least <italic>daf-16</italic> could partly suppress cold tolerance by <italic>isy-1</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Since ISY-1 regulates <italic>zip-10</italic> via <italic>mir-60</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) supporting a role of ISY-1 in specific microRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du et al., 2015</xref>), we performed small RNA library sequencing of wild type animals and <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants and identified specific members of microRNAs that were differentially regulated, including <italic>mir-60</italic> and additional microRNAs predicted to target stress-coping TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). Thus, <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants likely exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes caused by abnormal activation of multiple TFs in addition to ZIP-10. In contrast to ZIP-10 dependent genes (<italic>asp-17</italic> and <italic>cpr-3</italic>), the HIF-1/HSF-1/DAF-16 target genes were not apparently induced by CW (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Furthermore, unlike HSF-1 or DAF-16 that are induced by other types of stress stimuli, ZIP-10 is more strongly induced by CW in adults than in larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting phenoptosis-promoting effects of <italic>zip-10 </italic>more specifically for adults. Indeed, the phenotypic difference in cold tolerance between wild type animals and <italic>zip-10</italic> mutants manifested more prominently in developmentally more mature-stage and older animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These results indicate that CW specifically activates a ZIP-10-driven and developmental stage-modulated transcriptional genetic program to promote the organismic death, or phenoptosis, of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>From a genetic screen for <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants with altered transcriptional response to CW, we identified <italic>isy-1</italic> and subsequently discovered the CW and ISY-1-regulated transcription factor ZIP-10 as a key mediator of the transcriptional response to CW. A thermal stress-responding TF might be expected to promote adaptation of animals towards the stressor, causing its LOF mutants to be sensitive to the stress. Unexpectedly, we found <italic>zip-10</italic> mutants are markedly resistant to prolonged cold stress. However, unlike other stress-responding TFs that activate genes largely beneficial for physiological homeostasis and thus animal health under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baird et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dempersmier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hwang and Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kandror et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumsta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Landis and Murphy, 2010</xref>), identified transcriptional targets of ZIP-10 include at least two Cathepsin-type proteases, CPR-3 and ASP-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast to aspartyl-type proteases which are largely unknown in cellular functions, caspase-type proteases are well-known apoptotic cell death executioners while CPR-4, a Cathepsin CPR-3 paralogue, has been shown to inhibit cell deaths in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Metzstein et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peter, 2011</xref>). Ectopic expression of <italic>zip-10</italic> and its targets promotes organismic deaths, in contrast to the effect of <italic>zip-10</italic> or <italic>asp-17</italic> deficiency on cold tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). As duration of cold shock affects levels of ZIP-10 and transient CW does not trigger phenoptosis, the pro-death role of the <italic>zip-10</italic> genetic program likely depends on multiple factors, including the duration and severity of cold exposure. Notably, apoptotic cell death-promoting effects have also been described for specific members of mammalian bZIP TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chüeh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ritchie et al., 2009</xref>). The specific and robust induction of ZIP-10 by CW, the opposing cold-tolerance phenotypes caused by <italic>zip-10</italic> loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic manipulations, as well as the pro-death roles of ZIP-10 targets support the notion that the <italic>zip-10</italic> pathway is activated by severe CW to promote phenoptosis.</p><p>How do ISY-1 and CW regulate the <italic>zip-10</italic> pathway? We found that the <italic>zip-10</italic> promoter activity responds to the loss of ISY-1, which normally maintains <italic>mir-60</italic> levels and thereby regulates <italic>zip-10</italic> transcription likely through the processing of small RNAs. Severe cold stress also leads to accumulation of another class of small RNA risiRNA, which is important for maintaining rRNA homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Whether ISY-1 might also affect risiRNA processing remains to be characterized. Constitutive up-regulation of ZIP-10 targets in <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants and the lack of evidence for regulation of ISY-1 by CW supports ISY-1 as a gate-keeper for the ZIP-10-driven transcriptional response to CW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Regulation of <italic>zip-10</italic> is primarily transcriptional based on evidence we present in this study; further studies are required to discern to what extent <italic>mir-60</italic> might directly act at the <italic>zip-10</italic> locus or more indirectly impact the transcription of <italic>zip-10</italic>, e.g. by post-transcriptionally inhibiting translation of a transcriptional activator. Up-regulation of the activity of the <italic>zip-10</italic> promoter by CW indicates that additional cold-responding sensors and effectors upstream of ZIP-10 remain to be identified, by signaling mechanisms perhaps similar to the well-characterized cold-responding pathways found in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dempersmier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kandror et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu, 2016</xref>). Precisely how <italic>zip-10</italic> is regulated by CW in coordination with ISY-1 to promote <italic>C. elegans</italic> death under prolonged CW stress awaits further investigation.</p><p>The roles of ZIP-10 and a dedicated genetic program in promoting organismic death are surprising but would make sense in light of the evolutionary kin selection theory. Kin selection refers to the evolutionary process promoting the reproductive success of an organism's kin despite a cost to the organism's own reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamilton, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith, 1964</xref>). Dedicated genetic programs may have evolved to promote kin selection at the population level. Although the concept and potential mechanisms of programed organismic death, or phenoptosis, are debated, examples of kin selection and stress-induced organismic deterioration have been widely documented in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Longo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sapolsky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Skulachev, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2002</xref>).</p><p>Laboratory conditions for hermaphroditic <italic>C. elegans</italic> clearly no longer exert selection pressure for genetic programs underlying phenoptosis or kin selection. However, our mathematic modeling of an exemplar situation of population growth for wild-type and <italic>zip-10</italic> deficient animals under food-limiting and CW stress conditions supports the phenoptosis or kin selection hypothesis for the <italic>zip-10</italic> pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Experimentally, we found that both the CW-induced <italic>zip-10</italic> expression and the death-promoting effect of ZIP-10 occurred more prominently in older adults than in larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Extending from the kin selection theory, we postulate that the evolutionary advantage of programmed organismic death might manifest in the wild, where resources for growth and reproduction are limited and environments can change drastically. As such, the selective death of adult animals would benefit young and reproductively more privileged populations to facilitate the spreading of genes by young populations under resource-limiting and high-stress conditions. Our work provides an unprecedented example of stress-induced phenoptosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and identify a specific transcription factor in a genetic program that likely evolved to promote kin selection during animal evolution. These findings therefore bear broad implications for understanding thermal stress response, programmed organismic death (phenoptosis) and evolutionary biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and genetic manipulations</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were maintained with standard procedures unless otherwise specified.

Proteins were detected using antibodies against Flag (Sigma, F3165), mCherry (M11217, Life Technologies), Tubulin (Sigma, T5168), H3 (Abcam, ab1791) or HSP90 (Proteintech, 13171–1-AP).</p><p>For subcellular fractionation, 50 µl pellet animals were resuspended in 150 µl 1 X cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, 9803S) with protease inhibitor cocktail (BioTools, B14002) and 10 µM PMSF, and incubated for 10 min on ice. Animals were lysed by TissueRuptor (Qiagen, 9001271) with Motor unit ‘6’ for 30 s on ice. After incubation on ice for 5 min and centrifugation at 5,000 rpm at 4°C for 2 min, the supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic part. The nuclear pellet was washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 150 µl RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P89900) for 30 min on ice, spun at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected as nuclear extract. Tubulin and H3 were separately used as cytoplasm and nuclear loading control. For RNAi experiments, <italic>zip-10p::zip-10::EGFP::FLAG</italic> animals were bleached, and the eggs were laid onto RNAi plates. Animals were harvested as L4/young adults and subject to western blot analysis as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Chromatin and RNA immunoprecipitation (ChIP-QPCR and RIP-QPCR)</title><p>ChIP-QPCR assay was carried out as before with modifications. Briefly, CW-treated animals (4°C for 4 hrs, recovered at 25°C for 1 hr) and control (25°C) animals were harvested and washed by 1 X PBS. The pellet animals were resuspended in cross-linking buffer (1% formaldehyde in 1 X PBS) followed by homogenization using TissueRuptor with Motor unit ‘4’ for 1 min at room temperature. The process was then stopped by addition of glycine (125 mM final concentration). After washing and discarding the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer and lysed by TissueRuptor with Motor unit ‘6’ for 1 min on ice, with lysate kept on ice for additional 3 min, and then repeated three times. The lysate was centrifuged to collect the supernatant and one percent of the aliquot was used as ‘Input’. Lysate was precleared by adding salmon sperm DNA/protein-A agarose beads (Bioworld, 20182011–1), rotating at 4°C for 1 hr. After centrifugation, supernatant was divided equally and added with 50 µg Flag antibody (Sigma, F3165) and mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2025), respectively. The samples were incubated and rotated overnight at 4°C. Next, salmon sperm DNA/protein-A agarose beads were added for 2 hrs at 4°C. The beads-antibody-TF-DNA complex was washed extensively and the complex and input were diluted with proteinase K buffer. The samples were then incubated at 55°C for 4 hrs and then at 65°C overnight to reverse crosslink. DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol (Sigma-Aldrich, 77617). <italic>asp-17</italic> promoter was measured by QPCR and calculated by the percent input method.

Briefly, synchronous day-1 <italic>isy-1p::isy-1::mcherry</italic> animals were divided into two groups. One group is control (25°C) and the other is cold-warming (4°C for 4 hrs, recovered at 25°C for 1 hr). Animals were harvested and washed by M9 buffer until the supernatant was clear, and then washed once in buffer A and twice in lysis buffer. About 250 μl worm pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen twice and homogenized using TissueRuptor with Motor unit ‘4’ for 1 min on ice. The lysate was kept on ice for 15 min and centrifuged to collect the supernatant and 1% of the aliquot was kept as ‘Input’. Equal amount of supernatant was added with RFP-Trap_MA (Chromotek) and rotated for 4 hrs at 4°C. IP magnetic agarose beads were washed and 10% of IP beads were boiled for 6 min in 2X Laemmli Sample Buffer. RNA was eluted from remaining beads using 200 μl lysis buffer of Quick-RNA MiniPrepkit (Zymo Research, R1055) and extracted following the instruction. RNA was quantified with a Nanodrop device. 500 ng RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and quantified by the percent input method.

For cold tolerance assay of L1-stage animals, bleach-synchronized populations were kept at 4°C for 96 hrs and then recovered for 4 hrs at 25°C. For cold tolerance assay of adults, animals were raised at 25°C from hatching with excessive bacteria food on agar plates. Well-fed L4 stage animals were transferred to new plates and kept at 25°C overnight to reach day-1 adulthood. To cold shock the animals, agar plates were spread with equal distance on a thin plastic board and transferred to a constant 4°C cold room for 48 hrs or the indicated duration. After cold shock, animals were then moved to 25°C for recovery for 4 hrs before scoring survival rates. Animals were scored as dead if they showed no pumping and movement upon light touch with the body necrosis subsequently confirmed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Imaging and fluorescence quantification</title><p>smFISH of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and imaging were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ji and Oudenaarden, 2005</xref>). For fluorescence imaging, spinning-disc confocal and digital automated epifluorescence microscopes (EVOS, Life Technologies) were used to capture images of animals after RNAi or CW treatments. Synchronous population of worms were randomly picked and treated with 1 mM levamisole water solution to paralyze the animals. The animals were mounted on an agar pad on a slide and aligned for imaging. Identical conditions and settings were used for both control and test groups. For quantification of fluorescence images, the animals in the images were outlined and signals were quantified by ImageJ software. The intensity of an individual animal was obtained by dividing the total signal by the area of that animal. The average intensity of the control group was set to be 1.0, to which all other intensities were normalized. Graphpad Prism software was used to plot the data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Small RNA-seq and bioinformatics</title><p>For small RNA sequencing, total RNA was isolated by the Quick-RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, R1055) that yields total RNA including small RNAs ranging 17–200 nt.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;A Genetic Program Underlies Cold-warming Response and Promotes Phenoptosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Julie Ahringer) and a Senior Editor (Detlef Weigel). The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Shouhong Guang (Reviewer #1); Meng C Wang (Reviewer #2); Ding Xue (Reviewer #3.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work, at least in its current form, will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate both the general interest in the phenomenon you describe and the strengths of several of your experiments, with which you have made progress in understanding hypothermic stress and the cold-warming (CW) response, an important but little studied topic. At the same time, there was broad agreement that the study is not yet at a sufficient level for a general audience. In particular, the precise mechanism of <italic>isy-1</italic> action is still unclear. Similar, it is not yet known whether the genes identified are specific to CW or alternatively act in other stress pathways. Additionally, an important paper by Kato et al., 2016 linking mir-61 to regulation of <italic>zip-10</italic> and <italic>asp-17</italic> appears to have been missed; work that is relevant to the mechanism of <italic>isy-1</italic> and the specificity of the genes studied here.</p><p>Our criticisms notwithstanding, we are very interested in the CW phenomenon. If you decide, based on the reviews, not to go immediately elsewhere with the work for publication, but rather to add more mechanistic detail before resubmitting it, we would encourage you to consider <italic>eLife</italic> again for such a future submission. If the reviewers' comments are appropriately addressed, we would very likely review such a new submission again and would try to consult the same reviewers. In the meantime, we hope that you find the reviewers' specific comments helpful.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Altogether an interesting paper, with good data. It touches on important points, and I think it would be valuable to the community and would be relevant to anyone who is interested in hypothermic stress regulation. But some revisions must be made. Context is frequently omitted making this paper difficult to read. A longer format may be warranted to accommodate additional context and background.</p><p>1) <italic>asp-17</italic> was chosen as a robust CW-inducible reporter gene to search for regulators and identified <italic>isy-1/zip-10</italic> pathway. How general is this <italic>isy-1/zip-10</italic> regulation? How many other genes use this mechanism to respond to CW induction and how many don't? In Figure 3I, F39A9.1 is responsive to CW but independent of <italic>zip-10</italic>, what is the mechanism of this regulation? And <italic>srr-6</italic> exhibits a more pronounced upregulation to CW in <italic>zip-10</italic> KO mutant.</p><p>2) Figure 4C, does <italic>cpr-3</italic> contains similar ZIP-10-binding motif? A genome wide ChIP-seq of ZIP-10 with and without CW stress, and in <italic>isy-1(dma50</italic>) mutants will greatly increase the paper.</p><p>3) The Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-1F of microRNA deep sequencing is not involved in this paper at all, which can either be taken out or need more elaboration. Meanwhile, in the methods section, the deep-sequencing of small RNAs need elaboration. For example, did they use 5'-phosphate-dependent or independent method for sequencing? A recent paper showed that CW-induction (very similar to the treatment in this paper) elicits risiRNA expression, has this category of small RNAs been analyzed.</p><p>4) The Discussion section is very hard to read, both the length of sentences and the logic.</p><p>5) It is very interesting how CW induction upregulates <italic>zip-10</italic> expression. Is there any molecular reasoning of this regulation? In the genetic screening, has the author tried to isolate mutants that failed to respond to CW stress induction, in addition to the constitutive <italic>asp-17::GFP</italic> expression mutants?</p><p>6) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, in unc-43 mutant, the expression of <italic>asp-17</italic> is also decreased with and without CW stress. How about the relative change? And in TRPA-1 mutant, the upregulation of <italic>asp-17</italic> is actually more pronounced. CW likely involves calcium signaling is an interesting observation, which may need further discussion or investigation.</p><p>7) In Figure 4B, there is a very good correlation between <italic>isy-1</italic>/control vs. CW/control. Does this mean CW actually directly regulates <italic>isy-1</italic>?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors have used <italic>C. elegans</italic> as an animal model to investigate the molecular mechanisms that organisms utilize to handle cold shock and sequent warm-up (cold-warm stress response). From candidate genes upregulated by cold-warm stress, the authors have identified <italic>asp-17</italic>, an aspartyl-like protease and generated its GFP reporters for an EMS mutagenesis screen. From the screen, the authors discovered an <italic>isy-1</italic> mutant that leads to constitutive induction of <italic>asp-17</italic> without cold-warm stress. <italic>isy-1</italic> encodes a conserved RNA-binding protein and acts in intestinal cells to regulate <italic>asp-17</italic> expression cell-autonomously. Furthermore, they discovered that the ZIP-10 transcription factor functions downstream of <italic>isy-1</italic> and directly regulates <italic>asp-17</italic> expression. Inactivation of <italic>zip-10</italic> or <italic>asp-17</italic> increases organism survival upon cold-warm stress, while inactivation of <italic>isy-1</italic> also increases organism survival upon cold-warm stress. Overall, the manuscript addresses an interesting question that remains poorly understood and is well written.</p><p>1) In this study, the authors have used cold-shock and sequent warm-up as an experimental system to assay a cold-warm stress response. In this experimental set up, both phases, cold and warm, are important, and can have distinct molecular and physiological changes related to organism survival. In fact, as shown in Figure 3E and 3G, the protein levels of ZIP-10 show very different dynamics with different duration of cold shock and warm-up. It seems that ZIP-10 levels won't be induced without warm-up. Is this true? So which phase does <italic>zip-10</italic> play a crucial role in regulating organism responses and survival? How about <italic>asp-17</italic>? The authors should consider characterizing the dynamic changes of <italic>zip-10</italic> and <italic>asp-17</italic> during cold shock and during warm-up.</p><p>Also, the induction of <italic>zip-10</italic> goes away with increasing warming time. Is <italic>isy-1</italic> responsible for regulating this transient induction? In the <italic>isy-1</italic> inactivated condition, will <italic>zip-10</italic> levels stay on with increasing warming time?</p><p>2) <italic>asp-17</italic> is induced by the <italic>isy-1</italic> mutant without cold-warm stress, and this induction can be further enhanced by cold-warm stress (similar induction folds in both conditions, Figure 3A). It is likely that <italic>isy-1</italic> just controls the <italic>asp-17</italic> expression level in general. Then how about <italic>zip-10</italic>? Does <italic>isy-1</italic> just control its levels in general, or more specific to cold-warm stress?</p><p>3) <italic>zip-10</italic> is a transcription factor. The authors showed that it is transcriptionally induced upon cold-warm stress and increases its occupancy at the promoter of <italic>asp-17</italic>. Does this transcription factor regulate <italic>asp-17</italic> cell-autonomously in intestinal cells? Where is this transcription factor localized in the cell, cytosol or nucleus? Does cold-warm stress affect its cellular localization? From the WB results shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, it is hard to tell.

A few concerns remain that should be addressed:</p><p>1) CW and ISY-1 regulate <italic>zip-10</italic> predominantly at the transcriptional level.

It touches on important points, and I think it would be valuable to the community and would be relevant to anyone who is interested in hypothermic stress regulation. But some revisions must be made. Context is frequently omitted making this paper difficult to read. A longer format may be warranted to accommodate additional context and background.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have resorted to a longer Research Article format, which we agree is more appropriate for accommodating additional context, background and new results needed to improve readability and address the comments and questions raised by the reviewers and editors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) asp-17 was chosen as a robust CW-inducible reporter gene to search for regulators and identified isy-1/zip-10 pathway. How general is this isy-1/zip-10 regulation? How many other genes use this mechanism to respond to CW induction and how many don't? In Figure 3I, F39A9.1 is responsive to CW but independent of zip-10, what is the mechanism of this regulation? And srr-6 exhibits a more pronounced upregulation to CW in zip-10 KO mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important question to address. To assess specificity of gene regulation mediated by ISY-1/ZIP-10, we have performed QPCR quantification of the expression levels of 17 genes (in addition to the 4 reported in the initial submission) randomly selected from the gene set commonly regulated by ISY-1 and CW. The results indicate striking specificity: only <italic>asp-17, cpr-3</italic> and <italic>ZK896.4</italic> strictly depend on ZIP-10 while the remaining set of genes are up-regulated by CW even in <italic>zip-10</italic> mutants (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This indicates that ZIP-10 likely promotes a dedicated genetic program in response to CW, consistent with the induction of ZIP-10 specifically by CW stress (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B) and its mutant phenotype in CW adaptation (new Figure 5). Although identifying an exhaustive list of stringent ZIP-10 target genes will require additional RNAseq and tissue-specific ChIP experiments, we believe <italic>asp-17</italic> is the major and physiologically relevant target since LOF phenotype of <italic>zip-10</italic> is largely recapitulated by that of <italic>asp-17</italic> (new Figure 5E). Investigating mechanisms of regulation of <italic>F39A9.1</italic> and <italic>srr-6</italic> is underway and the results will be described elsewhere given the focus/scope of this paper and the ZIP-10 independence of their regulation by CW.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 4C, does cpr-3 contains similar ZIP-10-binding motif? A genome wide ChIP-seq of ZIP-10 with and without CW stress, and in isy-1(dma50) mutants will greatly increase the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the <italic>cpr-3</italic> promoter does not contain a canonical ZIP-10-binding AT-rich motif as predicted by the stringent criteria of the program (new Figure 5C), we manually checked the promoter sequence and note that it does contain conserved AT-rich motifs resembling the canonical ZIP-10 binding motif (e.g. agaatttttttaaattttcaacaaaa, at -441 nt of its transcriptional start site) that might allow binding of ZIP-10 at lower affinity or in combination with other contextual transcriptional binding partners. Since ZIP-10 seems to be exclusively present in intestine, whole-organism ChIP-seq of ZIP-10 would be limited in identifying additional relevant targets. We would like to focus on <italic>asp-17</italic>, the validated transcriptional target of ZIP-10 that confers major causal effects in CW responses (new Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-1F of microRNA deep sequencing is not involved in this paper at all, which can either be taken out or need more elaboration. Meanwhile, in the methods section, the deep-sequencing of small RNAs need elaboration. For example, did they use 5'-phosphate-dependent or independent method for sequencing? A recent paper showed that CW-induction (very similar to the treatment in this paper) elicits risiRNA expression, has this category of small RNAs been analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Given the note from the reviewing editor that <italic>mir-60</italic> is downregulated in <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants, we have confirmed the finding by QPCR and performed functional experiments to test causal involvement of <italic>mir-60</italic>. As suggested by the reviewing editor, we have explored the mechanistic connection of ISY-1 to <italic>mir-60</italic> and found indeed ISY-1 binds directly to the primary transcript of <italic>mir-60</italic>, based on RNA immune-precipitation of mCherry-tagged ISY-1, followed by QPCR quantification (new Figure 4). Furthermore, <italic>mir-60</italic> mutants exhibited elevated expression of <italic>asp-17</italic> in a manner that requires <italic>zip-10</italic>, thus linking ISY-1 to ZIP-10 mechanism of regulation. Therefore, we’d like to keep the microRNA profiling result including that of <italic>mir-60</italic>, which is now more directly relevant for this paper.</p><p>We did not distinguish the 5'-phosphate-dependent or independent methods or analyze risiRNA expression. Nonetheless, we performed new RNA immune-precipitation experiments and found that levels of <italic>mir-60</italic> bound to ISY-1 were slightly but significantly increased by CW, consistent with enhanced processing of small RNA by ISY-1, e.g. <italic>mir-60</italic> in particular as a feedback mechanism to curb overexpression and toxicity of ZIP-10 after CW. Although potential link from ISY-1 to risiRNA was not explored, the interesting result of CW regulation of risiRNA indicates a perhaps similar mechanism and function in organismic homeostatic control and now included in the paper for brief discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Discussion section is very hard to read, both the length of sentences and the logic.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganized and rewritten the Discussion section to improve readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is very interesting how CW induction upregulates zip-10 expression. Is there any molecular reasoning of this regulation? In the genetic screening, has the author tried to isolate mutants that failed to respond to CW stress induction, in addition to the constitutive asp-17::GFP expression mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. The up-regulation of <italic>zip-10</italic> is indeed striking and very interesting from molecular mechanistic points of view. Our results indicate that <italic>zip-10</italic> up-regulation by CW is largely mediated by transcriptional mechanisms, since GFP driven by the <italic>zip-10</italic> promoter (<italic>zip-10p::GFP</italic>) was up-regulated by CW while its 3’utr was not (new Figure 4F). We have used EMS mutagenesis to isolate viable mutants with <italic>zip-10p::GFP</italic> that fail to respond to CW induction but unfortunately the penetrance of such mutants were generally too low (~5-20%) to be tractable for genetic mapping and molecular cloning. We reason that the upstream stress-responding regulators might be essential (precedents include genes e.g. <italic>skn-1</italic>) or genetically redundant (precedents include GPCRs) so that positive gene regulators of CW responses are harder to identify than negative gene regulators like <italic>isy-1</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, in unc-43 mutant, the expression of asp-17 is also decreased with and without CW stress. How about the relative change? And in TRPA-1 mutant, the upregulation of asp-17 is actually more pronounced. CW likely involves calcium signaling is an interesting observation, which may need further discussion or investigation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that the baseline level of <italic>asp-17</italic> is already low in <italic>unc-43</italic> mutants and involvement of calcium signaling based on <italic>unc-43</italic> and <italic>trpa-1</italic> results alone is difficult to interpret. The relative change is not significant compared with wild type. Thus, we have removed this result in the revised manuscript to avoid any confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 4B, there is a very good correlation between isy-1/control vs. CW/control. Does this mean CW actually directly regulates isy-1?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this observation to clarify. Our results clearly indicate that CW does not directly regulate ISY-1 since endogenous <italic>isy-1</italic> mRNA and mCherry-tagged proteins are not changed by CW (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). In our model, <italic>zip-10</italic> up-regulation by CW and ISY-1 occurs likely in parallel pathways and is mediated largely by transcriptional mechanisms (based on <italic>zip-10p::GFP</italic> up-regulation). We clarified in the revised paper that marked correlation between <italic>isy-1</italic>/control vs. CW/control strongly supports common genetic regulation of additional unidentified transcriptional regulators that control <italic>zip-10</italic> rather than direct causal regulation of <italic>isy-1</italic> by CW.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) In this study, the authors have used cold-shock and sequent warm-up as an experimental system to assay a cold-warm stress response. In this experimental set up, both phases, cold and warm, are important, and can have distinct molecular and physiological changes related to organism survival. In fact, as shown in Figure 3E and 3G, the protein levels of ZIP-10 show very different dynamics with different duration of cold shock and warm-up. It seems that ZIP-10 levels won't be induced without warm-up. Is this true? So which phase does zip-10 play a crucial role in regulating organism responses and survival? How about asp-17? The authors should consider characterizing the dynamic changes of zip-10 and asp-17 during cold shock and during warm-up.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments and raising these important questions for us to clarify. Yes, it is true that neither <italic>asp-17</italic> nor <italic>zip-10</italic> levels are induced unless with warm-up (Figure 1E and new Figure 4G). Our data indicate that their induction require both cold and warm phases but it is during the warm phase that the genetic program comes to play in regulating organismic response and survival. This is also consistent with the notion that very severe hypothermic stress actually arrests most of cellular activities, as discussed in the Introduction in the context of rationale why we chose to use cold-warming rather than simply cold shock as the stress paradigm. In the revised manuscript, we have clarified this issue by additional discussion and also provided additional experimental characterization of the dynamic ranges of <italic>zip-10</italic> and <italic>asp-17</italic> regulation during CW (please see Figure 1E, Figure 3G and Figure 4G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the induction of zip-10 goes away with increasing warming time. Is isy-1 responsible for regulating this transient induction? In the isy-1 inactivated condition, will zip-10 levels stay on with increasing warming time?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed new RNA immune-precipitation experiments and found that the <italic>zip-10</italic>-regulating <italic>mir-60</italic> binds to ISY-1 directly and levels of <italic>mir-60</italic> bound to ISY-1 were slightly but significantly increased by CW (new Figure 4A-4D). ZIP-10 is transiently induced by CW, has constitutively high baseline level and is further induced by CW in <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants, indicating that <italic>isy-1</italic> gates <italic>zip-10</italic> expression via <italic>mir-60</italic>, while not responsible for triggering the transient induction of <italic>zip-10</italic> by CW. We also performed new experiments to examine effects of increasing warming time on <italic>zip-10</italic> induction (new Figure 4G). As predicted, <italic>isy-1</italic> RNAi-treated animals exhibit relatively high ZIP-10 levels under baseline conditions and even more pronounced ZIP-10 up-regulation upon CW. However, ZIP-10 levels did not stay on over extended increasing warming time likely because of residual <italic>mir-60</italic> functions as reasoned above and/or additional post-translational mechanisms promoting degradation of ZIP-10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) asp-17 is induced by the isy-1 mutant without cold-warm stress, and this induction can be further enhanced by cold-warm stress (similar induction folds in both conditions, Figure 3A). It is likely that isy-1 just controls the asp-17 expression level in general. Then how about zip-10? Does isy-1 just control its levels in general, or more specific to cold-warm stress?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the above response to Point 1. Our previous and new data strongly indicate that CW but not other stress including hypoxia up-regulates <italic>zip-10</italic> transcription, leading to up-regulation of <italic>asp-17</italic> transcription, whereas ISY-1 regulates <italic>zip-10</italic> (and thereby <italic>asp-17</italic>) via binding and processing of <italic>mir- 60</italic>, thus gating (permissive) but not triggering (instructive) the induction of <italic>zip-10</italic> in response to CW.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) zip-10 is a transcription factor. The authors showed that it is transcriptionally induced upon cold-warm stress and increases its occupancy at the promoter of asp-17. Does this transcription factor regulate asp-17 cell-autonomously in intestinal cells? Where is this transcription factor localized in the cell, cytosol or nucleus? Does cold-warm stress affect its cellular localization? From the WB results shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, it is hard to tell. The authors should consider conducting immunostaining.</p></disp-quote><p>Like <italic>asp-17, zip-10</italic> is exclusively expressed in intestine, based on our promoter-driven GFP reporters (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A) and single cell RNAseq data recently published by the Waterston lab (Cao et al., 2017), supporting cell-autonomous regulation. We have attempted to generate several arrays of ectopically over-expressed ZIP-10::GFP fusion constructs at varying concentrations to visualize its subcellular localizations but were not able to obtain viable animals, likely because of its toxicity, consistent with a role in promoting phenoptosis. Immunostaining of the low-copy FLAG-tagged ZIP-10 in single animals did not yield sufficiently strong specific signals for resolving cellular localization. However, we were able to use Western blot to obtain evidence of ZIP-10 abundance change and nuclear accumulation because of increased animal numbers (&gt;100/per blot) for the Western blot assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors showed that the isy-1 mutant is more resistant to cold-warm stress, which can be partially suppressed by daf-16.

Also, does HSF-1 affect the tolerance of the isy-1 mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed new experiments and statistic calculation indicates that <italic>daf-16</italic> slightly decreased the tolerance of <italic>zip-10</italic> mutants (p = 0.0464, unpaired t-test, n=3 independent assays for N&gt;30 animals for each group) whereas <italic>hsf-1</italic> more pronouncedly decreased the tolerance of <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants (p = 0.0128, unpaired t-test, n=3 independent assays for N&gt;30 animals for each group). These results suggest that ZIP-10 promotes phenoptosis in response to CW partially by antagonizing DAF-16 effects and that ISY-1 regulates broad programs of stress response including the HSF-1 pathway, consistent with pleiotropic effects of <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants as indicated in the Model and discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) When comparing Figures 4E and 4F, it seems like that heat-shock pre-treatment increases tolerance to cold-warm stress (0% death rate vs. 65% death rate).

We have now further clarified this in the Figure legend.

Given that human ISY1 is involved in microRNA processing, a plausible model is that isy-1 mutants reduce expression of mir-60 (which is intestine specific), which leads to upregulation of ZIP-10, which then induces asp-17 expression. The authors need to take this previous work into account, both by discussing their results in light of this paper and by directly investigating the potential link with mir-60.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. The paper by Kato et al., 2016 inadvertently omitted in our initial submission (thank you for bringing this to our attention) proved informative in suggesting a candidate ISY-1 target microRNA <italic>mir-60</italic>. We have since performed new experiments and explored the connection of ISY-1 to <italic>mir-60</italic>, as suggested by the reviewing editor, and found indeed ISY-1 binds directly to the primary transcript of <italic>mir-60</italic>, based on RNA immune-precipitation of mCherry-tagged ISY-1, followed by QPCR quantification. Furthermore, <italic>mir-60</italic> mutants exhibited elevated expression of <italic>zip-10</italic> (and thereby <italic>asp-17</italic>) and reduced tolerance of CW, thus linking ISY-1 to ZIP-10 regulation both mechanically and functionally. Human ISY1 has been shown to be important for primary microRNA processing (Du et al., 2015). We lend support to this notion and in this work further identify a specific microRNA target that is important for organismic response to CW. We conclude that the ISY-1/<italic>mir-60</italic>/ZIP-10 trio constitutes 3 major players of the novel and likely conserved pathway controlling animal adaptation and response to CW.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If ISY-1 is involved in microRNA processing, then it is probably not specifically involved in CW. Instead it may non-specifically affect this process through processing of microRNAs. If so, loss of other factors that process microRNAs (e.g. dicer, drosha) would be expected to activate the asp-17 reporter. This and whether loss of isy-1 affects microRNA processing should be tested. Interestingly, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 shows that mir-60 is downregulated in isy-1 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. We have since confirmed by QPCR that <italic>mir-60</italic> is indeed downregulated in <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants (new Figure 4D). Given our additional new results showing direct binding of <italic>mir-60</italic> to ISY-1 (new Figure 4A and 4B) and the established role of human ISY1 in small RNA processing, we have performed a small-scale candidate RNAi screen and found indeed RNAi against small RNA processing enzymes e.g. <italic>dcr-1</italic> caused <italic>asp-17p</italic>::GFP activation, likely also because of defective <italic>mir-60</italic> processing. We note, however, such RNAi phenotype cannot directly resolve the issue of the specificity of ISY-1 in regulating microRNA; in fact, we found that <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants, unlike <italic>dcr-1</italic> mutants, exhibited down-regulation of only a selective subset of microRNAs including <italic>mir-60</italic> while many microRNAs were actually up-regulated (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We are collaborating with a small-RNA biochemistry group to characterize how ISY-1 affects small RNA processing specifically for certain microRNA members e.g. <italic>mir-60</italic> and will describe results of such biochemical findings on specificity in a future rather than current genetic study focusing on roles of ISY-1/<italic>mir-60/zip-10</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ZIP-10 has been previously linked to the innate immunity pathway, and its expression is upregulated upon exposure to bacterial pathogens (Shapira et al., 2006). BATF3, the human ortholog of ZIP-10, has also been linked to immune system regulation and response to pathogens. Is asp-17 upregulated upon exposure to pathogens?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this interesting question. Expression profiling of a more recent paper (Wong et al., 2007) found indeed up-regulation of <italic>asp-17</italic> by three different pathogens, <italic>E. faecalis, E. carotovora, and P. luminescens</italic>, but their fold induction is relatively moderate (1.84, 1.40, 1.62, respectively) as compared with those by CW or <italic>isy-1</italic> mutations (10~50 fold induction). Compared with <italic>zip-10</italic>, another bZip gene <italic>zip-2</italic> is much more robustly induced by various pathogens with established causal effects (Estes et al. 2010; Shapira et al., 2006). Our results thus support a central involvement of ZIP-10 in the CW response but do not rule out the possibility that ZIP-10 and ASP-17 are also involved (perhaps less prominently) in pathogen response that remains to be resolved in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Liang et al., 2007 (not cited) showed that zip-10 is expressed in the intestine.</p><p>What was the rational for focusing on zip-10?

Interestingly, zip-2 mediates response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (Estes et al., 2010).</p><p>The authors propose that ZIP-10 may promote organismal death. Could the authors test if it has such a role in pathogen infection?</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on <italic>zip-10</italic> because its deletion or RNAi can completely abolish <italic>asp-17p</italic>::GFP induction upon CW or in <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants (Figure 3) and thus plays a key role in the pathway and biology of interest of current paper. RNAi against other TFs did not have effects in <italic>asp-17p</italic>::GFP induction by CW or in <italic>isy-1</italic> mutants. We agree that ISY-1 likely also regulates other TFs that are involved in processes e.g. pathogen response but unfortunately, we do not have the required biosafety permission yet to perform direct pathogen including <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> experiments in our laboratory.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] 1) CW and ISY-1 regulate zip-10 predominantly at the transcriptional level. Because microRNAs can function in the cytoplasm to downregulate targeted mRNAs or inhibit translation, mir-60 may not directly prohibit the transcription of zip-10. It would be of interest to discuss this potential for post-transcriptional regulation in models of of ISY-1and mir-60 may regulate zip-10.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We agree and have added discussion texts about the potential mechanisms by which ISY-1 and <italic>mir-60</italic> regulate <italic>zip-10</italic>, indicating that such regulation of <italic>zip-10</italic> is primarily transcriptional based on evidence in this study; further studies are required to discern to what extent <italic>mir-60</italic> might possibly act at the <italic>zip-10</italic> locus or more indirectly impact the transcription of <italic>zip-10, e.g.</italic> by post-transcriptionally inhibiting translation of a transcriptional activator of <italic>zip-10</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the new Figures 4B-4C, have the numbers been normalized to the amount of immunoprecipitated proteins?</p></disp-quote><p>We have used the standard percent input method to measure the RNA-IP signals (https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/epigenetics-noncoding-rna-research/chromatin-remodeling/chromatin-immunoprecipitation-chip/chip-analysis.html).

However, ISY-1 is rather ubiquitously expressed and its RNA or protein level does not appear to be regulated as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the Materials and methods section, the RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen was used to purify total RNAs which are usually longer than 200 nt.

In the methods section, the RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen was used to prepare total RNA for RNA-seq and QPCR studies. For small RNA sequencing, total RNA was isolated by the Quick-RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, R1055) that yields total RNA including small RNAs ranging 17-200 nt. We identified endogenous siRNAs in our small RNA-seq datasets but the numbers of reads were small and thus classified as others in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. We have revised the method section to clarify these issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 4E, please use different colors to represent different bars.
