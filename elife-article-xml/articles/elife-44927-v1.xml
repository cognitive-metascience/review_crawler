during threatening situations. Activation of orexin/hypocretin neurons is implicated in sustained arousal. However, orexin neurons produce and release orexin as well as several co-transmitters including dynorphin and glutamate. To disambiguate orexin-dependent and -independent physiological functions of orexin neurons, we generated a novel Orexin-flippase (Flp) knock-in mouse line. Crossing with Flp-reporter or Cre-expressing mice showed gene expression exclusively in orexin neurons. Histological studies confirmed that orexin was knock-out in homozygous mice. Orexin neurons without orexin showed altered electrophysiological properties, as well as received decreased glutamatergic inputs. Selective chemogenetic activation revealed that both orexin and co-transmitters functioned to increase wakefulness, however, orexin was indispensable to promote sustained arousal. Surprisingly, such activation increased the total time spent in cataplexy. Taken together, orexin is essential to maintain basic membrane properties and input-output computation of orexin neurons, as well as to exert awake-sustaining aptitude of orexin neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>orexin/hypocretin</kwd><kwd>flippase recombinase</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>chemogenetics</kwd><kwd>sleep/wakefulness</kwd><kwd>cataplexy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR1656</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26293046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26640041</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H01271</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H01428</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18KK0223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H05016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Subtraction analysis using novel <italic>Orexin-Flp</italic> mice isolated physiological importance of orexin peptides.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Orexin A (hypocretin-1) and orexin B (hypocretin-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Lecea et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sakurai et al., 1998</xref>), generated from the same precursor protein called prepro-hypocretin (encoded by <italic>hypocretin</italic> gene), are endogenous ligands for two closely related G-protein-coupled receptors termed orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin-2 receptor (OX2R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sakurai et al., 1998</xref>). Although orexin was named for its effect on inducing feeding behavior, it gained immense interest in sleep research as the knockout (KO) of prepro-orexin or dysfunction of OX2R in canines or mice reportedly mimics the human sleep disorder narcolepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chemelli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 1999</xref>). Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by fragmented sleep/wakefulness, persistent daytime sleepiness and brief episodes of muscle weakness called cataplexy, which is often triggered by positive emotions. Narcolepsy patients showed a loss of overall hypocretin mRNA, confirming the association between orexin neuronal loss and the pathogenesis of narcolepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peyron et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thannickal et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>A small number of orexin-producing neurons (orexin neurons) are exclusively distributed in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and perifornical area, but send projections widely throughout the major brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nambu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peyron et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, it is no surprise that orexin neurons have diverse physiological roles, including the regulation of sleep/wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chemelli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 1999</xref>), energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamanaka et al., 2003</xref>), thermoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tupone et al., 2011</xref>), as well as regulation of heart rate and blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Using optogenetic and/or chemogenetic techniques, we and others showed that orexin neurons modulate sleep/wake cycles in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamantidis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sasaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsunematsu et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to these, employing transgenic mice, we reported that chemogenetic activation of orexin neurons increased locomotion, feeding behavior and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inutsuka et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, orexin neurons are thought to interact with the neuroregulatory, autonomic and neuroendocrine systems, and perform critical roles in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness and energy homeostasis.</p><p>The physiological activity of orexin neurons is modulated by multiple neural inputs and humoral factors. These inputs include GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area, serotonergic neurons in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, central amygdala, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, supraventricular zone, and the dorsomedial, lateral and posterior hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sakurai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, we reported that serotonergic neurons in the raphe nucleus inhibit orexin neurons both directly and indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chowdhury and Yamanaka, 2016</xref>). Orexin neurons are also found to respond to multiple humoral factors and neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inutsuka and Yamanaka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sakurai, 2014</xref>). Most interestingly, orexin neurons form a positive-feedback circuitry among themselves in the LHA by activating other orexin neurons through OX2R to maintain the wake-active network at optimum level and/or for a sustained period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>However, orexin neurons contain other neurotransmitters including glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rosin et al., 2003</xref>), dynorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chou et al., 2001</xref>) and galanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Håkansson et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, to better understand the physiology and pathophysiology of orexin/hypocretin system, it is essential to disambiguate the roles of orexin from other co-transmitters. To address this, we generated novel Orexin-flippase (Flp) knock-in (KI) mice, which express Flp recombinase under control of <italic>hypocretin</italic> gene in mice. Employing this novel mouse line, we found that orexin performs critical roles in maintaining basic electrophysiological properties of orexin neurons as well as to initiate feed-forward activation of orexin neurons by facilitating excitatory glutamatergic inputs. Focusing on sleep/wakefulness, we also manipulated orexin neuronal activity and evaluated their physiological effects in freely-moving mice. To achieve this, we employed a chemogenetic technique, Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>). Our results showed orexin plays a major role in the awake-sustaining aptitude of orexin neurons. Although the phenotypic consequences of orexin neurons activation in increased wakefulness were reinforced for by co-transmitters, these co-transmitters rather deteriorated cataplexy. Together, these data clearly identified the importance of orexin neuropeptides for the physiological function of orexin neurons and their postsynaptic partners.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of novel Orexin-Flp (OF) mice</title><p>We previously generated Orexin-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inutsuka et al., 2014</xref>) or orexin-tetracycline-controlled trans-activator (Orexin-tTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tabuchi et al., 2013</xref>) transgenic mice in which Cre recombinase or tTA was expressed in orexin neurons to allow regulation of transgene expression in the orexin neurons. However, expression of Cre or tTA in those transgenic mice was driven by a 3.2 kb short gene fragment upstream of the human <italic>hypocretin</italic> gene. Thus, we generated a new mouse by targeting the <italic>hypocretin</italic> gene of the mouse genome. Employing a homologous recombination system, here we generated Orexin-Flp (OF) mice by knocking in the EGFP-2A-Flp transgene just downstream of the translation initiation site of the <italic>hypocretin</italic> gene in-frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To visualize the function of Flp recombinase, we bred these mice with Flp-reporter (FSF-mTFP1) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Imayoshi et al., 2012</xref>) in which fluorescent protein mTFP1 is expressed in a Flp-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis showed mTFP expression in 80.9 ± 4.4% of orexin-immunoreactive neurons. We observed no ectopic expression of EGFP and/or mTFP1 protein in melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-immunoreactive (n = 4 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>) or in any other non-orexin-immunoreactive neurons in these bigenic mice. In other words, all reporter gene-expressing neurons were orexin-immunoreactive (IR). Together, these data confirmed that functional Flp was expressed exclusively in the orexin neurons of newly generated OF mice.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44927.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of OF mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representations of the <italic>hypocretin</italic> gene, targeting vector, and targeted gene.

To this end, we sought to evaluate the importance of orexin neuropeptides in conserving the electrophysiological properties of orexin neurons. Therefore, we recorded and compared resting membrane potentials (Vrest), firing frequency, input resistance and capacitance in OF (KI/-), OF (KI/KI), and Orexin-EGFP (Tg/Tg) (OE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamanaka et al., 2003</xref>) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–4E</xref>). Orexin neurons in the OF (KI/KI) mice were found to have significantly hyperpolarized membrane potential (−58.8 ± 1.2 mV; n = 21 cells) compared to OF (KI/-) mice (−51.6 ± 0.9 mV; n = 21 cells, p=1.0e-5) and OE mice (−50.4 ± 0.9 mV; n = 22 cells, p=3.5e-7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–i–4A-iv</xref>). Spontaneous firing frequency measured by cell-attached recordings were also found to be significantly lower in orexin neurons in OF (KI/KI) mice (1.5 ± 0.2 Hz; n = 25 cells) compared to OF (KI/-) mice (2.5 ± 0.3 Hz; n = 21 cells, p=0.015) and OE mice (2.6 ± 0.2 Hz; n = 25, p=0.004; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–i–4B-iv</xref>). This lower discharge rate could be attributed to the hyperpolarized membrane potential of orexin neurons in homozygous mice. We next measured the input resistance of identified neurons by measuring the voltage deviation generated by current injection from −100 to +100 pA in the current clamp protocol. In mice lacking orexin peptide (OF (KI/KI) mice), orexin neurons were found to have significantly lower input resistance (485.9 ± 35.8 MΩ; n = 23 cells) compared to OF (KI/-) mice (639.9 ± 48.2 MΩ; n = 21 cells, p=0.037) and OE mice (638.2 ± 43.4 MΩ; n = 24 cells, p=0.032; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–i–4C-iv</xref>). The lower input resistance in neurons lacking orexin peptides suggests that greater synaptic inputs (current injection) are necessary to generate changes in membrane potential. We also compared the membrane capacitance measured during whole-cell recordings. Interestingly, we observed that orexin neurons in OF (KI/KI) mice had significantly higher membrane capacitance (35.4 ± 1.3 pF; n = 25 cells) than OF (KI/-) mice (29.9 ± 1.5 pF; n = 25 cells, p=0.012) and OE mice (30.0 ± 1.3 pF; n = 25 cells, p=0.014, one-way ANOVA post-hoc Tukey; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This higher capacitance in orexin neurons that lack orexin peptides reflects the increased surface area of the plasma membrane. Taken together, these data clearly suggest that orexin neuropeptide is essential for maintaining the active and passive electrophysiological properties of orexin neurons.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44927.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Electrophysiological properties of orexin neurons with/without orexin.</title><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) show representative traces recorded from OF (KI/-) (i), OF (KI/KI) (ii) and OE (iii) mice.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the co-transmitters could eventually rescue OF (KI/KI) mice from cataplexy as well. Surprisingly, however, activation of orexin neurons that lacked orexin peptide rather deteriorate the cataplexy during the light periods while it showed similar propensity during the dark period (saline (L): 0.2 ± 0.1 min/hr; CNO (L): 0.9 ± 0.3 min/hr, n = 8 mice, p=0.04; saline (D): 3.0 ± 1.2 min/hr; CNO (D): 5.2 ± 1.4 min/hr, n = 8 mice, p=0.14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-iv and 7D-iv</xref>). CNO itself is reported to have no effect on the initiation or maintenance of cataplectic attack in the Prepro-orexin KO (OXKO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mahoney et al., 2017</xref>). These results clearly suggested that neurotransmitters other than orexin could partially compensate for abnormalities in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness, excluding cataplexy.</p><p>We also compared the effect of orexin neuronal activation in the number of episodes (bouts) and average time spent in each vigilance state. Whereas, in OF (KI/-) mice, total observed bouts decrease in all three vigilance states for 2 hr after CNO injection (Wakefulness: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–i and E–i</xref>; REM: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–ii and E-ii</xref>, NREM: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–iii and 7E-iii</xref>), they remain unaffected in case of OF (KI/KI) mice (Wakefulness: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–i and E–i</xref>; REM: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–ii and 7E-ii</xref>, NREM: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–iii and 7E-iii</xref>; Cataplexy: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C-iv and 7E-iv</xref>). Conversely, orexin neuronal activation increased average wake duration in OF (KI/-) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–i and E–i</xref>); and decreased REM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–ii and 7E-ii</xref>) and NREM sleep duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–iii and 7E-iii</xref>). However, in case of OF (KI/KI) mice, while the total wake time was increased after chemogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and 7E i-iv</xref>), duration of wake was not extended (Wakefulness: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–i and E–i</xref>; REM: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–ii and 7E-ii</xref>; NREM: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–iii and 7E-iii</xref>; Cataplexy: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C-iv and 7E-iv</xref>). Together, all these experimental analyses indicated that orexin neuropeptide was indispensable to promote sustained arousal, where the co-transmitters could not compensate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>CNO-induced cataplexy was not different from naïve cataplexy</title><p>Finally, we sought to answer the question of whether CNO-induced increase in cataplexy attack showed similar properties to naïve cataplexy. We analyzed and compared the relative power spectrum EEG during the cataplexy episode in the daytime after saline or CNO administration as chemogenetic activation of orexin KO neurons resulted in increased cataplexy in the daytime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Relative power analysis showed no difference in either power of the delta, theta, alpha or beta wave (n = 8 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), suggesting that CNO-induced cataplexy showed similar electrocortical activity as the naïve cataplexy attack observed in OF (KI/-) mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been shown that orexin neurons possess several neurotransmitters and release them together with orexin. However, orexin- or OX2R-KO mice closely phenocopy the symptoms observed in human narcolepsy, which is caused by the specific degeneration of orexin neurons. This might suggest that other neurotransmitters have either no or insignificant role in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness. The physiological importance of orexin can be explored in several ways including central administration, KO, functional manipulation or ablation of source neurons, among others. Here, we dissociated the effect of orexin by applying electrophysiological analyses and neural activity manipulation to orexin neurons that lack orexin peptide using novel KI mice. Previously, we generated Orexin-Cre or Orexin-tTA transgenic mice in which a short 3.2 kb fragment from the 5′-upstream region of the human <italic>hypocretin</italic> gene was used as a promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inutsuka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sakurai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tabuchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamanaka et al., 2003</xref>). However, the random integration of the Orexin-Cre or Orexin-tTA transgene into the genome could result in ectopic gene expression in non-targeted cells as well as unexpected expression during development, as the timing and regulation of gene expression might be affected by genes located near the integrated locus. This could be problematic if these mouse lines were bred with reporter mice. In contrast, KI permits accurate temporo-spatial gene expression control. However, the knock-in method has the disadvantage that orexin content in OF (KI/-) mice could be slightly decreased since Flp was knocked into the <italic>hypocretin</italic> locus. Chemelli <italic>et al.</italic> reported that orexin A content was decreased to 75% in heterozygous mice. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chemelli et al., 1999</xref>). OF (KI/-) mice showed a shorter duration of wakefulness compared with WT control mice, and is likely due to the decrease in orexin. The Flp function was restricted in orexin neurons in the OF mice as confirmed by reporter mice. To our knowledge, OF mice represent the first line which enabled exclusive gene expression in orexin neurons by crossing with reporter mice. Moreover, combining Flp and Cre-driver mice enable us to express different genes in different neuronal subtypes to apply neural manipulations and/or activity readout simultaneously. By crossing OF mice with either MCH-Cre or Gad67-Cre, we generated Orexin-Flp; MCH-Cre and Orexin-Flp; Gad67-Cre bigenic mice, and argued that OF mice could be an essential tool for studying the functional connectome between orexin neurons and any other neurons in the hypothalamus. Besides, OF mice can also be useful for analyzing long-range neuronal connections. By using the Orexin-Flp; Gad67-Cre bigenic mice, we recently found that GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area inhibited orexin neuronal activity by making monosynaptic inhibitory projections and regulate NERM sleep in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chowdhury et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we reported that orexin neuropeptide depolarized orexin neurons via OX2R and mediates a positive-feedback loop both directly and indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>). In agreement with this, we also found that orexin facilitates glutamate release onto orexin neurons. However, several basic electrophysiological properties of orexin neurons were also found to be altered in the absence of orexin peptides, including hyperpolarized membrane potential, lower discharge rate and input resistance. Surprisingly, the capacitance of orexin neurons that lack orexin peptide was significantly larger than that of orexin neurons possessing orexin. This indicates that orexin neurons lacking orexin have a larger surface of the cell membrane since capacitance reflects the surface area of the cytoplasmic membrane. We did not directly measure the difference in diameter of cell size since an approximately 3 pF increase is estimated to be associated with a 1–2 µm increase in diameter as a spherical body. This might suggest that orexin signaling through either OX2R or glutamatergic excitatory inputs is involved in the regulation of cell size. However, this study cannot conclude whether the observed altered electrophysiological properties in the orexin KO neurons is directly caused by the absence of orexin, or if the lack of orexin signaling results in developmental compensation that contributes to these differences. Several studies have shown the role of orexin in the developing brain. Satoyanova <italic>et al.</italic> showed that orexin A and B are expressed at 1 week of age during early postnatal brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stoyanova et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to this, van den Pol <italic>et al.</italic> showed that orexin increased the temporal synchrony of action potentials in developing locus coeruleus cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van den Pol et al., 2002</xref>). These reports suggest that orexin might have a role in brain development. To fully characterize some of these unexpected effects of orexin in maintaining the biophysical properties of orexin neurons, in vivo genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system or <italic>hypocretin</italic> gene knockout after maturation using an inducible Cre recombinase such as CreERT2, will likely be required.</p><p>Orexin neurons are known to play an essential role in maintaining uninterrupted wakefulness as human narcolepsy patients show chronic daytime sleepiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crocker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thannickal et al., 2000</xref>). Disruption of orexin signaling in mice, rats and dogs produce a very similar phenotype which includes short bouts of wakefulness and increased transitions of vigilance states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chemelli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mochizuki et al., 2004</xref>). These suggest that orexin might be the key component released from the orexin neurons in performing the wake-maintaining role of orexin neurons. Our study showed further evidence in support of this hypothesis in the mouse model as a putative increase in the probability of co-transmitters release from orexin neurons could not rescue from the short bout and frequent state-transition phenomenon. Chemogenetic activation of orexin neurons prolonged the duration of wakefulness only in the presence of orexin, suggesting that orexin is crucial to achieve long-duration wakefulness. Moreover, orexin administration can also make wakefulness with high cognitive ability in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deadwyler et al., 2007</xref>). Such effect of orexin is also expected in human society, and our results indicate the irreplaceability of orexin.</p><p>On the contrary, we found that other behavioral outcomes of activating orexin neurons, including increased wakefulness and decreased REM and NREM sleep, can be compensated for by co-transmitters. This effect was obvious especially during the dark (active) period when baseline activity of orexin neurons is presumably higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Estabrooke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mileykovskiy et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, some other behavioral effects, like the prevention of cataplexy, cannot be compensated for by co-transmitters. Rather, it deteriorates the condition. This might suggest that the role of orexin in the prevention of cataplexy is not simply to activate post-synaptic neurons since glutamate (co-transmitter) also activates post-synaptic neurons. Rather, neurons that are not directly innervated by orexin neurons might also be involved in the regulation of cataplexy. It is also possible that the released orexin diffuses in the CSF since intracerebroventricular injection of orexin inhibited cataplexy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mieda et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, orexin co-transmitter dynorphin, which inhibits orexin neurons both directly and indirectly by depressing glutamatergic afferent inputs to orexin neurons, might also play a key role in such deterioration of cataplexy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li and van den Pol, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The release of orexin follows a circadian rhythm that is also strongly related to locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). In rodents, the level of orexin peptide in the CSF is low during the light period and high during the active-wake period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zeitzer et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, orexin neurons supposedly show higher activity during active wakefulness and become less active or inactive during REM or NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mileykovskiy et al., 2005</xref>). Our data also suggest that the activity of orexin neurons is differentially regulated during the light and dark periods. It is possible that the higher endogenous activity of orexin neurons during the dark period may facilitate CNO-induced transmitter release resulting in improved wakefulness in OF(KI/KI) mice.</p><p>In summary, here we dissociated the role of orexin at the cellular and behavioral level. We suggest that the primary function of orexin is to maintain the electrophysiological balance, the input-output functions in orexin neurons and most importantly, to exert the function of orexin neurons in maintaining sustained wakefulness.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

For Flp-dependent expression of humanized Renilla reniformis green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) and Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato, we stereotactically injected 600 nl of virus cocktail containing equal volume of AAV(DJ)-CMV-dFRT-hrGFP (viral titer: 3.7 × 10<sup>12</sup> particles/ml) and AAV(DJ)-CMV-FLEX-tdTomato (viral titer: 2.0 × 10<sup>12</sup> particles/ml) into one brain hemisphere of OF mice using the same coordinates described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with 10% somnopentyl (1.0 mg/kg, Kyoritsu Seiyaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and were perfused transcardially with 20 ml of ice-cold saline. This perfusion was immediately followed by another 20 ml of 10% ice-cold formalin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Brains were then isolated and postfixed in 10% formalin solution at 4°C overnight. Subsequently, brains were immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C for at least 2 days. Coronal brain slices of 40 μm thickness were generated using a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). For staining, coronal brain sections were immersed in blocking buffer (1% BSA and 0.25% Triton-X in PBS), then incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The sections were then washed with blocking buffer and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature (RT). After washing, brain sections were mounted and examined using a fluorescence microscope (BZ-9000, Keyence, Osaka, Japan or IX71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Antibodies and stains</title><p>Primary antibodies were diluted in the blocking buffer as follows: anti-orexin-A goat antibody (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) at 1:1000, anti-MCH rabbit antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:2000, anti-prodynorphin guinea pig antibody (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 1:100, anti-c-Fos rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz) at 1:500 and anti-GFP mouse antibody (Wako, Japan) at 1:1000. Secondary antibodies included: CF 488- or CF 594-conjugated anti-goat antibody (Biotium Inc, Hayward, CA), CF 647-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Biotium), CF 680-conjugated anti-guinea pig antibody (Biotium) and CF 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Biotium); all were diluted at 1:1000 in blocking buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Acute brain slice preparations and electrophysiological recording</title><p>OF and OE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamanaka et al., 2003</xref>) mice of both sexes, aged 2–5 months, were used for electrophysiological recordings. Brain slice preparations and subsequent electrophysiological recording were modified from a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chowdhury and Yamanaka, 2016</xref>). Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized using isoflurane (Wako) and decapitated at around 11:00 AM. Brains were quickly isolated and chilled in ice-cold oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) cutting solution (in mM: 110 K-gluconate, 15 KCl, 0.05 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 26.2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 Glucose, 3.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.0015 (±)−3-(2-Carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid). After trimming the brain, coronal brain slices of 300 µm thickness that contained the LHA were generated using a vibratome (VT-1200S; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and were temporarily placed in an incubation chamber containing oxygenated bath solution (in mM: 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.23 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 25 Glucose) in a 35°C water bath for 60 min. Slices were then incubated at RT in the same incubation chamber for another 30–60 min for recovery.</p><p>Acute brain slices were transferred from the incubation chamber to a recording chamber (RC-26G; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA) equipped with an upright fluorescence microscope (BX51WI; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and were superfused with oxygenated bath solution at the rate of 1.5 ml/min using a peristaltic pump (Dynamax; Rainin, Oakland, CA, USA). An infrared camera (C3077-78; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) was installed in the fluorescence microscope along with an electron multiplying charge-coupled device camera (EMCCD, Evolve 512 delta; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA) and both images were separately displayed on monitors. Micropipettes of 4–6 MΩ resistance were prepared from borosilicate glass capillaries (GC150-10; Harvard Apparatus, Cambridge, MA, USA) using a horizontal puller (P-1000; Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA). Patch pipettes were filled with KCl-based internal solution (in mM: 145 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 1.1 EGTA, 2 MgATP, 0.5 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP; pH 7.3 with KOH) with osmolality between 280–290 mOsm. Positive pressure was introduced in the patch pipette as it approached the cell. For whole-cell current clamp or voltage clamp recordings, a giga-seal of resistance &gt;1 GΩ was made between the patch pipette and the cell membrane by releasing the positive pressure upon contacting the cell. The patch membrane was then ruptured by gentle suction to form a whole-cell configuration. Electrophysiological properties of the cells were monitored using the Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instrument, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Output signals were low-pass filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at a 10 kHz sampling rate. Patch clamp data were recorded through an analog-to-digital (AD) converter (Digidata 1550A; Molecular Devices) using pClamp 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). Blue light with a wavelength of 475 ± 17.5 nm was generated by a light source that used a light-emitting diode (Spectra light engine; Lumencor, Beaverton, OR, USA) and was guided to the microscope stage with a 1.0 cm diameter fiber. Brain slices were illuminated through the objective lens of the fluorescence microscope. EGFP-expressing orexin neurons were identified by its fluorescence. For cell-attached recording, a seal of resistance &lt;1 GΩ was made and spontaneous firing was recorded. The resting membrane potentials (Vrest) were measured from offline analysis of current clamp recordings using the predefined fitting function provided by Clampfit. We performed standard exponential fitting with zero shift for the initial 20 s of data to measure the Vrest of recorded neurons. Firing frequency was also calculated from offline analysis of the initial 60 s of the cell-attached recording data. sEPSCs were recorded with picrotoxin (400 μM) and sIPSCs were recorded with AP-5 (50 μM) and CNQX (20 μM) in bath solutions. Both sEPSCs and sIPSCs were recorded in the presence of KCl-based pipette solutions that included 1 mM of QX-314.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>EEG-EMG surgery, data acquisition, and vigilance state determination</title><p>Virus injected age-matched male mice were implanted with EEG and EMG electrodes for polysomnographic recording under isoflurane anesthesia following the protocol published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tabuchi et al., 2014</xref>). Immediately after surgery, each mouse received an i.p. injection of 10 ml/kg of analgesic solution containing 0.5 mg/ml of Carprofen (Zoetis Inc, Japan). The same analgesic at the same dose was administered again 1 day after surgery. Mice were singly housed for 7 days during recovery. Mice were then connected to a cable with a slip ring in order to move freely in the cage and were habituated with the cable for another 7 days. The first 3 days were treated as the adaptation period for the animals to acclimate to the new environment and to intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration (10 ml/kg) of saline. On days 4 and 5, the mice were injected with saline (day 4) and CNO (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA) (day 5) at 10:00 AM during the light period. On days 7 and 8, they were injected with saline (day 7) and CNO (day 8) at 10:00 PM during the dark period (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). CNO was dissolved in water to make a stock solution (10 mg/ml) and was diluted with saline to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml just prior to i.p. administration.</p><p>EEG and EMG signals were amplified (AB-610J, Nihon Koden, Japan), filtered (EEG 1.5–30 Hz and EMG 15–300 Hz), digitized (at a sampling rate of 128 Hz), recorded (Vital Recorder, Kissei Comtec Co., Ltd, Japan) and finally analyzed (SleepSign, Kissei Comtec). Animal behavior was monitored through a CCD video camera (Amaki Electric Co., Ltd., Japan) during both the light and dark periods. The dark period video recording was assisted by infrared photography (Amaki Electric Co., Ltd., Japan) and an infrared sensor (Kissei Comtec). EEG and EMG data were automatically scored in 4 s epochs and classified as wake, rapid eye movement sleep, and non-rapid eye movement sleep. The EEG analysis yielded power spectra profiles over a 0 ~ 20 Hz window with 1 Hz resolution for delta (1–5 Hz), theta (6–10 Hz), alpha (11–15 Hz), and beta (16–20 Hz) bandwidths. All auto-screened data were examined visually and corrected. The criteria for vigilance states were the same as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tabuchi et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, (i) wake (low EEG amplitude with high EMG or locomotion score), (ii) non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (low EMG and high EEG delta amplitude), and (iii) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (low EMG, low EEG amplitude with high theta activity, and should be followed by NREM). Cataplexy was tracked using a combination of multiple criteria: muscle atonia lasting ≥10 s, predominance of theta activity and more than 40 s of wakefulness before the cataplectic attack.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis and presentation</title><p>Immunostaining data were analyzed and processed with ImageJ (US National Institute of Health) and BZ-X Analyzer (Keyence BZ-X710 microscope).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yang Dan as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Orexin neurons are known to be important for sustained arousal, and they release glutamate and dynorphin in addition to orexin. This paper addresses the effect of knocking out orexin on the property of orexinergic neurons and on the outcome of activating orexinergic neurons. They found that orexin knock out altered the electrophysiological properties of the neurons and reduced their glutamatergic inputs. While all transmitters contribute to arousal, orexin is crucial for sustained arousal and prevention of cataplexy. Interestingly, activating orexinergic neurons in an orexin deficient background causes increase in cataplexy. This novel finding is expected to lead to future discoveries on the mechanism of cataplexy. The new mouse line they generated is of great interest to the field, given the highly specific expression of Flp in orexin neurons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Discussion section: &quot;The Flp function was restricted in orexin neurons in the OF mice as confirmed by reporter mice.&quot;</p><p>To conclude this, it is essential to describe how many% of reporter positive cells are also orexin positive, which seems not provided. (The authors only state how many% of orexin positive cells are also reporter positive.)</p><p>Subsection “OF (KI/KI) mice showed symptoms in narcolepsy”: &quot;Sleep state parameters for orexin knockout mice are presented in Table 1. These values were comparable with our previously generated orexin neuron-ablated mice (Tabuchi et al., 2014a), as well as with the previously generated orexin-knockout mice (Chemelli et al., 1999).&quot;</p><p>This part is not very convincing. First, in case of Tabuchi et al., 2014a, the amount of each sleep stage changes dynamically following DTA expression so it is difficult to compare sleep amount to the current KI mice. According to Table 1, the KI mice show high REM sleep amount (96 min.), whereas NREM sleep amount is quite low (584 min.). According to Chemelli et al., 1999, Orexin KO mice exhibit normal amount of REM sleep (88 min.) and high amount of NREM sleep (761 min.). Thus, contrary to the manuscript, the values do not seem &quot;comparable&quot; to both papers that were cited. In addition, according to Hara et al., 2001, mice in which orexinergic neurons were ablated by ataxin-expression exhibited a similar trend to Chemelli et al., 1999, i.e. normal amount of REM sleep (88 min.) and high amount of NREM sleep (731 min.). The characterization of the sleep architecture of the KI mice generated here is important because unexpected effects of expressing Flp in these neurons are possible. The recording environment might have affected the sleep differently from Chemelli et al., 1999 or Hara et al., 2001. To truly characterize the KI mice, please also provide sleep data of wt control mice.</p><p>The authors find that chemogenetic activation of orexin neurons in the KI/- mice strongly increases the average duration of wake bouts, while activation of orexin neurons w/o orexin in the KI/KI mice has no effect on wake duration (Figure 7C, F). The control recordings (with saline injections) show no significant differences between the two mouse lines. However, also during spontaneous sleep/wake behavior mice show sustained periods of wakefulness, especially during the dark period (Lo et al., 2004, Stephenson et al., 2013), implying that the control recordings with saline in Figure 7 should contain long wake periods. Consequently, if the release of orexin by orexin neurons was indispensable for sustained wake periods, KI/KI mice (w/o orexin in orexin neurons) should show shortened wake periods under control (saline) conditions. As this is not the case, the reported data in their present form demonstrate that orexin is sufficient, but not indispensable for sustained wake periods. This point should be clarified.</p><p>As the duration of wake durations typically follows a bimodal distribution with short and long wake bouts (Lo et al., 2004, Stephenson et al., 2013), potential effects on long wake periods in the control recordings might be occluded by averaging. By separating the distribution of wake periods into short and long periods, the authors could test whether the absence of orexin specifically affects either of these two distributions. A second reason why the authors could not detect differences under control conditions might be that the analyses in Figure 7C, F only include the first two hours after saline injection (which might not contain enough wake periods to detect differences). By extending their analysis to the complete control recordings, can the authors find shortened wake periods in KI/KI mice supporting a necessary role of orexin in sustaining wakefulness?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44927.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Discussion section: &quot;The Flp function was restricted in orexin neurons in the OF mice as confirmed by reporter mice.&quot;</p><p>To conclude this, it is essential to describe how many% of reporter positive cells are also orexin positive, which seems not provided.

These results have been added to Table 1. <italic>OF</italic> (KI/KI) mice showed a significant increase in the number of bouts and a decreased average duration in all vigilance states compared with WT mice. These results suggest fragmentation of sleep/wakefulness and an inability to maintain sustained arousal in the absence of orexin. However, we observed a higher amount of REM sleep even in the WT control mice (92 min) compared with values reported for WT mice by Chemelli et al., 1999 (73 min). Although our REM sleep results for WT mice were similar to that reported by Hara et al., 2001 (92 min), our WT mice showed a higher level of wakefulness (792 min) and less NREM sleep (556 min) than observed by either Chemelli et al. (awake: 661 min, NREM: 703 min) or Hara et al. (awake: 654 min, NREM: 692 min). These differences might be caused by either i) the position of the EEG electrodes, or ii) the criteria used for the definition of vigilance state and the recording environment.</p><p>i) Position of EEG electrodes:</p><p>Our position: AP -1.5, ML -1.0 and AP -5.4, ML -1.0, mm.</p><p>Chemelli et al., 1999: AP1.1, ML ± 1.45 and AP-3.5, ML ± 1.45, mm.</p><p>Duran et al. (Sleep 2018) reported that differences in electrode position resulted in different REM sleep times. Our electrode position enabled detection of theta activity from the hippocampus with high sensitivity since the electrode was positioned close to the hippocampus. Thus, the observed increase in REM sleep time under our recording conditions compared with other reports might be caused by such differences in electrode position.</p><p>ii) Criteria for the definition of vigilance state: Our definition of drowsiness differed from that used by others. While Chemelli et al. defined drowsiness as NREM sleep, we defined it as wakefulness since we identified NREM sleep as having a low EMG and high delta amplitude by EEG. This might be caused by less NREM sleep and longer wakefulness compared with previous reports.</p><p>Therefore, we hypothesize that one potential reason for the differences in the amount of NREM and REM sleep in orexin-Flp mice may be the differences in recording conditions, environment and criteria used for sleep/wakefulness analysis, and not due to the expression of Flp. Moreover, patch clamp recording from orexin neurons in orexin-Flp (KI/-) heterozygous mice showed no abnormality in electrophysiological parameters compare with orexin-EGFP mice, confirming that Flp expression did not induce unexpected effect (Figure 4). Nevertheless, to avoid any confusion, we have removed the citation of Tabuchi et al. and added Hara et al. We added the following sentences to the Results:</p><p>“We also compared the vigilance state parameters of the <italic>OF</italic> (KI/KI) mice with those of wild type (WT) control mice and the values are presented in Table 1. As expected, <italic>OF</italic> (KI/KI) mice showed less wakefulness and higher NREM and REM sleep compared to the WT control animals (Table 1). Along with these changes, orexin KO mice showed an increased number of bouts and decreased average duration in all vigilance states (Table 1), suggesting fragmentation of the sleep-wakefulness and an inability to maintain sustained arousal in the absence of orexin peptides. However, in comparison to the previously generated orexin KO (Chemelli et al., 1999) as well as to the orexin neuron-ablated mice (Hara et al., 2001), newly generated <italic>OF</italic> (KI/KI) mice showed higher REM sleep and wakefulness and a lower amount of NREM sleep. This is presumably due to changes in the recording environment, different criteria of the definition of vigilance state and/or changes in the genetic background as the WT control mice show similar changes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors find that chemogenetic activation of orexin neurons in the KI/- mice strongly increases the average duration of wake bouts, while activation of orexin neurons w/o orexin in the KI/KI mice has no effect on wake duration (Figure 7C, F). The control recordings (with saline injections) show no significant differences between the two mouse lines. However, also during spontaneous sleep/wake behavior mice show sustained periods of wakefulness, especially during the dark period (Lo et al., 2004, Stephenson et al., 2013), implying that the control recordings with saline in Figure 7 should contain long wake periods. Consequently, if the release of orexin by orexin neurons was indispensable for sustained wake periods, KI/KI mice (w/o orexin in orexin neurons) should show shortened wake periods under control (saline) conditions. As this is not the case, the reported data in their present form demonstrate that orexin is sufficient, but not indispensable for sustained wake periods. This point should be clarified.</p><p>As the duration of wake durations typically follows a bimodal distribution with short and long wake bouts (Lo et al., 2004, Stephenson et al., 2013), potential effects on long wake periods in the control recordings might be occluded by averaging. By separating the distribution of wake periods into short and long periods, the authors could test whether the absence of orexin specifically affects either of these two distributions. A second reason why the authors could not detect differences under control conditions might be that the analyses in Figure 7C,F only include the first two hours after saline injection (which might not contain enough wake periods to detect differences). By extending their analysis to the complete control recordings, can the authors find shortened wake periods in KI/KI mice supporting a necessary role of orexin in sustaining wakefulness?</p></disp-quote><p>To address whether KI/KI mice (that lack orexin expression in orexin neurons) exhibit shortened periods of wakefulness under control (saline) conditions, we extended our analysis for 12 hours after the injection of saline. However, the duration and number of bouts of wakefulness were not significantly different. The duration of wakefulness in heterozygous (n = 4) and homozygous (n = 6) mice were 106.3 ± 16.8 sec and 99.5 ± 11.9 sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1; p</xref> = 0.7, unpaired t-test), respectively. The number of bouts of wakefulness in heterozygous and homozygous mice was 228.0 ± 23.1 and 252.8 ± 20.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1, p</xref> = 0.5, unpaired t-test), respectively.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44927.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Bouts and duration of wakefulness in <italic>OF</italic> (KI/-) (n = 4) and <italic>OF</italic> (KI/KI) (n = 7) mice after saline injection for 12 hr).</title><p>Data represent mean ± S.E.M.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44927-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>It is, however, notable that both the duration and bouts of wakefulness in heterozygous mice was not comparable to those of WT mice (Table 1; duration: 316.6 ± 30.9 sec, bouts: 107.5 ± 10.6, without saline injection during the dark period). This is presumably because of decrease in orexin in heterozygous mice since the Flp gene was knocked-in to the prepro-orexin gene locus. We could not compare sleep/wakefulness values from heterozygous mice with previous reports including that of Chemelli et al., since they did not provide such values. However, Chemelli et al. did describe a decrease in the content of orexin peptides in the brain of heterozygous mice, orexin-A was 75% and orexin-B was 83% of wild type mice. While we did not measure orexin content in orexin-Flp mice, the orexin content in heterozygous mice should be decreased. Thus, the decreased duration in both heterozygous and homozygous mice compared with WT mice demonstrates that orexin is indispensable for sustaining the period of wakefulness. We added this limitation in our results to the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“However, the knock-in method has the disadvantage that orexin content in <italic>OF</italic> (KI/-) mice could be slightly decreased since Flp was knocked into the prepro-orexin locus. Chemelli et al. reported that orexin A content was decreased to 75% in heterozygous mice. (Chemelli et al., 1999). <italic>OF</italic> (KI/-) mice showed a shorter duration of wakefulness compared with WT control mice, and is likely due to the decrease in orexin.”</p><p>Given the reasons described above (that heterozygous mice were not normal due to a slight decrease in orexin), we compared the number of short, middle and long bouts of wakefulness between <italic>OF</italic> (KI/KI) homozygous mice (n = 7) and wild type mice (n = 8) during the dark period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). The wakefulness duration was divided into three categories, less than 5 min (short), 5 min to 1 hr (middle) and more than 1 hr (long) according to Stephenson et al., 2013. During the dark period (12 hr active period), <italic>OF</italic> (KI/KI) homozygous mice showed a significantly larger number of wakefulness episodes of short and middle durations compared with those of WT mice (short p = 0.0007 vs WT; middle p = 0.0001 vs WT; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). On the contrary, <italic>OF</italic> (KI/KI) homozygous mice exhibited no wakefulness episodes longer that 1 hr (p = 0.000001 vs WT, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that orexin is indispensable for sustained wakefulness.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44927.024</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Number of wakefulness bouts of short duration (~5 min), middle duration (5 min-1 hr) and long duration (1 hr~) in WT mice and <italic>OF</italic> (KI/KI) mice during the dark period.</title><p>Data represent mean ± S.E.M.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44927-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
