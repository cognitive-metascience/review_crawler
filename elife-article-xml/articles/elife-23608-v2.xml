Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the neural mechanisms mediating anxiety symptoms. We used unbiased, multimodal, data-driven, whole-brain measures of neural activity (magnetoencephalography) and connectivity (fMRI) to identify the regions of the brain that contribute most prominently to sustained anxiety. We report that a single brain region, the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), shows both elevated neural activity and global brain connectivity during threat. The IPS plays a key role in attention orienting and may contribute to the hypervigilance that is a common symptom of pathological anxiety. Hyperactivation of this region during elevated state anxiety may account for the paradoxical facilitation of performance on tasks that require an external focus of attention, and impairment of performance on tasks that require an internal focus of attention.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23608.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23608.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Anxiety disorders affect around one in five Americans, and in many cases people experience anxiety so intensely that they have difficulties performing day-to-day activities. To help these people, it is important to understand how anxiety works. Current research suggests that anxiety disorders are caused when the connections in the brain that control our response to threat are either excessively or inappropriately activated. However, it was not clear what causes the anxiety to last for long periods. To better understand this phenomenon, Balderston et al. studied the brains of over 30 volunteers using two types of measurements called magnetoencephalography and fMRI.</p><p>In the each experiment, participants experienced periods of threat, where they could receive unpredictable electric shocks. In the first experiment, Balderston et al. measured the brain activity by recording the magnetic fields generated in the brain. In the second experiment, they used fMRI to record changes in the blood flow throughout the brain to measure how the different regions in the brain communicate.</p><p>The recordings identified a single part of the brain that increased its activity and changed its communication pattern with the other regions in the brain, when people are anxious. This region in a part of the brain called parietal lobe, is also important for processing attention, which suggests that anxiety might make people also more aware of their surroundings. However, this extra awareness might also make it more difficult for people to concentrate.</p><p>Future studies may be able to stimulate this area of the brain through the scalp to potentially reduce anxiety, as the affected area is close to the skull.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23608.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23608.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>magnetoencephalography</kwd><kwd>startle</kwd><kwd>alpha</kwd><kwd>global connectivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIAMH002798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grillon</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multimodal neuroimaging was used to study the effect of threat on spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity, and demonstrated that threat increases both activity and connectivity of the intraparietal sulcus, a key node in the frontoparietal attention network.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Current models of anxiety disorders suggest that pathological anxiety results from excessive or inappropriate activation of the same neural circuits that are responsible for adaptive anxiety in the face of threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Insel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Insel, 2014</xref>). Although there is a long history of translational work studying neural systems mediating the acute fear response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Pavlov, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fanselow and Poulos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Fullana et al., 2016</xref>), much less is known about the neural systems mediating prolonged periods of elevated state anxiety. Closing this knowledge gap is critical because the occurrence of prolonged periods of elevated state anxiety is one of the primary symptoms of all anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>). Therefore, understanding neural mechanisms underlying prolonged periods of elevated anxiety has the potential to identify targets for the treatment of anxiety disorders, which are among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The gold-standard translational paradigm for studying elevated state anxiety in the laboratory is the threat of shock paradigm, during which subjects are exposed to periods when they are either safe, or at risk for receiving unpredictable aversive electrical stimulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Schmitz and Grillon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Grillon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Grillon and Baas, 2003</xref>).

A key feature of prolonged periods of threat of shock is that they induce a stable increase in anxiety that can be probed at random intervals using the acoustic startle reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Grillon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Grillon and Baas, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">1998</xref>), suggesting that this anxious state is mediated by a fundamental sustained change in the pattern of ongoing brain activity. This is in contrast to more phasic event-related fear responses in typical cued fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Schmitz and Grillon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Grillon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Davis et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Current neuroscientific models of anxiety are based in part on translational work using Pavlovian fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Pavlov, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fanselow and Poulos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Fullana et al., 2016</xref>).

However, much less is known about the network mediating extended periods of elevated state anxiety.</p><p>In addition, cognitive scientific research in humans shows that attentional processing is profoundly influenced by both state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Vytal et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Patel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Shackman et al., 2006</xref>) and trait anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Derakshan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Eysenck et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that multiple neural systems are affected by anxiety. Although there have been some studies investigating the neural systems that mediate anxiety, these studies often depend on an <italic>a priori</italic> focus that is centered on the regions of the canonical fear network, and typically rely on <italic>a priori</italic> methods to increase statistical sensitivity in these regions such as lowered statistical thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Robinson et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Mobbs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hooker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Tabbert et al., 2010</xref>), region of interest analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balderston et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2013</xref>), and seed-based functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Schultz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Vytal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gold et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the increased sensitivity gained by using these statistical methods comes at the cost of assessing anxiety-related changes in regions not identified <italic>a priori,</italic> thus resulting in a possible under-reporting of anxiety-related changes in other areas of the brain, such as regions important for attentional processing. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use exploratory analytical methods to identify the most prominent activity/connectivity changes induced by the threat of shock paradigm.</p><p>Toward this aim, we collected data from two complimentary imaging modalities, fMRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a threat of shock paradigm. In both MEG and fMRI experiments, subjects underwent alternating blocks of safety and threat, and rated their anxiety continuously using a centrally located visual analog scale (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). During the MEG experiment, subjects also received randomly timed white noise presentations, which served to probe the subject’s current anxiety level (via the acoustic startle response) and their ongoing brain activity (via the preceding pattern of neural oscillations).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of experimental paradigm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Subjects underwent alternating blocks of threat and safety.

To assess functional connectivity changes in the fMRI signal, we used the global brain connectivity (GBC) metric, which does not rely on <italic>a priori</italic> seed-selection for the connectivity analysis. To assess ongoing patterns of activity in the MEG study, we evaluated changes in oscillatory power during the 2 s prior to the startle probes as a function of threat. According to the translational approach, one might predict that the most prominent changes in spontaneous neural activity and connectivity would emerge in regions of the canonical fear network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fanselow and Poulos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Kim et al., 2011</xref>).

To address this limitation, researchers have developed complementary data-driven functional connectivity metrics such as GBC, which do not rely on <italic>a priori</italic> seed-selection for the connectivity analysis. By assessing the connectivity between each voxel and every other voxel, this analysis allows the user to identify the most connected regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cole et al., 2010</xref>), as well as the seed regions where connectivity impacts behavior across subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gotts et al., 2012</xref>).

Subjects were exposed to alternating 2-min blocks of safety and threat, without startle probes. Given that this design lacked external timing information (i.e. external stimulus presentations), we examined changes in functional connectivity as a function of block type. We opted for a data-driven GBC approach where the connectivity of every voxel was assessed. We first computed GBC maps independently for the safe and threat conditions by correlating each voxel’s timecourse with every other voxel’s timecourse, applying the Fisher’s Z transformation, and averaging across these correlation maps (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

Using the same GBC maps created above, we conducted a voxelwise (Safe vs. Threat) paired-sample t-test. We used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate a null distribution for statistical testing, and used a cluster-based method based on this null distribution to correct for multiple comparisons. We found a significant increase in GBC in the threat blocks compared to the safe blocks in three clusters (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The largest cluster was in the right angular gyrus. The two remaining clusters were found bilaterally in the IPS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

To determine whether these differences were affected by the delivery of the shock, or differences in motion across blocks, we repeated the threat vs. safe analysis at the cluster level after censoring the 10 TRs following shock delivery, and an equivalent number of safe TRs closely matched for motion. In addition, we covaried out any remaining differences in motion using an analysis of covariance. Using this approach, we still found a significant effect of threat on GBC in all three regions (Right angular gyrus: f(1, 23)=4.71, p=0.04; Right IPS: f(1, 23)=7.22, p=0.01; Left IPS: f(1, 23)=5.39, p=0.03), suggesting that our initial findings were not due to differences in motion, censoring, or residual neural activity evoked by the shock.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.009</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Results from voxelwise GBC analysis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23608.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23608.009</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Label</th><th rowspan="2">Volume</th><th rowspan="2"><italic>t</italic>-value</th><th colspan="3" valign="bottom">Peak activation (LPI)</th></tr><tr><th valign="bottom">x</th><th valign="bottom">y</th><th valign="bottom">z</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Right Angular Gyrus</td><td valign="bottom">158</td><td valign="bottom">3.45</td><td valign="bottom">48</td><td valign="bottom">−51</td><td valign="bottom">27</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Right Intraparietal Sulcus</td><td valign="bottom">83</td><td valign="bottom">3.42</td><td valign="bottom">21</td><td valign="bottom">−60</td><td valign="bottom">66</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Left Intraparietal Sulcus</td><td valign="bottom">81</td><td valign="bottom">3.6</td><td valign="bottom">−18</td><td valign="bottom">−63</td><td valign="bottom">66</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Results from voxelwise global brain connectivity (GBC) analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Statistical map showing results from a threat vs. safe paired-sample t-test.

Finally, when comparing the MEG results with the fMRI results, we found that the left IPS cluster in the fMRI data substantially overlaps with the alpha cluster (46/81 voxels; See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Conjunction map from voxelwise fMRI GBC analysis and MEG alpha power differences.</title><p>Colors represent significant safe vs. threat differences from the fMRI analysis (yellow), MEG analysis (blue), and both analyses (green).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23608.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23608.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23608-fig8-v2"/></fig></p><p>As with the MRI data, it is important to show that our denoising steps did not affect the comparisons between the safe and threat conditions. Specifically, it is important to show that the number of trials rejected either (1) did not differ across the safe and threat blocks, or (2) did not affect the safe vs. threat comparisons. In the safe condition, there were on average 58.21 ± 5.5 trials, while in the threat condition there were on average 55.32 ± 7.6 trials, which was significantly different across subjects (t(27) = 2.78, p=0.01). Therefore, we decided to determine whether this difference in trial number impacted our results at the censor and source level. Accordingly, we included the difference in trial number across safe and threat blocks as a covariate in an ANCOVA examining the effect of threat on alpha responses. At both the sensor (f(1,26) = 7.48, p=0.01) and at the source (f(1,26) = 17.797, p&lt;0.001), we find that even with the difference in number of trials covaried out, the effects of threat on alpha power is still significant, suggesting that this difference did not significantly impact our results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The purpose of this study was to use the complementary methods of fMRI and MEG to identify the regions and network hubs that contribute most prominently to sustained anxiety during threat of shock. In both cases, we used unbiased, data-driven, whole-brain measures of activity/connectivity, and identified the IPS as the region most affected by the threat of shock manipulation. Using fMRI GBC, we found that the IPS increased its connectivity during periods of threat with a set of regions important for attention control, suggesting that this region is a hub in a network important for attentional processing during threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Du et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Kincade et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Rushworth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bucci, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>). Using MEG, we found that the magnitude of spontaneous alpha oscillations in the same region decreased during periods of threat, suggesting that threat increases IPS cortical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Klimesch et al., 2007</xref>). Together, these results suggest that threat of shock facilitates attentional processing mediated by increased excitability and connectivity of the IPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Du et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Kincade et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Rushworth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bucci, 2009</xref>). This enhanced attentional processing may reflect a state of hypervigilance, consistent with the findings that elevated state anxiety biases the attentional system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Waters et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amir et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Lapointe et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, this hypervigilance may provide a mechanistic explanation for why threat facilitates performance on tasks that require an external focus of attention but impairs performance on tasks that require an internal focus of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Vytal et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Patel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Torrisi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Grillon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balderston et al., 2016</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Functional connectivity</title><p>Previous studies exploring the relationship between threat and functional connectivity focused on how threat affected connectivity within networks centered on seeds placed in emotional processing regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Vytal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">McMenamin and Pessoa, 2015</xref>). However, in this study because we were specifically interested in identifying the regions of the brain that contributed most prominently to anxiety, we chose to forego an <italic>a priori</italic> seed-based approach, and employ data-driven connectivity measures that do not rely on choosing a seed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cole et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Calhoun et al., 2009</xref>). To start, we used GBC as a method to determine whether connectivity <italic>en masse</italic> changed with threat, and to identify where in the brain the largest changes occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cole et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chu et al., 2011</xref>). We found the largest changes to occur bilaterally in the IPS, where connectivity with the rest of the brain increased as a function of threat. Then, using these regions as a seed, we found that they supported an increase in connectivity within a set of regions important for executive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Posner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>). These results suggest that the IPS is a critical connectivity hub in the network of regions that contribute most prominently to the sustained elevation of state anxiety induced by the threat of shock paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cole et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cole et al., 2014</xref>). Although our GBC approach did not reveal any hubs within the amygdala, or in other regions typically associated with emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Simmons et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Mechias et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Etkin and Wager, 2007</xref>), we do see an increase in connectivity between the IPS and the thalamus and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, two regions known to be part of the canonical fear network.</p><p>In addition to the IPS, we found changes in GBC as a function of threat in the right angular gyrus. Although it is currently unclear how the angular gyrus might contribute to threat processing, there is work suggesting that this region may be a key site for multisensory integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Seghier, 2013</xref>). One hypothesis is that enhanced GBC in this region may reflect a heightened awareness of the current context. However, this is a post hoc explanation that should be explored in future studies.</p><p>An obvious parallel to the fMRI connectivity analysis would be to conduct a similar whole brain connectivity analysis of the MEG data. Not only would corroborating evidence from an independent imaging modality strengthen the fMRI connectivity results, but results from MEG specifically would allow for a frequency-specific analysis of the effects of threat on functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Hillebrand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brookes et al., 2011</xref>). However, the current study was not optimized to reliably detect differences in MEG connectivity. In the current study, we included the white noise probes as a way to obtain a quantitative measure of anxiety throughout the safe and threat blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Grillon et al., 1999</xref>). These white noise probes trigger the acoustic startle reflex, which varies as a function of an individual’s current level of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Grillon, 2008</xref>). Unfortunately, these reflexive blinks also inject an artifact into the MEG signal, and because the magnitude of these blinks differs across conditions, the blink artifact also differs across conditions. Although adaptive beamforming can theoretically remove the artifact induced by the blink response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Van Veen et al., 1997</xref>), the only way to ensure that the blink artifact does not differentially affect the MEG signal is to remove the contaminated time periods from the analysis, or remove the startle probes from the design at the outset. In the current study, we chose to address this limitation by extracting two-second time windows prior to each startle presentation to minimize the effect of the blink artifact on our power estimates. However, it has been shown that reliability of the MEG connectivity estimates increases as the duration of the recording increases, and durations of ~10 min or greater may be needed to maximize reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Liuzzi et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, using such short intervals did not allow for the ability to obtain reliable estimates of MEG connectivity. Future studies should be conducted to address this limitation. In addition, it will be important to use appropriate correction methods to account for signal leakage between source space regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Colclough et al., 2015</xref>), and verify that the resulting connectivity estimates match previously published work (i.e. strong alpha connectivity in occipital regions and strong beta connectivity linking the parietal cortex with other frontal, temporal, and occipital regions; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Hunt et al., 2016</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>fMRI and alpha</title><p>In addition to the increases in functional connectivity measured with fMRI, we also found decreases in alpha as a function of threat of shock in the same parietal region using MEG. Although the focus of the paper was on alpha, our initial approach (described in the introduction) was to examine all frequency bands independently (other bands not shown). The focus on alpha emerged out of the observations that, (1) alpha was the strongest signal in the recordings, (2) alpha showed the largest power changes as a function of threat, (3) alpha was the only frequency band that showed consistent results at both the sensor and the source level, and (4) the source space results aligned nicely with the corresponding fMRI GBC data.</p><p>These results are also consistent with several previous studies using simultaneous recordings of fMRI and EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Sadaghiani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Mo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Mayhew et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Scheeringa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Walz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, functional connectivity at the whole brain level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chang et al., 2013</xref>), and within the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Scheeringa et al., 2012</xref>) is negatively correlated with posterior alpha power. In addition, alpha power is negatively correlated with activity with dorsal attention network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Sadaghiani et al., 2010</xref>), and positively correlated with activity in the default mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Mo et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, intrinsic connectivity within networks is negatively correlated with alpha during eyes open vs. eyes closed resting state studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Wu et al., 2010</xref>), and both the phase and power of pre-stimulus alpha affects event-related BOLD responses in sensory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Mayhew et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Walz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>). Together these results suggest that the increase in IPS connectivity and decrease in IPS alpha power may reflect a common process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Alpha oscillations</title><p>We also show that threat reduces the power of resting state alpha oscillations. These oscillations are thought to reflect cortical inhibition, driven by inhibitory interneurons, and triggered by top-down modulatory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Klimesch et al., 2007</xref>). According to this view, our current findings may be driven by a release from top-down inhibition, resulting in a net increase in cortical excitability. Importantly, reductions in alpha power (i.e. increases in excitability) are associated with enhanced sensory and motor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cornwell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baas et al., 2006</xref>). For instance, reduced pre-stimulus alpha is associated with enhanced visual and illusory visual perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Lange et al., 2013</xref>), and increased pre-stimulus alpha is associated with reduced transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor-evoked potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Klimesch et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, alpha reduction (i.e. cortical excitation) may provide a mechanistic explanation for one of the most commonly reported symptoms of elevated state anxiety, namely anxiety-potentiated startle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Schmitz and Grillon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Grillon and Ameli, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Grillon et al., 1991</xref>). That is, threat of shock potentiates the startle reflex by increasing cortical excitability.</p><p>Cognitively, alpha oscillations are thought to play a key role in selective attentional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Klimesch, 2012</xref>), such that increases in alpha typically reflect inhibition or filtering of information that is to-be-ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bonnefond and Jensen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kelly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Händel et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, alpha oscillations have been shown to filter out noise during distracting listening conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Strauß et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, increases in pre-stimulus alpha to predictable stimuli are lateralized to to-be-ignored locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Horschig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Rihs et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, alpha power increases during the maintenance of items in working memory (WM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Klimesch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Meyer et al., 2013</xref>), and this increase in alpha serves to protect these items from distractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bonnefond and Jensen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Manza et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the decreases in alpha power observed in our study may reflect greater perceptual sensitivity, consistent with the idea that threat may increase vigilance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Eilam et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, alpha-gamma coupling is thought to be important for allocating attention to unattended salient stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The reductions in alpha power observed here were lateralized to the left hemisphere, leading to a right dominant parietal asymmetry. According to prominent models, left dominant frontal alpha is associated with positive affect and/or approach behavior, while right dominant alpha is associated with negative affect and/or avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Davidson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Harmon-Jones et al., 2010</xref>). Like the valence model of alpha asymmetry, one prominent model on parietal alpha asymmetry is rooted in the arousal-valence model of emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Heller, 1993</xref>). According to this model, right dominant parietal alpha is associated with increased arousal. Consistent with this theory, we find that threat of shock, which increases arousal, also reduces left parietal alpha, resulting in a right dominant profile. However, more research should be conducted to specifically test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cognition/anxiety interactions</title><p>Although our results only provide indirect evidence for the hypothesis that threat facilitates orienting, a bias toward hyper-orienting during periods of elevated state anxiety could explain many of the conflicting findings related to the cognition/anxiety interaction. The relationship between cognition and anxiety has been extensively studied (For reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Eysenck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Robinson et al., 2013b</xref>]). Importantly, threat of shock improves performance on sustained attention tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Torrisi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Grillon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>), while impairing performance on working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Vytal et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Patel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balderston et al., 2016</xref>). These tasks can be distinguished from one another based on the locus of attention required for performance. In sustained attention tasks, subjects are constantly monitoring the external environment for odd-ball stimuli, while in working memory tasks, subjects are required to maintain information internally. Our hypothesis is that threat-induced hyper-orienting improves performance on sustained attention tasks by reducing lapses in attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Torrisi et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, we hypothesize that threat-induced hyper-orienting impairs performance on working memory tasks by lowering the threshold for distractors to gain access to WM resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balderston et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these hypotheses, high pre-stimulus alpha is associated with better memory performance while low pre-stimulus alpha is associated with better perception performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Klimesch et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study had a number of strengths. First, we used the gold standard threat of shock paradigm, which has been extensively applied to manipulate state anxiety within subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Grillon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Grillon and Baas, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Grillon et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Balderston et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cornwell et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cornwell et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Lissek et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike previous studies, we also collected anxiety ratings throughout the recordings, and found that these ratings were similar across studies and correlated with anxiety-potentiated startle within session. Similarly, retrospective anxiety ratings were similar across studies, suggesting a comparable anxiety induction in both studies. We also collected data from multiple imaging modalities that both support the finding of enhanced IPS processing during periods of threat. In addition, we used the state-of-the-art multi-echo fMRI acquisition, and accompanying echo time-dependent independent components analysis to eliminate non-BOLD sources of noise from our fMRI data.</p><p>Although there were a number of strengths to our study, there were also several limitations. First, as mentioned above, our MEG study was not optimally designed to reliably detect differences in connectivity, which would have been an obvious parallel to the fMRI connectivity analysis. Second, because we had a relatively small sample size, this study was not optimally designed to study how individual variability in anxiety affected IPS activity/connectivity. Third, our initial goal was to collect both the fMRI and the MEG data in all subjects, but a number of subjects could not participate in both, making it difficult to compare the results at the single subject level. Fourth, given our interest in the relationship between alpha and connectivity, it might have been better to collect simultaneous fMRI and EEG. However, because of our interest in the startle data, it was important to present white noise probes in at least one of the experiments, and our MRI scanner does not currently have that capability. To overcome that limitation, we collected startle data in the MEG study, which we used to validate the continuous anxiety ratings, which were collected during both studies. Finally, another limitation with the MEG data is that we do not have a measure of within-block movement, making it difficult to determine whether motion differed between the safe and threat blocks; however, it should be noted that any trials contaminated by movement (i.e. muscle) artifact were removed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Current translational neuroscientific models of anxiety focus on regions of the canonical fear network as anatomical hubs for anxiety. However, support for these models in humans is often based on studies that focus on these regions <italic>a priori</italic> (i.e. seed-based functional connectivity), at the expense of rigorous, unbiased, whole-brain approaches. In this work we conduct two separate experiments, using complimentary imaging modalities (fMRI and MEG) to assess the effect of elevated state anxiety on functional connectivity and cortical excitability across the entire brain. In these studies, we identify effects in a common region, the IPS, which is a key node in the frontoparietal attention network. These results suggest that threat enhances processing in this region, possibly facilitating attentional processing, leading to increased vigilance. However, these results have broader implications for future research and treatment. First, our results suggest that elevated anxiety in humans is primarily a cognitive state that is not fully captured by the current translational models. Second, because the most prominent region contributing to elevated state anxiety is cortical, it may be possible to target this region with neuromodulatory methods and reduce anxiety.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-two (28 female; age: M = 28.45, SD = 6.23) healthy volunteers from the Washington DC metropolitan area were recruited to participate in the current study.

When triggered by a TTL pulse, the solenoid allowed air from the tank to pass through tubes to the air vortex generators.

The EMG signal was extracted from the recordings, bandpass filtered (30–500 Hz), rectified, and smoothed with a 20 ms time constant. The peak startle/eyeblink magnitude was determined during the 20–100 ms after the onset of the noise presentation. The peaks were then transformed to <italic>z</italic>-scores and converted to <italic>t</italic>-scores within-subjects to reduce large inter-individual differences in the overall magnitude of the startle reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blumenthal et al., 2005</xref>), and to facilitate comparison with the online anxiety ratings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Online ratings</title><p>Subjects reported their anxiety level continuously throughout the experiment using the response device. They also received continuous feedback via a colored circle in the center of the screen, updated at 60 Hz (A colored circle, as opposed to a moving cursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Schultz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balderston and Helmstetter, 2010</xref>], was chosen to minimize eye movements in the MEG study). As they updated their rating it updated the color of the circle, which ranged from white to red with 256 possible intermediate hues. Values representing these hues were used to numerically represent the subjects’ current anxiety level. During the MEG study, these ratings were sampled just prior to each startle probe for comparison with the startle magnitudes. Because startle probes were not presented during the MRI study, online ratings were sampled once per repetition (TR). The values were then transformed to <italic>z</italic>-scores and converted to <italic>t</italic>-scores within-subjects to facilitate comparison with the startle responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Procedure</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>MEG</title><p>On the day of the appointment, the subject arrived at the NIH clinical center, and completed the informed consent form, and pre-experiment questionnaire packet in the waiting room. Next, subjects were escorted to the MEG suite and given the instructions for the task. Afterward, the subject was prepped to enter the magnetically shielded room (MSR). Electrodes to deliver the shock and measure heartbeats/eyeblinks were attached and secured to the subject. In addition, head position indicator (HPI) coils were attached to the subject. One each was attached 1.5 cm anterior to the left and right tragi, and one was attached 1.5 cm superior to the nasion. Finally, the vortices were affixed to the subject’s hairnet, and secured over the ears. Once setup was completed, the subject was escorted into the MSR, given the shock workup procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Balderston et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2017b</xref>), and raised into place. Recording began with a 2-minresting run to ensure that there were no visual artifacts (breathing, jaw movement, etc.) in the data. After the resting run, the subject was asked the pre-experiment affective rating scales over the intercom. Once complete, the subject began the experiment.</p><p>During the experiment, the subject viewed two concentric circles (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The color of the outer circle indicated the type of block (orange = threat; blue = safe). The color of the inner circle indicated the subject’s current level of anxiety. The subject was instructed to keep the color scale updated continuously throughout the experiment with their current level of anxiety. They were instructed that red meant that they were extremely anxious, while white meant that they were not anxious at all. They were also instructed that they could adjust the color to any shade between red and white, depending on their anxiety level.</p><p>The experiment consisted of four runs, each of which were ~6 min long, determined dynamically by the length of the trials. Each run began with four presentations of the startle probes to facilitate habituation, and ensure no head movement. Next, we use the HPI coils to localize the subject’s head relative to the sensors. After head localization, the experimental portion of the run began. The experimental portion of the run consisted of two blocks each of safety and threat in alternating order. Each block contained eight presentations of the startle probe. Probes were separated by a variable interprobe interval (min = 6 s; max = 14 s), which was randomly determined for each probe. Shocks were presented during the threat blocks in randomly selected interprobe intervals, 2–4 s after the preceding probe. The number of shocks was randomly determined as well. Each run could contain between 0 and 2 shocks, and each interprobe interval had a 1 in 12 chance of containing a shock (unless the two shock ceiling had been reached).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>MRI</title><p>As with the MEG experiment, the subject arrived at the NIH clinical center, and completed the informed consent form, and pre-experiment questionnaire packet in the waiting room. Next subjects were escorted to the MRI control room and given the instructions for the task. Afterward, the subject was prepped for scanning. Electrodes to deliver the shock and record skin conductance were attached and secured to the subject. In addition, vitamin E capsules were attached to the subject in the same locations as the HPI coils during the MEG study, to facilitate coregistration of the structural MRI and MEG. Next the subject was escorted into the scan room, and given the shock workup procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Balderston et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2017b</xref>). Subjects were then given ear plugs, situated on the table, and connected to the pulse oximeter and breathing belt. Scanning began with a localizer, a T1-weighted structural scan, and two 30 s echo planar imaging (EPI) runs. These short EPI runs had opposing phase-encoding directions, and were used for EPI distortion correction (See below). After these, the subject was asked the pre-experiment affective rating scales over the intercom. Once complete, the subject began the experiment.</p><p>As in the MEG study, the subject viewed two concentric circles. The color of the outer circle indicated the type of block (orange = threat; blue = safe). The color of the inner circle indicated the subject’s current level of anxiety. The instructions for the task were the same as the MEG study as well, with the exception of the difference in response device.</p><p>The experiment consisted of four runs, each of which were ~8 min (490 s) long. Each run consisted of two blocks each of safety and threat in alternating order. The number of shocks was randomly determined as well. Each run could contain between 0 and 3 shocks at random intervals. There were no startle probes presented.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Affective rating scales</title><p>Prior to each experiment, subjects completed several standard psychological questionnaires, including the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Spielberger, 1987</xref>), the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Peterson and Heilbronner, 1987</xref>), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beck et al., 1988</xref>), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beck and Steer, 1987</xref>). At the start of both experiments and after each magnetoencephalography (MEG)/functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) run, subjects were given a set of affective rating scales: (1) How anxious are you (1 = not anxious, 9 = extremely anxious)? (2) How afraid are you (1 = not afraid, 9 = extremely afraid)? (3) How would you rate the intensity of the electrical stimulation (1 = not painful at all, 9 = uncomfortable but not painful)?</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>MRI acquisition</title><p>We collected four runs, each containing 245 multi-echo EPI images, using a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Skyra (Erlangen,Germany) fMRI system, and a 32-channel head coil. For each image, we collected 32 interleaved 3 mm slices (matrix = 64 mm×64 mm; FOV = 192 × 192) parallel to the AC-PC line (TR = 2 s; TEs = 12 ms, 24.48 ms, 36.96 ms; flip angle = 70°). These 32 slices covered the entire cerebrum, but did not cover the most posterior parts of the brainstem and cerebellum. Slices were collected with an anterior-to-posterior phase encoding direction. We also collected two, 10 image multi-echo EPI series with the same parameters and the same field of view; however, one of these series was collected with a posterior-to-anterior phase encoding direction, and these series were used to correct for EPI distortion in the phase encoding direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Morgan et al., 2004</xref>). We also acquired a multi-echo T1-weighted MPRAGE (TR = 2530 ms; TEs = 1.69 ms, 3.55 ms, 5.41 ms, 7.27 ms; flip angle = 7°). We acquired 176, 1 mm axial slices (matrix = 256 mm × 256 mm; field of view (FOV) = 256 mm × 256 mm), which were later co-registered to the EPI images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>MRI preprocessing</title><p>Functional images were preprocessed and analyzed using the AFNI software package (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Source code 1</xref> for processing and analysis scripts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Cox, 1996</xref>). EPI images for each run and each echo were first reconstructed, despiked (i.e. single voxel outliers were truncated), slice-time corrected, and then deobliqued. Then each volume in the series was registered to the first volume, and skull-stripped.</p><p>Preprocessed images were then entered into a multi-echo-independent components analysis using the meica.py script distributed with the AFNI software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Kundu et al., 2012</xref>). This analysis uses the T2* decay of BOLD signals, measured across the echoes to denoise the timeseries. The analysis first decomposes the timeseries into independent components using FastICA. Then it determines whether signal intensity across echoes decays in a manner consistent with what is expected from BOLD data. Components that fit the model are kept, components that do not (i.e. components where the signal intensity does not decay across echoes) are discarded. A new denoised timeseries is then synthesized from the components not discarded. This technique has been previously shown to robustly remove sources of noise corresponding to motion, physiology, and scanner artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Kundu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The denoised timeseries for all runs are then registered to the first run, scaled, and further denoised using a general linear model with regressors of no interest. Regressors of no interest included the six motion parameters from the volume registration step, up-through third-order polynomials to model baseline drift, and hemodynamic response functions (HRF)s corresponding to button presses and shock deliveries. In addition, images where the derivative of the motion regressors from volume registration step had a Euclidean norm above 0.5 mm were censored (‘scrubbed’) from further analyses. All remaining images from the safe and threat blocks were concatonated into separate timeseries; however, as part of the denoising procedure, we removed neural responses related to both button presses and transitions from one block type to another.</p><p>To correct for geometric distortion of the EPI images, the forward and reverse phase-encoding blips are first averaged across time, skull-stripped, and then rigid-body aligned with the reference image for the other EPI timeseries. Then, the two blips are non-linearly aligned to each other using the ‘plusminus’ flag in the AFNI program 3dQwarp, so that the resulting image is ‘in the middle’ of the two. This reference image can then be registered to the T1 image, and the voxelwise displacement map for the forward blip is then saved, so that it can be applied to the EPI timeseries. Although a standard linear registration approach would have possibly yielded similar results at the group level, the nonlinear approach we used leads to better T1/EPI within-subject registration, and has been shown to perform even better than when using fieldmaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Hong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To align the EPI data to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and to mask out non-grey matter voxels, the T1 data was processed as follows. First, the volumes for the T1 echoes were averaged, and the resulting volume was run through the standard Freesurfer processing pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Desikan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Fischl et al., 2004</xref>). Next, the skull-stripped anatomy is non-linearly registered to MNI space using the MNI_avg152T1 template distributed with AFNI. In addition, masks that included all cortical and sub-cortical grey matter atlas regions for each subject. These were warped to MNI space, downsampled to the EPI resolution, and dilated by 1 voxel. A group grey matter mask was created by averaging these binary masks, and thresholding out voxels with less than 2/3 overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Torrisi et al., 2015</xref>). Next the original space, skull-stripped anatomy was aligned to the distortion corrected EPI reference image in two steps. The first was a simple affine transformation. The second was a non-linear transformation using a criterion based on the local Pearson correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Saad et al., 2009</xref>), and the inverse displacement map was saved. Finally, the following warps were applied to the EPI timeseries data: inverse warp from the distortion correction step, affine transformation matrix from the T1 alignment step, the inverse warp from the T1 alignment step, and the non-linear warp from the T1 to MNI transformation. Finally, the EPI data were masked with the group grey matter mask, and blurred within this mask using a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>MRI analysis</title><p>To analyze the MRI recordings, we used a global brain correlation (GBC) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cole et al., 2010</xref>). In brief, we correlated each voxel in our grey matter mask with each other voxel in the mask, applied the Fisher’s Z transform, and summed across correlations. The result was a map where the value in each voxel reflected the strength of the correlation between that voxel and the rest of the brain. We conducted this GBC analysis for each subject and each condition, and used these values for further analysis. First, to identify changes in GBC across the entire brain, we averaged across voxels for safe and threat. We then conducted a paired-sample t-test on these averages. Next, to identify changes in GBC at the regional level, we analyzed the voxel-wise GBC for safe and threat. For this, we conducted a voxel-wise paired-sample t-test on the GBC values. Finally, to identify changes in connectivity with highly connected regions, we identified regions of interest (ROI)s from the voxel-wise GBC threat &gt; safe t-test, and correlated the timecourse of activity in these ROIs with every voxel in the brain for safe and threat, and applied the Fisher’s Z. We then conducted paired-sample t-tests on the resulting connectivity maps.</p><p>We used Monte Carlo simulations and a cluster-based method to correct for multiple comparisons across voxels. First, we estimated the smoothness in our residual timeseries using a Gaussian plus mono-exponential shaped function implemented by the ‘-acf’ option in the AFNI program 3dFWHMx, which addresses recent concerns over inflated Type one error in studies using the cluster correction method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Cox et al., 2016</xref>). We calculated smoothness for each subject, and averaged this across subjects. Next, we simulated 10,000 random statistical parametric maps in 3dClustSim with a smoothness matching that of the original timeseries. For each simulation, we thresholded at a voxel-wise alpha of 0.005, and extracted the largest cluster. We then compared our test statistics to the distribution of clusters across all simulations to identify a minimum cluster size threshold of 80, corresponding to a two-tailed alpha of 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>MEG acquisition</title><p>We recorded neuromagnetic activity at 600 Hz from 271 radial first-order gradiometers using a 275 channel CTF-OMEGA whole-head magnetometer (VSM MedTech, Ltd., Canada). Recording took place in a magnetically shielded room (Vacuumschmelze, Germany), and Synthetic third-order gradient balancing was used for active noise cancellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Vrba and Robinson, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>MEG preprocessing</title><p>MEG recordings were preprocessed and analyzed using the Fieldtrip toolbox in MATLAB (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Source code 1</xref> for processing and analysis scripts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>). First, movement within runs was checked by comparing the position of the HPI coils from the beginning of the run to the end of the run, and any run with a root mean square movement value above 1 cm was excluded from the analysis. Next, startle probe onsets were identified, and the 2 s window prior to each trial was extracted, demeaned, and detrended. Next, muscle artifacts were identified using the ft_artifact_muscle function in Fieldtrip. Trials where muscle movements were identified were removed. Next the recordings were low-pass filtered with a 90 Hz cutoff, and notch filtered at 60 Hz to remove line noise. The recordings were then downsampled to 300 Hz, and submitted to an independent components analysis. Components were visually inspected, and those with a topography, and timecourse consistent with either blinks or heartbeats were identified for removal (typically 1–2 per artifact). Rejected components were projected out of the dataset, and the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix was inspected to determine the regularization factor (lambda). A lambda of 5% was found to be sufficient to regularize the covariance matrix for source analysis following the removal of the rejected components. The result was a dataset cleaned for blink and heartbeat artifacts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>MEG frequency analysis</title><p>Because we were specifically interested in alpha oscillations, we identified each subject’s individual alpha frequency (IAF). We began by transforming the timeseries data into the frequency domain using a multi-taper fast Fourier transform (mtmfft) based on a set of discrete slepian sequences. In this initial transformation, we used a frequency window of 1 Hz to 20 Hz, and a single taper per frequency. We then averaged these spectrograms across sensors and across trials for each subject, and identified the largest local maxima in the average spectrogram for each subjects. For the majority of subjects (24/28), the largest peak occurred in the alpha frequency band (8–12 Hz). For all other subjects, the average IAF was used for further analyses. Next we conducted a second mtmfft, using a 2 Hz window centered around each subject’s IAF, with two tapers per frequency and averaged the resulting power estimates across frequency for each sensor and each trial. This mean IAF power estimate was used in both the sensor space analyses and the source space analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>MEG forward model</title><p>Single subject T1 images were used to generate the forward model for the MEG source analysis. First the T1 images were aligned to a single subject template in MNI space. Next the brain surface was extracted, and a single shell head model was generated from this surface. Then a source model was created using a single subject template with current dipoles placed along a regular 8 mm grid inside the brain surface. The single subject MNI space images were aligned to CTF space (i.e. coregistered to the sensors) manually, guided by the vitamin E capsules placed over the fiducial points. The resulting transformation matrix was applied to both the head model and the source model, and alignment between the sensors, head model, and source model was visually inspected. Finally, leadfields were then created using the location of the sensors, head model, and source model dipole locations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>MEG inverse model</title><p>Because we were interested in frequency information (as opposed to time), we used the dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Gross et al., 2001</xref>) technique to localize the sources of our recordings. We began by computing the cross spectral density matrix (CSD) from the frequencies of interest from all trials in the analysis. We then estimated the beamformer filter using the CSD, leadfields (with fixed orientations), headmodel, and gradiometer locations. Once estimated, this common filter was applied to the safe and threat conditions independently.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>MEG sensor-level analyses</title><p>We compared IAF power in safe vs. threat. For this, we averaged the IAF power across trials independently for safe and threat for each subject and each sensor, and conducted a paired sample t-test on these averages. For both analyses, we used Monte Carlo simulations and a cluster-based method to correct for multiple comparisons across sensors. We calculated 1000 random permutations, where condition labels were shuffled across subjects. For each permutation, we thresholded the shuffled results at a sensor-level alpha of 0.005, summed the t-value across sensors in each cluster, and extracted the largest summed t-value. We then compared our test-statistic to the distribution of summed t-values and discarded any clusters where the summed t-value was smaller than the summed t-value corresponding to a two-tailed alpha of 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>MEG source-level analyses</title><p>As with the sensor-level analyses, to compare power in the safe and threat conditions, we projected the average IAF power into source space independently for each condition using the common filter calculated from all trials.

As with the sensor-space data we used Monte Carlo simulations and a cluster-based method to correct for multiple comparisons across voxels. As before we calculated 1000 random permutations, where condition labels were shuffled across subjects. For each permutation, we thresholded the shuffled results at a source-level alpha of 0.005, summed the t-value across sensors in each cluster, and extracted the largest summed t-value.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Threat of shock increases excitability and connectivity of the intraparietal sulcus&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Van Essen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Krish Singh (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your paper was assessed positively by all three reviewers, with all three saying that this is a valuable addition to the literature and of broad scientific interest. In particular, the multi-modal aspect was well received. I am therefore happy to provisionally recommend publication, however a number of significant revisions must be successfully carried out first. On receiving your revised manuscript with explanatory comments, the Reviewing Editor will decide whether the manuscript needs to be seen again by the reviewers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>For fMRI, all of the technical concerns raised by reviewer 2 must be addressed comprehensively. These are copied in full below.</p><p>For MEG, both reviewers 1 and 3 suggest that a functional connectivity analysis would be a better candidate for comparison with your fMRI results than the current approach. I therefore strongly recommend that you undertake such analyses; here, a key confound is signal leakage between source space regions and an appropriate correction method must be employed. Though multiple schemes are available I would suggest using the approach published by Colclough, Brookes, Smith and Woolrich, 2015. (referenced by reviewer 1) but perhaps applied to a denser parcellation (e.g. the AAL parcellation). Again for completeness the reviewers comments are copied in full below.</p><p>Finally, a quantitative analysis of the similarity of the regions identified by MEG and fMRI must be given.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The paper by Balderston et al. describes a study in which both fMRI and MEG are used to investigate the neural correlates of anxiety. To this end, a threat of shock paradigm is employed to increase anxiety in subjects; this increase is then assessed behaviourally in multiple ways. Both fMRI and MEG data are acquired during the paradigm and analysed in an unbiased way; briefly, in fMRI an 'all-to-all' connectivity approach is used to measure connectivity among voxels. In MEG, data are analysed in multiple frequency bands and changes in oscillatory power between task blocks (safe versus threat of shock) characterised. The interesting result is that both the fMRI connectivity analysis and the α band power assessment both implicate the intraparietal sulcus as a key hub in processing anxiety.</p><p>Overall I believe this to be a very interesting and exciting paper. The primary finding is not only impactful for basic science but may also, potentially, have significant clinical relevance. The paper is well written and the analyses, for the most part, solid. However I do have a number of suggestions that I think would improve the paper.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1) It is assumed that the fMRI and MEG responses occur in the same location, however this was never analysed quantitatively. The distance between the fMRI cluster and the MEG peak location should be quantified. What are the chances that this difference could occur by chance?</p><p>2) It is not made clear in the Introduction why complementary analysis is not used – e.g. the MEG is used to assess oscillatory changes whereas fMRI is used to assess connectivity. Why? I realise of course the links that have been made between oscillations and connectivity but this is not well discussed in the paper (I personally didn't find the relation to the simultaneous EEG-fMRI literature very convincing). Why not just do a standard GLM approach to the BOLD analysis to get regions of increased BOLD response during threat and compare that with changes in α oscillations? In short, the analysis pipeline used should be better motivated.</p><p>3) Related to the above question, I found the MEG analysis quite limited. Wouldn't it have been better to take advantage of the huge steps forward in MEG connectivity methods that have been made recently and employ one such approach to measure whole brain α band connectivity – and then compare this to the fMRI connectivity. Its true that you couldn't do this at the voxel level spatial scale but with a brain parcellation it should be easily possible. See papers by e.g. Colclough, Brookes, Smith and Woolrich, 2015 or O'Neill et al., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9155/60/21/R271">http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9155/60/21/R271</ext-link></p><p>4) I felt there should be more justification for looking at the α band, which seems to have been chosen specifically, with the other frequency bands treated as an afterthought. Given the apparent close links between β oscillations and functional connectivity why was the β band not chosen? Again just saying that α was the strongest signal at many sensors didn't really convince me.</p><p>5) Can the authors give some explanation as to why the α response was lateralised?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>General</p><p>This study is a nice example of an investigation into neuronal mechanisms of anxiety that uses two different complementary modalities. However, some of the fMRI analysis approaches need further investigation to ensure that the results were not driven by noise, and the manuscript is longer than necessary in some places.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1) The within-network results do not pass multiple comparison correction and do not add much to the story. I would therefore suggest that the authors remove these results. In general, the manuscript should be shortened. Specifically the Discussion would benefit from being more concisely written, and the Materials and method could also be reduced (specifically the subject numbers and the 'on the day of the appointment…' text).</p><p>2) Was there a difference in motion parameters between the safe and threat blocks in fMRI? If so, this could lead to a shift between short-distance and long-distance connectivity, which could drive the results. The scrubbing that was performed most likely avoids this possibility, but it would be of interest to present the difference in motion parameters, and to potentially run further analyses to explicitly exclude this possibility (for example, by selecting periods or subjects in which the motion was matched between the two conditions).</p><p>3) How many time points were removed during scrubbing, and was there a significant difference between the safe and shock blocks for this? If so, the difference in power could bias the results, and it would be worth excluding this possibility by matching the number of timepoints included in shock and safe blocs (within participants).</p><p>4) The change in global connectivity during the shock period could occur as a result of the actual shock stimuli that were not present in the safe periods. I know the HRF responses to shocks and button presses were modeled and removed, but this may not capture the changes in functional connectivity resulting from shock stimuli. Would it be possible to repeat the analysis using only shock blocks that contained zero shocks to ensure that this is not driving the results?</p><p>5) Cluster-based corrections with an initial cluster forming threshold above 0.001 have been shown to suffer from inflated false positives (Eklund et al., 2016). The authors should at least point this out in the limitations, and should ideally repeat analyses using the latest guidelines.</p><p>6) The methods used in this study are described as unbiased and multimodal, which is a strong statement to make given that some of the whole-brain statistics might suffer from a false positive bias, and the different modalities are analysed separately, rather than in a joint multimodal approach.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I really enjoyed reading this paper, which is a valuable contribution to the field.

Using a sub-sampled atlas approach (say the AAL atlas) the authors could easily compare 'GBC&quot;-type connectivity matrices extracted with fMRI with those extracted with MEG, either using amplitude-amplitude coupling within frequency bands or phase-phase coupling. There are several recent papers using this approach, so it seems odd that the authors did not do this.</p><p>2) It is not absolutely clear in the Abstract/Introduction that when the authors talk about neural activity and connectivity in the IPS, they are really talking about haemodynamics measures (i.e. FMRI). This should be made clearer.</p><p>3) When presenting the fMRI-GBC (for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) I think it would be useful to show the spatial distribution across the brain of the connectivity measure i.e. after summing across rows but before global summing across the brain. This would be a companion figure to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which shows the voxelwise difference in connectivity strength between Threat v. Safe.

I wonder however if some extra clarification could be given: What frequency band was connectivity computed in (sincere apologies if I missed it)? I assume α? I'm also unsure as to what is meant by &quot;we then computed the Hilbert transform using a 500 ms sliding window&quot;? The Hilbert transform shouldn't need a sliding window – when undertaking this analysis we usually compute the HT over all time? Please clarify why this was done. Could the authors please show the MEG adjacency matrices for the safe and thread blocks independently, as well as the difference? This would allow the reader to confirm that the two separate matrices look sensible (one expects large occipital connectivity in the α band, see e.g. Hunt et al., 2016). Finally, given the strong finding of MEG connectivity in the β band, I would like to see the connectivity analysis attempted in this band. I of course read the authors argument that &quot;one might expect a high degree of stationarity in coherence of the β oscillations across time&quot; but I disagree, specifically because multiple papers (e.g. O'Neill et al., 2015; O'Neill et al., 2016; Baker et al., 2014) show that, in fact, β band functional connectivity is highly dynamic.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Threat of shock increases excitability and connectivity of the intraparietal sulcus&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

However this should not be the case (again see Hunt et al, 2016). It is quite hard for me to judge the spatial signature of connectivity as, unfortunately, in the pdf version the figure quality is too low resolution to read the region names on the axes. However, these matrices do not look correct to me and I would urge the authors to find out why.</p><p>In their response, the authors have suggested that they use blocks of only 2 seconds of envelope data. However they also apply downsampling prior to connectivity estimation. This to me seems silly – why apply the downsampling if you have such short blocks.

I also don't understand why such short data setments were used when in fact the blocks are quite long. Why not just try using the whole block?</p><p>I remain enthusiastic about this article, but I maintain that the MEG connectivity analysis has not yet been properly carried out.

I'm pleased that the authors were able to spot errors in their pipeline (use of incorrect spatial filters) although it does appear that the major difference came from the down-sampling, as suggested in my previous review. Downsampling over such a small time window is obviously incorrect so these analyses should now be discarded.</p><p>Unfortunately, the adjacency matrices still don't look right – without seeing them plotted on a brain it's hard to judge exactly where the primary pathways of connectivity are (and I still can’t read the labels clearly in the pdf). As I have said previously, the highest connectivity in the α band should be in the occipital lobe whilst the highest connectivity in the β band should encompass bilateral parietal and occipital connections alongside tempero-parietal and fronto-parietal networks (again as in Hunt et al, 2016). In fact this does not seem to be the case. In what the authors have provided the α network looks like pure noise. There is clearly some structure to the β band connectivity matrix although this doesn't really look like one would expect. So I strongly suspect something is still wrong with the analysis.</p><p>Without looking at the data directly it’s hard for me to judge but I suspect that the problem is the short time windows (unless there are other more basic errors (similar to the incorrect spatial filter) which the authors have not discovered). It is known that a reasonable amount of data is required to make MEG connectivity analyses work reliably (Luizzi et al., Optimising experimental design for MEG resting state functional connectivity measurement, NeuroImage 2016) and perhaps this is the reason the adjacency matrices look so poor. In the light of these failed attempts, I suggest that a paragraph is added to the Discussion stating that MEG connectivity analysis would have been a useful means to probe these data; however the study design was poorly set up to make such analyses work.</p><p>Please note that this must now be your final attempt to satisfy the Board.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>For fMRI, all of the technical concerns raised by reviewer 2 must be addressed comprehensively. These are copied in full below.</italic> </p><p>Reviewer 2 raised 6 technical concerns in their major issues section. Technical concern 1 was addressed as part of a larger effort to shorten the manuscript, and therefore will be described below in a separate section about manuscript length. Technical concerns 2-4 were all related to ruling out alternative explanations for our global connectivity results. These will be addressed together in the paragraphs below. Finally, technical concerns 5 and 6 were separate issues, and are addressed inline with the reviewer’s original comments.</p><p>In technical concerns 2-4, reviewer 2 questioned whether the following could explain our global connectivity results: 2) the difference in motion across block types (i.e. safe vs. threat), 3) the difference in the number of TRs censored across block types, and 4) the presentations of the shocks in the threat blocks. Before we describe the additional steps conducted to rule out these possibilities, we would like to note that we took very thorough steps in the original analysis to account for possible sources of noise in the fMRI data. First, we used the novel multi-echo ICA cleaning approach which identifies and eliminates sources of noise that do not exhibit the expected TE-dependence of the BOLD signal. Second, we used a strict threshold for head motion scrubbing (i.e. censoring TRs with a framewise displacement &gt; 0.5 mm). Third, we used a GLM to remove noise related to the 6 motion parameters from the EPI timeseries. Fourth, we modeled the HRF corresponding to each shock delivery, and included this as a regressor of no interest in above mentioned GLM.</p><p>To further address these questions, we began by examining whether motion and TRs censored differed across block type in the original analysis. To quantify motion, we calculated the Euclidean norm of framewise displacement across the six motion parameters after scrubbing, and averaged this across the TRs included in the analysis for each block type. We found that this indeed differed across the safe and threat blocks (t(24) = 15.32; p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, when we count the total TRs included in the analysis (Total TRs – Censored TRs) we found that this also differed across threat and safe blocks (t(24) = -6.89; p &lt; 0.001). Therefore to account for this difference, and to account for the potential effects of the shock delivery, we recalculated global brain connectivity (GBC) using a more selective set of TRs.</p><p>In this analysis, we censored the 10 TRs during the threat periods following each shock delivery, and then censored safe TRs so that the total number of TRs was equivalent across the safe and threat blocks, and the Euclidean norm of framewise displacement was as equivalent as possible across the safe and threat blocks (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref> for total number of TRs and framewise displacement before and after this correction). Although we were able to fully match the total number of TRs across blocks, the framewise displacement was not fully matched (t(24) = -3.75; p = 0.001). However, it should be noted that the average framewise displacement after this correction was very low (&lt; 1mm). To address this remaining difference in framewise displacement, we calculated the difference in framewise displacement across the safe and threat blocks, and used this value as a covariate in an ANCOVA looking at the effect of threat on GBC across this more selective set of TRs.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23608.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23608.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23608-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>Since the purpose of this analysis was to determine whether our original results remained after this more stringent scrubbing, we sampled GBC within the same ROIs identified by the original whole brain GBC analysis. We found that even after censoring out 10 TRs following the shock, matching the total number of TRs censored, closely matching framewise displacement, and factoring out the remaining differences in framewise displacement, we still see a significant difference in GBC as a function of threat in all 3 ROIs identified in the original analysis. These results suggest that our initial findings were not due to differences in motion, censoring, or residual neural activity evoked by the shock. We understand that these are important controls, and have therefore revised the original version of the manuscript to include the details of this analysis.</p><p><italic>For MEG, both reviewers 1 and 3 suggest that a functional connectivity analysis would be a better candidate for comparison with your fMRI results than the current approach. I therefore strongly recommend that you undertake such analyses; here, a key confound is signal leakage between source space regions and an appropriate correction method must be employed. Though multiple schemes are available I would suggest using the approach published by Colclough Brookes, Smith and Woolrich, 2015. (referenced by reviewer 1) but perhaps applied to a denser parcellation (e.g. the AAL parcellation). Again for completeness the reviewers comments are copied in full below.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this work would benefit from a connectivity analysis of the MEG data, and recognize that signal leakage is a serious issue affecting such analysis. Therefore, we have chosen to follow the reviewers’ advice and conduct an analysis of the differences in MEG connectivity as a function of threat, while accounting for signal leakage using the symmetric orthogonalisation method detailed by Colclough, Brookes, Smith and Woolrich, 2015.</p><p>We began by computing the virtual MEG channels using the single trial timecourses and leadfields computed in the original manuscript. Then, using the toolbox provided by Dr. Colclough (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/MEG-ROI-nets">https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/MEG-ROI-nets</ext-link>), we downsampled the source space MEG data to the AAL atlas, and computed the symmetric ortrhogonalization of the atlas space signals to remove any 0-phase correlations. We then computed the Hilbert transform using a 500 ms sliding window, low-pass filtered the data to 0.5 Hz, and downsampled the data to 1 Hz. Next we concatonated these envelope timeseries across all trials for safe and threat separately for each subject, and computed the cross correlation matrix for each subject and each block separately. To determine whether there were any differences in connectivity between safe and threat, we computed paired-sample t-tests at each cell of the cross correlation matrix. We then conducted 10,000 permutation tests and extracted the maximum t-value for each permutation in order to build a null distribution for these t-tests. Finally, we identified a corrected t-value at the 95 percentile of this distribution (t = 5.5), and thresholded the original t-map using this corrected t-value. As can be seen from the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>, there were no significant changes in pairwise functional connectivity as a function of threat based on this analysis and correction method.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.023</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23608.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23608.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23608-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>Given that the overall suggestion was to reduce the length of the manuscript, we have decided not to include this analysis in the revised submission.

We are happy to make additional changes if requested.</p><p><italic>Finally, a quantitative analysis of the similarity of the regions identified by MEG and fMRI must be given.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this reviewer that it is important to demonstrate the correspondence between the regions identified by the MEG and fMRI analyses. Accordingly, we have prepared a conjunction map of these two results, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 3</xref>. There are two major points illustrated by this map. First, although the fMRI results are bilateral, the MEG results are unilateral. This point will be addressed below. Second, the fMRI cluster in the left IPS substantially overlaps with the source space MEG cluster (46 of 81 voxels). Due to the recommendation to reduce the length of the manuscript, we did not include this figure in the revised version of the manuscript. However, we did revise the Results section to reflect this finding. If requested, we would be happy to add a figure with this result to the manuscript.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.024</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23608.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23608.024</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23608-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Major comments</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It is assumed that the fMRI and MEG responses occur in the same location, however this was never analysed quantitatively. The distance between the fMRI cluster and the MEG peak location should be quantified. What are the chances that this difference could occur by chance?</italic> </p><p>This point has been addressed in the general comments to the editor, see above.</p><p><italic>2) It is not made clear in the Introduction why complementary analysis is not used – e.g. the MEG is used to assess oscillatory changes whereas fMRI is used to assess connectivity. Why? I realise of course the links that have been made between oscillations and connectivity but this is not well discussed in the paper (I personally didn't find the relation to the simultaneous EEG-fMRI literature very convincing). Why not just do a standard GLM approach to the BOLD analysis to get regions of increased BOLD response during threat and compare that with changes in α oscillations? In short, the analysis pipeline used should be better motivated.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this reviewer that a standard GLM approach to analyze the BOLD data might be a better match for the analysis of the MEG oscillation data. However, our blocks were quite long for fMRI data ~2 min, and therefore subject to baseline drifts. Although there are approaches to minimize the contributions of these baseline drifts to activation estimates (including the multi-echo ICA denoising technique used here), it is unclear whether these techniques are robust enough to warrant conducting the additional GLM approach suggested. Given the recommendation to reduce the overall length of the manuscript, we have decided not to include this analysis. However, we are happy to conduct the GLM analysis, and include it in the paper if deemed necessary.</p><p><italic>3) Related to the above question, I found the MEG analysis quite limited. Wouldn't it have been better to take advantage of the huge steps forward in MEG connectivity methods that have been made recently and employ one such approach to measure whole brain α band connectivity – and then compare this to the fMRI connectivity. Its true that you couldn't do this at the voxel level spatial scale but with a brain parcellation it should be easily possible. See papers by e.g. Colclough, Brookes, Smith and Woolrich, 2015 or O'Neill et al., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9155/60/21/R271">http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9155/60/21/R271</ext-link> </italic></p><p>We agree that MEG connectivity is an interesting topic, and have undertaken the analysis described in Colclough, Brookes, Smith and Woolrich, 2015. This analysis is described in the general comments to the editor, see above.</p><p><italic>4) I felt there should be more justification for looking at the α band, which seems to have been chosen specifically, with the other frequency bands treated as an afterthought. Given the apparent close links between β oscillations and functional connectivity why was the β band not chosen? Again just saying that α was the strongest signal at many sensors didn't really convince me.</italic> </p><p>We agree that there is a strong connection between functional connectivity and β oscillations. Indeed, a careful examination of spontaneous β oscillations can uncover a set of resting state networks that is remarkably similar to those identified from spontaneous fluctuations in BOLD data. However, given that resting state networks identified from BOLD data are highly correlated with independent measures of anatomical connectivity, one might expect a high degree of stationarity in coherence of the β oscillations across time. This might be acceptable if the purpose of this study were to identify correlations between resting state networks and anxiety across subjects. However, the purpose of this study was to determine how a within-subject experimental manipulation of anxiety affects spontaneous measures of neural activity/connectivity.</p><p>Although the focus of the paper was on α, our initial approach (described in the Introduction) was to examine all frequency bands independently. The focus on α emerged out of the observations that, 1) α was the strongest signal in the recordings, 2) α showed the largest power changes as a function of threat, 3) α was the only frequency band that showed consistent results at both the sensor and the source level, 4) the source space results aligned nicely with the corresponding fMRI GBC data.</p><p>It should also be noted that there are several theoretical reasons to focus on α as well. For instance, it is well established that spontaneous neural activity at rest is dominated by oscillations in the α (8-12 Hz) range, which are most prominent when the subject is in an alert state of restful relaxation, and that α asymmetries can reflect differences in arousal across subjects. Theoretical models of α function suggest that α oscillations are generated by coherent activity in local inhibitory interneurons, and that decreases in α power reflects increases in cortical excitability. Consistent with these theories, studies collecting simultaneous measures of electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI have shown that α power is negatively correlated with functional connectivity.</p><p>Given these points, we believe that it is appropriate to focus primarily on the α results. However, we agree that this motivation should be clarified. This is especially true given that we have chosen to remove the results from the other frequency bands, in order to respond to the request to shorten the manuscript. Therefore we have revised the Discussion section of the manuscript to clarify our motivation for focusing primarily on the α results.</p><p><italic>5) Can the authors give some explanation as to why the α response was lateralised?</italic> </p><p>There is actually a robust literature on α asymmetry and emotional processing. According to prominent models, left dominant frontal α is associated with positive affect and/or approach behavior, while right dominant α is associated with negative affect and/or avoidance behavior (Davidson 2004; Harmon-Jones, Gable and Peterson, 2010). Like the valence model of α asymmetry, one prominent model on parietal α asymmetry is rooted in the arousal-valence model of emotional processing (Heller, 1993). According to this model, right dominant parietal α is associated with increased arousal. Consistent with this theory, we find that threat of shock, which increases arousal, also reduces left parietal α, resulting in a right dominant profile. However, more research should be conducted to specifically test this hypothesis. We understand that this is an important point, and have revised the manuscript to include a brief discussion of this aspect of the findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>General</italic> </p><p><italic>This study is a nice example of an investigation into neuronal mechanisms of anxiety that uses two different complementary modalities. However, some of the fMRI analysis approaches need further investigation to ensure that the results were not driven by noise, and the manuscript is longer than necessary in some places.</italic> </p><p><italic>Major comments</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The within-network results do not pass multiple comparison correction and do not add much to the story. I would therefore suggest that the authors remove these results. In general, the manuscript should be shortened. Specifically the Discussion would benefit from being more concisely written, and the Materials and method could also be reduced (specifically the subject numbers and the 'on the day of the appointment…' text).</italic> </p><p>This point has been addressed in the general comments to the editor, see above.</p><p><italic>2) Was there a difference in motion parameters between the safe and threat blocks in fMRI? If so, this could lead to a shift between short-distance and long-distance connectivity, which could drive the results. The scrubbing that was performed most likely avoids this possibility, but it would be of interest to present the difference in motion parameters, and to potentially run further analyses to explicitly exclude this possibility (for example, by selecting periods or subjects in which the motion was matched between the two conditions).</italic> </p><p>As with point 1, this point has been addressed in the general comments to the editor, see above.</p><p><italic>3) How many time points were removed during scrubbing, and was there a significant difference between the safe and shock blocks for this? If so, the difference in power could bias the results, and it would be worth excluding this possibility by matching the number of timepoints included in shock and safe blocs (within participants).</italic> </p><p>As with point 1 and 2, this point has been addressed in the general comments to the editor, see above.</p><p><italic>4) The change in global connectivity during the shock period could occur as a result of the actual shock stimuli that were not present in the safe periods. I know the HRF responses to shocks and button presses were modeled and removed, but this may not capture the changes in functional connectivity resulting from shock stimuli. Would it be possible to repeat the analysis using only shock blocks that contained zero shocks to ensure that this is not driving the results?</italic> </p><p>As with points 1, 2, and 3, this point has been addressed in the general comments to the editor, see above.</p><p><italic>5) Cluster-based corrections with an initial cluster forming threshold above 0.001 have been shown to suffer from inflated false positives (Eklund et al., 2016). The authors should at least point this out in the limitations, and should ideally repeat analyses using the latest guidelines.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, we agree that several common approaches to multiple comparisons suffer from inflated Type 1 error, as indicated by Eklund et al., 2016. Cluster thresholding, as implemented by the AFNI program 3dClustSim, had, until recently, used Gaussian estimates of the noise smoothness in the monte carlo simulations, which do not appropriately model the noise smoothness of BOLD data. The AFNI team has since provided new option that models the noise smoothness using a Gaussian plus mono-exponential spatial AutoCorrelation Function (ACF), which addresses the criticisms raised by the Eklund paper.</p><p>See:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/26/065862">http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/26/065862</ext-link></p><p>In the current work, we used the newly created autocorrelation function to estimate the smoothness of the noise in our data, which was used to identify minimum cluster-size threshold reported in the manuscript. We realize that this was not sufficiently explained in the original version of the manuscript, and have therefore clarified this methodological detail in the revised version.</p><p>In addition, although our voxelwise p-value is higher than recommended by the reviewer, this is offset by a larger minimum cluster-size threshold. This, combined with the fact that our results are bilateral and consistent with the MEG data, leads us to conclude that it is unlikely that our results are due to Type 1 error.</p><p><italic>6) The methods used in this study are described as unbiased and multimodal, which is a strong statement to make given that some of the whole-brain statistics might suffer from a false positive bias, and the different modalities are analysed separately, rather than in a joint multimodal approach.</italic> </p><p>The main finding of the current work is that aspects of IPS functioning are affected by the threat of shock manipulation. We show this in two ways: first we show that α oscillations are decreased by threat of shock (MEG), second we show that global IPS functional connectivity is increased by threat of shock (fMRI). These two independent findings are significant at the whole brain level, corrected for multiple comparisons. For that reason, we feel that it is appropriate to refer to these findings as both unbiased and multimodal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Here are my main comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It seems as if there is a missed opportunity here in terms of directly comparing connectivity measures in fMRI to those extracted with MEG (albeit at the group-level). Using a sub-sampled atlas approach (say the AAL atlas) the authors could easily compare 'GBC&quot;-type connectivity matrices extracted with fMRI with those extracted with MEG, either using amplitude-amplitude coupling within frequency bands or phase-phase coupling. There are several recent papers using this approach, so it seems odd that the authors did not do this.</italic> </p><p>This point has been addressed in the general comments to the editor, see above.</p><p><italic>2) It is not absolutely clear in the Abstract/Introduction that when the authors talk about neural activity and connectivity in the IPS, they are really talking about haemodynamics measures (i.e. FMRI).

These points have been clarified in the revised version of the manuscript (See Abstract and Introduction).</p><p><italic>3) When presenting the fMRI-GBC (for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) I think it would be useful to show the spatial distribution across the brain of the connectivity measure i.e. after summing across rows but before global summing across the brain. This would be a companion figure to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which shows the voxelwise difference in connectivity strength between Threat v. Safe. Based on my comment 1 above it would be great to see similar visualisations based on frequency-specific MEG connectivity maps.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the revised version of the manuscript would benefit from this figure. Therefore, we have updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> to reflect this change. As for the MEG connectivity maps, we conducted the functional connectivity analysis recommended by the editor, which yielded no significant results. Given the overall recommendation to shorten the manuscript, we have decide not to include these results in the final work. However, we are happy to add this work if deemed necessary.</p><p><italic>4) In the MEG analysis, it looks like some trials are rejected if contaminated with artefacts. I just wanted to check that the statistical tests performed later (between Safe and Threat) properly account for differing number of trials.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, when we examine the number of trials included in the analysis across conditions, we do see a difference in the number of trials for the safe and threat conditions. In the safe condition there were on average 58.21 ± 5.5 trials, while in the threat condition there were on average 55.32 ± 7.6 trials, which was significantly different across subjects (t(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">27</xref>) = 2.78, p = 0.01). Therefore, we decided to determine whether this difference in trial number impacted our results at the censor and source level. Accordingly, we included the difference in trial number across safe and threat blocks as a covariate in an ANCOVA examining the effect of threat on α responses. At both the sensor (f(1,26) = 7.48, p = 0.01) and at the source (f(1,26) = 17.797, p &lt; 0.001), we find that even with the difference in number of trials covaried out, the effects of threat on α power is still significant, suggesting that this difference did not significantly impact our results. This analysis has been included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) In the MEG analysis, did the authors check that there was no difference in head movement between the Safe and Threat blocks?</italic></p><p>Unfortunately we are unable to determine this from our current data. In this study we determined the amount of motion by comparing the subject’s position before a run to their position after the run. Accordingly, we did not have an online measure of motion within a given run. Each run contained four blocks: two safe and two threat, so we do not have condition specific measures of motion for the MEG study. We agree that this is a limitation of the current work, and have added a statement to the Discussion to address this limitation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>We thank the authors for their careful consideration of the comments of all three reviewers, and for the extra analyses that have been undertaken. The paper is much improved as a result of these changes and is now close to publication. However, a few points remain to be addressed.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) I consider the conjunction map, provided in the response to reviewers, to be critical to the paper and I would very much like to see this in the main paper, perhaps added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this conjunction map is an important part of the work, and are happy to add it to the main paper. We have added it as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Its rather a shame that the MEG connectivity analysis didn't work, but nevertheless I thank the authors for attempting it. I wonder however if some extra clarification could be given: What frequency band was connectivity computed in (sincere apologies if I missed it)? I assume α? I'm also unsure as to what is meant by &quot;we then computed the Hilbert transform using a 500 ms sliding window&quot;? The Hilbert transform shouldn't need a sliding window – when undertaking this analysis we usually compute the HT over all time? Please clarify why this was done. Could the authors please show the MEG adjacency matrices for the safe and thread blocks independently, as well as the difference? This would allow the reader to confirm that the two separate matrices look sensible (one expects large occipital connectivity in the α band, see e.g. Hunt et al., 2016). Finally, given the strong finding of MEG connectivity in the β band, I would like to see the connectivity analysis attempted in this band. I of course read the authors argument that &quot;one might expect a high degree of stationarity in coherence of the β oscillations across time&quot; but I disagree, specifically because multiple papers (e.g. O'Neill et al., 2015; O'Neill et al. 2016; Baker et al. 2014) show that, in fact, β band functional connectivity is highly dynamic.</italic> </p><p>There were several points raised in the above comment. For clarity, we have numbered these, and addressed them below.</p><p>a) This is correct. Given that the other analyses in the paper were focused on the α band, we conducted the connectivity analyses in the α band as well.</p><p>b) This statement was made in error. We were describing the functionality of the power envelope calculation implemented in the MEG-ROI-nets toolbox, and mistakenly mixed up the steps. Upon reviewing the methods of the Colclough, Brookes, Smith and Woolrich, 2015, and the matlab functions provided by Dr. Colclough on github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/MEG-ROI-nets">https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/MEG-ROI-nets</ext-link>), it is clear that these functions compute the power envelope by first taking the Hilbert transform, then low-pass filtering the data, and finally downsampling the data using a sliding window approach.</p><p>c) We have attached the adjacency matrices for the safe and threat conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 4</xref>. Although the matrices do not exactly match those from Hunt et. al 2016, there appears to be α connectivity in the occipital lobe for both safe and threat conditions. One possible reason for the difference across studies is that we calculated connectivity across a series of discrete events (the 2 seconds prior to each startle probe). We understand that these short blocks are not optimal for studying connectivity; however, the study was initially designed to investigate pre-stimulus activity and startle magnitude under threat.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.025</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Α connectivity across AAL regions during 2 second baseline prior to startle probe.</title><p><bold>A</bold>) Mean α connectivity across AAL regions during safe periods. <bold>B</bold>) Mean α connectivity across AAL regions during threat periods. <bold>C</bold>) Unthresholded T-test results comparing α connectivity during safe and threat conditions.

We used the exact approach as in the previous study. Briefly, we bandpass filtered the data, downsampled it to the AAL atlas, applied the orthogonalization procedure detailed in Colclough, Brookes, Smith and Woolrich, 2015, computed the Hilbert transform, downsampled the power envelopes, and computed pairwise t-tests at each node of the adjacency matrices. Note that, like α, there were no significant differences in β connectivity from safe to threat after correcting for multiple comparisons. Although it may be interesting to explore changes in MEG connectivity as a function of threat, perhaps future studies can be conducted to examine this question. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 5</xref>.</p><p>Because the connectivity analysis involves downsampling the power envelopes, one recommendation for future studies would be to ensure longer windows of clean data by removing the startle probes from the experimental design. We included the startle probes as a way to probe anxiety throughout the safe and threat blocks, however, because blink magnitude differs across conditions, the blink artifact also differs across conditions. Although beamforming can theoretically remove the artifact induced by the blink response, the only way to ensure that the blink artifact does not differentially affect the MEG signal is to remove the contaminated time periods from the analysis, or remove the startle probes from the design to begin with.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.026</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Β connectivity across AAL regions during 2 second baseline prior to startle probe.</title><p><bold>A</bold>) Mean β connectivity across AAL regions during safe periods. <bold>B</bold>) Mean β connectivity across AAL regions during threat periods. <bold>C</bold>) Unthresholded T-test results comparing β connectivity during safe and threat conditions.

However, something has clearly gone wrong here in the analysis.</italic></p><p><italic>By my assessment of the adjacency matrices presented, the case for the α and β bands look virtually identical. However this should not be the case (again see Hunt et al., 2016). It is quite hard for me to judge the spatial signature of connectivity as, unfortunately, in the pdf version the figure quality is too low resolution to read the region names on the axes. However, these matrices do not look correct to me and I would urge the authors to find out why.</italic> </p><p>We would like to thank you for noticing this abnormality, and encouraging us to troubleshoot our MEG connectivity scripts. Indeed, we did notice an error in the analysis that affected the estimation of connectivity in the β band. When switching from α to β band we initially neglected to change the leadfield file during the construction of the virtual timeseries. This lead to an estimation of connectivity in the β band using the spatial filter optimized for the α band. This was an oversight, and has been corrected in the revised analyses. In addition, we understand that the original figures were difficult to read in the auto-generated PDF, and have included the original picture files for all adjacency matrices as a separate zip attachment.</p><p>After correcting this mistake, we re-ran the β connectivity analysis using the same method as in the previous revision. When looking at the adjacency matrices from the downsampled power envelopes, we noticed that the α and β adjacency matrices still looked very similar (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Author response image 6</xref>).<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.027</object-id><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Adjacency matrices constructed from downsampled timeseries for the α and β bands.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23608.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23608.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23608-resp-fig6-v2"/></fig></p><p>Therefore, as recommended in your decision letter we re-ran the connectivity analyses for both the α and β bands using the non-downsampled, Hilbert-transformed, orthogonalized timeseries. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Author response image 7</xref>) This analysis yielded adjacency matrices for the α and β band that looked more distinct than the analysis using the downsampled timeseries. However, the resulting correlation coefficients were much smaller from the non-downsampled timeseries.<fig id="fig15" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23608.028</object-id><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Adjacency matrices constructed from non-downsampled timeseries for the α and β bands.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23608.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23608.028</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23608-resp-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><p>One possibility for this reduction in the magnitude of the correlations is that some of the structure in the initial adjacency matrices resulted from variability across trials, and this variability represented a smaller proportion of the overall variability when the analysis was based on the non-downsampled timeseries. This might also explain why the adjacency matrices for the α and β bands looked so similar when constructed from the downsampled timeseries. To test this possibility, we z-scored the individual trial data before concatenating the trial timeseries and conducting the correlations. If across trial variability is sufficient to explain the larger correlation coefficients and similarity between the adjacency matrices, these effects should be eliminated by the z-scoring. This does not appear to be the case. Based on the resulting adjacency matrices, the downsampled data yield higher correlation coefficients, and the adjacency matrices from the downsampled data look similar between the α and β bands.

However, it should be noted that this approach did not yield any significant differences in connectivity as a function of threat (See the high-resolution images included in the attached zip file). Furthermore, although the other approaches seemed to be sub-optimal, we tested whether there were any differences in connectivity as a function of threat with these as well, and were unable to identify any significant differences. In summary, we feel we have conducted a thorough analysis of the connectivity data, using methods recommended by both yourself and the reviewers, and were unable to identify any changes in connectivity as a function of threat.</p><p>Although we are happy to conduct additional analyses if requested, we feel that these analyses will likely be unfruitful, and only delay a decision on the manuscript. We understand that you are enthusiastic about the manuscript, and hope that you find it acceptable in its current form.</p><p><italic>In their response, the authors have suggested that they use blocks of only 2 seconds of envelope data. However they also apply downsampling prior to connectivity estimation. This to me seems silly – why apply the downsampling if you have such short blocks. It is well established that connectivity works without the downsampling so perhaps removing that step might improve the adjacency matrices. I also don't understand why such short data setments were used when in fact the bliocks are quite long. Why not just try using the whole block?</italic> </p><p>We agree that downsampling the timeseries prior to conducting the correlation analyses was not the best approach, and have addressed this limitation (See response above).</p><p>We also agree that analyzing the entire block (rather than a series of 2 s periods) might yield more power to detect a potential difference in connectivity as a function of threat. However, we initially chose to segment the data into 2 s intervals corresponding to the pre-startle period for 2 reasons. 1) We wanted to characterize the effect of threat on pre-stimulus oscillations during the otherwise well-studied threat of shock paradigm. 2) We wanted to minimize the effect of the blink artifact on our power estimates. This is especially important in our study because startle-elicited blinks (and thus the blink artifact) are larger under threat. Although it could be argued that the adaptive beamformer spatial filter should remove noise associated with blinks from the data, we prefer a more conservative approach, and therefore chose to include only verifiably clean data in our analysis.</p><p>Again, we understand that using the data from the entire block may yield more power for the connectivity analysis, this would require re-analyzing and cleaning the data from scratch. Not only would this be time consuming, but it would also require re-running the data-cleaning ICA and the beamformer analysis, which would bring the connectivity data out of sync with the power data reported in the manuscript. If there were some indication that our current null connectivity results may be due to type 2 error, it could be argued that this re-analysis would be justified. However, given that several previous analyses yielded no effect of threat on connectivity in the MEG data, we do not feel that our results are due to type 2 error, and feel that this re-analysis of the whole-block data would not be fruitful.</p><p>Although we are happy to undertake the analysis if requested, it would require a substantial amount of time, and would significantly delay decision on the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>I would like to thank the authors for their attempt at addressing my concerns. I'm pleased that the authors were able to spot errors in their pipeline (use of incorrect spatial filters) although it does appear that the major difference came from the down-sampling, as suggested in my previous review. Downsampling over such a small time window is obviously incorrect so these analyses should now be discarded.</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>In the light of these failed attempts, I suggest that a paragraph is added to the Discussion stating that MEG connectivity analysis would have been a useful means to probe these data; however the study design was poorly set up to make such analyses work.</italic> </p><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and we agree that this addition is necessary. In order address this concern we have added the following paragraph to the functional connectivity section of the Discussion, and edited the limitations section to be consistent with this addition.</p><p>An obvious parallel to the fMRI connectivity analysis would be to conduct a similar whole brain connectivity analysis of the MEG data. Not only would corroborating evidence from an independent imaging modality strengthen the fMRI connectivity results, but results from MEG specifically would allow for a frequency specific analysis of the effects of threat on functional connectivity (Brookes et al., 2011; Hillebrand et al., 2012). However, the current study was not optimized to reliably detect differences in MEG connectivity. In the current study we included the white noise probes as a way to obtain a quantitative measure of anxiety throughout the safe and threat blocks (Grillon et al., 1999). These white noise probes trigger the acoustic startle reflex, which varies as a function of an individual’s current level of anxiety (Grillon, 2008). Unfortunately, these reflexive blinks also inject an artifact into the MEG signal, and because the magnitude of these blinks differs across conditions, the blink artifact also differs across conditions. Although adaptive beamforming can theoretically remove the artifact induced by the blink response (Van Veen et al., 1997), the only way to ensure that the blink artifact does not differentially affect the MEG signal is to remove the contaminated time periods from the analysis, or remove the startle probes from the design at the outset. In the current study, we chose to address this limitation by extracting two-second time windows prior to each startle presentation to minimize the effect of the blink artifact on our power estimates. However, it has been shown that reliability of the MEG connectivity estimates increases as the duration of the recording increases, and durations of ~10 min or greater may be needed to maximize reliability (Liuzzi et al., 2016). Therefore, using such short intervals did not allow for the ability to obtain reliable estimates of MEG connectivity. Future studies should be conducted to address this limitation. In addition, it will be important to use appropriate correction methods to account for signal leakage between source space regions (Colclough, Brookes, Smith and Woolrich, 2015), and verify that the resulting connectivity estimates match previously published work (i.e. strong α connectivity in occipital regions and strong β connectivity linking the parietal cortex with other frontal, temporal, and occipital regions; (Hunt et al., 2016)).</p></body></sub-article></article>
