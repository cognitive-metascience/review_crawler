After injury these muscle stem cells exit quiescence, proliferate and differentiate to regenerate damaged fibres. We show that this progression is accompanied by metabolic changes leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> single and double mutant mice that provide genetic models of deregulated redox states, we demonstrate that moderate overproduction of ROS results in premature differentiation of satellite cells while high levels lead to their senescence and regenerative failure. Using the ROS scavenger, N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC), in primary cultures we show that a physiological increase in ROS is required for satellite cells to exit the cell cycle and initiate differentiation through the redox activation of p38α MAP kinase. Subjecting cultured satellite cells to transient inhibition of P38α MAP kinase in conjunction with NAC treatment leads to their rapid expansion, with striking improvement of their regenerative potential in grafting experiments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>muscle stem cell</kwd><kwd>redox state</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>Pitx2/3</kwd><kwd>cell therapy</kwd><kwd>p38α MAPK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie IRG 248496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>L'honoré</surname><given-names>Aurore</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoc Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>L'honoré</surname><given-names>Aurore</given-names></name><name><surname>Pallafacchina</surname><given-names>Giorgia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Domaine d’Intérêt Majeur STEM-Pole</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>L'honoré</surname><given-names>Aurore</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004923</institution-id><institution>AFM-Téléthon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friguet</surname><given-names>Bertrand</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>REGSAT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buckingham</surname><given-names>Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-73</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buckingham</surname><given-names>Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OptiStem 223098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buckingham</surname><given-names>Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004923</institution-id><institution>AFM-Téléthon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montarras</surname><given-names>Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Modulation of muscle stem cell redox state in culture both improves their amplification while maintaining a similar grafting potential as freshly isolated stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In adult mammals, many tissues can undergo repair in response to injury due to the presence of stem cells. In contrast to embryonic stem cells, most adult stem cells are maintained in a quiescent state in specialized niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lander et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ema and Suda, 2012</xref>). In response to tissue damage or changes in their microenvironment, they exit quiescence, proliferate and then differentiate in order to regenerate the tissue, or self-renew to reconstitute the stem cell pool. Progression from quiescence to proliferation and differentiation requires metabolic flexibility to adapt to changing energy demands, as exemplified by hematopoietic stem cells which when quiescent mainly rely on glycolysis, but upon activation depend on active mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simsek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takubo et al., 2013</xref>). Such a metabolic switch, which is critical for responding to bio-energetic needs, may also be implicated in the regulation of adult stem cell behaviour, as observed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are by-products of oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murphy, 2009</xref>). Although detrimental when in excess, ROS can serve as signalling molecules at physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Autréaux and Toledano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sena and Chandel, 2012</xref>), and their regulation is now emerging as an important facet of stem cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigarella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khacho and Slack, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Moal et al., 2017</xref>). Thus increased ROS production when quiescent hematopoietic stem cells switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation has been shown to be critical for priming their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jung et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to enhancing stem cell proliferation, moderate levels of ROS can also affect cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khacho and Slack, 2017</xref>). However, it is still unclear how ROS levels in adult stem cells can modulate the critical balance between proliferation and differentiation in an in vivo context and whether this impacts tissue homeostasis and regeneration.</p><p>To address this issue we have used the model of adult muscle stem cells, known as satellite cells, which progress from quiescence to proliferation and differentiation during skeletal muscle regeneration. While quiescent satellite cells have a low redox state, we observed a marked increase in ROS levels in activated cells, with a peak occurring prior to the onset of muscle differentiation. To investigate the effect of redox regulation on satellite cell behaviour, we employed conditional mouse mutants for <italic>Pitx2</italic> and <italic>Pitx3</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gage et al., 1999a</xref>), encoding homeodomain transcription factors that we previously identified as critical regulators of cell redox state during foetal myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">L'honoré et al., 2014</xref>). We found that the intracellular ROS level is a critical regulator of satellite cell behaviour, acting through p38α MAP kinase activity. While the moderate overproduction of ROS observed in the single <italic>Pitx3</italic> mutant results in the premature differentiation of satellite cells, excessive ROS levels seen in double <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> mutants lead to impaired skeletal muscle regeneration due to accumulation of DNA damage and senescence of satellite cells. Reduction of ROS levels by the antioxidant N-Acetyl-Cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richards et al., 2011</xref>), together with inhibition of P38α MAP kinase signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Segalés et al., 2016</xref>), leads to robust expansion of satellite cells in culture. Satellite cells cultured under these conditions show high in vivo expansion and regenerative potential upon grafting, with implications for muscle cell therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased ROS and mitochondrial biogenesis mark the progression of satellite cells towards terminal differentiation</title><p>To investigate the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism in quiescent and committed myoblasts, we first performed a transcriptome analysis with Pax3(GFP)-positive satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pallafacchina et al., 2010</xref>) purified by flow cytometry from adult <italic>Pax3<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> (Adult), postnatal day 7 <italic>Pax3<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> (P7) and adult dystrophic <italic>mdx/mdx:Pax3<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic>(<italic>mdx</italic>) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Compared with quiescent satellite cells from adult muscle, activated satellite cells present during post-natal development, or in <italic>mdx</italic> muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pallafacchina et al., 2010</xref>), which in the absence of Dystrophin undergo chronic regeneration, showed up-regulation of genes implicated in fatty acid metabolism and in oxidative phosphorylation, including regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Such activated cells, marked by the onset of <italic>Myogenin</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), display increased levels of ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), showing that activation is accompanied by metabolic changes involving increase in both mitochondrial activity and ROS production. We then investigated mitochondrial activity during the transition from proliferation to differentiation. Satellite cells were purified by flow cytometry from <italic>pectoralis</italic>, diaphragm and abdominal muscles of adult <italic>Pax3<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> mice and both respiration and glycolysis were measured by Seahorse analysis after different days of culture (D2-D4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). While proliferative satellite cells (D2) predominantly display glycolytic metabolism, the contribution of oxidative phosphorylation increases at day 3 (D3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>), a time that precedes differentiation by one day, as evidenced by <italic>Myogenin</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). To investigate the kinetics of mitochondrial function and of ROS production in vivo during muscle regeneration, satellite cells were then purified by flow cytometry from <italic>pectoralis</italic> muscles of adult <italic>Pax3<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> mice at different days (D0 to D7) after notexin-induced injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While quiescent satellite cells are characterized by a low mitochondrial mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Latil et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tang and Rando, 2014</xref>), we observed an increase in mitochondrial mass occuring two days after injury and continuing thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). This increase precedes the onset of differentiation, marked by <italic>Myogenin</italic> expression and down-regulation of <italic>Pax7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Strikingly, quantification of total H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and mitochondrial ROS production revealed a marked increase at two days after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), a time when satellite cells initiate differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Analysis of cytoplasmic ROS levels showed an increase at day 2 after injury that reaches a peak at day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), when the level of GFP, reflecting <italic>Pax3</italic> transcription, is low, as also seen for <italic>Pax7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Subsequent increase in GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) corresponds to later self-renewal of the Pax3-positive satellite cell pool.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32991.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Activation of muscle stem cells during regeneration is accompanied by changes in their redox state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quiescent (adult) and activated (P7 and <italic>mdx</italic>) satellite cells were purified respectively from adult <italic>Pax3<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> (Ad, 98% quiescent), postnatal day 7 <italic>Pax3<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> (P7, 80% activated) and adult dystrophic <italic>mdx:Pax3<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> (<italic>mdx,</italic> 30% activated) mice.

Altogether, these results indicate that the increased ROS level observed in activated Pitx3-deficient satellite cells leads to their premature differentiation through activation of the p38α MAP kinase pathway. We also verified ERK, JUNK, NFκB and ATM signalling pathways, but did not observe any significant change in the ratio of phosphorylated to total forms of ERK and JUNK kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H,I</xref>), while no phosphorylation of p65 (NFκB) nor ATM could be detected (data not shown) in the <italic>Pitx3</italic> mutant cells after 3 days of culture. Since it is possible that Pitx3 also controls ROS levels in response to cytokine stimulation, we treated control and mutant satellite cells with 0.5 nM TNFα.

In view of the increase in ROS levels after TNFα stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>), we first investigated their consequences on satellite cell proliferation and differentiation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, addition of 0.5 nM TNFα leads to reduced proliferation together with premature differentiation.

Consistent with what we observed during foetal myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">L'honoré et al., 2014</xref>), mutation of both <italic>Pitx2</italic> and <italic>Pitx3</italic> in satellite cells leads to altered expression of genes for antioxidant proteins (<italic>Mgst2</italic>, <italic>SelX</italic>, <italic>SelM</italic>, <italic>Gstz</italic>, <italic>Hspb2</italic>) and for the regulator of mitochondrial function <italic>NRF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gleyzer et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then assayed proliferation and differentiation properties of control and double mutant satellite cells. Similarly to what we observed with the <italic>Pitx3</italic> mutant, Pitx2/3 deficient satellite cells exhibit an expansion defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). NAC addition to the culture medium alleviates this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>), and also exerts a positive effect on control cells by improving both their cloning efficiency, probably reflecting improved survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and their expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). In contrast to Pitx3<italic>-</italic>deficient satellite cells, which undergo differentiation following premature cell cycle exit, mutation of both <italic>Pitx2</italic> and <italic>Pitx3</italic> genes leads to a marked reduction in differentiation markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>(i), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>), accumulation of carbonylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) and DNA damage marked by γH<sub>2</sub>AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonner et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>(ii), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In contrast to the foetal situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">L'honoré et al., 2014</xref>), double mutant cells do not undergo apoptosis (data not shown) but become senescent, as evidenced by up-regulation of senescence associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</xref>) (<italic>Igfbp5</italic>, <italic>Ifitm1</italic> or <italic>Ccl5</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and by the increased number of cells positive for the marker of heterochromatin foci Hp1γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>(iii), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and by senescence associated β-galactosidase staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dimri et al., 1995</xref>) (SA-βgal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>), compared to controls.

Treatment of control satellite cells purified from <italic>Pax3<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> adult mice with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">L'honoré et al., 2014</xref>) leads to an increase in ROS levels and senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H,I</xref>), suggesting that, while excessive ROS lead to apoptosis in foetal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">L'honoré et al., 2014</xref>), it triggers senescence in adult satellite cells. Treatment of double mutant cells with NAC efficiently prevents DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>(ii), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and protein carbonylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), resulting in markedly fewer senescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>(iii), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>), and in the restoration of their differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>(i), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In view of the role of p38α MAP kinase in senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coulthard et al., 2009</xref>) and in single <italic>Pitx3</italic> mutant satellite cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>), we investigated the consequences of its inhibition in double mutant cells. Treatment with SB203580 efficiently reduces senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>(iii), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>), but does not rescue DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>(ii), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>) with consequent impairment of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>(i), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puri et al., 2002</xref>).

Pax3(GFP)-positive satellite cells were cultured in the presence or absence of NAC, SB203580 (SB), or both compounds (NAC/SB). Immunostaining experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) show that while NAC or SB treatment alone leads to a reduction in p38α MAP kinase phosphorylation, the NAC/SB combination has a more pronounced effect on p38α MAP kinase phosphorylation and therefore activation of this signalling pathway. Accordingly, while NAC and SB treatments, under which proliferation is promoted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>), both reduce differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), treatment with the dual NAC/SB combination leads to even stronger effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

It is notable that SB has little effect on ROS levels compared to NAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which is also reflected in cloning efficiency where NAC promotes cell viability and prevents senescence by reducing ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In view of the synergistic effect seen with NAC and SB together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), we checked whether ERK, JUNK, p65 (NFκB) and ATM were affected and found no evidence that these signalling pathways were implicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>, data not shown).</p><p>In view of these results, we anticipated that NAC/SB treatment, in addition to promoting expansion of satellite cells in culture, might improve their regenerative potential in vivo, by maintaining them in a highly proliferative and undifferentiated state. To test this hypothesis, 15.000 freshly isolated Pax3(GFP)-positive satellite cells, or 15.000 Pax3(GFP)-positive satellite cells cultured for three days (D3) in the absence or in the presence of NAC/SB, were grafted into the <italic>Tibialis Anterior</italic> muscle of <italic>Rag2<sup>−/−</sup>:Il2rβ<sup>-/-</sup>:dmd/dmd</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vallese et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Three weeks after grafting, muscle sections were assayed for Dystrophin expression by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). While satellite cells cultured under standard conditions display a regenerative potential at least 10 times lower than freshly isolated satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montarras et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>), NAC/SB treatment of cultured satellite cells leads to a very efficient engraftment, with a number of Dystrophin-positive cells similar to that obtained with freshly isolated satellite cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). To test whether engrafted cells also contributed to the satellite cell compartment in recipient muscles, we performed immunostaining with GFP and Pax7 antibodies. Both staining co-localized in a subset of nuclei in the engrafted muscle, indicating that the transplanted cells also successfully populated the satellite cell compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J</xref>).

Injury regeneration assays performed 3 weeks after grafting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–K</xref>) show that donor satellite cells treated with both NAC and SB203580 are much more abundant, (x20, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>) than when treated with NAC or SB alone, which also have a positive effect compared to controls (x2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). When put in culture, all the Pax3(GFP)-positive cells recovered from grafted muscles displayed a MyoD-positive phenotype (data not shown), confirming their myogenic identity. In addition, this grafting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J,K</xref>) further indicates that while NAC or SB treatments both improve the regeneration potential of cultured satellite cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J,K</xref>), the use of both compounds leads to a much higher number of Dystrophin-positive fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J,K</xref>).

In the double mutant, these satellite cells undergo DNA damage and become senescent. This is in contrast to the situation in the embryo where muscle progenitor cells respond to DNA damage by undergoing apoptosis in the absence of both factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">L'honoré et al., 2014</xref>). As during foetal myogenesis, we show that Pitx2/3 factors are involved in the redox control of the muscle satellite cell. The link between Pitx factors and the control of ROS has also been reported in cardiomyocytes where <italic>Pitx2</italic>, the only <italic>Pitx</italic> gene expressed in the heart, plays a critical role in the regulation of antioxidant scavenger genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of Pitx3 alone, the balance between proliferation and differentiation is perturbed so that satellite cells differentiate prematurely, a phenotype that impacts the efficiency of muscle regeneration. This mutant provides a valuable tool to investigate the regulation of this critical balance. Although historically viewed as harmful, ROS are now established as important regulators of signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigarella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holmström and Finkel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khacho and Slack, 2017</xref>). Our analysis of skeletal muscle regeneration in the <italic>Pitx3</italic> mutant reveals a critical role for the redox state of satellite cells in the regulation of their behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). While quiescent satellite cells exhibit low ROS levels, we observed a marked increase in activated cells at the onset of differentiation. Using chemical as well as genetic manipulation of the redox state of satellite cells during muscle regeneration, we show that the increase in ROS occurring in proliferating satellite cells leads to activation of p38α MAP kinase and link this redox activation to its function as a critical regulator of satellite cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Segalés et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perdiguero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brien et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palacios et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the striking synergistic effect that we observe with NAC which lowers ROS levels and SB which inhibits p38α MAP kinase, it is probable that ROS levels also affect satellite cell behaviour independently of p38α MAP kinase. This is demonstrated by our analysis of the double <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> mutant, where DNA damage is reversed by NAC treatment but not by SB, indicating that they reflect a p38α−independent effect of high ROS levels. In wild-type satellite cells too, cloning efficiency is improved by NAC but not SB treatment suggesting that lowering ROS levels in normal cells also reduces a background level of DNA damage. The striking effect of NAC and SB together may reflect reduced DNA damage due to ROS, which will repercuss on the cell cycle, as well as delayed differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaltiel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32991.027</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of muscle stem cells by their redox state.</title><p>This model represents redox regulation acting through p38α MAP kinase of a wild-type satellite cell as it progresses towards a differentiated myofibre.

While quiescent satellite cells, with low energetic requirements, are characterized by reduced mitochondrial mass and low ROS production, their activated progeny is marked by increased mitochondrial mass and activity and enhanced ROS levels. We show that a peak of mitochondrial ROS production occurs at day 2 of regeneration, when mitochondrial mass is only beginning to increase in activated satellite cells. Under conditions in which the cellular energy demand is still moderate, increased ROS production has been reported to occur from complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murphy, 2009</xref>). In addition to mitochondrial ROS, by using Apocynin, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petrônio et al., 2013</xref>), we demonstrate a contribution of these enzymes to the redox state of satellite cells and the regulation of satellite cell differentiation. In this study we have focused on the cell-autonomous role of the satellite cell redox state, but extracellular sources of ROS released into the environment by injured muscle fibres and inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Moal et al., 2017</xref>), will also contribute to the in vivo scenario.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interplay between redox regulation, metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications</title><p>The metabolic switch that accompanies the satellite cell transition from quiescence to ex vivo activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>) results in a decrease of intracellular NAD(+) levels and of the activity of the histone deacetylase, Sirt1, leading to elevated H4K16 acetylation and activation of muscle genes required for the entry of satellite cells into the myogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>). In the hematopoietic system, Sirt1 has been shown to be critical for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsui et al., 2012</xref>). The premature differentiation seen in <italic>Sirt1</italic> mutant satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>), resembles what we observe in the <italic>Pitx3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, Sirt1 has been characterized as a direct redox sensor, which is inactivated upon oxidation of its cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zee et al., 2010</xref>). It is therefore possible that increased ROS levels during normal regeneration lead to Sirt1 inactivation in parallel with activation of p38α MAP kinase, and consequent onset of differentiation. This parallel action may contribute to the more striking effect that we observe with NAC, which reduces ROS levels with a consequent increase in Sirt1 activity, compared to the effect of inhibiting p38α MAP kinase with SB203580 alone, which does not correct the DNA damage and only partially corrects the differentiation defect seen in <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> double mutant mice. It should be noted that the level of SB203580 that we employ (5 μM) is lower than that used by other authors (10 to 25 μM) who have reported beneficial effects of this drug on the regenerative properties of satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charville et al., 2015</xref>).

The effects that we observe on p38α phosphorylation in wild type cells are similar with SB203580 and with NAC, indicating that the dose of SB203580 is effective. SB203580 acts on threonine 106 to inhibit phosphorylation, whereas ROS, and therefore the ROS scavenger NAC, can affect the redox state of cysteine residues involved in substrate binding and activation of p38<underline>α</underline> MAP kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bassi et al., 2017</xref>). Additional effects of NAC due to the lowering of ROS levels, through a reduction in DNA damage and a potential increase in Sirt1 activity, are independent of p38α MAPK kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Muscle stem cell ageing and perturbation of redox homeostasis</title><p>In skeletal muscle, as in many tissues, ageing is accompanied by a decline in regenerative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>). While the aged systemic environment significantly impacts the function of satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gopinath and Rando, 2008</xref>), recent studies have shown that impaired regeneration is also due to a cell-autonomous functional decline in satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernet et al., 2014</xref>). Skeletal muscle is a remarkably stable tissue, and satellite cells are long-lived resident adult stem cells. Despite their low metabolic rate and their high antioxidant capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pallafacchina et al., 2010</xref>), these long-lived cells are particularly exposed to ROS generated either by mitochondria during muscle fibre contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jackson, 2011</xref>), or by NADPH oxidases shown to be over-expressed in sarcopenic fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerkweg et al., 2007</xref>). This exposure to ROS throughout life combined with a decline in their antioxidant capacity during ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sullivan-Gunn and Lewandowski, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fulle et al., 2005</xref>) makes geriatric satellite cells particularly vulnerable to accumulation of genomic and mitochondrial DNA mutations, and as a consequence, to mitochondrial dysfunction and genomic instability. Geriatric satellite cells have been shown to have elevated p38α MAP kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernet et al., 2014</xref>) and defective autophagy leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, excessive ROS levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">García-Prat et al., 2016</xref>), with increased DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">García-Prat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>) and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Latella et al., 2017</xref>).

Ex vivo amplification of tissue specific stem cells is an option, but it generally leads to a reduction of their regenerative potential, due to their commitment to differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montarras et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walasek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggs and Morgan, 2013</xref>). In the muscle field, advances have been made by manipulating dystrophic muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Price et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tierney et al., 2014</xref>), by modifying culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilbert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charville et al., 2015</xref>), or by grafting selected satellite cell sub-populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jean et al., 2011</xref>), however further improvements are mandatory. Treatment with SB203580, that inhibits p38α MAP kinase activation required for the onset of differentiation, promotes proliferation of human myoblasts in culture and their contribution to the reconstitution of the satellite cell pool upon grafting into injured skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charville et al., 2015</xref>). NAC treatment of Pitx2 deficient mice restores the regenerative capacity of the newborn heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tao et al., 2016</xref>), a situation that is reminiscent of our finding for skeletal muscle in triple Pitx2/3:Dystrophin-deficient mice, where the dystrophic muscle phenotype is improved by NAC treatment. We now show that the use of the NAC/SB203580 combination in culture not only leads to fast and very efficient amplification of satellite cells, but also maintains their regenerative potential at levels similar to that of freshly isolated cells in grafting experiments. In vivo also, treatment with both compounds promotes expansion of the transplanted satellite cell pool after injury. These observations have important implications for stem cell therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal breeding, Cre recombination and genotyping</title><p>All animal procedures were approved and conducted in accordance with the Institut Pasteur animal ethics committee (CEEA Institut Pasteur n°2013–0017 and APAFIS #2455 2015 1122133311) following the regulations of the Ministry of Agriculture and the European Community guidelines.</p><p><italic>Pitx2</italic>-floxed (<italic>Pitx2<sup>flox</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>+</italic></sup>) mice were provided by S.

Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Below we have compiled a summary of the essential revisions (please see attached full reviews for further details):</p><p>In the present manuscript by L'honore et al., the authors claim that <italic>Pitx2</italic> and <italic>Pitx3</italic> are involved in the regulation of the redox state in skeletal muscle stem cells, which balances their proliferation and differentiation for skeletal muscle regeneration. This manuscript follows from the authors earlier work, in which they identified <italic>Pitx2</italic> and <italic>Pitx3</italic> as regulators of redox state in fetal myogenesis. In the present work, the authors use single and double mutant <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> mice as well as conditional mutants to assess the role of <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> in adult satellite cell function related to ROS production. The authors conclude that <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> loss raises ROS levels promoting premature differentiation that can be rescued by reducing p38α signaling together with NAC supplementation. This work extends the group's prior work in fetal myogenesis to adult satellite cells revealing distinct phenotypes within the two contexts.</p><p>There are several major issues with this study:</p><p>1) The authors provide evidence linking the <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> expression levels and related amount of ROS production (redox state) with substantially different biological outcomes in adult satellite cells – either premature differentiation or senescence. The implication is that this dose relationship dictates whether a cell will differentiate or senesce. This needs to be tested more thoroughly. Does ROS activity change incrementally with <italic>Pitx</italic> gene dosage?</p><p>2) Manipulation of the redox state of muscle stem cells in vitro via combined p38α and ROS inhibition, the authors discover a ten-fold cell expansion and complete preservation of the regenerative capacity comparable to freshly isolated muscle stem cells. How is this possible? If the role of p38α is to regulate the redox state, shouldn't ROS inhibition on its own exert an effect of similar magnitude? Does NAC treatment alone improve grafting potential of cultured muscle stem cells? Resolving this interaction is important to resolve the mechanism.</p><p>3) Along the same line, one might wonder whether premature satellite cell differentiation by increased levels of ROS coincides with loss of asymmetric division. This can be evaluated by localization of pp38 and Par staining, as shown in Troy et al. (CSC 2012). In line with this thinking, it is possible that different SC subsets undergo different fates in response to <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> deletion. Can clonal analysis be performed to determine if SCs are biased to differentiate or senesce and is that prevented by p38i or NAC. It is possible that the synergistic effect of p38i and NAC occur because they are acting in different cells/states.</p><p>4) The authors should focus on clarifying whether these different outcomes depend entirely on p38α (regulating different subsets of genes depending on whether it is activated by moderate vs high ROS) or by the activation of parallel signalling by ROS (this seems to me the most plausible scenario, which would explain why SB/NAC treatment is more effective than each treatment alone).</p><p>The most effective way to do so would be to analyze gene expression (genome wide, if possible; or alternatively by measuring expression levels of muscle differentiation, cell cycle and senescence-associated genes by qPCR, and activation of alternative signalling pathways, such as NFkB, <italic>JNK</italic>, DDR etc., in satellite cells from <italic>Pitx3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant and <italic>Pitx3<sup>+/-</sup></italic> control animals 3 days post cardiotoxin injection, with or without SB and NAC in different combinations).</p><p>5) It is important that the authors clarify the issue of whether <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> control only production of endogenous (mitochondrial) ROS, or also ROS generation in response to cytokines/growth factors, thereby clarifying the relationship between ROS- vs. cytokine/growth factor-mediated activation of p38 kinases α and β.</p><p>6) The effects of oxygen concentrations on satellite cell behavior are also well documented, first published in 2001, these studies demonstrate that un-physiological O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (20%) promote myogenic differentiation and repress proliferation. There is a concern that all the culture experiments are done in a hyperoxic environment. Thus, the NAC treatment and other ROS manipulation in culture are potentially the same that would be achieved by simply reducing O<sub>2</sub>. The authors should test whether the <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> mutants have ROS effects that are rescued by NAC in 4-6% O<sub>2</sub> culture. Ignoring the effects of O<sub>2</sub> culture levels considering the extensive published literature is a serious concern.</p><p>7) The transplantation experiment does not address whether the treatment enhances satellite cell expansion but simply shows that more dystrophin+ myofibers are present when treated cells are transplanted vs. non-treated cells. This could reflect either (i) increased survival upon transplantation, (ii) increased differentiation, (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii), or (iv) expansion of the satellite cells. The authors fail to show whether more donor satellite cells are present and thus the author's claims in the discussion are not supported by the data. The authors should perform transplants and double injuries in presence or absence of treatments followed by quantification of muscle fiber and SC contribution.</p><p>8) Many of the controls are <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> heterozygotes and there is a concern that further manipulation of cells could uncover haploinsufficiency. The authors need to include wild type controls for some of the experiments as differing experimental conditions such as knock downs or changing culture conditions could uncover a haploinsufficiency phenotype that is not observed under normal culture conditions.</p><p>9) The title and narrative of the manuscript imply that the authors directly regulate ROS. The authors should reframe the title and the manuscript in general, to refocus on the role of <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> in adult muscle stem cells. Alternatively, the authors need to directly manipulate mitochondrial function in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the present manuscript by L'honore et al., the authors claim that <italic>Pitx2</italic> and <italic>Pitx3</italic> are involved in the regulation of the redox state in skeletal muscle stem cells, which balances their proliferation and differentiation for skeletal muscle regeneration. The authors additionally claim that manipulation of the muscle stem cell redox state can expand muscle stem cells in vitro and preserve their regenerative capacity similar to freshly isolated cells. These claims are well supported by extensive temporally-controlled conditional mouse genetics and in vitro muscle stem cell culture experiments, and the body of work presents an important new addition to the muscle stem cell literature.</p><p>The finding of <italic>Pitx2/3</italic>'s role in regulating the muscle stem cell redox state is certainly not surprising given the author's previous publication on the role of <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> in fetal myogenic progenitor cells. Yet, the extension of that work to the adult muscle stem cell is appreciated as the adult muscle stem cell becomes activated from a quiescent state in adult muscle regeneration, which differs from the highly proliferative muscle progenitor population, which is continuously cycling.</p><p>Manipulating the redox state of muscle stem cells in vitro via combined p38α and ROS inhibition, the authors discover a ten-fold cell expansion and complete preservation of the regenerative capacity comparable to freshly isolated muscle stem cells. While the data is very exciting, the rationale for implementing the dual inactivation strategy is lacking and the results need a much more in-depth discussion within the context of the vast p38α literature on muscle stem cells. In particular, the magnitude of the cell expansion effect by dual p38α and ROS inhibition is not simply cumulative but much more substantive. How is this possible? If the role of p38α is to regulate the redox state, shouldn't ROS inhibition on its own exert an effect of similar magnitude? Along this line, it would be helpful to expand the in vitro inhibition (and transplantation) studies to include a dose response for SB203580, for which partial inhibition of p38α was shown to rejuvenate aged muscle stem cells (Bernet, 2014). Would NAC treatment alone improve grafting potential of cultured muscle stem cells? Minimally the results need a much more in-depth discussion including work from the Olwin lab (Jones, 2005; Bernet, 2014), Blau lab (Cosgrove, 2014), and in particular, work from the Pell lab (Brien, 2013), which used mouse genetics to completely eliminate p38α from the muscle stem cell.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors use single and double mutant <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> mice as well as conditional mutants to assess the role of <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> in satellite cell function related to ROS production. The authors conclude that <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> loss raises ROS levels promoting premature differentiation that can be rescued by reducing p38α signaling together with NAC supplementation.</p><p>The results, while of interest appear an indirect method to assess the effects of ROS on satellite cell differentiation. Although the data clearly show that ROS levels are changing, it seems likely that loss of <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> affects far more than ROS levels and thus, the authors cannot simply attribute the deficits in muscle regeneration occurring upon loss of <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> to changes in ROS. There are a number of serious concerns regarding the manuscript that are discussed in the following paragraphs but the overall issue that cannot be overcome is the use of <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> knockouts to study ROS in satellite cells. The effects on ROS are indirect and thus, how can the authors attribute the effects of the double knockout to changes in ROS levels? Floxed alleles are available for both <italic>Ucp2</italic> and <italic>Tfam</italic> from Jax. Incorporation of these knockouts in satellite cells and a comparison with <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> knockouts is essential for the authors to draw conclusions about ROS effects on satellite cell behavior and separate the non-ROS dependent effects of <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> knock outs from ROS-dependent effects.</p><p>Additional major issues:</p><p>The authors discussion and depiction for the roles of p38α MAPK signaling are insufficient and dated. Several laboratories have demonstrated that p38α plays a role in satellite cell activation and asymmetric division. The subcellular localization of p38α is a critical determinant of its function and during satellite cell activation/proliferation the phospho- p38α is present in the cytoplasm. The role for p38α in differentiation is well-documented and is nuclear. The authors are likely partially inhibiting p38α using the SB203580 concentrations stated and this is well documented by several labs to dramatically enhance transplantation efficacy. Thus, the p38α effects observed by the authors do not add to what has already been published.</p><p>The effects of oxygen concentrations on satellite cell behavior are also well documented, first published in 2001, these studies demonstrate that un-physiological O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (20%) promote myogenic differentiation and repress proliferation. Reducing the O<sub>2</sub> concentrations to physiological levels of 2-6% would likely produce the same effect as NAC in the manuscript. Ignoring the effects of O<sub>2</sub> culture levels in light of the extensive published literature is a serious concern and needs to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>The observations that NAC/SB treatment expands the satellite cell population is predicted from the effects of O<sub>2</sub> concentrations and the effects of p38α inhibition on satellite cell self-renewal and transplantation. Thus, this observation is not novel and does not add significantly to existing knowledge. The transplantation experiment does not address whether the treatment enhances satellite cell expansion but simply shows that more dystrophin+ myofibers are present when treated cells are transplanted vs. non-treated cells. This could reflect either (i) increased survival upon transplantation, (ii) increased differentiation, (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii), or (iv) expansion of the satellite cells. The authors fail to show whether more donor satellite cells are present and thus the claim at the end of the Results &quot;To test whether engrafted cells also contributed to the satellite cell compartment in recipient muscles, we performed immunostaining with GFP and <italic>Pax7</italic> antibodies. Both staining co-localized in a subset of nuclei in the engrafted muscle, indicating that the transplanted cells also successfully populated the satellite cell compartment (Figure 6I)&quot; and claims in the Discussion are not supported by the data.</p><p>The vast majority of the controls are <italic>Pitx2/Pitx3</italic> heterozygotes and there is a concern that further manipulation of cells could uncover haploinsufficienies. The authors need to include wild type controls for the majority of the experiments as differing experimental conditions such as knock downs or changing culture conditions could uncover a haploinsufficiency phenotype that is not observed under normal culture conditions.</p><p>Finally, the global knockout data reported in Figures 1-3 need repeating with the floxed allele as the authors cannot attribute the effects observed as cell intrinsic. The effects observed in vivo could be due to a combination of effects on multiple cell types, especially those shown in vivo. The authors imply that the global knockout and the satellite cell-specific knockouts are equivalent but they are not. There seems to be no rationale for performing half of the experiments on a global knock out and the other half on a cell-specific knock out.</p><p>In summary, the authors utilize an indirect approach to assess the effects of changing ROS levels in satellite cells. The possibility that the observed phenotypes are due to effects independent of ROS are not sufficiently addressed. Moreover, the mixed use of global and cell-specific knock outs complicates the interpretation of the phenotypes. More direct analyses of ROS effects on satellite cells could be performed and coupled with data from the submitted manuscript to much better support the conclusions drawn by the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript, in which the authors followed-up previous studies that identified <italic>Pitx2</italic> and <italic>Pitx3</italic> as satellite cell regulators of redox state, which in turn regulates DNA damage and differentiation. By using <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> single and double mutants, as genetic models of perturbed redox states in satellite cells, the authors show that while moderate ROS production (at physiological levels) leads to premature satellite cell differentiation, via cell cycle entry and p38 activation, excessive ROS levels induce senescence, DNA damage and consequent activation of the differentiation checkpoint which inhibits satellite cell differentiation. The authors used this information to devise a combinatorial and transient blockade of ROS and p38α kinase to expand satellite cells for successful muscle engraftment in vivo, upon transplantation.</p><p>Overall, the experiments are well performed and the data correctly interpreted, revealing an interesting connection between genetic control of redox state by <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> and p38 activation in satellite cells, leading to physiological or premature activation of the myogenic program, or DNA damage, cellular senescence and block of differentiation.</p><p>Below are listed few important points that I invite the authors to address.</p><p>1) In Figure 1, the gene expression analysis does not include satellite cells from injured muscles. That experimental point should be included, as it seems it would provide an important dataset integration.</p><p>2) It should be explained why the authors initially used pectoralis, diaphragm and abdominal muscles, and notexin injury (Figure 1), and then switched to hind-limb muscles and cardiotoxin injury for satellite cell analysis.</p><p>3) Figure 1J. The ROS levels in satellite cells from control and mutant mice seem to eventually converge at later time points (D3). The authors should comment on this trend and possibly extend their analysis beyond D3 (i.e. D4 and 5).</p><p>4) ROS-mediated activation of p38 is an interesting finding, that adds one more p38 activator to stimuli identified so far (cytokines, cell to cell contact). It would be interesting to experimentally address (or just speculate/discuss) the relationship between these stimuli and intracellular production of ROS. For instance, is TNFα-mediated activation of p38 in satellite cells affected by NAC?</p><p>5) Along the same line, one might wonder whether premature satellite cell differentiation by increased levels of ROS actually coincides with loss of asymmetric division. This can be evaluated by localization of p-p38 and Par staining, as shown in Troy et al. (CSC 2012).</p><p>6) Figure 3I. The reduction of p38α phosphorylation upon incubation with the p38 kinase inhibitor SB is unexpected, as the inhibitor should not affect p38 phosphorylation (which is catalyzed by upstream kinases – MKK3, MKK6 and others). Actually, a paradoxical hyper-phosphorylation should be observed, as a result of the accumulation of phosphorylated p38 upon blockade by SB. The authors might want to re-evaluate this experiments (possibly by showing also the total p38 Western blot).</p><p>7) <italic>Pax3</italic>/GFP sorting of satellite cells is definitely acceptable; however, validation of the major findings (ROS-p38 activation, and expansion by NAC/SB ex vivo) should be done in satellite cells sorted by conventional FACS procedures.</p><p>8) Improved engraftment of satellite cells injected after in vitro expansion by NAC/SB treatment should be evaluated also upon transplantation in muscles of wild type animals and repeated injuries, in order to evaluate whether these cells divide asymmetrically – a key issue in regenerative medicine.</p><p>9) A similar finding reporting on DNA damage-driving senescence that impairs satellite cell differentiation has been recently reported by Latella et al. and should be discussed.</p><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and they made a formal revised submission.

While it has been previously shown that p38α can directly regulate the redox state in some cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells, in muscle stem cells, this does not appear to be the case, as shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1E, where SB treatment alone does not significantly affect ROS levels. We propose that in muscle stem cells, p38α does not act as a redox regulator, but rather as a redox signalling molecule.</p><p>To address the issue of the role of NAC on grafting potential of cultured muscle stem cells, we proposed to perform the following grafting experiments: satellite cells purified from <italic>Pax3</italic>(GFP) cells will be cultured in the absence or presence of NAC, and then grafted in the <italic>Tibialis Anterior (TA</italic>) muscle of <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup><sup>-/-</sup>:Il2Rβ<sup>-/-</sup>:dmd/dmd</italic> mice. Three weeks after grafting, the grafting efficiency will be analyzed by detection of dystrophin in regenerating fibers as in our previous experiments.</p><p>Final response: These additional grafting experiments are now presented in Figure 6H-K. We have moved Figure 6F (schema) and Figure 6I (<italic>Pax7</italic> and <italic>Pax3<sup>GFP</sup></italic> images) into Figure 6—figure supplement 1I and J.</p><p>The question of NAC versus SB effects are now addressed more extensively in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Along the same line, one might wonder whether premature satellite cell differentiation by increased levels of ROS coincides with loss of asymmetric division. This can be evaluated by localization of pp38 and Par staining, as shown in Troy et al. (CSC 2012). In line with this thinking, it is possible that different SC subsets undergo different fates in response to Pitx2/3 deletion. Can clonal analysis be performed to determine if SCs are biased to differentiate or senesce and is that prevented by p38i or NAC. It is possible that the synergistic effect of p38i and NAC occur because they are acting in different cells/states.</p></disp-quote><p>Revision plan: To address the issue of a possible link between premature satellite cell differentiation and loss of asymmetric division, we will study the distribution of pp38α and Par in cultured control and <italic>Pitx3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> satellite cells. It is not clear whether clonal analysis could provide more information than we already have from the mass culture studies. Pp38 staining will not help to distinguish cells undergoing differentiation from cells undergoing senescence since both will be positive. However, we propose to add to Figure 5F-H, data obtained by treating the <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> double mutant cells by both NAC and SB.</p><p>Final response: We could detect asymmetric distribution of pp38α and Par in cultured control and <italic>Pitx3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> satellite cells. However the results on their precise localisation were not statistically significant with considerable variation over the cell population. We used the same sources of antibodies as those reported by Troy et al. but unfortunately in our hands the subcellular resolution was poor.</p><p>We now include data that address the fate of the <italic>Pitx</italic> mutant cells, with addition of SB and NAC together as well as separately (Figure 5E, Figure 6I-K). These results provide additional insight into the synergistic effect.</p><p>As now shown by additional experiments and discussed at greater length in the paper we think that NAC and therefore the level of ROS has additional effects, notably on DNA damage, senescence and cloning efficiency for example, which do not depend on P38α and are not targeted by SB.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should focus on clarifying whether these different outcomes depend entirely on</italic> p38α <italic>(regulating different subsets of genes depending on whether it is activated by moderate vs high ROS) or by the activation of parallel signalling by ROS (this seems to me the most plausible scenario, which would explain why SB/NAC treatment is more effective than each treatment alone).</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The most effective way to do so would be to analyze gene expression (genome wide, if possible; or alternatively by measuring expression levels of muscle differentiation, cell cycle and senescence-associated genes by qPCR, and activation of alternative signalling pathways, such as NFkB, JNK, DDR etc., in satellite cells from Pitx3<sup>-/-</sup> mutant and Pitx3<sup>+/-</sup> control animals 3 days post cardiotoxin injection, with or without SB and NAC in different combinations).</p></disp-quote><p>Revision plan: We agree that it is plausible that ROS can act through parallel signalling to p38α. To test this hypothesis, we propose to perform Western-blot analysis on control and <italic>Pitx3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> satellite cells cultured with and without SB and NAC in different combinations. We think that RNA transcripts are less informative about the activation of signalling pathways than looking at the phosphorylated protein intermediates. We therefore propose to perform the following Western blots: phosphoATM/ATM (DDR), phosphoJun/Jun (<italic>JNK</italic>), phosphop65/p65 (NFkB).</p><p>Final response: We have carried out Western blots for phosphorylated versus unphosphorylated <italic>JNK</italic> and ERK which are more informative than p65 (NFkB) or ATM (DDR), neither of which changed at the onset of differentiation. Representative Western blots and quantification are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1H and 1I. We do not detect significant changes in <italic>Pitx3</italic> mutant satellite cells, indicating that these pathways are not affected.</p><p>We have modified the summary diagram (Figure 7) to indicate that ROS may act independently of p38α signalling. We think that DNA damage is a clear example of this as we show and is now pointed out in the discussion where other effects of ROS, on <italic>Sirt1</italic> for example, are also invoked.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is important that the authors clarify the issue of whether Pitx2/3 control only production of endogenous (mitochondrial) ROS, or also ROS generation in response to cytokines/growth factors, thereby clarifying the relationship between ROS- vs. cytokine/growth factor-mediated activation of p38 kinases α and β.</p></disp-quote><p>Revision plan: Our previous (L’honore et al., 2014) and current results implicate <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> transcription factors as regulators of mitochondrial ROS production through regulation of mitochondrial activity. To investigate whether they can also control ROS generation in response to cytokines, we propose to culture control and <italic>Pitx3</italic> mutant cells in the absence or presence of TNFα (suggested by reviewer 3) and NAC. Differentiation and ROS levels will be monitored. If <italic>Pitx3</italic> control ROS production by TNFα stimulus, TNFα should have no effect in mutant cells, while affecting control cells.</p><p>Final response: The experiment with TNFα is shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1J. The result shows that mutant cells are sensitive to a similar extent to control cells, in keeping with a role of <italic>Pitx</italic> factors in regulating mitochondrial ROS independently of cytokines. Furthermore, in wild type cells, we show that TNFα increases ROS levels and affects the balance between proliferation and differentiation (Figure 3J).</p><p><italic>6) The effects of oxygen concentrations on satellite cell behavior are also well documented, first published in 2001, these studies demonstrate that un-physiological</italic> O<sub>2</sub><italic>concentrations (20%) promote myogenic differentiation and repress proliferation.

Ignoring the effects of</italic> O<sub>2</sub><italic>culture levels considering the extensive published literature is a serious concern.</italic></p><p>Revision plan: We agree with reviewer 2 that the effects of O<sub>2</sub> culture levels on cells is a serious concern. While a hyperoxic environment has been previously shown to negatively affect myogenic proliferation, the role of intracellular ROS levels in this phenotype has not been established. In contrast, we have previously demonstrated that culturing fetal muscle cells under 20% or 3% O<sub>2</sub> (L’honore et al., 2014) does not change their ROS levels, and importantly does not affect their response to NAC treatment. In this context, we have already obtained evidence that the phenotype of <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> double mutant cells is not rescued by culture in 3% O<sub>2.</sub> We propose to add these results to the new manuscript and to perform satellite cell culture in the absence or presence of NAC under hyperoxic (20% O<sub>2</sub>) and normoxic conditions (3% O<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>Final response: Results of culture in 3% oxygen have now been added as Figure 3—figure supplement 1G, Figure 5—figure supplement 1G and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B. We show that the effect of NAC and therefore modulation of ROS levels on the <italic>Pitx3</italic> mutant phenotype is not rescued by satellite cell culture under these normoxic conditions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G). This is also the case for double <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> mutant cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1G) and for wild-type cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The transplantation experiment does not address whether the treatment enhances satellite cell expansion but simply shows that more dystrophin+ myofibers are present when treated cells are transplanted vs. non-treated cells.

The authors should perform transplants and double injuries in presence or absence of treatments followed by quantification of muscle fiber and SC contribution.</p></disp-quote><p>Revision plan: The issue of the re-colonisation of the satellite cell reservoir will be addressed by grafting experiments under the following conditions: satellite cells purified as <italic>Pax3</italic>(GFP) cells will be cultured in the absence or presence of NAC, SB and NAC/SB and will then be grafted into the <italic>TA</italic> muscles of either <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>:Il2Rβ<sup>-/-</sup>or Rag<sup>-/-</sup>:Il2Rβ<sup>-/-</sup>:dmd/dmd</italic> mice. Three weeks after grafting, the presence of GFP+/<italic>Pax7+</italic> satellite cells will be quantified.</p><p>We propose to perform a single injury experiment and not a double one that will be too time consuming and will not add much information.</p><p>Final response: This grafting experiment with both NAC and SB as well as each separately is now presented in Figure 6H-K. It shows an additional increase in regeneration (Figure 6J, K) in the presence of both with a striking increase in the expansion of grafted <italic>Pax3</italic>(GFP)-positive cells after injury (Figure 6I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Many of the controls are Pitx2/Pitx3 heterozygotes and there is a concern that further manipulation of cells could uncover haploinsufficiency. The authors need to include wild type controls for some of the experiments as differing experimental conditions such as knock downs or changing culture conditions could uncover a haploinsufficiency phenotype that is not observed under normal culture conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Revision plan: We have evidence that results obtained with cells isolated from wild type <italic>Pax3<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic>mice are not statistically different to those obtained with cells from <italic>Pitx2<sup>+/-</sup> :Pitx3<sup>+/-</sup> : Pax3<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> mice, suggesting absence of haploinsufficiency. These results will be included in the new manuscript.</p><p>Final response: The issue of haploinsufficiency is addressed by data on wild type and heterozygote satellite cells, which show similar levels of ROS (Figure 1—figure supplement 1M).</p><p><italic>9) The title and narrative of the manuscript imply that the authors directly regulate ROS. The authors should reframe the title and the manuscript in general, to refocus on the role of Pitx2/3 in adult muscle stem cells. Alternatively, the authors need to directly manipulate mitochondrial function</italic> in vivo.</p><p>Revision plan: We will change the title of the manuscript in order to refocus on the role of <italic>Pitx2/3</italic> in adult muscle stem cells. We will also include new references on p38 in our Discussion.</p><p>Final response: The title has been modified. The manuscript begins with the results on the <italic>Pitx</italic> mutants and this is now the starting point for the Discussion, which now further addresses the points raised by the reviewers.</p><p>Additional references have been added.</p><p>We have not removed any of the previous results presented but some of these have now been transferred to the supplementary figures to make room for the most important new data obtained following the reviewers’ recommendations. We thank them for suggestions that have strengthened the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
