breathing patterns and the response to CO<sub>2</sub> levels. This may have fatal consequences in newborn babies and result in sudden infant death. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we present a novel breathing brainstem organotypic culture that generates rhythmic neural network and motor activity for 3 weeks. We show that increased CO<sub>2</sub> elicits a gap junction-dependent release of PGE<sub>2</sub>. This alters neural network activity in the preBötzinger rhythm-generating complex and in the chemosensitive brainstem respiratory regions, thereby increasing sigh frequency and the depth of inspiration. We used mice lacking eicosanoid prostanoid 3 receptors (EP3R), breathing brainstem organotypic slices and optogenetic inhibition of EP3R<sup>+/+</sup> cells to demonstrate that the EP3R is important for the ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Our study identifies a novel pathway linking the inflammatory and respiratory systems, with implications for inspiration and sighs throughout life, and the ability to autoresuscitate when breathing fails.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14170.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14170.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14170.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans and other mammals breathe air to absorb oxygen into the body and to remove carbon dioxide. We know that in a part of the brain called the brainstem, several regions work together to create breaths, but it is not clear precisely how this works. These regions adjust our breathing to the demands placed on the body by different activities, such as sleeping or exercising. Sometimes, especially in newborn babies, the brainstem’s monitoring of oxygen and carbon dioxide does not work properly, which can lead to abnormal breathing and possibly death.</p><p>In the brain, cells called neurons form networks that can rapidly transfer information via electrical signals. Here, Forsberg et al. investigated the neural networks in the brainstem that generate and control breathing in mice. They used slices of mouse brainstem that had been kept alive in a dish in the laboratory. The slice contained an arrangement of neurons and supporting cells that allowed it to continue to produce patterns of electrical activity that are associated with breathing. Over a three-week period, Forsberg et al. monitored the activity of the cells and calculated how they were connected to each other. The experiments show that the neurons responsible for breathing were organized in a “small-world” network, in which the neurons are connected to each other directly or via small numbers of other neurons.</p><p>Further experiments tested how various factors affect the behavior of the network. For example, carbon dioxide triggered the release of a small molecule called prostaglandin E2 from cells. This molecule is known to play a role in inflammation and fever. However, in the carbon dioxide sensing region of the brainstem it acted as a signaling molecule that increased activity. Therefore, inflammation could interfere with the body’s normal response to carbon dioxide and lead to potentially life-threatening breathing problems. Furthermore, prostaglandin E2 induced deeper breaths known as sighs, which may be vital for newborn babies to be able to take their first deep breaths of life. Future challenges include understanding how the brainstem neural networks generate breathing and translate this knowledge to improve the treatment of breathing difficulties in babies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14170.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14170.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breathing is essential for life, but the underlying mechanisms that control breathing movements and neuronal pattern generation are under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jasinski et al., 2013</xref>). Breathing maintains tissue homeostasis, and an adequate response to increased carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels is crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaila and Ransom, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guyenet and Bayliss, 2015</xref>). Failure to adequately respond to pCO<sub>2</sub> alterations is linked to breathing disturbances; apnea of prematurity; centrally mediated sickness, such as noxious sensations and panic; and premature death, as in sudden infant death syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guyenet and Bayliss, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Neuronal networks in the parafacial respiratory group/retrotrapezoid nucleus (pFRG/RTN) and the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) are important networks implicated in the central control of breathing. pFRG/RTN paired-like homeobox 2b (Phox2b)-expressing neurons are sensitive to changes in CO<sub>2</sub> levels or their proxy, pH ([H<sup>+</sup>]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mellen and Thoby-Brisson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Onimaru and Dutschmann, 2012</xref>). This responsiveness to hypercapnia is independent of synaptic transmission, and the Phox2b+ neurons detect CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> via intrinsic proton receptors (TASK-2 and GPR4) in parallel pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, medullary astrocytes contribute to central chemosensitivity. Slight acidification leads to an increased astrocytic intracellular concentration of calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), resulting in vesicle-independent ATP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In addition, a CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of astrocytes also mediates a vesicular-independent ATP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huckstepp and Dale, 2011</xref>). Some connexins, which are expressed on astrocytes, e.g., connexin 26 (Cx26) and Cx30, are indeed sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>These cellular processes of chemosensitivity result in an altered respiratory pattern that lowers the blood CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Inflammation reduces the CO<sub>2</sub> response and, particularly in neonatal mammals, can induce sighs, an altered response to hypoxia and potentially life-threatening apnea episodes as shown in humans, sheep, piglets and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guerra et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Long, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herlenius, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siljehav et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Siljehav et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the inflammatory pathway, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) is an important molecular mediator, that together with its main receptor, the EP3R, play roles in the hypoxic and hypercapnic responses, e.g. seen in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kovesi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siljehav et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koch et al., 2015</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> also seems to induce a sigh oriented respiratory pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koch et al., 2015</xref>). Sighs are regularly occurring events of augmented breaths with a biphasic inspiratory pattern with the initial phase being comparable to eupnea and the second having larger amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Toporikova et al., 2015</xref>). Such breaths are necessary for life and have been linked to several pathological states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ramirez, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we hypothesized that both PGE<sub>2</sub> and EP3R constitute parts of the respiratory machinery and that they are involved in the induction of sighs and the hypercapnic response. We established a viable brainstem organotypic slice culture that maintains respiratory-related activity for several weeks in vitro and used this to investigate how PGE<sub>2</sub> and EP3R alter breathing and control of chemosensitivity. Our novel data reveal an important role of the EP3R in the pFRG/RTN hypercapnic response and furthermore suggest that PGE<sub>2</sub> is released during hypercapnia, possibly through CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive connexin hemichannels. Inflammation, with its associated PGE<sub>2</sub> release, exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> and a lack of EP3R, blunts the hypercapnic response.

The sigh frequency increased after the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of PGE<sub>2</sub> (1 µM in 2–4 µl artificial cerebrospinal fluid, aCSF) in an EP3R-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), as did the tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) (during eupnea, excluding sighs) in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Furthermore, hypercapnic exposure also induced an increase in sigh frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This increase was larger in wild-type mice than in mice lacking the EP3R (<italic>Ptger3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice).

Inhibiting the firing of action potentials and consequent activation of synapses by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 20 nM) abolished the coordinated network activity and revealed a population of cells that retained rhythmic alterations of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (31 ± 4% of the total number of cells, N=14 slices). Most of these cells (76 ± 12%, N=14) were NK1R-positive neurons, indicating the presence of functioning pacemaker neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, we suggest that the CO<sub>2</sub> response is not entirely explained by the connexin-mediated release of ATP. Furthermore, inflammation via PGE<sub>2</sub> and EP3R alters the hypercapnic response in vivo and in brainstem spinal cord <italic>en bloc</italic> preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Siljehav and colleagues Figures 1 and 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siljehav et al., 2014</xref>]). Therefore, we hypothesized that hypercapnic responses involve PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling and next analyzed the PGE<sub>2</sub> content of the aCSF under control and hypercapnic conditions. In all examined slices (N=12/12, 7 DIV), a transient doubling of the PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration after pCO<sub>2</sub> elevation was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). When gap junction blockers were applied, this peak was absent (N=4/4, 7 DIV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).

These findings provide novel insights into central respiratory central pattern generation, its modulation, and the mechanisms underlying breathing disorders during the neonatal period.</p><p>Due to the complexity of the respiratory mechanisms, it is difficult to create optimal in vitro model systems that represent in vivo conditions while allowing sufficient depth in detailed mechanisms and their manipulation. The majority of previous studies were performed on brainstem-spinal cord preparations (<italic>en bloc</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Onimaru, 1995</xref>) or acute slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ruangkittisakul et al., 2006</xref>). However, these preparations remain active only for hours, making it difficult to study development and long-term effects on respiratory rhythm. Organotypic slice cultures provide a bridge between cell cultures and animals in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yamada and Cukierman, 2007</xref>). Their preserved three dimensional structure allows functional circuits to be studied and manipulated over time under microenvironmental control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gähwiler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gogolla et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yamada and Cukierman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Preynat-Seauve et al., 2009</xref>). First used with hippocampal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gähwiler, 1988</xref>), the organotypic culturing method has since expanded to research on the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2011</xref>) as well as on the brainstem auditory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thonabulsombat et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, Phillips and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Phillips et al., 2016</xref>) presented an organotypic model system of the preBötzinger complex with respiration-related neuronal rhythm that persists for a month. Here, we characterize this new type of brainstem slice culture further, and also provide details on respiratory network structure and functional respiratory-related motor output. In addition we show that also the pFRG/RTN retains respiration-related rhythmic activity and chemosensitivity. As with all model systems, it has its limitations, e.g., the slices lose several respiratory-related regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, in contrast to acute slices and the brainstem-spinal cord preparation, our new experimental model system allows long-term studies and manipulation of respiratory networks. This enables the use of different techniques and methods, and significantly reduces the number of procedures that otherwise need to be performed on live animals, as well as the total number of experimental animals. We have exploited this advantage by transfecting the brainstem slice cultures in vitro to be suitable for optogenetic techniques.</p><p>Using a newly developed cross-correlation analysis algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smedler et al., 2014</xref>), we revealed in the brainstem slice culture, a clustering of cells within the two central pattern generators, a small-world network. A small-world network is characterized by a mean clustering coefficient exceeding that in random networks, but has a mean shortest path-length as short as that in random networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malmersjo et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of the connective nodes and hubs gives the network a scale-free organization. This finding is in line with a previous topological analysis based on neuronal staining in the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartelt et al., 2008</xref>). The present insights into the network structure of the pFRG/RTN have not been achieved previously with other methods. Notably, scale-free and small-world networks have been suggested to have evolutionary advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malmersjo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently we examined how the networks and individual cells were connected. Early in development, gap junctions connect the respiration-related fetal neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>). During development, gap junction-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients stimulate the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malmersjo et al., 2013</xref>) and form a template for chemical synapses to coordinate more mature neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaderstad et al., 2010</xref>). Using CBX and 18-α-GA, we demonstrated that intercellular connections still play a role in postnatal preBötC network activity. This is in line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elsen et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, even though fewer cells remained active, respiratory neuron frequency and network structure were not affected. Although both CBX and 18-α-GA are commonly used as gap junction inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Solomon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elsen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Véliz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaderstad et al., 2010</xref>), these drugs have side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rekling et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schnell et al., 2012</xref>). We used GZA as a control substance because it is structurally similar to CBX but does not have any gap junction inhibiting properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Solomon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li and Duffin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elsen et al., 2008</xref>). However, it mimics many of the side effects of CBX, e.g. the initial stimulatory effect seen in the present study. These limitations need to be kept in mind when interpreting our results on gap junction functions, and further studies are needed to confirm them, preferably using more specific methods of connexin blockage, such as RNAi.</p><p>However, our findings do suggest the presence of a neuron-specific subnetwork, connected by chemical synapses, that is able to maintain the network structure. Furthermore, another subnetwork, likely a glial one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giaume et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Okada et al., 2012</xref>) driven by the electrical connections that modulate network output also seems to be present. Thus, neonatal preBötC synchronization is both gap junction-and synaptic signal-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>), and it probably contains both neuronal and glial subnetworks. The pFRG/RTN, by contrast, requires gap junctions for its establishment in rodents but is not dependent on them postnatally for rhythmic, correlated network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fortin and Thoby-Brisson, 2009</xref>). The main mechanism that drives activity in the pFRG/RTN is glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guyenet et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, pFRG/RTN gap junctions seem here to be involved in the hypercapnic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>). It has been suggested that Cx26 is directly modulated by CO<sub>2</sub>, independent of H<sup>+</sup>, through the formation of carbamate bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>). Our data do not distinguish between intracellular pH-dependent and -independent mechanisms. However, since PGE<sub>2</sub> can pass through connexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>), the present data are in line with a CO<sub>2</sub>-induced, connexin-mediated, release of PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>).<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14170.064</object-id><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Model of how PGE<sub>2</sub> modulates respiration and sighs in the preBötC and pFRG/RTN.</title><p>Systemic inflammation, through the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β and hypoxia, induces the production of PGE<sub>2</sub> in blood brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hofstetter et al., 2007</xref>).PGE<sub>2</sub> subsequently induces respiratory depression and increases sigh activity via the inhibitory G-protein coupled receptor EP3Rα in the preBötC. In the pFRG/RTN, PGE<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the response to elevated pCO<sub>2</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> directly modulates connexin 26 (Cx26) hemichannels, leading to ATP release. The results in this study suggest that Cx26 also releases PGE<sub>2</sub>, possiblyfrom mPGEs-1<sup>+</sup> astrocytes. PGE<sub>2</sub> increases respiratory activity via the stimulatory G-protein coupled receptor EP3Rγ on pFRG/RTN neurons. Thus, inflammation, hypoxia, and hypercapnia alter respiratory neural network and motor output and breathing activity through distinct effects of PGE<sub>2</sub> in the pFRG/RTN and the preBötC, respectively. Chronically elevated PGE<sub>2</sub> levels, as observed during ongoing inflammation, may decrease the central pattern generators’ ability to respond to hypoxic and hypercapnic events. In extreme cases, this decrease may have fatal consequences.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14170.064">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14170.064</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14170-fig14-v2"/></fig></p><p>Prostaglandins are important regulators of autonomic functions in mammals. In many disease states, acute inflammatory responses are initially protective but become harmful under chronic conditions. In our previous reports, we demonstrated how the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β impairs respiration during infection by inducing a PGE<sub>2</sub> release in the vicinity of respiratory centers. We also showed that infection is the main cause of respiratory disorders in preterm infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hofstetter et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2008</xref>) and, in the case of apneas, bradycardias and desaturations (ABD) events in neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Siljehav et al., 2015</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> is also a key component in the regulation of sigh frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ramirez, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koch et al., 2015</xref>). During and immediately after birth, PGE<sub>2</sub> levels are increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 1978</xref>). Indeed, the first breaths of extrauterine life are deep and sigh-like, facilitating alveolar recruitment and CO<sub>2</sub> removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mian et al., 2015</xref>). In the brainstem slice cultures, PGE<sub>2</sub> had a direct EP3R-dependent effect on both respiratory centers. Notably, PGE<sub>2</sub> increased pFRG/RTN but inhibited preBötC frequency (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). This finding might be explained by the different distributions of EP3R subtypes in the different regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). The coupling to inhibitory or stimulatory G proteins depends on the alternative post-transcriptional splicing of the C-terminal tail of the EP3R preprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Namba et al., 1993</xref>). Furthermore, PGE<sub>2</sub> caused a longer Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient and a higher relative amplitude in an I<sub>NaP</sub>-dependent manner, mimicking the PGE<sub>2</sub>-based induction of sighs that we observe in vivo and that were recently reported by Koch and colleagues in acute preBötC slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koch et al., 2015</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-14170-media3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14170.065</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Parallel display of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations visualized with Fluo-4 in the pFRG/RTN (left) and preBötC (right).</title><p>After 15 s, PGE<sub>2</sub> (10 nM) is added.

In addition to these peptidergic pathways, the present and recent data from Koch and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koch et al., 2015</xref>) suggest that low concentrations of the inflammation-associated PGE<sub>2</sub> induce sighs, acting through modulation of the persistent sodium current in preBötC neurons.</p><p>The preBötC results presented in this study provide evidence for how the general respiratory depression induced by inflammatory signaling, previously reported in vivo and in vitro(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hofstetter et al., 2007</xref>) and in human neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hofstetter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Siljehav et al., 2015</xref>), is mediated by a direct effect of PGE<sub>2</sub> on EP3R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siljehav et al., 2012</xref>) in the preBötC. The present data may help to further explain the mechanism underlying apneas that occur during infectious periods in neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hofstetter et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Di Fiore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Siljehav et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Another common respiratory problem in neonates, particularly premature infants, is an inability to respond adequately to hypoxia and hypercapnia. This may cause recurrent hypoxia, leading to cognitive disabilities later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greene et al., 2014</xref>). A disruption of central CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensitivity is commonly seen in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Di Fiore et al., 2013</xref>), leading to chronic hypoventilation, which may explain why these infants have an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the role of the pFRG/RTN in chemosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guyenet et al., 2013</xref>) and found that the response to hypercapnia is dependent on functioning gap junctions. This is in line with previous findings showing that Cx26 is directly modified by CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>These CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive connexin hemichannels can release ATP, and indeed the hypercapnic response is partly mediated by purinergic type 2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Erlichman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guyenet et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to these purinergic pathways, we suggest that EP3R-dependent signaling is involved in the response to altered pCO<sub>2</sub>. Genetic ablation of <italic>Ptger3</italic> reduced the hypercapnic response both in vivo and in vitro, as did pharmacological blockage in vitro, in line with our previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siljehav et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the optogenetic inhibition of <italic>Ptger3</italic>-expressing cells in the pFRG/RTN revealed that these cells are essential for the CO<sub>2</sub> response. We also demonstrated that PGE<sub>2</sub> is released during hypercapnic exposure, likely through Cx26 or other CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive connexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huckstepp et al., 2010b</xref>). Thus, part of the CO<sub>2</sub> response seems to be mediated by a gap junction-dependent release of PGE<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Generation of active expiration is another important function of the pFRG/RTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that PGE<sub>2</sub> stimulates both chemosensitive neurons and neurons important for active expiration. Such neuronal populations could overlap, but the ventral part pFRG/RTN seems to have a more chemosensitive character while the lateral part displays rhythmic activity and enforces active expiration when stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>). The CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing of the pFRG/RTN slice remains functional. Whether the rhythmic activity we observe in the pFRG/RTN is generated by “active expiration-neurons” is outside the scope of the present study. Future studies should aim to investigate whether PGE<sub>2</sub> also may affect active expiration.</p><p>The pFRG/RTN is the best-recognized central chemosensitive region. However, in our pFRG/RTN brainstem slice culture, neurons of the raphe nucleus should be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Such neurons may also have chemosensing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Richerson, 2004</xref>), though this has not been shown conclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Depuy et al., 2011</xref>). From the raphe nucleus there are evidence of projections to the pFRG/RTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guyenet et al., 2009</xref>), and we cannot exclude the possibility that these are preserved in the brainstem slice culture.</p><p>The effects of CO<sub>2</sub> in the present study are based on a change in carbamylation of specific proteins, e.g. Cx26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>), or intracellular pH, but testing these alternatives goes beyond the scope of the present work. In our experimental setup the extracellular pH remained stable while the dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> increased. This specific approach was selected because CO<sub>2</sub> has a direct modulating effect on connexins, allowing passage of small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huckstepp et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huckstepp and Dale, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>), and our hypothesis was that PGE<sub>2</sub> is released through such connexins.</p><p>What still remains to be determined the exact source of the PGE<sub>2</sub> released during hypercapnia. The indication of a gap junction-dependent release of PGE<sub>2</sub> together with the presence of mPGEs-1 in pFRG/RTN astrocytes suggests that the PGE<sub>2</sub> is of astrocytic origin. This would be in line with previous findings of astrocytic ATP release during hypercapnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huckstepp et al., 2010a</xref>). The astrocytic involvement in the CO<sub>2</sub> response is also evident in a Rett syndrome model (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) knockout), in which conditional MeCP2 knockout in astroglia blunts the CO<sub>2</sub> response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Turovsky et al., 2015</xref>). We think that mPGEs-1-expressing astrocytes are the likely source, even though alternative sources of PGE<sub>2</sub>, such as endothelial cells or microglia, remain to be investigated with regards to their possible involvement in the pFRG CO<sub>2</sub> response. Nonetheless, CO<sub>2</sub>-mediated PGE<sub>2</sub> release introduces a novel chemosensitive pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>).</p><p>As PGE<sub>2</sub> and the EP3R are directly involved in and modulate both the respiratory rhythm-generating preBötC and the Phox2b chemosensitive neurons, PGE<sub>2</sub> from other sources, such as endothelial cells during hypoxia and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hofstetter et al., 2007</xref>), will alter the hypercapnic and the hypoxic responses. PGE<sub>2</sub> has prominent respiratory depressant effects in humans, sheep, pigs, and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guerra et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Long, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ballanyi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hofstetter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Siljehav et al., 2015</xref>). The PGE<sub>2</sub>-induced attenuation of these vital brainstem neural networks, e.g., during an infectious response, could result in gasping, autoresuscitation failure and ultimately death. However, how chronic PGE<sub>2</sub> release associated with ongoing inflammation alters plasticity and the responsiveness to CO<sub>2</sub> must be further investigated.</p><p>To conclude, we identified a novel pathway in the hypercapnic response of brainstem neural networks that control breathing. This pathway depends on EP3R and gap junctions and is partly mediated by the release of PGE<sub>2</sub>, linking chemosensitivity control to the inflammatory system. The present findings have important implications for understanding why and how ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia are impaired and inhibitory reflexes exaggerated in neonates, particularly during infectious episodes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>C57 black (C57BL/6J) inbred mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were utilized in the experiments.

Negative controls with only secondary antibodies showed no staining.</p><p>For EP3R staining, a different protocol was used. Initially, brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight followed by 10% sucrose overnight and then frozen to -80%. The frozen brainstems were cryosectioned and blocked in blocking buffer (1% BSA, 5% donkey serum, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, consisting of 6 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM Tris base and 9 mM NaCl in ddH<sub>2</sub>O) for 1 hr at RT. After blocking, the slices were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-EP3R antibody (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) diluted 1:50 in 10% DMSO containing 0.2% Triton X-100 in TBS at RT overnight. Next, slices were washed 3 × 15 min with TBS with agitation, followed by incubation for 1 hr in the dark with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA, 2% donkey serum, 2% DMSO and 5% Triton X-100 in TBS. The slices were then washed 3 × 15 min with TBS with agitation, and blocked again for 1 hr at RT in the same blocking buffer as used previously. After blocking, the slices were incubated with the second primary antibody, diluted 1:200 in 10% DMSO containing 0.2% Triton X-100 in TBS at 4°C overnight. Following overnight incubation, the slices were washed 3 × 15 min with TBS with agitation and incubated with Alexa Flour 647-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA, 2% donkey serum, 2% DMSO and 5% Triton X-100 in TBS. Finally, the slices were washed 3 × 15 min with TBS with agitation, and mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI.</p><p>Antibody binding was controlled by including an irrelevant rabbit polyclonal IgG isotype control (Bioss, Woburn, MA, USA). EP3R staining was controlled by including an EP3R blocking peptide reconstituted in distilled water mixed with EP3R antibody at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. A pre-incubation of EP3R antibody with the blocking peptide for 1 hr at RT was necessary before the antibody was added to the slice. The peptide was used in conjunction with the antibody to block protein-antibody complex formation during immunohistochemical analysis for the EP3Rs. These controls showed no staining.</p><p>Double immunofluorescence staining was also performed according to Westman and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Westman et al., 2004</xref>) using polyclonal rabbit anti-human microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 antiserum (mPGES-1; Cayman chemicals, cat. no. 160140) and monoclonal anti-mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody (GFAP; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA, cat no. MAB360). PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin (PBS-saponin) was used as a buffer through the experiment. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using PBS containing 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 0.1% saponin for 60 min in darkness. Endogenous biotin was blocked using an avidin-biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) supplemented with 0.1% saponin. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight, in PBS-saponin containing 3% BSA antibody solution. Thereafter, they were blocked with 1% normal goat serum, or normal donkey serum (depending on the host of secondary antibody) in PBS-saponin for 15 min, followed by 1-hr incubation with secondary antibody, donkey anti-rabbit alexa fluorophore 488 or goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Propidium iodide staining</title><p>Propidium iodide (1 ml/L, Invitrogen, UK) was added to brain slice medium (dilution 1:1000). Staining solution (1 ml) was added on top of the membrane with the brainstem slice cultures and incubated at 37°C (5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for 3 hr. Immediately after incubation, the brainstem slice cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr. Positive controls were made by first treating the brainstem slice culture for oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) for 1 h, as described by Montero Dominguez and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montero Domínguez et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Whole-cell patch recordings were obtained from brainstem slice cultures at a temperature of 34°C. Cells were visualized by using IR-differential contrast microscopy (Axioskop FS, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Recorded cells were selected visually, and paired recordings were obtained for neurons with lateral somatic distances of &lt;100 µm. Recordings were amplified by using 700B amplifiers (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 5–20 kHz by using ITC-18 (Instrutech, Longmont, CO, USA), and acquired by using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA). Patch pipettes were pulled with a P-97 Flamming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA) and had an initial resistance of 5–10 MΩ in a solution containing in mM: 110 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 GTP and 10 phosphocreatine. Recordings were performed in current-clamp mode, with access resistance compensated throughout the experiments. Recordings were discarded when access resistance increased beyond 35 MΩ. To characterize the electrical properties of the recorded cells, depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current steps and ramps were injected, enabling the extraction of properties such as input resistance, membrane time constant and action potential threshold. Electrophysiological properties were presented as box plots, with maximum and minimum values.</p><p>For recording of hypoglossal nerve activity and hypoglossal nucleus neuronal population discharge, an extracellular suction electrode was used together with a Model 1700 AC amplifier (A-M systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA) and AxoScope software, version 9.2 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA). Recordings were made with a sampling interval of 0.3 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> time-lapse imaging</title><p>For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen, UK) dissolved in DMSO (Invitrogen, UK) was used at 10 µM in serum free brain slice medium or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, containing in mM: 150.1 Na<sup>+</sup>, 3 K<sup>+</sup>, 2 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 2 Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 135 Cl<sup>−</sup>, 1.1 H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>, 25 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and 10 glucose) together with 0.02% pluronic acid (Invitrogen, UK). We did not observe any differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup>activity between HEPES-free brain slice medium and aCSF during Ca<sup>2+</sup>imaging, despite slight differences in [K<sup>+</sup>] and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], which both affect the rhythm of the slice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballanyi and Ruangkittisakul, 2009</xref>). A higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] or an increase in [K<sup>+</sup>] from 3 mM to 4.8 mM did not affect the network properties in our system. To localize the preBötC or the pFRG/RTN, tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated Substance P (TMR-SP; Biomol, Oakdale, NY, USA) was used at a final concentration of 3 µM in brain slice medium or aCSF. The TMR-SP solution was placed on top on the brainstem slice and incubated for 10–12 min at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The TMR-SP solution was then replaced with 1 ml of 10 µM Fluo-4 solution. The Fluo-4 solution was incubated for 30–40 min (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Before imaging, the slice was washed with brain slice medium/aCSF for 10 min (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>During time-lapse imaging, slices were kept in an open chamber perfused with HEPES-free brain slice medium (containing in mM: 132 Na<sup>+</sup>, 4.8 K<sup>+</sup>, 1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 0.74 Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 112 Cl<sup>-</sup>, 0.76 H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, 25.6 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and 16.8 glucose) or aCSF (2.5 ml/min) by using a peristaltic pump. A Chamlide Inline Heater (Live Cell instruments, Seoul, Korea, cat no. IL-H-10) was used for temperature control, and a Chamlide AC-PU perfusion chamber for 25-mm coverslips (Live Cell instruments, Seoul, Korea, cat no. ACPU25) was used for perfusion. HEPES-free medium was used to minimize the risk for hydrogen peroxide formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lepe-Zuniga and Gery, 1987</xref>). The medium or aCSF was constantly bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% O<sub>2</sub>. The temperature of the chamber was set to 32°C, which Hartelt and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartelt et al., 2008</xref>) showed to be well tolerated by neurons. Images were captured by using a Zeiss AxioExaminer D1 microscope equipped with 20× and 40× water immersion objectives (N.A. 1.0), a monochromatic Zeiss MrM CCD-camera, a Photometrics eVolve EMCCD-camera and filter sets 38HE (Zeiss), 43 (Zeiss), and et560/hq605 (Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT, USA). For live imaging, a frame interval of 0.1–2 s was used. Exposure time was set to 100–300 ms.</p><p>Substances added during imaging were [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO, 0.5 µM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, cat no.

All substances were dissolved in brain slice medium/aCSF prior to experimentation and added to the chamber by using a continuous flow system. For each experiment, a control period with regular medium/aCSF was followed by drug application. GZA was used as a negative control for the gap junction inhibitors CBX and 18α-GA because it has non-gap junction-inhibiting properties, but similar side effects to those of CBX. Specificity was tested by using a second batch of medium or aCSF. During infections in neonatal children, PGE<sub>2</sub> is present at a concentration of 15 pM in cerebrospinal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hofstetter et al., 2007</xref>). A higher concentration (10 nM) was used to compensate for the in vivo metabolism of the molecule.</p><p>Exposure to isohydric hypercapnia was done by using aCSF adjusted with a high bicarbonate buffer concentration (in mM: 150.1 Na<sup>+</sup>, 3 K<sup>+</sup>, 2 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 2 Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 111 Cl<sup>−</sup>, 1.1 H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>, 50 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> and 10 glucose).

The brainstem slice cultures were then placed in an incubator for 5 days, and after washing with warm brain slice medium at time points 2 and 5 days, the brainstem slice cultures were moved back to the original laboratory and placed in an incubator overnight. Ca<sup>2+</sup> time-lapse imaging was performed on the slices as described above.

Regions of interest were marked for all cells based on the standard deviation of fluorescence intensity over time, by using a semiautomatic-adapted ImageJ script kindly provided by Dr. John Hayes (The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://physimage.sourceforge.net/">http://physimage.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>). The mean intensity value and coordinates were measured using ImageJ. Average intensities of regions of interest were quantified for each frame, and dynamic fluorescence signals were normalized to baseline values. The linear similarity (Pearson correlation) was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) between pairs of Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces with a custom-made script in MATLAB (version 7.9.0.529 R2009b; MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and by using the mic2net toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smedler et al., 2014</xref>) (version 6.12; MathWorks). Calculating the pairwise correlation coefficients resulted in a correlation matrix that was converted to an adjacency matrix by applying a cut-off level. The cut-off level was selected by calculating the mean of the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of correlation coefficients for a set of experiments with scrambled signals. Scrambling was performed by randomly translating all traces in the time-domain. The network structure was visualized by plotting a line between pairs of cells, where the color of the lines was proportionate to the correlation coefficient. This was plotted on top of an image of the standard deviations of the fluorescence over time per pixel. Connectivity was defined as the number of cell pairs with a correlation coefficient larger than the cut-off value divided by the total number of the pairs of cells. This provided a measure of the degree of connections within a network. Small-world parameter, mean shortest path length (λ) and mean clustering coefficient (σ) were calculated by using the MATLAB BGL library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10922">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10922</ext-link>) and compared to corresponding randomized networks. Many biological networks have a small-world structure, where the mean shortest path length is as short as in random networks and the mean clustering coefficient is higher. This signifies that the average number of nodes (for example, neural cells) that a signal has to pass is low, and that many of the nodes are connected in clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Jan-Marino Ramirez, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the study by Forsberg et al., the authors combine in vivo, ex vivo and novel in vitro approaches to address the role of gap junctions and potential involvement of astrocytic release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in respiratory control. PGE2 released in response to CO<sub>2</sub> acts on prostaglandin EP3 receptors located in two main structures involved in respiratory rhythm generation, modulation and CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity: the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) and the parafacial respiratory group/retrotrapezoid nucleus (pFRG/RTN). The authors propose that this PGE2-EP3R pathway is an essential component of the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> and a vital modulator of respiratory activity, including sighing. The present results build upon previous results by Herlenius et al., showing that IL-1β impairs breathing during infection by inducing PGE2 release in the vicinity of brainstem respiratory networks (Hoffsteter et al. 2007), that inflammation via PGE2 and EP3R alters the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> in brainstem spinal cord preparations (Siljehav et al., 2014), and other recent works on the role of PGE2 in the regulation of breathing pattern, in particular sigh frequency (Koch et al., 2015).</p><p>In order to characterize the pathway from brainstem astrocytes to the central pattern generator, the authors conducted plethysmographic studies in EP3R-knockout mice, which showed that PGE2 increases sighing activity via EP3R signaling and that the genetic ablation of EP3R reduces the hypercapnic response in vivo. In particular, they extended these experiments through electrophysiological studies in slice cultures of the brainstem with a functioning pFRG/RTN and preBötC. Furthermore, connectivity analysis of preBötC and pFRG/RTN respiratory networks (a very original aspect of the paper) showed that the hypercapnic response is dependent on gap junctions. The authors also used Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and optogenetic silencing of EP3R-expressing cells to assess the role of this pathway in the hypercapnic response of the pFRG/RTN.</p><p>The reviewers were very impressed by the numerous techniques and novel approaches presented in this study. However, the manuscript is very complex and dense, and it tries to convey several different messages that in part become mixed up. For example, the thread of the Introduction oscillates between sighs, the role of astrocytes, inflammation, and inflammation-related respiratory disorders. A similar, general, concern also applies to the presentation of the results.</p><p>Another general concern is that the manuscript is lacking clear and concise specific hypotheses. The clarity of the manuscript would be greatly improved by clearly stating the hypothesis for a given set of experiments, and thus the conclusions of such experiments. At present, it is sometimes difficult to know how a given experiment relates to the overall conclusions. A similar concern relates to the figures. The reader must jump back and forth between different figures (and supplementary figures) to understand how the results relate to the specific and overall hypotheses of the manuscript.</p><p>It would vastly improve clarity to separate out analyses and hypotheses in the preBötC and those in pFRG/RTN. It would then be clearer why symmetrical analyses are not completed on each region.</p><p>Thus, in general, it will be critical to substantially re-organize the paper and figures, and make it more hypothesis-driven to bring it up to its full potential. Remember that the manuscript needs to be understood by a general audience.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The demonstration that it is actually the astrocytes that mediate the hypercapnic response is a minor and weaker part of the study. The study focuses more on the role of gap junctions than glia cells, and there is no experiment that actually tests the direct involvement of glia, or &quot;astrocytic release&quot; as stated in the Abstract. The role of glia is primarily inferred by prior work, e.g. by Gourine. The reviewers have no principle concern with the conclusion, and this possibility should be discussed, but the title, Introduction and Abstract should not imply that this study is about the role of glia. Along the same lines, the authors should avoid strong statements such as &quot;PGE2 is released from astrocytes through CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive connexin hemichannels&quot;. This is good for a discussion, but included into the Introduction (last paragraph) suggests that this will actually be demonstrated in the paper. Even with regards to the gap junctions. the authors did not really test gap junctions. The toxins used are not entirely specific. This should be discussed.</p><p>Along the same lines: A major conclusion of the manuscript is that PGE2 and ATP are released from astrocytes to alter pFRG/RTN responses to proton-independent increases in CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> and Discussion, sixth paragraph). However, this was not directly shown in the experiments conducted. The authors demonstrate changes after blocking gap junctions and blocking P2Rs alters the response, but this does not mean that astrocytes are releasing either PGE2 or ATP. The present results in context with previously published work does suggest this might be a logical conclusion, but alternative interpretations should be discussed.</p><p>2) The authors present a wealth of data using multiple different experimental methods, including a &quot;breathing&quot; brainstem slice culture. Several issues related to these slices were raised and are listed as separate points, below. Without addressing these concerns and being specific about the age of the slices in culture (i.e. 1, 2, or 3 weeks of culturing), it is difficult to critically evaluate the results. For clarity of the results, the reviewers suggest that it would be useful separate out data from the preBötC cultured slices and pFRG/RTN cultured slices, since the authors end up testing slightly different questions between the two preparations. This would help delineate which slice preparation was used for particular results. You will find related comments listed below.</p><p>3) Development of a &quot;breathing&quot; brainstem slice culture is very interesting and could be highly valuable to the field. However, the authors leave out a number of critical aspects with regards to the preparation that make the results difficult to evaluate. Firstly, it is unclear why such a preparation is necessary or what advantages it has compared to the classic rhythmic slice preparation. Acute measurements in the rhythmic slice preparation or a pFRG/RTN slice preparation would be just as advantageous for such experiments. Further, the authors are not clear about how long the slice culture is &quot;breathing&quot;. No traces are shown to demonstrate baseline activity after 1, 2, or 3 weeks for the reader to see how activity changes with longer time in culture, and thus how the presented results might change with time. The authors do present data that the connectivity and number of active cells does not change with time (though the connectivity diagrams do appear to change over time especially when evaluating the raw numbers), but it is not clear how this would be observed in &quot;breathing&quot; or rhythmic/oscillatory behaviour. For example, is there any rhythmic activity after 3 weeks in culture in either the pFRG/RTN slices or the preBötC slices?</p><p>Additionally, no images are presented showing NK1 or other staining in the organotypic slices after three weeks, so it is difficult to decipher how neurons or astrocytes in culture have changed during this period (morphology, position, etc.). Since the conclusions in the study are based largely on data from such preparations, these are important methodological aspects to address. And since information is lacking in most figures and data presentation regarding the details of the slice preparation from which the data was obtained (i.e. 1, 2, or 3 weeks in culture), the reviewer assumes that the data from all weeks were collapsed, but without additional information, it is not clear whether such collapsing of data is appropriate. The authors also switch back and forth between saying &quot;organotypic slice cultures&quot;, cultured cells, or slices. It would aid the reader if the authors used one terminology. Multiple types of preparations are used in these investigations and in the present format, it is difficult to follow which preparations are being used where and why such a preparation was necessary.</p><p>4) Related to the comment (3): There is a general issue with regards to the characterization of rhythmic activity in the two types of organotypic slices. Some of the specific concerns raised by the reviewers are as follows: The authors never spell out, whether they have population rhythms, and what kind of characteristics they have – even though they clearly have rhythms. The authors talk about &quot;clustered activity&quot;, &quot;clusters of high correlated activity&quot;. What do they mean with this? Only in the last few sentences of the subsection “Physiological measurements of brainstem respiratory activity demonstrate functional and responsive networks” they state that the preBötC remains rhythmic. The authors show something on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, but it doesn't look like rhythmicity. Yet, in the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, the authors imply that they have population rhythmicity that seems to even drive XII activity. Please try to be more concrete. Did these slices generate rhythmicity? What kind of properties do they find: frequency, amplitude, and also regularity? Do the calcium oscillations correspond to the &quot;clustered&quot; neuronal activities in frequency?</p><p>In the third paragraph of the subsection “Physiological measurements of brainstem respiratory activity demonstrate functional and responsive networks” – do the authors record from pacemaker neurons? This is potentially all very interesting, and if these slices show rhythmicity, the authors need to show traces of recordings, rather than activity from individual or pairs of neurons.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> e.g. is beautiful, but do the pFRG/RTN slices show similar properties? Why is this not shown e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is interesting, but why not show an expanded trace of rhythmicity? This is critical information in order to be able to assess what type of activity was characterized in this study. Did the pre-Bötzinger complex show activity that resembled sighs? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> shows some rhythmicity, but this should be expanded to see the characteristics. Given that this is the first report for these slices, a careful characterization is important. The authors might want to consider a reorganization of the manuscript: They should first characterize the population phenomenon, then report the clustered activity, correlations between neurons. Indeed, streamlining the messages, and not mixing up information would be critical to make this paper readable for a general readership.</p><p>5) Another general issue: the pFRG/RTN has been implicated (a) in CO<sub>2</sub> sensing and (b) the neuronal control of active expiration. However, it is not entirely clear how these two functions work together, and whether the same neurons are responsible for active expiration and CO<sub>2</sub> sensing. Phox2B is a good marker for the sensing aspect, but the rhythmicity observed in the pFRG/RTN slice may relate to &quot;active expiration&quot;, and not necessarily to CO<sub>2</sub> sensing. Clearly, the slice will also contain CO<sub>2</sub> sensing neurons. Both possibilities are interesting, and both could play a role. The excitatory effect on the pFRG/RTN could imply that PGE2 induces active expiration, a possibility that has not been discussed in this paper. Discussing the role of active expiration should be considered, and the authors should also discuss the general issue of &quot;rhythm generating function&quot; versus &quot;CO<sub>2</sub> sensing&quot;, and the fact that this may not be related to the same neurons, but that PGE2 may affect both.</p><p>6) The reviewers have some reservations about the authors' claim that the PGE2-EP3R pathway is indispensable for the ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Specifically, the experimental support for this claim is not convincing (mainly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>). There are several problems in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> that may question whether the inhibition of gap junctions by 18-a-GA abolished the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>. On the one hand, Panel b (top trace) and c (left graph) seem to indicate that 18-α-GA abolishes the response to CO<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, in Panel c, the CO<sub>2</sub> responses are the same whether gap junctions are inhibited by 18-α-GA or not (GZA, i.e. the negative control for the gap junction inhibitors 18α-GA). In fact, control values (in air) in the middle and right graphs are very similar, and the values obtained for GZA+ CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>+18-α-GA are also very similar. This apparent contradiction is reflected in the legend: it is first stated that &quot;hypercarbic responses were abolished when gap junctions were inhibited by 18-α-GA&quot;, but later on, the legend states that &quot;the hypercarbic response was attenuated but not completely reversed by 18-α-GA&quot;. Some details in this figure also need attention. DF/F0 in Panel b should not be expressed in &quot;arbitrary units&quot;, as mentioned. It is in fact a dimensionless variable (there is nothing to add after &quot;DF/F0&quot; on the y-axis label). Also, the scales are different for the different traces in Panel b, which is misleading. The experimental basis of the abolition of the CO<sub>2</sub> response in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> also presents some shortcomings. Panel a indicates a lack of response to CO<sub>2</sub> after AH6809 treatment, but there is no experimental control showing the time course of frequency changes in the absence of AH6808. In Panel f, the top graph lacks a control (e. g. a return to normocapnia). As presented, it is unclear whether the response to CO<sub>2</sub> was abolished, as implied by the authors, or whether the period of measurement was too short for the full CO<sub>2</sub> response to appear. In the bottom graph, the light stimulus seems to stabilize the hypercapnic response, not to abolish it, which departs from the clear-cut return to baseline presented in Panel g, left graph. This raises a concern on the way data were averaged in Panel g.</p><p>Incidentally, the DF/F0 graph in Panel a contains a numerical scale on the y-axis, which should be the case for all similar graphs (with a larger font size).</p><p>Because of all these considerations it seems an exaggeration to conclude, that the PGE2-EP3R pathway is &quot;a vital modulator of respiratory activity&quot;, if only because EP3R<sup>-/-</sup> mice (although obese) survive until adulthood.</p><p>7) The authors do not address why using a proton-independent CO<sub>2</sub> stimulus was important to their studies, nor how they expect their studies to be altered if a proton-dependent stimulus was used. Since the majority of studies investigating hypercapnic responses has used acidification/pH changes as a stimulus (including the papers referenced in this manuscript), the authors should address this discrepancy. The authors need to address the rationale for choosing to investigate proton-independent changes in CO<sub>2</sub> instead of changes in pH/H<sup>+</sup>, as is commonly done in the field. While CO<sub>2</sub> may be a direct activator of cells, most literature to date has tested changes in pH. Additionally, many of the papers referenced in the manuscript in support of using proton-independent increased CO<sub>2</sub>, actually used pH to evoke changes. For example, Gourine et al. used changes in pH to examine involvement of ATP-P2Rs, yet the authors use these previous studies as rationale to look at the effects of proton-independent increased CO<sub>2</sub> on the pFRG/RTN (Results, subsection “The pFRG/RTN respiratory region exhibited correlated network activity and retained CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity”). This discrepancy and rationale for using such a stimulus is not addressed in the present manuscript. Do the authors think that the same results would be obtained if experiments were conducted by altering pH? Why are the results proton-independent responses important? These questions are not addressed in the manuscript and would greatly improve the clarity and impact of the results.</p><p>8) The reviewers raised several questions regarding the experimental controls. Were the controls wild-type littermates of mutant mice (obtained by the crossing of heterozygous mice), and if so, were the heterozygotes also analyzed, as suggested by the mention that pups were analyzed after their genotype had been determined? If not, were the controls simply obtained from a C57Bl/6J strain? Control littermates are highly preferable, to control for date of birth, maternal care, litter size etc. These factors, also influence the maturation of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. It is indicated in the Methods that the EP3R gene was selectively deleted in knockout mice, as described in Fabre et al., 2001, but here, the authors used a 129 background.</p><p>9) The analysis of sighs is central to this study, and a very clear description of how sighs are defined and determined is thus essential. This point is ambiguous in the manuscript. In Methods, sighs are defined as &quot;a breath with &gt;50% increase in inspired volume compared to eupneic breaths&quot;, but there is no indication of how these reference eupneic breaths were determined. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and 1d</xref>, not all sighs (arrows) seem to fulfill these criteria. In the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, sighs are defined differently, as &quot;an inspiratory volume and respiratory cycle period increase followed by a 2-cycle pause&quot;. In fact, apnea does not occur systematically after a sigh and cannot be a defining characteristic. Besides, the trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> that illustrates the authors' definition does not display any post-sigh pause. In contrast, a defining characteristic of sighs is their biphasic pattern (see Toporikova et al., 2015 and the references quoted in her article). Without taking into account this biphasic pattern, above-average breaths may be confused with sighs, especially in a context of increased variability. There are also several minor concerns with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: sigh frequencies (Panel c) do not exemplify the mean values shown in Panel d; in Panels c, e and f, only relevant comparisons are necessary. In Figure 1—figure supplement 1, it is puzzling that there are 11 divisions between 100 and 200 on the y-axis. Also, with a 60% increase in Fr (compared to WT) and a 30% increase in VT (compared to WT), the EP3R<sup>-/-</sup> mice only displayed a 20-30% increase in VE (compared to WT). Is this correct?</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> needs to be revised: Three comments:</p><p>A) It is important to include &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 1&quot; into the &quot;final <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>&quot;. The supplementary figure contains an important message that is not contained in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>B) The traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> are not very helpful, as they contain lots of &quot;artifacts&quot; or deflections that are not respiratory, and could be mistaken by a non-specialist with sighs. I am very familiar with such traces and can detect sighs – but the general reader isn't an expert. Either, find other examples, or just show the graphs, which would also make it easier to add the supplementary figure.</p><p>C) Indeed, given that the sigh plays such an important part of the paper, there should be a figure of a sigh, and how the authors characterize sighs. Again, for the general reader this will not be clear from the figures presented. This comment relates also to the general comment (9) on the sigh.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>, has a very concrete model. It looks nice and is making their point. But, I am not convinced that they actually showed the differential glia/neuron modulation in preBötC and RTN/pFRG.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;CO<sub>2</sub>-evoked release of PGE2 modulates sighs and inspiration as demonstrated in brainstem organotypic culture&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, the manuscript is very complex and dense, and it tries to convey several different messages that in part become mixed up.

In accordance with your advice, we have now reorganized the manuscript and figures. The hypothesis for each set of experiments is now more clearly stated. We have also reorganized the results so that they are now divided into three themes. After the introduction to the main issues from the in vivo data, we first characterize the new organotypic brainstem slice culture system we have developed and use this to investigate the mechanisms behind the results seen in vivo. Since those experiments did not answer our main questions fully, we have now created a novel brainstem slice culture for the pFRG/RTN and characterized it as well. Finally, in the third part, we used the pFRG/RTN culture to investigate the role of PGE<sub>2</sub> in chemosensitivity. Consequently, we have split some figures and rearranged them to follow the new structure of the results.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The demonstration that it is actually the astrocytes that mediate the hypercapnic response is a minor and weaker part of the study. The study focuses more on the role of gap junctions than glia cells, and there is no experiment that actually tests the direct involvement of glia, or &quot;astrocytic release&quot; as stated in the Abstract. The role of glia is primarily inferred by prior work, e.g. by Gourine. The reviewers have no principle concern with the conclusion, and this possibility should be discussed, but the title, Introduction and Abstract should not imply that this study is about the role of glia. Along the same lines, the authors should avoid strong statements such as &quot;PGE2 is released from astrocytes through CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive connexin hemichannels&quot;. This is good for a discussion, but included into the Introduction (last paragraph) suggests that this will actually be demonstrated in the paper. Even with regards to the gap junctions. the authors did not really test gap junctions. The toxins used are not entirely specific. This should be discussed.</italic> </p><p><italic>Along the same lines: A major conclusion of the manuscript is that PGE2 and ATP are released from astrocytes to alter pFRG/RTN responses to proton-independent increases in CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> and Discussion, sixth paragraph). However, this was not directly shown in the experiments conducted. The authors demonstrate changes after blocking gap junctions and blocking P2Rs alters the response, but this does not mean that astrocytes are releasing either PGE2 or ATP. The present results in context with previously published work does suggest this might be a logical conclusion, but alternative interpretations should be discussed.</italic></p><p>We agree with your statement that our data do not show the direct release of PGE<sub>2</sub> (or ATP) from astrocytes. We have rephrased these conclusions throughout the manuscript and removed the statement that PGE<sub>2</sub> is released by glia from the title, Abstract, and Introduction and have clarified that this is still a working hypothesis. In the fourteenth paragraph of the Discussion, we discuss the issue further and describe how astrocytes are known to release ATP, for example, and that it would be possible for them to release the similar small molecule PGE<sub>2</sub> as well. Notably, we show that astrocytes lining the ventral border express mPGEs<sup>-1</sup> (which produces PGE<sub>2</sub>). However, as you correctly point out, we have not shown directly that the PGE<sub>2</sub> released during exposure to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> originates from astrocytes. This is a remaining issue that needs to be resolved. Sources like endothelial cells and microglia should be investigated in future studies.</p><p>Further, we are aware of the problem with the gap junction inhibitors. However, they are commonly used for this purpose and we use both vehicle alone and structurally similar substances as controls. In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, we discuss the limitations of gap junction pharmacological tools and that the results concerning gap junction function should be interpreted carefully.</p><p>We have also removed statements that would draw a line between proton-independent and -dependent mechanisms. In our experimental setup, extracellular pH remained stable during hypercapnic exposure but we have not controlled or monitored intracellular pH. Thus, our present experiments and data do not distinguish between the two alternatives.</p><p><italic>2) The authors present a wealth of data using multiple different experimental methods, including a &quot;breathing&quot; brainstem slice culture. Several issues related to these slices were raised and are listed as separate points, below. Without addressing these concerns and being specific about the age of the slices in culture (i.e. 1, 2, or 3 weeks of culturing), it is difficult to critically evaluate the results. For clarity of the results, the reviewers suggest that it would be useful separate out data from the preBötC cultured slices and pFRG/RTN cultured slices, since the authors end up testing slightly different questions between the two preparations. This would help delineate which slice preparation was used for particular results. You will find related comments listed below.</italic></p><p>Information about the age of the cultures during the experiment is very important, and we understand that this has raised concerns. Throughout the revised manuscript, we have specified how long the slices were cultivated before the experiment was performed, and we have also provided more detailed data on the behavior of the brainstem slice culture at different ages. This is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> we also display the calcium signaling frequency and variability at the different culture ages. In general, all the experiments in which we characterize the model, i.e., survival, immunohistochemical analysis of protein expression, calcium activity, network structure, and testing for the preservation of hypercarbic responses, used slices 1, 2, or 3 weeks of age. The more detailed experiments concerning inflammation and hypercarbic responses were done using 1-week-old cultures.</p><p>As we describe above, we have separated the preBötC from the pFRG/RTN data.</p><p><italic>3) Development of a &quot;breathing&quot; brainstem slice culture is very interesting and could be highly valuable to the field. However, the authors leave out a number of critical aspects with regards to the preparation that make the results difficult to evaluate. Firstly, it is unclear why such a preparation is necessary or what advantages it has compared to the classic rhythmic slice preparation. Acute measurements in the rhythmic slice preparation or a pFRG/RTN slice preparation would be just as advantageous for such experiments. Further, the authors are not clear about how long the slice culture is &quot;breathing&quot;. No traces are shown to demonstrate baseline activity after 1, 2, or 3 weeks for the reader to see how activity changes with longer time in culture, and thus how the presented results might change with time. The authors do present data that the connectivity and number of active cells does not change with time (though the connectivity diagrams do appear to change over time especially when evaluating the raw numbers), but it is not clear how this would be observed in &quot;breathing&quot; or rhythmic/oscillatory behaviour. For example, is there any rhythmic activity after 3 weeks in culture in either the pFRG/RTN slices or the preBötC slices?</italic> </p><p><italic>Additionally, no images are presented showing NK1 or other staining in the organotypic slices after three weeks, so it is difficult to decipher how neurons or astrocytes in culture have changed during this period (morphology, position, etc.). Since the conclusions in the study are based largely on data from such preparations, these are important methodological aspects to address. And since information is lacking in most figures and data presentation regarding the details of the slice preparation from which the data was obtained (i.e. 1, 2, or 3 weeks in culture), the reviewer assumes that the data from all weeks were collapsed, but without additional information, it is not clear whether such collapsing of data is appropriate. The authors also switch back and forth between saying &quot;organotypic slice cultures&quot;, cultured cells, or slices. It would aid the reader if the authors used one terminology. Multiple types of preparations are used in these investigations and in the present format, it is difficult to follow which preparations are being used where and why such a preparation was necessary.</italic></p><p>We are happy to hear that the development of a breathing brainstem organotypic culture might be highly valuable to the present field of research. In the short introduction to the first theme (Results), we point out that there is a need for a model system that provides the ability to perform long-term studies on respiratory centers. In the second paragraph of the Discussion, we now provide a more in-depth discussion on the pros and cons of our brainstem slice culture. In short, the culture provides the possibility of studying long-term drug exposure (hours to days), which we are currently conducting in parallel in studies that have not yet been finalized, and viral transduction in vitro (not possible in “acute slices”), which we have assessed for the optogenetic experiments in this study. Further, the slice cultures give the user somewhat more flexibility and significantly reduces the number of procedures otherwise needed to be performed on live animals.</p><p>To better characterize and clarify how the baseline activity of the cultures changes over time, we have added several figures and data. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> we have added traces of NK1R-expressing neurons’ activity during TTX inhibition at 7, 14, and 21 days in vitro. We have not detected differences among slices of different ages with any of the parameters we have analyzed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, we show rhythmic hypoglossal nerve output that is stable for over 2 hours of recording after 3 weeks of cultivation.</p><p>We have now shown the expression of the different neural markers after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of slice cultivation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. Throughout the whole manuscript, we have better described the settings for each experiment, including cultivation stage. For consistency, we have used “brainstem slice culture” for general terminology.</p><p>The current characterization better presents the novel model system’s behavior over time. The present manuscript already contains a wealth of novel data, techniques, and approaches, as mentioned by the reviewers. Nonetheless, an even more detailed characterization will surely emerge in future studies. We hope that the novel approaches presented in the current manuscript will help to shed light on several of the remaining black boxes of how inspiration is generated and controlled.</p><p><italic>4) Related to the comment (3): There is a general issue with regards to the characterization of rhythmic activity in the two types of organotypic slices. Some of the specific concerns raised by the reviewers are as follows: The authors never spell out, whether they have population rhythms, and what kind of characteristics they have – even though they clearly have rhythms. The authors talk about &quot;clustered activity&quot;, &quot;clusters of high correlated activity&quot;. What do they mean with this? Only in the last few sentences of the subsection “Physiological measurements of brainstem respiratory activity demonstrate functional and responsive networks” they state that the preBötC remains rhythmic. The authors show something on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, but it doesn't look like rhythmicity. Yet, in the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, the authors imply that they have population rhythmicity that seems to even drive XII activity. Please try to be more concrete. Did these slices generate rhythmicity? What kind of properties do they find: frequency, amplitude, and also regularity? Do the calcium oscillations correspond to the &quot;clustered&quot; neuronal activities in frequency?</italic> </p><p><italic>In the third paragraph of the subsection “Physiological measurements of brainstem respiratory activity demonstrate functional and responsive networks” – do the authors record from pacemaker neurons? This is potentially all very interesting, and if these slices show rhythmicity, the authors need to show traces of recordings, rather than activity from individual or pairs of neurons.</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> e.g. is beautiful, but do the pFRG/RTN slices show similar properties? Why is this not shown e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is interesting, but why not show an expanded trace of rhythmicity? This is critical information in order to be able to assess what type of activity was characterized in this study. Did the pre-Bötzinger complex show activity that resembled sighs? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> shows some rhythmicity, but this should be expanded to see the characteristics. Given that this is the first report for these slices, a careful characterization is important. The authors might want to consider a reorganization of the manuscript: They should first characterize the population phenomenon, then report the clustered activity, correlations between neurons. Indeed, streamlining the messages, and not mixing up information would be critical to make this paper readable for a general readership.</italic></p><p>We hope our revised version better addresses your concerns on rhythmicity. We have also added more data to provide a more detailed description of the rhythmic activity (see above). The slices do indeed generate rhythmicity. Our results are based on calcium oscillations within the preBötC and extracellular measurements of the electrical hypoglossal nerve and nucleus activity. Results indicate the presence of NK1R<sup>+</sup> neuronal pacemaker activity. Their rhythmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during inhibition of synaptic transmission remained, however with a lower frequency and higher coefficient of variation (subsection “Physiological measurements of brainstem respiratory activity demonstrate functional and responsive networks”, fifth paragraph). We have also added a display of a longer extracellular recording from the hypoglossal nucleus, showing activity after 3 weeks, as well as graphs that show frequency and regularity at 1, 2, and 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Considering the clustered activity, we refer to cells that were shown to be connected in the correlation analysis. We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, for clarification and to make this concept easier to grasp. Also, calcium oscillation frequency does indeed correspond to motor output frequency.</p><p>Regarding sigh activity, we have noticed increases in the calcium signal amplitude and length after application of PGE<sub>2</sub>. This is discussed in the second paragraph of the subsection “PGE2 modulates preBötC activity”. We have not, however, identified sigh-related calcium activity in preBötC control recordings.</p><p>Concerning the pFRG/RTN output, to our knowledge, there is no established method to measure such electrical nerve output from slices, and hence such a technique is not established in our lab. Respiration-related output has been reported to emerge through the facial nerve. However, in those studies, preBötC and other respiratory centers were preserved in the specimen examined.</p><p><italic>5) Another general issue: the pFRG/RTN has been implicated (a) in CO<sub>2</sub> sensing and (b) the neuronal control of active expiration. However, it is not entirely clear how these two functions work together, and whether the same neurons are responsible for active expiration and CO<sub>2</sub> sensing. Phox2B is a good marker for the sensing aspect, but the rhythmicity observed in the pFRG/RTN slice may relate to &quot;active expiration&quot;, and not necessarily to CO<sub>2</sub> sensing. Clearly, the slice will also contain CO<sub>2</sub> sensing neurons. Both possibilities are interesting, and both could play a role. The excitatory effect on the pFRG/RTN could imply that PGE2 induces active expiration, a possibility that has not been discussed in this paper. Discussing the role of active expiration should be considered, and the authors should also discuss the general issue of &quot;rhythm generating function&quot; versus &quot;CO<sub>2</sub> sensing&quot;, and the fact that this may not be related to the same neurons, but that PGE2 may affect both.</italic></p><p>Active expiration has not been the primary focus of this manuscript, but we have added the concept in the eleventh paragraph of the Discussion. It is possible that PGE<sub>2</sub> stimulates both chemosensitive neurons and neurons important for active expiration. Such neurons could also overlap. Future studies should aim to investigate whether PGE<sub>2</sub> also affects active expiration.</p><p><italic>6) The reviewers have some reservations about the authors' claim that the PGE2-EP3R pathway is indispensable for the ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Specifically, the experimental support for this claim is not convincing (mainly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>). There are several problems in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> that may question whether the inhibition of gap junctions by 18-a-GA abolished the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>. On the one hand, Panel b (top trace) and c (left graph) seem to indicate that 18-α-GA abolishes the response to CO<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, in Panel c, the CO<sub>2</sub> responses are the same whether gap junctions are inhibited by 18-α-GA or not (GZA, i.e. the negative control for the gap junction inhibitors 18α-GA). In fact, control values (in air) in the middle and right graphs are very similar, and the values obtained for GZA+ CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>+18-α-GA are also very similar. This apparent contradiction is reflected in the legend: it is first stated that &quot;hypercarbic responses were abolished when gap junctions were inhibited by 18-α-GA&quot;, but later on, the legend states that &quot;the hypercarbic response was attenuated but not completely reversed by 18-α-GA&quot;. Some details in this figure also need attention. DF/F0 in Panel b should not be expressed in &quot;arbitrary units&quot;, as mentioned. It is in fact a dimensionless variable (there is nothing to add after &quot;DF/F0&quot; on the y-axis label). Also, the scales are different for the different traces in Panel b, which is misleading. The experimental basis of the abolition of the CO<sub>2</sub> response in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> also presents some shortcomings. Panel a indicates a lack of response to CO<sub>2</sub> after AH6809 treatment, but there is no experimental control showing the time course of frequency changes in the absence of AH6808. In Panel f, the top graph lacks a control (e. g. a return to normocapnia). As presented, it is unclear whether the response to CO<sub>2</sub> was abolished, as implied by the authors, or whether the period of measurement was too short for the full CO<sub>2</sub> response to appear. In the bottom graph, the light stimulus seems to stabilize the hypercapnic response, not to abolish it, which departs from the clear-cut return to baseline presented in Panel g, left graph. This raises a concern on the way data were averaged in Panel g.</italic> </p><p><italic>Incidentally, the DF/F0 graph in Panel a contains a numerical scale on the y-axis, which should be the case for all similar graphs (with a larger font size). Because of all these considerations it seems an exaggeration to conclude, that the PGE2-EP3R pathway is &quot;a vital modulator of respiratory activity&quot;, if only because EP3R<sup>-/-</sup> mice (although obese) survive until adulthood.</italic></p><p>We agree that the PGE2-EP3R pathway is not indispensable, but our results show that it is important, given the attenuated response in EP3R knockout mice. Therefore, we have replaced “indispensable” and “vital” with “important” in the text.</p><p>The comment on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is an interesting point. Indeed, there is no significant difference between frequencies during treatment with CO<sub>2</sub>+18-α-GA and CO<sub>2</sub>+GZA. However, the dynamics are different. When gap junctions are inhibited by 18-α-GA, no CO<sub>2</sub> response is seen. This is not the case with GZA, as CO<sub>2</sub> increases signaling frequency during GZA treatment. On the other hand, 18-α-GA is not able to completely reverse the CO<sub>2</sub> response, supporting our theory that it is mainly pre-made PGE<sub>2</sub> that is released. However, the reduction that 18-α-GA causes, indicates that gap junctions are still important to maintain the CO<sub>2</sub> response, even if they are not exclusively responsible for this function. GZA is not able to reduce an already-initiated response. We have adjusted this in the figure (which is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) to better illustrate this.</p><p>The DF/F0 panels have been adjusted throughout the manuscript according to your suggestion. We have also added the numerical scale to all relevant figures. We cannot, however, see how the scales are different in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>). The middle (GZA) trace is somewhat noisier compared to the other two. Is this what you are referring to?</p><p>A control recording has been added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13a</xref> for comparison, and a graph showing average frequencies in these experiments has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13b</xref>. A trace showing the return to normocapnia has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13f</xref>, as you have suggested. Also, a cell trace (from the same experimental setting) that better represents the average data has been used for the bottom graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13f</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) The authors do not address why using a proton-independent CO<sub>2</sub> stimulus was important to their studies, nor how they expect their studies to be altered if a proton-dependent stimulus was used. Since the majority of studies investigating hypercapnic responses has used acidification/pH changes as a stimulus (including the papers referenced in this manuscript), the authors should address this discrepancy. The authors need to address the rationale for choosing to investigate proton-independent changes in CO<sub>2</sub> instead of changes in pH/H<sup>+</sup>, as is commonly done in the field. While CO<sub>2</sub> may be a direct activator of cells, most literature to date has tested changes in pH. Additionally, many of the papers referenced in the manuscript in support of using proton-independent increased CO<sub>2</sub>, actually used pH to evoke changes. For example, Gourine et al. used changes in pH to examine involvement of ATP-P2Rs, yet the authors use these previous studies as rationale to look at the effects of proton-independent increased CO<sub>2</sub> on the pFRG/RTN (Results, subsection “The pFRG/RTN respiratory region exhibited correlated network activity and retained CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity”). This discrepancy and rationale for using such a stimulus is not addressed in the present manuscript. Do the authors think that the same results would be obtained if experiments were conducted by altering pH? Why are the results proton-independent responses important? These questions are not addressed in the manuscript and would greatly improve the clarity and impact of the results.</italic></p><p>As stated above, our experiments do not distinguish between proton-dependent and -independent CO<sub>2</sub> responses. With regard to intracellular pH, our experimental designs will have an effect e.g. (Ruusuvuori, Kirilkin et al. 2010).</p><p><italic>8) The reviewers raised several questions regarding the experimental controls. Were the controls wild-type littermates of mutant mice (obtained by the crossing of heterozygous mice), and if so, were the heterozygotes also analyzed, as suggested by the mention that pups were analyzed after their genotype had been determined? If not, were the controls simply obtained from a C57Bl/6J strain? Control littermates are highly preferable, to control for date of birth, maternal care, litter size etc. These factors, also influence the maturation of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. It is indicated in the Methods that the EP3R gene was selectively deleted in knockout mice, as described in Fabre et al., 2001, but here, the authors used a 129 background.</italic></p><p>Unfortunately, we do not have the ability to use littermate controls, as the strain is the homozygotic EP3R knockout obtained from the Anders Blomqvist research group at Linköping University, Sweden. Genotyping was performed to confirm the genetic homogeneity of the knockout line. These mice do indeed have a C57Bl/6J background and are regularly backcrossed with C57Bl/6J, which is why such animals, bred in the same facility, were used as wild-type controls. The reference by Fabre et al. simply describes the technique used, though in a different strain from the one used here. A clarification has been added to Methods, subsection “Subjects”, first paragraph.</p><p><italic>9) The analysis of sighs is central to this study, and a very clear description of how sighs are defined and determined is thus essential. This point is ambiguous in the manuscript. In Methods, sighs are defined as &quot;a breath with &gt;50% increase in inspired volume compared to eupneic breaths&quot;, but there is no indication of how these reference eupneic breaths were determined. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and 1d</xref>, not all sighs (arrows) seem to fulfill these criteria. In the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, sighs are defined differently, as &quot;an inspiratory volume and respiratory cycle period increase followed by a 2-cycle pause&quot;. In fact, apnea does not occur systematically after a sigh and cannot be a defining characteristic. Besides, the trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> that illustrates the authors' definition does not display any post-sigh pause. In contrast, a defining characteristic of sighs is their biphasic pattern (see Toporikova et al., 2015 and the references quoted in her article). Without taking into account this biphasic pattern, above-average breaths may be confused with sighs, especially in a context of increased variability. There are also several minor concerns with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: sigh frequencies (Panel c) do not exemplify the mean values shown in Panel d; in Panels c, e and f, only relevant comparisons are necessary. In Figure 1—figure supplement 1, it is puzzling that there are 11 divisions between 100 and 200 on the y-axis. Also, with a 60% increase in Fr (compared to WT) and a 30% increase in VT (compared to WT), the EP3R<sup>-/-</sup> mice only displayed a 20-30% increase in VE (compared to WT). Is this correct?</italic></p><p>We have better defined the sigh (as suggested in Toporikova 2015) on page 4 and in the Materials and methods section. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, we now more illustratively show its characteristics. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, we selected a different period from the same experimental setting that better represents the mean values presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, there was a shift in the graph, but, after rendering it again, this has been solved. The differences in the figure supplement (which is now incorporated into the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) as you observantly noted was due to a mix-up in the graphs. The Fq graph was the VE graph and vice versa. This embarrassing mistake has been corrected, and we sincerely apologize for this. The statements in the Results text, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, and the legend were correct. The traces in the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> have been removed in accordance with your suggestion.</p><p><italic>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> needs to be revised: Three comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) It is important to include &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 1&quot; into the &quot;final <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>&quot;. The supplementary figure contains an important message that is not contained in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</italic> </p><p><italic>B) The traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> are not very helpful, as they contain lots of &quot;artifacts&quot; or deflections that are not respiratory, and could be mistaken by a non-specialist with sighs. I am very familiar with such traces and can detect sighs – but the general reader isn't an expert. Either, find other examples, or just show the graphs, which would also make it easier to add the supplementary figure.</italic> </p><p><italic>C) Indeed, given that the sigh plays such an important part of the paper, there should be a figure of a sigh, and how the authors characterize sighs. Again, for the general reader this will not be clear from the figures presented. This comment relates also to the general comment (9) on the sigh.</italic></p><p>Please see the answer to comment (9).</p><p><italic>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>, has a very concrete model. It looks nice and is making their point. But, I am not convinced that they actually showed the differential glia/neuron modulation in preBötC and RTN/pFRG.</italic> </p><p>Thank you. The current Figure is now 14. We agree that we have not yet shown directly the differential glia/neuron modulation and have therefore added a question mark at the astrocyte to better illustrate that this is a possible mechanism that remains to be addressed in future work.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>I would like to encourage you to cite and discuss the following study:</italic> </p><p><italic>Organotypic slice cultures containing the preBötzinger complex generate respiratory-like rhythms.</italic></p><p><italic>Phillips WS, Herly M, Del Negro CA, Rekling JC.</italic></p><p><italic>J Neurophysiol. 2016 Feb 1;115(2):1063-70. doi: 10.1152/jn.00904.2015.
