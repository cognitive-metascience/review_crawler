We show that the conserved eukaryotic/archaeal protein Mbf1 acts with ribosomal proteins Rps3/uS3 and eukaryotic Asc1/RACK1 to prevent frameshifting at inhibitory CGA-CGA codon pairs in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Mutations in <italic>RPS3</italic> that allow frameshifting implicate eukaryotic conserved residues near the mRNA entry site. Mbf1 and Rps3 cooperate to maintain the reading frame of stalled ribosomes, while Asc1 also mediates distinct events that result in recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex and mRNA decay. Frameshifting occurs through a +1 shift with a CGA codon in the P site and involves competition between codons entering the A site, implying that the wobble interaction of the P site codon destabilizes translation elongation. Thus, eukaryotes have evolved unique mechanisms involving both a universally conserved ribosome component and two eukaryotic-specific proteins to maintain the reading frame at ribosome stalls.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39637.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins perform all the chemical reactions needed to keep a cell alive; thus, it is essential to assemble them correctly. They are made by molecular machines called ribosomes, which follow a sequence of instructions written in genetic code in molecules known as mRNAs. Ribosomes essentially read the genetic code three letters at a time; each triplet either codes for the insertion of one of 20 building blocks into the emerging protein, or serves as a signal to stop the process. It is critical that, after reading one triplet, the ribosome moves precisely three letters to read the next triplet. If, for example, the ribosome shifted just two letters instead of three – a phenomenon known as “frameshifting” – it would completely change the building blocks that were used to make the protein. This could lead to atypical or aberrant proteins that either do not work or are even toxic to the cell.</p><p>For a variety of reasons, ribosomes will often stall before they have finished building a protein. When this happens, the ribosome is more likely to frameshift. Cells commonly respond to stalled ribosomes by recruiting other molecules that work as quality control systems, some of which can disassemble the ribosome and break down the mRNA. In budding yeast, one part of the ribosome – named Asc1 – plays a key role in recruiting these quality control systems and in mRNA breakdown. If this component is removed, stalled ribosomes frameshift more frequently and, as a result, aberrant proteins accumulate in the cell. Since the Asc1 recruiter protein sits on the outside of the ribosome, it seemed likely that it might act through other factors to stop the ribosome from frameshifting when it stalls. However, it was unknown if such factors exist, what they are, or how they might work.</p><p>Now, Wang <italic>et al.</italic> have identified two additional yeast proteins, named Mbf1 and Rps3, which cooperate to stop the ribosome from frameshifting after it stalls. Rps3, like Asc1, is a component of the ribosome, while Mbf1 is not. It appears that Rps3 likely stops frameshifting via an interaction with the incoming mRNA, because a region of Rps3 near the mRNA entry site to the ribosome is important for its activity. Further experiments then showed that the known Asc1-mediated breakdown of mRNAs did not depend on Mbf1 and Rps3, but also assists in stopping frameshifting. Thus, frameshifting of stalled ribosomes is prevented via two distinct ways: one that directly involves Mbf1 and Rps3 and one that is promoted by Asc1, which reduces the amounts of mRNAs on which ribosomes frameshift.</p><p>These newly identified factors may provide insights into the precisely controlled protein-production machinery in the cell and into roles of the quality control systems. An improved understanding of mechanisms that prevent frameshifting could eventually lead to better treatments for some human diseases that result when these processes go awry, which include certain neurological conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>frameshifting</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>Rps3</kwd><kwd>Asc1/RACK1</kwd><kwd>Mbf1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM118386</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grayhack</surname><given-names>Elizabeth J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An eukaryotic specific system cooperates with the ribosome quality control pathway to maintain the reading frame during translation of slowly translated sequences.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate translation of mRNA into protein depends upon precise, repetitive three base translocation of the ribosome to maintain the correct reading frame throughout a coding sequence. Reading frame maintenance is challenging because multiple movements of the tRNAs and mRNA as well as conformational changes within the ribosome itself are required to complete a single elongation cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noller et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, the tRNA acceptor stems move within the large subunit during formation of the hybrid state, while the joining of EF-G-GTP (eEF2 in eukaryotes) results in additional movement of tRNA, and finally completion of translocation, driven by Pi release, requires additional movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belardinelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brilot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pulk and Cate, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ramrath et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ratje et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tourigny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). To accomplish this cycle, many interactions between the tRNAs and ribosome are disrupted, and new interactions are created, but the relative position of the tRNA anticodon to the mRNA codon must be maintained throughout all of these events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dever et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodnina, 2018</xref>). Thus, it is critical that mechanisms exist to prevent slippage during these transitions.</p><p>Reading frame maintenance is facilitated by structures within the ribosome as well as by tRNA modifications. Structural features that contribute to reading frame maintenance, inferred from analysis of prokaryotic translation intermediates, include a swivel of the 30S head relative to the 30S body to form a contracted mRNA tunnel downstream of the A site prior to translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jenner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schuwirth et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, during translocation, two conserved bases in the 16S rRNA intercalate into different positions of the mRNA to prevent slippage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), while domain IV of EF-G contacts the codon and tRNA in the A/P site and h44 of 16S rRNA, likely coupling mRNA and tRNA movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ramrath et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). tRNA modifications within the anticodon loop also assist in reading frame maintenance, inferred both from genetic and structural analyses. Mutants that affect several such modifications in both bacteria and eukaryotes result in increased frameshifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkins and Björk, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jäger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tükenmez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Urbonavicius et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Waas et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, a cross-strand base stacking interaction between a modified ms<sup>2</sup>i<sup>6</sup>A37 in an <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> and the mRNA codon is proposed to prevent slippage of P site tRNA on the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jenner et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, a number of mechanisms exist to prevent loss of reading frame.</p><p>Nevertheless, ribosomes do move into alternative reading frames in response to specific sequences and structures in mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkins and Björk, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dever et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dinman, 2012</xref>). The existence of such events has implied that ribosomal plasticity with respect to reading frame movement is an integral function of the translation machinery. The common feature of all frameshifting events in bacteria to humans is that the ribosome stalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dever et al., 2018</xref>). The stall can be mediated by combined effects of the A and P site codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Farabaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gamble et al., 2016</xref>), by the presence of downstream structures, or by an upstream Shine-Dalgarno sequence in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caliskan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dinman, 2012</xref>). Analysis of programmed frameshifting indicates that additional sequences or protein factors are frequently required to mediate efficient frameshifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkins and Björk, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dinman, 2012</xref>). For instance, +1 programmed frameshifting events are frequently enhanced by stimulatory sequences, although the role of these sequences is not always clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guarraia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Taliaferro and Farabaugh, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The identification of mutants that either affect programmed frameshifting or suppress frameshift mutations has pointed to four key factors in reading frame maintenance. First, mutations of ribosomal proteins, particularly those that contact the P site tRNA can cause increased frameshifting. In bacteria, frameshifting mutations are suppressed by deletions within the C terminal domain of ribosomal protein uS9, which contacts the P site tRNA anticodon loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jäger et al., 2013</xref>). In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, programmed frameshifting in the L-A virus is affected by mutations in 5S rRNA or its interactors uL18 or uL5, that also contact the P site tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meskauskas and Dinman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rhodin and Dinman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith et al., 2001</xref>). Frameshifting mutations are also suppressed by a mutation in the yeast <italic>RPS3</italic>, although this mutation does not affect a tRNA contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hendrick et al., 2001</xref>). Second, mutations in the basal translation machinery can also affect frameshifting. For instance, frameshifting mutations are suppressed by mutations in both EF-1α, which delivers tRNA to the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sandbaken and Culbertson, 1988</xref>), and in <italic>SUP35</italic>, encoding the translation termination factor eRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilson and Culbertson, 1988</xref>). Third, miRNAs can affect the efficiency of programmed frameshifting, for instance at <italic>CCR5</italic> in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belew et al., 2014</xref>). Fourth, mutations that affect proteins with previously unknown functions in translation can either alter programmed frameshifting or suppress frameshifting mutations. For instance, in yeast, frameshifting mutations are suppressed by mutations in <italic>MBF1</italic>, encoding Multi-protein Bridging Factor 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hendrick et al., 2001</xref>), or in <italic>EBS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ford et al., 2006</xref>), while in the porcine virus PRRSV, the RNA binding protein nsp1β stimulates both −1 and −2 frameshifting events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, reading frame maintenance is modulated by ribosomal components, many of which contact the tRNAs, as well as by non-ribosomal proteins and miRNAs. However, the roles of many of these proteins are not understood.</p><p>We set out to work out the mechanisms that maintain reading frame when eukaryotic ribosomes encounter a stall, the common feature of all frameshifting events. In bacteria, ribosome stalls due to limited availability or functionality of tRNA seem to suffice to cause frameshifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gurvich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Seidman et al., 2011</xref>). In wild type yeast, ribosomes stall at CGA codon repeats, which inhibit translation due to wobble decoding of CGA by its native tRNA<sup>Arg(ICG)</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Letzring et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Letzring et al., 2013</xref>). Although frameshifting was detected at several underrepresented heptanucleotide sequences in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shah et al., 2002</xref>), it was not detected at CGA codon repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wolf and Grayhack, 2015</xref>). Instead, eukaryotes have evolved new pathways to regulate inefficient translation events, such as the Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) pathway, in which these stalled ribosomes undergo ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins, followed by dissociation of the subunits, and recruitment of the RQC Complex, which mediates CAT tailing and degradation of the nascent polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandman and Hegde, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Defenouillère et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joazeiro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kostova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Verma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simms et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sitron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>). The ribosomal protein Asc1/RACK1 mediates these events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuroha et al., 2010</xref>); in the absence of Asc1, ribosomes fail to engage the RQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sitron et al., 2017</xref>), and also undergo substantial frameshifting at CGA codon repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wolf and Grayhack, 2015</xref>). However, Asc1 sits on the outside of the ribosome at the mRNA exit tunnel and likely functions as scaffold for recruitment of other proteins, such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hel2/mammalian ZNF598 and Slh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simms et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sitron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>). Based on the location of Asc1 and the precedent that Asc1 recruits other proteins to abort translation, we considered it likely that Asc1 cooperates with additional proteins to mediate reading frame maintenance at CGA codon repeats and set out to find such factors.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that the Multi-protein Bridging Factor 1 (Mbf1) and ribosomal proteins Rps3 and Asc1 (homolog of human Rack1) work together to prevent translational slippage at CGA codon repeats. Frameshifting results from inactivation of <italic>MBF1</italic>, or from mutations in amino acids in Rps3 located on an exposed surface of the protein near the mRNA entry site. Asc1 was previously known to mediate recruitment of the RQC, mRNA cleavage and mRNA decay at similar stall sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ikeuchi and Inada, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuroha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Letzring et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sitron et al., 2017</xref>), as well as reading frame maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wolf and Grayhack, 2015</xref>). We provide evidence that Asc1 and Mbf1 cooperate to mediate reading frame maintenance at similar sites, acting on a common set of substrates, including the seven most slowly translated codon pairs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gamble et al., 2016</xref>). We examined the precise frameshift at one of these inhibitory pairs, CGA-CGG, purifying the frameshifted polypeptide, followed by analysis with mass spectrometry. We found that frameshifting occurs in the +1 direction at the CGA codon and moreover, that frameshifting is modulated by the competition between the in-frame and +1 frame tRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>MBF1</italic> (Multi-protein Bridging Factor 1) prevents frameshifting at CGA codon repeats</title><p>We considered it likely that proteins other than Asc1 worked to prevent frameshifting at CGA codon repeats for two reasons. First, Asc1 binds on the outside of the ribosome, not in the decoding center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rabl et al., 2011</xref>), and thus is not positioned in any obvious way to assist with reading frame maintenance. Second, Asc1 recruits other proteins, Hel2 and Slh1, to recruit the RQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandman and Hegde, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joazeiro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sitron et al., 2017</xref>), and thus is likely to work with other proteins in reading frame maintenance. Thus, we set out to identify genes responsible for reading frame maintenance at CGA codon repeats.</p><p>To isolate mutants that frameshift due to translation of CGA codon repeats, we set up a selection in which a +1 frameshift (caused by 6 adjacent CGA codons) was required to express the <italic>URA3</italic> gene. The native <italic>URA3</italic> gene was placed in the +1 reading frame downstream of an N-terminal domain of <italic>GLN4</italic> encoding amino acids 1–99 (<italic>GLN4</italic><sub>(1-99)</sub>), followed by 6 CGA codons and one additional nucleotide upstream of the <italic>URA3</italic> coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This strain exhibits an Ura<sup>-</sup> phenotype, due to the low levels of frameshifting in an otherwise wild-type background, allowing for an Ura<sup>+</sup> selection to obtain mutants with increased frameshifting. As an independent secondary screen for frameshifting mutants due to CGA codon repeats, we integrated a modified version of the RNA-ID reporter with <italic>GLN4</italic><sub>(1-99)</sub> followed by 4 CGA codons and one additional nucleotide upstream of the <italic>GFP</italic> coding region into the <italic>ADE2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dean and Grayhack, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wolf and Grayhack, 2015</xref>). Thus, GFP expression was dependent upon frameshifting efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

That is, the 2.7-fold increase in GFP/RFP mRNA from the +1 reporter in an <italic>asc1</italic>Δ mutant (relative to the wild type) cannot account for the &gt;50 fold increase in frameshifted GFP/RFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, an <italic>asc1</italic>Δ mutant clearly exhibits a defect in reading frame maintenance.</p><p>If increased frameshifted protein/mRNA in an <italic>asc1</italic>Δ mutant is due to a failure of the Mbf1 pathway, then we expected that <italic>asc1</italic>Δ <italic>mbf1</italic>Δ double mutants would frameshift with similar efficiency to the <italic>mbf1</italic>Δ mutant. In fact, the level of frameshifted GFP/RFP protein per mRNA was very similar in the single <italic>mbf1</italic>Δ mutant to that in the double <italic>asc1</italic>Δ <italic>mbf1</italic>Δ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These results are most consistent with a single pathway of reading frame maintenance, which Asc1 influences.</p><p>We confirmed that the +1 GFP signal detected in our mutants was due to frameshifting rather than another aberrant translation event by directly measuring both the size and amount of GFP fusion protein. The amount of full-length GFP protein in the Western blot corresponds to the GFP/RFP values obtained from flow analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) indicating that +1 GFP/RFP signal in our mutants is due to frameshifting.</p><p>If the defect in the <italic>asc1</italic>Δ mutant that results in frameshifting is due to a failure of the Mbf1 pathway, then overproduction of Mbf1 in the <italic>asc1</italic>Δ mutant might suppress frameshifting in this mutant. We found that expression of <italic>MBF1</italic> on a multi-copy plasmid did suppress frameshifting in the <italic>asc1</italic>Δ strain to 1/3 that seen with an empty vector, but did not affect in-frame expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The overproduction of Mbf1 was not complementing a reduced abundance of Mbf1 in this mutant. We did not detect a reduction in Mbf1-HA (which complements the <italic>mbf1</italic>Δ mutant) in the <italic>asc1</italic>Δ strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), although <italic>asc1</italic> mutants generally exhibit a defect in expression of small proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>). We also considered that <italic>mbf1</italic> mutants might require additional Asc1 protein, but additional copies of <italic>ASC1</italic> did not suppress frameshifting in an <italic>mbf1</italic>Δ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, the frameshifted GFP/RFP fluorescence in the <italic>asc1</italic>Δ strain is likely a result of both an increase in mRNA and a defect in the Mbf1 pathway. We infer that Mbf1 and Asc1 contribute in distinct ways to the response to CGA codon pairs, but we do not know if Asc1 also has a direct role in the reading frame maintenance pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mbf1 and Asc1 work at a common subset of inhibitory codon pairs and at a single inhibitory codon pair in a context-dependent manner</title><p>To address the mechanism of frameshifting and to understand the relationship between Asc1 and Mbf1, we set out to identify the protein and sequence requirements for efficient frameshifting.

Reading frame maintenance of stalled ribosomes is achieved in two ways: by direct inhibition of frameshifting; and by aborted translation coupled with mRNA decay. The system is composed of two proteins that lack bacterial homologs, the archaeal/eukaryotic Mbf1 protein and the eukaryotic ribosomal protein Asc1/RACK1, as well as one universally conserved ribosomal protein Rps3. Mutations in any of these proteins result in increased frameshifting at CGA codon repeats. Moreover, the Rps3 residues in which mutations affect reading frame maintenance are specifically conserved in eukaryotes (and differ in archaeal and bacterial Rps3), consistent with a eukaryotic-specific mechanism. We suggest that when ribosomes stall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simms et al., 2017b</xref>), two distinct sets of events occur: Asc1 triggers a set of responses that result in aborted translation, recruitment of the RQC complex and mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Defenouillère et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simms et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sitron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Verma et al., 2013</xref>); while Mbf1 and Rps3 cooperate at the stalled ribosomes to prevent frameshifting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In the absence of Mbf1 and Asc1, ribosomes frameshift efficiently, even at a single CGA-CGG pair in some cases, including sequences found in the native yeast genome. Frameshifting on the CGA-CGG codon pair occurs in the +1 direction, with the CGA codon in the P site of the ribosome and is modulated by availability of in-frame and +1 frame A site tRNAs.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39637.024</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Models for the interplay between the Mbf1/Rps3 and Asc1-mediated RQC pathways and for the role of Mbf1 in reading frame maintenance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of the two pathways that maintain reading frames of stalled ribosomes at CGA codons.

In model I, Mbf1 (two domains shown in red) interacts with mRNA, and is recruited through an interaction with Rps3 (blue) to the leading stalled ribosome (gray) to restrict mRNA movement. The interaction must be transient, with removal of Mbf1 when the ribosome translocates. In model II, Mbf1 is recruited to the colliding ribosomes (light blue) possibly by both Asc1 (yellow) and Rps3. We postulate that again an interaction with mRNA could buffer the effects of ribosome collision.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39637-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The coordinated activities of both the Asc1 and Mbf1/Rps3 pathways are likely important to maintain the reading frame, since the absence of either pathway results in increased frameshifting. We think both pathways are likely engaged by similar stalls, since we noted evidence that Asc1 regulates expression (either in-frame or out-of-frame) at every sequence at which Mbf1 acted. However, there may be differences in the extent to which each pathway contributes at particular stall sites. For instance, at sequences at which frameshifting occurs rapidly (i.e. CGA-CGG-C), Mbf1 may play the critical role; in the absence of Mbf1, ribosomes frameshift before they can be captured by the Asc1 pathway. Generally, some fraction of ribosomes are removed from the translating pool with concomitant mRNA decay, while ribosomes that remain stalled are kept in-frame by Mbf1/Rps3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>The Asc1-mediated events couple mRNA decay to abortive translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sitron et al., 2017</xref>), thus effectively reducing the number and duration of ribosome stalls. The integration of RNA decay with translation is extensive: cleavage of mRNA occurs upstream of many ribosome stalls including at CGA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doma and Parker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guydosh and Green, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Letzring et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simms et al., 2017b</xref>) and is modulated by Asc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ikeuchi and Inada, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuroha et al., 2010</xref>). mRNA decay is triggered by many problems in translation, such as nonsense mediated decay (NMD), no-go and NonStop decay [See (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shoemaker and Green, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Simms et al., 2017a</xref>) and by slow translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). For reading frame maintenance, it seems likely that both reducing the number of stalled ribosomes (by aborting translation) and removing the mRNA are important. Deletion of <italic>ASC1</italic> in a <italic>mbf1</italic>Δ mutant results in an increase in frameshifted GFP/RFP protein that is directly proportional to the increase in mRNA. However, <italic>asc1</italic>Δ mutants exhibit a 50-fold increase in frameshifting relative to wild type cells with less than a 3-fold increase in mRNA levels. One likely explanation for frameshifting in the <italic>asc1</italic>Δ mutant is that Mbf1 becomes limiting due to an increase in the number of stalled ribosomes; this idea is strengthened by the observation that overproduction of Mbf1 suppressed frameshifting in the <italic>asc1</italic>Δ mutant. Alternatively, Asc1 might also play a direct role in the reading frame maintenance function. Asc1 interacts with the C terminal region of Rps3 and could affect the conformation of Rps3 or its interaction with Mbf1. Mbf1 was found in the vicinity of Asc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Opitz et al., 2017</xref>) lending credence to the idea that Asc1 could interact with Mbf1 (although such an interaction cannot be obligatory).</p><p>We think Rps3 and Mbf1 inhibit frameshifting in a coordinated manner, perhaps due to their interactions with mRNA or to Mbf1’s interaction with the ribosome. The role of Rps3 in this process is likely to involve interactions with either the incoming mRNA or proteins external to the ribosome. The <italic>RPS3</italic> mutations that affect frameshifting map to residues (<italic>S104</italic>, <italic>L113, G121</italic>, <italic>K108</italic>) on two α-helices or their connecting loop right next to the entering mRNA. Although this section of Rps3 is involved in helicase activity and initiation selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takyar et al., 2005</xref>), the residues mutated in frameshifting selections were not specifically those involved in these activities. Instead, these residues all sit on the solvent side of the ribosome and could form an interface interacting with mRNA or mRNA-bound proteins. The role of Mbf1 is likely mediated by interactions with either or both of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klass et al., 2013</xref>) and the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blombach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Opitz et al., 2017</xref>). The apparent RNA binding domain maps to the less conserved N terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klass et al., 2013</xref>), while ribosome binding activity of the archaeal homolog of Mbf1 maps to its C-terminal HTH domain and the linker at the N terminus of this domain, which are both conserved with eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blombach et al., 2014</xref>); our frameshifting mutations cluster in the conserved linker region of Mbf1. Moreover, Mbf1 is sufficiently abundant with ~85,000 molecules per cell to participate in general translation cycles, although it is less abundant than core ribosomal proteins (~200,000) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are two reasonable models to account for the role of Mbf1 and Rps3 in reading frame maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The first model is that Mbf1 has a loose association with mRNA and is recruited to the leading stalled ribosome by an interaction with Rps3; the interactions with the ribosome and the mRNA at the stall site could restrict mRNA movement in the ribosome. Based on structures of prokaryotic ribosomes caught in translocation, mRNA flexibility may occur in ribosomes lacking an A site tRNA due to few contacts with the region of mRNA near the A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), or due to a failure of two rRNA pawls that lock the mRNA in a translocating ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), or due to defects in the interactions with elongation factor 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). In the absence of Mbf1, the ribosome stall might allow sufficient time for mRNA flexibility, resulting in frameshifting. The second model, which is based on the observation that ribosome collisions trigger no-go decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simms et al., 2017b</xref>), is that Mbf1 is recruited to colliding ribosomes to buffer the collision effects; in this case Asc1 and Rps3 might both participate in Mbf1 recruitment. Mbf1 could prevent ribosome collision-mediated movement of the leading ribosome on the mRNA.</p><p>Frameshifting occurs by a mechanism that involves the interplay between the two adjacent codons, in which I•A wobble interaction in the P site in conjunction with competition between tRNAs entering the A site results in the frameshift, consistent with a model proposed by Baranov <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baranov et al., 2004</xref>). Two lines of evidence support this mechanism. First, we demonstrated that, in the <italic>asc1</italic>Δ <italic>mbf1</italic>Δ double mutant, ribosomes frameshift at a single CGA-CGG codon pair (in a particular context) when the CGA codon occupies the P site. We infer that CGA codon in the P site is generally important for frameshifting, because six of the seven codon pairs on which ribosomes frameshift are CGA-NNN and the three efficient pairs are CGA-CNN. The wobble interaction between the CGA codon and tRNA could weaken the interaction between mRNA and the ribosome, which in turn could slow down the elongation cycle. Second, we found that frameshifting is influenced by the abundance of the in-frame and out-of-frame tRNAs for next position, which implies that the frameshift occurs after translocation of the CGA from the A site to the P site. We speculate that the flexibility of the wobble base pair interaction between inosine and other nucleotides could actively facilitate the acceptance of out-of-frame A site tRNA. For instance, we consider that a rare instance in which the A base in CGA is bulged out might be stabilized by the very strong I•C interaction, increasing the time available to accept the out-of-frame tRNA.</p><p>The eukaryotic specific reading frame maintenance activity, involving Mbf1 and ribosomal proteins Rps3 and Asc1, is likely to be important for translation accuracy in the yeast genome. Mutations in either <italic>RPS3</italic> or <italic>MBF1</italic> suppressed frameshifting mutations in several native yeast genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hendrick et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, mutations in <italic>MBF1</italic> and <italic>ASC1</italic> resulted in detectable frameshifting in a set of native gene sequences with only a single inhibitory codon pair flanked by six adjacent codons on each side, although it is apparent that the frameshifting potential within a particular sequence is not simply due to the presence of a single inhibitory codon pair. These results confirmed that Mbf1 with Rps3 and Asc1 play a critical role in maintaining the reading frame during normal translation cycles. It is still unknown why this eukaryote-specific reading frame maintenance system evolved and why it is important to eukaryotes, but not bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> <break/> <italic>cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>MBF1/</italic> <break/><italic>YOR298C-A</italic></td><td/><td>SGD:S000007253</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>ASC1/</italic> <break/><italic>YMR116C</italic></td><td/><td>SGD:S000004722</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>RPS3/</italic> <break/><italic>YNL178W</italic></td><td/><td>SGD:S000005122</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> <break/><italic>MAT<bold>a</bold></italic>)</td><td>BY4741</td><td>Open <break/>Biosystems</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> <break/><italic>MATα</italic>)</td><td>BY4742</td><td>Open <break/>Biosystems</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>See Supplementary table 1 in <break/><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td><td>this paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-HA <break/>High Affinity <break/>(Rat <break/>monoclonal)</td><td>Roche</td><td>3F10, <break/>catalog# <break/>11867423001;

Quantification of mRNA was performed using in vitro transcribed GFP and RFP mRNA fragments, synthesized from linearized plasmid pEJYW407 and pEJYW409 using RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System-T7 (Promega, cat.# P1300). The synthesis reaction was followed by DNase treatment to remove the DNA template and by elution through MicroSpin G-25 columns (GE, cat.# 27-5325-01) to remove unincorporated nucleotides. The synthesized RNA sample was analyzed by ultraviolet light absorbance at 260 nm on a nanodrop to determine the concentration and by electrophoresis to assess integrity. Each qPCR plate contained 5-point 1:5 dilution standard curves for both GFP and RFP, which were optimized to ensure that all samples fall into the linear range of the curves. For each tested strain, three biological replicates were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Purification of frameshifted peptide</title><p>To purify the frameshifted peptide from yeast, a <italic>LEU2</italic> plasmid containing either in-frame or +1 frame protein purification constructs were transformed into the <italic>asc1</italic>Δ <italic>mbf1</italic>Δ strain (YJYW378). Two independent transformants (FOA treated) of each construct were grown overnight in SD-Leu media and transferred into 80 ml S-Leu + 2% raffinose media in the morning. After reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8–1.2, expression of the GST-StrepII-ZZ construct was induced by addition of 40 ml 3xYP + 6% galactose and growth was continued for 10 hr. Cells were collected by centrifugation and cell pellets were quick frozen on dry ice. The cell pellets were re-suspended in 1 ml extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM DTT, 10% Glycerol, 1 M NaCl, 2.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 µg/ml pepstatin) and lysed with bead beating (10 repeats of 20 s beating followed by 1 min on ice), essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quartley et al., 2009</xref>). The cell lysate was collected from the bead beating tubes by puncturing the bottom with a hot needle and blowing with low pressure air. Solid contents were removed by centrifugation before the remaining lysate was divided into half and purified on either GSH or Streptactin resin.</p><p>For GST purification: the cell lysate was first diluted with equal volume No Salt Wash Buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM DTT, 10% Glycerol) to bring the salt to 0.5 M NaCl. GSH resin [Glutathione sepharose-4B from GE, catalog# 17-0756-01; pre-washed with Wash Buffer (No Salt Wash Buffer + 0.5 M NaCl)] (50 µl/ ml of lysate) was added to the diluted cell lysate and the mixture was nutated for 3 hr at 4°C. The resin was separated from the liquid by centrifugation at low speed (&lt;3,000 rpm) and washed twice with 0.5 ml Wash Buffer followed by 20 min nutation. The bound protein products were then eluted by nutating for 40 min with 100 µl Elution Buffer (Wash buffer + 20 mM NaOH + 25 mM glutathione); the elution step was repeated to increase the yield.</p><p>For Strep purification: the cell lysate was diluted with 5x volumes No Salt Wash Buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 µg/ml pepstatin) to bring the salt to 150 mM NaCl. MagStrep ‘type3’ XT beads [from IBA, cat# 2-4090-002; pre-washed with Wash Buffer (No Salt Wash Buffer + 150 mM NaCl)] were added to the diluted cell lysate (80 µl/ 3.3 ml diluted cell lysate). After nutating for 2 hr at 4°C, resins were separated from liquid using a magnetic separator, then the resin was washed with 1 ml Wash Buffer three times without additional incubation. The bound protein products were then eluted by adding 50 µl Elution Buffer (Wash buffer + 50 mM biotin) and nutating for 10 min, followed by separation using magnetic separator; the elution step was repeated to increase the yield.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>The elution samples from both GST and Strep purification were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie Blue.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We have received the comments from four expert reviewers all of whom found the genetic screen and its follow-up to contain interesting new experiments focused on the activities of the ribosome in the face of elongation distress. These studies argue that a factor, Mb1, previously implicated in transcription and translation, and the ribosomal protein S3 play a critical role in preventing frameshifting at sites of stalling. In the absence of frameshifting, when severe stalling occurs, the ribosome-associated protein Asc1 triggers a diverse set of quality control events that have been studied in some substantial detail by the field. While all the reviewers felt that this study nicely leveraged genetics to reveal unanticipated players in the ribosome-centric event, all were somewhat concerned that the study did not go sufficiently beyond the reporter-based screen to reveal molecular insights into the roles of these factors on the ribosome. There was extensive use of reporters, with very similar disruptive features, to detail the subtleties in the response to pause sequences, for example. The figures detailing the di-codon pair experiments (Figure 4) and experiments focused on a natural context (Figure 5) provided little new information and potentially could be placed in a supplemental figure. The most critical set of experiments that brought all the ideas in the manuscript together was Figure 6, where depletion and over-expression of tRNAs and mass spec were used to determine that the frameshifting is triggered only when CGA is in the P site with its associated I:A wobble base pairing.</p><p>In addition to some concerns that molecular mechanism was lacking, the reviewers all had concerns about the relative lack of analysis and discussion of the role of mRNA decay in the events being studied. As you will read in the detailed comments, the reviewers felt it is critical to generate RNA quantitation data on both the GFP and RFP mRNAs, and then to present the data in terms of these measurements. It is clear that there are some substantial effects on mRNAs levels that result from the various genetic mutations, and it likely that these effects do not account for the observed increases in GFP only on the +1 constructs. To support the strength of this conclusion, the RNA levels should be quantitated both for the (CGA)4 constructs as well as the (CGA)4+1 constructs, as the RNA changes will likely be equivalent, and there will only be increases in GFP on the +1 constructs. While we are relatively confident that the conclusions will hold, given the extent to which translation and decay are coupled in these pathways, this analysis seems critical, and a careful discussion important for the reader.</p><p>In addition to this main criticism (related to measuring RNA levels carefully), there are some smaller points to be addressed in the reviewer comments. For example, the data and discussion on Hel2/Slh1 seemed over-interpreted or unclear. At a glance, there are no substantial differences that result when these factors are deleted. Moreover, the discussion of how these pathways might intersect or what these data might mean were not easy to follow. The manuscript would benefit from removal from the main text of figures that add little to our understanding of the role of these new factors (Mbf1 and S3) but simply support the results of the initial screen (yeast growth plates and the very detailed study in Figure 5, for example). What would benefit from more discussion is a more complete analysis about how these results fit in with the literature on mRNA decay, and most importantly, some thoughts about what Mbf1 might be doing. A model figure with the relative positions of S3 and Asc1 on the ribosome might help frame such a discussion, even in the absence of new biochemical information on Mbf1.</p><p>In light of the strength of the screen and the identification of an interesting new player in ribosome quality control, the reviewers support publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if the various concerns are all addressed.</p><p>While the study fails to provide substantive mechanistic insights, we feel that the screen and follow-up to confirm the role of Mbf1 in preventing frameshifting will be a valuable contribution to the field.</p><p>Thank you for submitting your excellent work to the journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, Wang and colleagues study protein factors and pathways that regulate translational frameshifting of stalled ribosomes. Previous work by the Grayhack lab identified Asc1 as a regulator of translational frameshifts for ribosomes decoding translation-inhibitory codons. Using a forward genetic screen in budding yeast, Wang and co-authors discover two more players in this process: Rps3 and Mbf1. The authors use genetic manipulations, translational reporters, and mass spectrometry to identify the contributions of different pathways to translational frameshifting and gain some mechanistic insight into how this process occurs.</p><p>The identification of the Mbf1/Rsp3 system of translational frame maintenance is an important contribution to the field and opens up new areas of research. Furthermore this work represents a systematic genetic dissection of the determinants of translational frameshifting, and the authors confirm the conclusions informed by synthetic stalling sequences using endogenous genomically-encoded sequences. However, additional and critical controls are necessary to support the authors' conclusions. Specifically, this work relies heavily on a ratiometric, fluorescent reporter system based on a bidirectional pGAL1,10 promoter. In this reporter, two separate mRNAs are created, one to use as an expression control (RFP) and one as an experimental condition that encodes various test sequences upstream of a GFP in different frames. By comparing protein expression levels between the two messages, the authors hope to quantify the effect of the experimental conditions on translation. Yet this system also is sensitive to changes that affect mRNA levels of sequences that stall ribosomes. In fact, all the results reported in this study could be the result of how Asc1, Mbf1, and Rps3 affect decay of mRNAs that encode stalls and frameshifts. This is more than a hypothetical possibility, as <italic>asc1∆</italic> has been reported to affect mRNA levels of messages with stalls (Kuroha et al., 2010; Ikeuchi et al., 2016; Sitron et al., 2017).</p><p>The paper is fit for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if the authors can address this major concern as detailed below.</p><p>1) The pGAL1,10-RFP/insert-GFP reporter system needs additional validation to ensure that measurements of GFP/RFP values truly report on increases in the frequency of stall readthrough or frameshifting rather than mRNA metabolism. This validation is of particular concern due to the data presented in Figure 3D. We plotted the mRNA levels of the (CGA-CGA)3+1 reporter against the corresponding GFP/RFP fluorescence values and found there is an almost perfect linear relationship between the levels of GFP mRNA and GFP/RFP fluorescence in the wt, <italic>asc1∆, mbf1∆</italic>, and <italic>asc1∆mbf1∆</italic> strains. The slope we plotted is not 1, however, since we do not have the standard curves for these primer sets, we cannot know the absolute differences in mRNA, only the relative increase. Thus, the increase in GFP/RFP fluorescence in the mutant strains could be driven primarily by an increase in mRNA levels of the stalling transcript rather than increased frameshifting frequency.</p><p>To validate the reporters used in the context of frameshifting and stalling, the authors must measure GFP and RFP mRNA levels of (CGA-CGA)3, (CGA-CGA)3+1, (CGA-CGA)3-1 reporters using absolute quantification (not relative quantification) in wt, <italic>asc1∆, mbf1∆</italic>, and <italic>asc1∆mbf1∆</italic> strains by RT-qPCR.</p><p>- Include a standard curve for each primer set (varying cDNA input) to map experimental conditions back to absolute input levels. Ensure the assay is conducted in the linear range of the qPCR.</p><p>- Include a plot of absolute levels of GFP mRNA vs RFP mRNA in each genetic condition to ensure that the mutations don't differentially affect the RFP and GFP-containing transcripts.</p><p>- Plot absolute GFP/RFP mRNA vs GFP/RFP fluorescence for each reporter and genetic background mentioned above to ensure that mRNA levels alone do not account for apparent changes in GFP/RFP fluorescence ratios.</p><p>Absolute quantification is described in this link: https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-learning-center/real-time-pcr-basics/absolute-vs-relative-quantification-real-time-pcr.html)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In prior work, Grayhack and colleagues identified pairs of adjacent codons that cause ribosome stalling. In the current work, they conduct an unbiased genetic screen and show that mutations in the ribosomal proteins Asc1 and Rps3, and in the protein Mbf1, promote frameshifting on these inhibitory codon pairs. Whereas Rps3 and Mbf1 appear to cooperate in maintaining reading frame, because double mutants do not enhance the phenotype of single mutants, Asc1 appears to promote frameshifting by limiting ribosome quality control pathways that turnover the stalled ribosomes (the <italic>asc1</italic> mutation also enhances readthrough of an in-frame reporter containing an inhibitory codon pair). Additional studies demonstrate that the nucleotides flanking the codon pairs can impact their ability to promote frameshifting. Finally, purification of the frameshifted proteins enabled the authors to show that mutation of these factors results in a +1 frameshift with the first of the codon of the bad codon pair in the P site.</p><p>While all three of these proteins were previously implicated in frameshifting by other groups (primarily Mike Culbertson), this work is independent of the previous work significantly expands the analysis to provide greater insight into the nature of the frameshift and the complementary versus independent roles of Rps3, Mbf1 and Asc1.</p><p>The function of Mbf1 is unclear. This protein has been implicated in both transcription and translation. As the assay for frameshifting involves a dual GFP-RFP reporter in which GFP and RFP are transcribed from the divergent GAL1,10 promoter, an important control is to examine RFP and GFP mRNA levels in the WT and mutant strains. While perhaps it is unlikely that the <italic>mbf1</italic> mutant would differentially affect transcription of the GFP and RFP reporters, analysis of these mRNA levels for the in-frame and +1 frameshift reporters would more definitively rule out this possibility.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Wang et al., identified a eukaryotic-specific mechanism to prevent frameshifting by stalled ribosomes. Previous work from the Grayhack group, through the use of genetic screens, identified a role for the ribosome-associated factor Asc1/Rack1 in maintaining frame during stalling events. Here, the authors elaborate on these screens and identified the multi-bridging factor 1 (Mbf1) as an additional important player in preventing frameshifting on inhibitory codons. Additional regions on ribosomal protein Rps3 were also identified as potentially functionally important in mediating Mbf1's function. In particular, mutations of residues on the solvent phase of the protein's mRNA entry tunnel region promote frameshifting, but do not increase it in an <italic>mbf1</italic> background. Furthermore, the effect of these mutations is suppressed by overexpression of Mbf1. In contrast, overexpression of Mbf1 did not rescue the effect of <italic>asc1</italic> deletion on frameshifting. This, together with the observation that <italic>mbf1</italic> deletion does not promote readthrough of inhibitory codon (unlike <italic>asc1</italic> deletion), suggest that the Mbf1 and Asc1 work independently of each other. The authors put forward a model explaining these results: Mbf1, in combination with Rps3, prevents frameshifting by stalled ribosomes, whereas Asc1 is responsible for recruiting downstream factors to dissociate the ribosome and degrade the nascent proteins.</p><p>Overall, this is a very thorough investigation of frame maintenance during stalling and the requirement of different factors to prevent frameshifting. While many studies have looked at the effects of stalling from an mRNA- and a protein-quality-control perspective, only a few have explored its effect on ribosome function. The study offers new insights into how different factors communicate with the ribosome to trigger multiple pathways to prevent frameshifting and initiate ribosome rescue.</p><p>1) The paper would benefit from a model that could explain Mbf1's function. Do the authors propose a model whereby Mbf1 binding to the mRNA prevent it from slippage? Or is it its ribosome binding that prevent the ribosome from frameshifting? I understand testing either model is beyond the scope of the current paper, but it would be nice to see how the authors are thinking about the mechanism of Mbf1.</p><p>2) Although unnecessary, it would be nice if the authors analyzed the ribosome profiling data of the Gilbert group on <italic>asc1</italic> deletion to see if frameshifting occurs on the native targets that are mentioned in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript the authors present the results of a screen (for growth on -Ura) conducted to look for mutants that confer an increase in +1 frameshifting when ribosomes are confronted with problematic CGA rich sequences within an ORF. Importantly, the screen was conducted in a background carrying two copies of Asc1 to avoid its (re)isolation as an interesting mutant. The screen yielded recessive mutations in Mbf1 and dominant mutations in the r-protein S3. The authors then proceeded to characterize in detail the frameshifting and readthrough properties of the various mutants, whether they act independently or synergistically, in the original growth assay as well as a great number of GFP reporter assays. The authors also include in this analysis deletions of Asc1, an r-protein previously implicated in readthrough and frameshifting on CGA-enriched sequences, and in ribosome quality control events. Based on the results in the manuscript, there is little doubt that Mbf1 and S3 play important roles in the events that take place on ribosome stalling at problematic CGA rich sequences. Disappointingly, this manuscript does not give much sense of what these factors might do at a molecular level as essentially the only experiment presented is a broad set of in vivo reporter assays that provide modest mechanistic insight. Also, importantly, given the well known connection between translational stalling and mRNA degradation, in particular as already detailed for Asc1, it seems essential that the authors take some effort to reconcile these diverse effects (while they do present data in Figure 3D, they don't acknowledge that there are substantial mRNA level effects that could explain a fraction of their +1 FS data). It is critical that this point be addressed. Overall, this manuscript extends the set of molecular players involved in specifying ribosome function at problematic mRNA sequences and provides a strong foundation for subsequent molecular characterization.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>Not clear it is necessary to show plates and GFP reporter data in parallel throughout; results are simplest to digest in bar graphs from reporters (especially if both results are effectively the same).</p><p>Figure 3C – discussion of results with Hel2/Slh1 was confusing – my look at the data says there is nothing interesting going on with these double mutants (even if the asterisks say otherwise).</p><p>Figure 3D – mRNA levels clearly do vary – these values should be rigorously determined for CGA-4 and CGA-4-+1 reporters – the expectation is that mRNA level changes in various genetic backgrounds will be similar, but that protein output will be quite distinct – these data should be presented in a scatter plot that allows correlations in mRNA and protein levels to be directly compared.</p><p>Figure 4 – revisiting of di-codon pairs does not add much to what the authors learn in this study – the same pairs that were problematic in Cell paper appear to be problematic still, and are where the +1 FS signal is seen – supplemental?</p><p>Figure 5 – huge amount of work to define some vague contextual contributions to the +1FS phenomenon – doesn't add much in terms of mechanism or even the rules for context – supplemental?</p><p>Figure 6 – very nice set of data identifying CGA in P site as the critical feature for permitting the +1 FS (or stabilization of mRNA).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39637.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We have received the comments from four expert reviewers all of whom found the genetic screen and its follow-up to contain interesting new experiments focused on the activities of the ribosome in the face of elongation distress.

Furthermore, this work represents a systematic genetic dissection of the determinants of translational frameshifting, and the authors confirm the conclusions informed by synthetic stalling sequences using endogenous genomically-encoded sequences. However, additional and critical controls are necessary to support the authors' conclusions. Specifically, this work relies heavily on a ratiometric, fluorescent reporter system based on a bidirectional pGAL1,10 promoter. In this reporter, two separate mRNAs are created, one to use as an expression control (RFP) and one as an experimental condition that encodes various test sequences upstream of a GFP in different frames. By comparing protein expression levels between the two messages, the authors hope to quantify the effect of the experimental conditions on translation. Yet this system also is sensitive to changes that affect mRNA levels of sequences that stall ribosomes. In fact, all the results reported in this study could be the result of how Asc1, Mbf1, and Rps3 affect decay of mRNAs that encode stalls and frameshifts. This is more than a hypothetical possibility, as asc1∆ has been reported to affect mRNA levels of messages with stalls (Kuroha et al., 2010; Ikeuchi et al., 2016; Sitron et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>Changes in GFP and RFP protein could indeed be due to changes in RNA levels. Thus, we measured GFP and RFP mRNA levels for (CGA) reporters (in-frame and out-of-frame) in the wild type strain as well as in <italic>mbf1, RPS3, asc1</italic>, and double mutants. The specific information is detailed below in response to individual comments.</p><p>The results reported in Figure 2B and Figure 3A were done by measuring GFP and RFP fluorescence and mRNA levels in triplicate in a single experiment. We also measured GFP and RFP fluorescence and mRNA levels in triplicate for the in frame optimal codon reporter (AGA) in Figure 2B in the wild type strain as well as in <italic>mbf1, RPS3</italic>, and double mutant. Similarly, we measured protein and mRNA simultaneously for the results reported in Figure 3A. As we described above, mutations in <italic>mbf1</italic> and <italic>RPS3</italic> do not significantly affect mRNA levels of in-frame or +1 reporters, while mutation of ASC1 has the expected effects on both in-frame and +1 frame mRNA levels. However, the 55-fold increase in frameshifted GFP/RFP in the <italic>asc1</italic> mutant (relative to wild type) is not accounted for by the 2.7-fold increase in mRNA; the increase in protein/mRNA of frameshifted GFP/RFP is 20-fold, while that of in-frame GFP/RFP is only 1.1-fold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The pGAL1,10-RFP/insert-GFP reporter system needs additional validation to ensure that measurements of GFP/RFP values truly report on increases in the frequency of stall readthrough or frameshifting rather than mRNA metabolism. This validation is of particular concern due to the data presented in Figure 3D. We plotted the mRNA levels of the (CGA-CGA)3+1 reporter against the corresponding GFP/RFP fluorescence values and found there is an almost perfect linear relationship between the levels of GFP mRNA and GFP/RFP fluorescence in the wt, asc1∆, mbf1∆, and asc1∆mbf1∆ strains. The slope we plotted is not 1, however, since we do not have the standard curves for these primer sets, we cannot know the absolute differences in mRNA, only the relative increase. Thus, the increase in GFP/RFP fluorescence in the mutant strains could be driven primarily by an increase in mRNA levels of the stalling transcript rather than increased frameshifting frequency.</p><p>To validate the reporters used in the context of frameshifting and stalling, the authors must measure GFP and RFP mRNA levels of (CGA-CGA)3, (CGA-CGA)3+1, (CGA-CGA)3-1 reporters using absolute quantification (not relative quantification) in wt, asc1∆, mbf1∆, and asc1∆mbf1∆ strains by RT-qPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done this. We used the absolute standard curve method described below to quantify these mRNAs.

There are only small differences in mRNA levels for <italic>RPS3</italic> and <italic>mbf1</italic> mutants in Figure 2. By contrast, mutation of ASC1 does affect mRNA levels. As shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, the changes in mRNA levels correlate with in-frame expression of GFP/RFP, and with the increase in frameshifted GFP/RFP in the <italic>asc1Δ mbf1Δ</italic>, compared to the <italic>mbf1Δ</italic> strain.

This methodology helped us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The function of Mbf1 is unclear. This protein has been implicated in both transcription and translation. As the assay for frameshifting involves a dual GFP-RFP reporter in which GFP and RFP are transcribed from the divergent GAL1,10 promoter, an important control is to examine RFP and GFP mRNA levels in the WT and mutant strains. While perhaps it is unlikely that the mbf1 mutant would differentially affect transcription of the GFP and RFP reporters, analysis of these mRNA levels for the in-frame and +1 frameshift reporters would more definitively rule out this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We did this as explained above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) The paper would benefit from a model that could explain Mbf1's function. Do the authors propose a model whereby Mbf1 binding to the mRNA prevent it from slippage? Or is it its ribosome binding that prevent the ribosome from frameshifting? I understand testing either model is beyond the scope of the current paper, but it would be nice to see how the authors are thinking about the mechanism of Mbf1.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. In fact, we proposed two models, both of which depend upon the interaction of Mbf1 with both mRNA and the ribosome (RPS3). The first posits that this interaction occurs between Mbf1 and the leading ribosome, while the second posits that Mbf1 interacts with colliding ribosomes (perhaps interacting with both Rps3 and Asc1). These models are presented in Figure 6B and are discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>New Text:</p><p>“There are two reasonable models to account for the role of Mbf1 and Rps3 in reading frame maintenance (Figure 6B). The first model is that Mbf1 has a loose association with mRNA and is recruited to the leading stalled ribosome by an interaction with Rps3; the interactions with the ribosome and the mRNA at the stall site could restrict mRNA movement in the ribosome. Based on structures of prokaryotic ribosomes caught in translocation, mRNA flexibility may occur in ribosomes lacking an A site tRNA due to few contacts with the region of mRNA near the A site (Zhou et al., 2013), or due to a failure of two rRNA pawls that lock the mRNA in a translocating ribosome (Zhou et al., 2013), or due to defects in the interactions with elongation factor 2 (Zhou et al., 2014). The ribosome stall might allow sufficient time or altered structure that one of these occurs. The second model, which is based on the observation that ribosome collisions trigger no-go decay (Simms et al., 2017b), is that Mbf1 is recruited to colliding ribosomes to buffer the collision effects; in this case Asc1 and Rps3 might both participate in Mbf1 recruitment. Mbf1 could prevent ribosome collision-mediated movement of the leading ribosome on the mRNA.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although unnecessary, it would be nice if the authors analyzed the ribosome profiling data of the Gilbert group on asc1 deletion to see if frameshifting occurs on the native targets that are mentioned in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 B.</p></disp-quote><p>Gilbert’s lab generously supplied us with all the ribosome reads mapped to the genome. We attempted to examine frameshifting by generating a histogram of ribosome reads for each nucleotide in the AYT1 gene (in the <italic>asc1</italic> mutant).
