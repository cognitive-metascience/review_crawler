Yet little is known about the dynamics of ciliary membrane proteins besides a possible role for motor-driven Intraflagellar Transport (IFT). To characterize these dynamics, we imaged single molecules of Somatostatin Receptor 3 (SSTR3, a GPCR) and Smoothened (Smo, a Hedgehog signal transducer) in the ciliary membrane. While IFT trains moved processively from one end of the cilium to the other, single SSTR3 and Smo underwent mostly diffusive behavior interspersed with short periods of directional movements. Statistical subtraction of instant velocities revealed that SSTR3 and Smo spent less than a third of their time undergoing active transport. Finally, SSTR3 and IFT movements could be uncoupled by perturbing either membrane protein diffusion or active transport. Thus ciliary membrane proteins move predominantly by diffusion, and attachment to IFT trains is transient and stochastic rather than processive or spatially determined.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00654.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00654.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00654.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Primary cilia are tiny protrusions from the cell surface, which have a central role in processing sensory stimuli, such as light or odorants. Cilia are also involved in mediating the response to developmental signaling molecules, including Sonic Hedgehog, and may help to convert mechanical signals into electrical or chemical ones. Primary cilia are made up of an axoneme—a core structure that consists of microtubules extending along the length of the cilium—ensheathed by a membrane that contains a number of receptor proteins.</p><p>These receptor proteins travel up and down the cilium, and it is generally assumed that an active process known as intraflagellar transport is responsible for their movement. This process is mediated by motor proteins called kinesins and dyneins, which carry cargo proteins along axonemal microtubules. However, it has been difficult to study the transport of individual receptor proteins directly because they are uniformly distributed over the membranes of the cilia.</p><p>Now, Ye et al. have shown that intraflagellar transport is not the most important mode of transport for membrane proteins within primary cilia. By labelling individual receptors with a fluorescent dye and then filming their movements under a microscope, Ye et al. found that the receptors generally did not show the directed, linear motion that would be expected from intraflagellar transport. Instead, much of their movement occurred through passive diffusion, with occasional short bursts of directed motion.</p><p>To investigate how rapidly receptor molecules could move through the cilium in this way, Ye et al<italic>.</italic> used a technique called fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). This involves using light to bleach the fluorescent dye attached to receptor molecules in part of the cilium, and then measuring how long it takes for the fluorescence to return as a result of other labelled molecules moving into the bleached area: the shorter this time, the faster the movement of the molecules. It took less than a minute for fluorescence to be restored within a primary cilium, indicating that passive diffusion with occasional active transport can move proteins rapidly through the structure.</p><p>By using drugs to inhibit intraflagellar transport, Ye et al. confirmed that the majority of membrane protein transport within primary cilia occurs via diffusion. Further studies are now required to determine whether this is also the case for other molecules that travel along cilia, and whether intraflagellar transport may have a more important role in the assembly of these structures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00654.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00654.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>IFT</kwd><kwd>diffusion</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>motor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EFRI-MEK</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>W James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM35527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>W James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM089933</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nachury</surname><given-names>Maxence V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>March of Dimes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5-FY09-112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nachury</surname><given-names>Maxence V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Damon Runyon Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG 2087-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Breslow</surname><given-names>David K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Membrane receptor proteins move through primary cilia largely by passive diffusion rather than by active intraflagellar transport.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane proteins explore cellular space by diffusion or motor-driven transport on the cytoskeleton, but the relative contributions of these processes in specific cellular contexts have not been directly assessed. A prototypical system to study how proteins explore cellular space is the primary cilium, a surface-exposed compartment consisting of a microtubule-based axoneme ensheathed within a plasma membrane protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Satir and Christensen, 2007</xref>). The primary cilium is an important signaling compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>): entire signaling cascades, from the most upstream membrane-embedded receptors to the ultimate effectors, are dynamically concentrated within the ciliary space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corbit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haycraft et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rohatgi et al., 2007</xref>), and cilium dysfunction abolishes specific pathways such as Hedgehog signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huangfu et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The assembly of cilia, and structurally related flagella, relies on intraflagellar transport (IFT), a process in which moving IFT trains bring cargo, such as tubulin and axonemal precursors, to the tip of the axoneme by kinesin II motor-powered transport along axonemal microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cole, 2008</xref>). In reverse, polypeptides move by dynein 1b-powered IFT from the tip to the base of cilia. The requirement of the IFT machinery for ciliary assembly, and the bidirectional movements of IFT trains in mature cilia have been substantiated in every model system tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pedersen and Rosenbaum, 2008</xref>) and it is generally accepted that soluble and membrane-embedded cargo explore the ciliary space by loading onto IFT trains at one end of the primary cilium and unloading at the other end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pedersen et al., 2006</xref>). Yet, there is limited direct experimental evidence to support this model of IFT-mediated transport of ciliary membrane proteins.</p><p>Pioneering studies using the flagellated green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> showed that externally applied beads, which artificially cluster mating receptors, are transported along the flagellar axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloodgood et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloodgood and Salomonsky, 1989</xref>), but a role for IFT has not been tested in this context. While bulk imaging of some GFP-tagged ciliary membrane proteins (e.g., PKD2-GFP, OSM9-GFP) discerned a few fluorescence foci moving processively in cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2007</xref>), ciliary membrane proteins are generally distributed homogeneously inside cilia and information on their dynamics is therefore lacking. Furthermore, while IFT trains have been visualized as large polymeric assemblages by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pigino et al., 2009</xref>) and as clusters of fluorescence by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pedersen and Rosenbaum, 2008</xref>), the IFT entities that ferry cargoes remain elusive.</p><p>The goal of our work was to directly measure the contributions of IFT and diffusion to the movement of individual ciliary membrane proteins. We developed an experimental system to image single membrane receptors together with IFT trains in the primary cilium of live cells. By selectively disrupting membrane protein diffusion or motor-driven active transport, we show that cargo and IFT movements can be uncoupled from each other and that diffusion is sufficient for membrane proteins to explore the ciliary surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Membrane proteins move in a saltatory manner in cilia</title><p>To overcome the limitations of ensemble measurements of cargo proteins in primary cilia, we quantified the ciliary movements of individually labelled membrane proteins. We selected two ciliary membrane proteins: the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), Somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Händel et al., 1999</xref>), and the Hedgehog signaling intermediate Smoothened (Smo), a non-GPCR 7-pass membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corbit et al., 2005</xref>). To facilitate cilia visualization, SSTR3 and Smo were tagged at the intracellular C-terminus with a fluorescent protein (SSTR3-GFP and Smo-YFP). In order to detect single molecules we also fused a biotinylation acceptor peptide (AP) to the extracellular N-terminus of SSTR3 or Smo, and co-expressed the biotin ligase BirA in the ER of the stable cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Howarth and Ting, 2008</xref>). Proteins were expressed stably and at low levels in IMCD3-Flp-In cells.</p><p>Singly biotinylated SSTR3 and Smo molecules were labelled on the cell surface by extracellular addition of a low concentration (50 pM) of monovalent streptavidin (mSA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howarth et al., 2006</xref>) conjugated to Alexa647 fluorescent dye (mSA-A647) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Under these conditions, SSTR3-GFP and Smo-YFP were distributed homogeneously in cilia, but each cilium contained between zero and five dots of mSA-A647 labelled molecules (referred hereafter as single SSTR3 or Smo molecule) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); cilia orientation was determined by co-expressing pericentrin-RFP (PCNT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gillingham and Munro, 2000</xref>) which localizes to the basal body at the base of the cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Differences between distributions were analyzed by performing an effective histogram subtraction (‘Materials and methods’). Anterograde and retrograde velocities were binned separately to create histograms with an optimum bin size that generated an unbiased estimate of the distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scott, 1979</xref>). Using nonlinear least-squares regression, the live cell velocity histogram was fitted to a mixed distribution consisting of fraction f of a Gaussian with unknown mean and variance and fraction (1−f) of the antimycin/deoxyglucose-treated cell distribution. This, and two other (‘Materials and methods’), unbiased statistical tests were highly significant for both anterograde and retrograde SSTR3 velocities, and indicated that 27% of anterograde and 13% of retrograde movements of SSTR3 involved active transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Second, we used the cholesterol-selective detergent digitonin. which selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane but leaves the ciliary membrane intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breslow et al.</xref>).

This raises questions about the relationship between IFT and active transport of SSTR3, especially since directional tracks of single SSTR3 molecules rarely overlapped with movements of large IFT88 foci in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As noted above, it is possible that the majority of directional SSTR3 movements are mediated by IFT nanotrains that are smaller than the IFT88 foci that we can resolve, and which might be less sensitive to dynein inhibition. Although ciliobrevin has been shown to inhibit dynein in gliding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>), it is also possible that it is less potent against dynein under specific loads such as those corresponding to very small IFT nanotrains.

While every evidence point to IFT trains assembling at one end of the cilium and then being transported by an IFT motor all the way to the other extremity of the cilium, keeping their state of assembly intact along the way, we find instead that cargo are highly labile components of IFT trains. Our finding that immobilization of membrane proteins (cargoes) only minimally affected IFT train formation and movement suggests that IFT trains assemble spontaneously rather than ‘on demand’ by binding cargo; this is similar in principle to the cargo-independent assembly of clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>). In our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), IFT trains assemble spontaneously at a given frequency at the base and tip of cilia, forming conveyor belts along the length of the cilium onto which membrane cargo can hop on and off. While this model would at first glance appear to contradict prior findings of PKD2-GFP and OSM9-GFP foci moving processively along cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2007</xref>), it is likely that this is due to differences between ensemble and single molecule imaging. For example, it is possible that each IFT train carries a constant number of cargo molecules but individual cargo molecules continually hop on and off; ensemble imagining would not detect these individual events which we could detect here at the single molecule level. Thus membrane protein transport in cilia may be reminiscent of the slow axonal transport pathway in which most proteins synthesized in the neuronal body move at an apparent slow rate along the axon because they infrequently hop onto motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scott et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Another interpretation of our data is that proteins undergo advective movements created by the constant movements of large IFT trains up or down the cilium. The influence of fluid motion to particle movements can be measured by the Péclet number Pe = UR/D where U is the speed of fluid motion, R is the radius of the structure and D the diffusion coefficient. If Pe &lt; 1, diffusion outpaces the speeds of fluid motion and the contribution of fluid motion to particle transport are minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldstein et al., 2008</xref>). In the case of the cilium, U is of the order of IFT motor speeds (10<sup>−4</sup> cm/s), R is ∼10<sup>−5</sup> cm and D is 2 × 10<sup>−9</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s for SSTR3 and 10 × 10<sup>−9</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s for a typical protein such as tubulin. The calculated values of Pe are thus 0.5 for SSTR3 and 0.1 for tubulin, thereby suggesting that passive advection plays a very minor role in the movement of typical proteins inside cilia. Moreover, the passive advection model is incompatible with our finding that IFT foci movements can be interrupted without affecting active transport of SSTR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This experiment suggests that unresolvable IFT nanotrains transport SSTR3 when cells are exposed to ciliobrevin, and that large IFT trains visualized as readily detectable foci of fluorescence may be devoid of cargo and represent recycling IFT complexes. The hypothesis that IFT nanotrains, possibly reduced to single IFT complexes bridging a cargo to a motor, represent the transporting entities is in line with nearly all other example of motor-cargo adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>). An alternative hypothesis is that ciliobrevin creates an artificial situation in cilia that forces cargo to utilize IFT nanotrains that are not normally found in cilia. A resolution of these possibilities will require advanced imaging approaches that are capable of detecting single molecules of IFT complexes.</p><p>In summary, our studies indicate that ciliary membrane proteins such as SSTR3 and Smo explore the ciliary space by passive diffusion rather than only by motor-driven, directional transport. Indeed, the diffusion coefficient of SSTR3 (D= 0.25 μm<sup>2</sup>/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>) indicates that a single SSTR3 molecule could diffuse along the length of a 4 μm cilium in less than 40 s, while IFT-mediated transport would complete the same trip in 8 s. Interestingly, the dimensions of a cilium are similar to those of a bacterium in which proteins rapidly explore the cellular space by diffusion in the absence of cytoskeletal motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elowitz et al., 1999</xref>). The importance of diffusion in exploration of the ciliary space does not rule out other roles for IFT in ciliogenesis, or the possible formation of IFT scaffolds for signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pan and Snell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Further studies of other single molecule dynamics under signaling conditions, using techniques introduced here, will be needed to address these possibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs</title><p>Mouse SSTR3-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berbari et al., 2008</xref>) (a gift from Dr Kirk Mykytyn, Ohio State University) was fused at its N-terminal extracellular domain to a 13 amino acid acceptor peptide (AP) for the biotin ligase BirA to create AP-SSTR3-GFP.

The largest principal component was used to define the axis of the cilium. Those trajectories that were essentially stationary, that is, with a variance &lt;0.1 μm<sup>2</sup> along the cilium axis, were designated as outliers and were not included in the analysis (a total of 4 trajectories from permeabilized samples).</p><p>Instantaneous velocities were identified as differences between consecutive positions, divided by the time-step of 0.46 s. Each velocity vector was then divided into components lying along and perpendicular to the cilium axis. The distribution of velocities was compared between untreated cells and either digitonin semi-permeabilized cells or ciliobrevin D-treated cells. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference between these distributions. This test is non-parametric, makes no assumptions about the shape of the underlying distributions, and does not require binning of the data. For velocity components perpendicular to the cilia, no significant difference was found (p&gt;0.9) between either untreated cells and digitonin semi-permeabilized cells, or untreated cells and ciliobrevin D treated cells, as expected. For velocity components along the cilia axis, there was no significant difference between untreated cells and ciliobrevin D treated cells (p&gt;0.05). Meanwhile, there was a significant difference between velocity distributions in untreated and digitonin semi-permeabilized cells for both the anterograde velocities (p=0.0004) and retrograde velocities (p=0.003) along the cilia axis.</p><p>These differences between distributions were further analyzed by performing an effective histogram subtraction. The anterograde and retrograde velocities were separately binned to create histograms with an optimum bin size designed to generate an unbiased estimate of the distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scott, 1979</xref>). Using nonlinear least-squares, the live cell velocity histogram was fitted to a mixed distribution consisting of fraction f of a Gaussian with unknown mean and variance and fraction (1−f) of the permeabilized cell distribution. For anterograde velocities, the fitted fraction in the additional Gaussian was f = 0.22 ± 0.13. The fitted Gaussian had a mean at 0.41 ± 0.14 μm/s and a standard deviation 0.26 ± 0.12 μm/s. An F-test was used to establish that the fitted mixed distribution fitted the live cell anterograde velocity data significantly better compared to the permeabilized cell distribution alone (p=10<sup>−5</sup>, justifying the three additional degrees of freedom). For retrograde velocities, we fitted a fraction f = 0.24 ± 0.06 in the additional Gaussian, which had a mean at 0.30 ± 0.10 μm/s and a standard deviation 0.28 ± 0.06 μm/s. The F-test statistic established that the mixed distribution yielded a significant improvement in fitting the retrograde velocity data (p=10<sup>−5</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>FRAP data analysis</title><p>The measured fractional fluorescence intensity in a narrow segment of the cilium as a function of time after photobleaching was fitted to a model of one-dimensional diffusion in a bounded region.

Your article has now been peer reviewed and we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication. Your submission has been evaluated by 3 reviewers, one of whom, Vivek Malhotra, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision has been discussed further with one of <italic>eLife’s</italic> Senior editors.</p><p>Based on extensive discussions between the reviewers before we reached this decision, unfortunately the consensus is that we cannot accept your manuscript for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. In a previous publication you have already reported the diffusion of proteins in the ciliary membrane (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092790/">Science 2010</ext-link>). While we agree that in your current paper you have sought to search for the mechanism, the data provided is not convincing. For example, the use of digitonin to test the significance of ATP in the migration of SSTR3 is less than satisfactory. It is not clear if this treatment is sufficient to deplete the ciliary (cellular) ATP levels.</p><p>An even bigger concern is the use of ciliobrevin as a reagent to test the potential involvement of Dynein. Is the function of Dynein completely inhibited under your experimental conditions? Your findings that this compound might also be inhibiting Kinesin cast a doubt on the efficacy of ciliobrevin. The other major concern is whether the tagged SSTR3 is correctly targeted and functional? Addressing the functional significance of the tagged SSTR3 is an important issue, albeit technically difficult. However, given the other concerns, the consensus is that your manuscript is currently not suitable for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We are therefore, with regret, returning your manuscript to you with the hope that you will find our comments helpful in revising the manuscript for submission elsewhere. The original reviews, on which the discussions between the reviewers were based, are below for reference.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>This is an interesting and surprising finding and should be published. I would, however, like to raise the following concerns.</p><p>Does digitonin permeabilization really affect intracellular ATP levels? It would be better to use the more standard/reliable approach of treating cells with sodium azide and deoxglucose.</p><p>The data on the use of ciliobrevin to inhibit dynein is alright but is there a more specific procedure to address the involvement of dynein?</p><p>Minor comment:</p><p>In the first few lines of the Results and Discussion the authors refer to SST3 as a GPRC. It should be GPCR instead.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>I was not very excited by the work. The insight provided is not great. The authors suggest that diffusion is enough to account for the spread of the receptor. However, receptors are likely concentrated in the Cilia, and diffusion alone cannot account for that. Also, any clustering of components changes the diffusion properties. Further, there are no functional studies. Just because the receptor they looked at can spread out and looks more or less 'o.k.' as far as distribution does not mean that overall function does not depend on active transport. Further, are the transient interactions with motors that they suggest relevant/important for function?</p><p>Critical controls are missing. The authors imaged singly biotinylated Somatostatin Receptor 3 (SSTR3, a ciliary GPCR) labelled with fluorescent monovalent streptavidin. We don’t know what the labeling does to the function/transport of the receptor. If the receptor usually forms a complex, but said complex is altered due to the labeling, the ability of the receptor to diffuse would be significantly altered-size and variety of interactions can influence efficacy of diffusion a lot. So, just because a small uncomplexed receptor can diffuse does not mean that a larger one can/will. At the very least, things will depend on size of things. This is ignored.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript seems to me to provide an intriguing hint that diffusion may play an interesting role in the process, but it falls far short of providing a definitive understanding of the process, and as such, seems inappropriate to me for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>Nachury and colleagues address the relative importance of active transport and diffusion in the localization of ciliary membrane proteins. In theory diffusion should account for the exploration of the entire ciliary membrane surface by membrane proteins. A series of experiments using FRAP to measure behaviour of SSTR3 (a membrane protein) are most consistent with diffusion. Furthermore, conditions that reduce active transport such as ATP depletion or inhibition of dynein using ciliobrevin have little effect on the behavior of SSTR3. This would not exclude a role of active transport in restricting membrane proteins to subdomains of the membrane, although this would not appear to be relevant for SSTR3.</p><p>This is a technically well-executed study with clear logic behind all the major experiments. It is of importance for understanding cilium function, and therefore suited to publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The limitations are that:</p><p>1) a single membrane protein is used for the experiments.</p><p>2) motor protein inhibition is achieved by a drug ciliobrevin rather than specific targeting of motor complex subunits.</p><p>Ideally some data on a second membrane protein would be useful. Addressing point 2 is a little more complex since targeting motor proteins may compromise cilium formation.</p><p>[Editors’ note: guidance for resubmission follows.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “Single Molecule Imaging Reveals a Major Role for Diffusion in the Exploration of Ciliary Space by Signaling Receptors” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Does digitonin permeabilization really affect intracellular ATP levels? It would be better to use the more standard/reliable approach of treating cells with sodium azide and deoxglucose [Reviewer 1]. The use of digitonin to test the significance of ATP in the migration of SSTR3 is less than satisfactory. It is not clear if this treatment is sufficient to deplete the ciliary (cellular) ATP levels [editorial letter]</italic>.</p><p>We have conducted experiments using cells treated with deoxyglucose and antimycin A and find that the movement of IFT foci is inhibited while SSTR3 movements are globally unaffected. A detailed analysis is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and shows that – like digitonin – deoxyglucose/antimycin treatment inhibits active transport of single SSTR3 molecules. We have also measured ATP levels after antimycin/deoxyglucose treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and digitonin permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and find that digitonin is slightly more effective than antimycin/deoxyglucose in reducing ATP levels, but both treatments remove more than 90% of cellular ATP.</p><p><italic>2) Inhibition of IFT motor proteins. The data on the use of ciliobrevin to inhibit dynein is alright but is there a more specific procedure to address the involvement of dynein? [Reviewer 1]; motor protein inhibition is achieved by a drug ciliobrevin rather than specific targeting of motor complex subunits [Reviewer 2]</italic>.</p><p>Ciliobrevin is currently the only published small molecule, membrane permeable inhibitor of dynein that can be added to live cells. In published experiments by Firestone et al., ciliobrevin neither inhibited the activity of kinesin-1 in a microtuble gliding assays, nor the ATPase activity of kinesin-1 or kinesin-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>, Nature <italic>484:125-9).</italic> The only alternative treatment that we could use to inhibit IFT motors would be to deplete dynein 1b or kinesin-II using siRNA. However, IFT motors are required for ciliogenesis, and siRNA treatments will lead to morphologically aberrant cilia in which indirect effects on IFT rates and membrane diffusion will make data impossible to interpret.</p><p><italic>An even bigger concern is the use of ciliobrevin as a reagent to test the potential involvement of Dynein. Is the function of Dynein completely inhibited under your experimental conditions [editorial letter]</italic>?</p><p>We treat cells with 50 μM ciliobrevin D, a concentration shown by Firestone et al. to completely inhibiting dynein 1 in cells and <italic>in vitro.</italic> Beyond the concern of remaining dynein 1b activity, we observed a complete block of IFT foci movement while active transport of single SSTR3 molecules appeared uninhibited. To this day, more that 50 published studies have measured IFT foci movements and models have been generated based on the assumption that cargo movements were directly correlated to the movement of these IFT foci. Even if a small percentage of dynein 1b remained active in 50 μM ciliobrevin D, our results suggest – for the first time – that following IFT foci movements cannot be equated to cargo movements.</p><p><italic>3) A single membrane protein is used for the experiments</italic>.</p><p>We conducted a series of experiments following single molecules of the Hedgehog signaling intermediate Smoothened (Smo) in cilia. We find that Smo – like SSTR3 – moves in cilia by a combination of diffusion and active transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The proportion of time spent undergoing active transport are similar for Smo and SSTR3.</p><p><italic>4) Functionality of AP-SSTR3-GFP. Critical controls are missing. The authors imaged singly biotinylated Somatostatin Receptor 3 (SSTR3, a ciliary GPCR) labeled with fluorescent monovalent streptavidin. We don't know what the labeling does to the function/transport of the receptor [Reviewer 2]. The other major concern is whether the tagged SSTR3 is correctly targeted and functional? Addressing the functional significance of the tagged SSTR3 is an important issue, albeit technically difficult [editorial letter]</italic>.</p><p>We present data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> showing that AP-SSTR3-GFP undergoes agonist-induced endocytosis from the plasma membrane, a key signaling event of functional GPCRs, indicating that the fusion protein is indeed functional. AP-SSTR3-GFP is a targeted to the cilia, as expected.</p><p><italic>If the receptor usually forms a complex, but said complex is altered due to the labeling, the ability of the receptor to diffuse would be significantly altered-size and variety of interactions can influence efficacy of diffusion a lot [Reviewer 2]</italic>.</p><p>We addressed the possibility that binding of monovalent streptavidin (mSA) affects the mobility of biotinylated AP-SSTR3-GFP by comparing the diffusion of mSA-labeled AP-SSTR3-GFP to the diffusion of unlabeled protein by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). The absence of a significance difference in the apparent diffusion coefficients suggests that our labeling strategy does not alter the behavior of single molecules.</p><p><italic>5) Other points. In a previous publication you have already reported the diffusion of proteins in the ciliary membrane (Science 2010) [editorial letter]</italic>.</p><p>Our Science paper provided evidence for a diffusion barrier at the base of the cilium between the ciliary membrane and apical plasma membrane. We did not conduct any experiments that analyzed whether ciliary protein movements <italic>within</italic> cilia were the result of passive diffusion or active transport. We have clarified the presentation of our past results in the text.</p><p><italic>Further, are the transient interactions with motors that they suggest relevant/important for function [Reviewer 2]</italic>?</p><p>The regulation of signaling function by IFT is an exciting hypothesis that is compatible with our observations and this is discussed in the final paragraph of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
