calcium uniporter. The uniporter is a multi-subunit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pore formed by the MCU protein and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation mediated by MICU subunits. Recently, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein EMRE was identified as a uniporter subunit absolutely required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation. However, the molecular mechanism and regulatory purpose of EMRE remain largely unexplored. Here, we determine the transmembrane orientation of EMRE, and show that its known MCU-activating function is mediated by the interaction of transmembrane helices from both proteins. We also reveal a second function of EMRE: to maintain tight MICU regulation of the MCU pore, a role that requires EMRE to bind MICU1 using its conserved C-terminal polyaspartate tail. This dual functionality of EMRE ensures that all transport-competent uniporters are tightly regulated, responding appropriately to a dynamic intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> landscape.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15545.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15545.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15545.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Like all power plants, mitochondria – the compartments inside our cells that supply energy – must adjust their energy output to match fluctuations in demand. Inside cells, the levels of calcium ions in the cytoplasm often signal such demands. Mitochondria therefore control their calcium ion levels with tightly regulated, membrane-embedded proteins that move calcium ions into and out of the mitochondria. One of these membrane machines, the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, is a &quot;smart channel&quot; that admits calcium ions into the mitochondria only when their cytoplasmic levels exceed a threshold.</p><p>The MCU complex contains four essential proteins: MCU, which forms the pore through which the calcium ions enter the mitochondrion; MICU1 and MICU2, which act as “gatekeepers”, opening the pore only when the cell contains high levels of calcium ions; and EMRE, a small, mysterious protein. Why is EMRE required for the channel's operation, and how does it fit into the four-protein complex?</p><p>By comparing EMRE proteins from different species, constructing mutant forms of EMRE, and recording calcium ion transport in mitochondria from cultured human cells, Tsai, Phillips et al. show that EMRE has two key roles. First, it snuggles up against the MCU protein and forms an essential part of the calcium ion-selective pore. Second, it acts as molecular glue to fix the calcium ion-sensing MICU gatekeepers to the pore. These two linked functions ensure that the MCU complex switches on only when the cell contains high levels of calcium ions, preventing the cell becoming catastrophically overloaded with calcium ions and cell death.</p><p>Challenges for the future are to purify the MCU complex and reconstitute its ability to transport calcium ions from its component parts. This will help to determine the structure of the channel.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15545.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15545.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>calcium transport</kwd><kwd>MCU</kwd><kwd>EMRE</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>Ming-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM107023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Studies of EMRE, one of the four essential protein subunits in the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex that regulates calcium ion levels in mitochondria, reveal new details about the physical interactions between the subunits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of key mitochondrial processes such as ATP production and initiation of apoptosis is controlled by precise balance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and efflux across the mitochondrial inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gunter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>). Studies in the 1960s and '70s established that mitochondria from most eukaryotes, except for certain yeast species, can take up large quantities of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the matrix through a mechanism that is membrane potential dependent and strongly inhibited by ruthenium compounds such as Ru360 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carafoli and Lehninger, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deluca and Engstrom, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ying et al., 1991</xref>). A few years ago, the field witnessed a groundbreaking achievement — identification of the <italic>MCU</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baughman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Stefani et al., 2011</xref>). The 35-kDa MCU protein oliogomerizes with unknown stoichiometry to form a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baughman et al., 2011</xref>). MCU possesses two transmembrane helices (TMHs) connected by a short loop that hosts a signature sequence (DIME) thought to contribute to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective permeation site. The N- and C-terminal regions of MCU are exposed to the mitochondrial matrix, each with a coiled-coil sequence of unknown function.</p><p>It was subsequently found that MCU forms a complex with the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake protein 1 (MICU1), which has co-evolved with MCU since early eukaryotic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baughman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bick et al., 2012</xref>). In humans, MICU1 has two additional homologues, MICU2 and the neuron-specific MICU3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Plovanich et al., 2013</xref>). The MICUs serve as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing gate that confers Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence to opening of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Csordas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mallilankaraman et al., 2012</xref>). In resting cellular conditions, where cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is low, MICUs shut the pore to prevent excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the matrix, a dangerous process that could diminish inner membrane potential and trigger apoptotic cell death. Transient elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the low μM range, detected by EF-hands in MICUs, releases this inhibition to open the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Csordas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kamer and Mootha, 2014</xref>). To avoid confusion on nomenclature, we henceforth refer to the Ru-360 sensitive mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel complex as the 'uniporter complex,' a molecular assembly of the pore-forming MCU protein along with associated regulatory subunits.</p><p>Recently, using quantitative mass spectroscopy, Mootha and colleagues discovered yet another component of the uniporter complex: the essential MCU regulator (EMRE), a small (~10 kDa) inner membrane protein found only in metazoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sancak et al., 2013</xref>). EMRE possesses a single TMH and a highly conserved C-terminal polyaspartate tail, typically composed of one glutamate followed by 5–7 aspartates. In humans, MCU-EMRE interaction is absolutely required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation via MCU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kovacs-Bogdan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sancak et al., 2013</xref>). However, an MCU homologue in <italic>D. discoideum,</italic> a species belonging to the EMRE-lacking Amoebazoa group in protists, is fully capable of conducting Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kovacs-Bogdan et al., 2014</xref>). The question naturally arises: what might be the physiological importance for MCU to become strictly dependent on EMRE for function in humans? What would be the consequence if human MCU could transport Ca<sup>2+</sup> without EMRE?</p><p>We address these questions by mounting an extensive investigation of EMRE. We first sought to determine the protein's transmembrane topology, a problem that cannot be definitively resolved by standard protease digestion assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baughman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vais et al., 2016</xref>) due to the small size of the protein’s extra-membrane regions. Two alternative strategies – directed mass-tagging and MCU-EMRE fusion construction - establish that EMRE exposes its N-terminal region to the matrix and C-terminus to the intermembrane space (IMS). Mutagenesis screening and domain-interaction analysis further demonstrate that EMRE supports Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport by using its TMH to bind to MCU through its first TMH (TMH1). Moreover, EMRE also interacts with MICU1 via its C-terminal polyaspartate tail, a molecular contact that turns out to be crucial to retain MICUs in the uniporter complex to gate the MCU pore. These results lead to a molecular model wherein the dual 'MCU-activating' and 'MICU-retaining' functionalities of EMRE together play a crucial role in orchestrating uniporter responses to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional dependence of MCU on EMRE in various species</title><p>To study uniporter subunits without interference from native mitochondrial proteins, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 to produce MCU-knockout (KO), EMRE-KO, or MCU/EMRE double KO (ME-KO) HEK 293 cell lines. A standard Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux assay was used to evaluate uniporter activity. In a typical experiment, HEK cells were permeabilized with digitonin in the presence of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing fluorophore (CG-5N) and then treated with 10 μM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In WT cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is rapidly sequestered by mitochondria, and Ru360, a potent MCU inhibitor, arrests the uptake immediately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). (Henceforth for clearer data presentation, only the response of permeabilized cells to Ca<sup>2+</sup> will be presented, as in the red box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, with arrowheads indicating Ru360 addition.)

The orientation of EMRE in the inner membrane was determined by a cysteine-modification, mass-tagging method. In a typical experiment, mitoplasts (outside-out submitochondrial vesicles lacking the outer membrane) prepared from HEK 293 cells are incubated with a 5-kDa, membrane impermeant thiol-reactive reagent, polyethylene glycol maleimide (PEGM). If the protein of interest has a cysteine exposed to the external solution, PEGM would react with this cysteine and thus increase the protein’s molecular weight.</p><p>We first validated the assay on the known orientation of MCU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamer and Mootha, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murgia and Rizzuto, 2015</xref>). Human MCU possesses five cysteines, all in the N-terminal domain. If this region faces outward towards the IMS, PEGM would increase MCU’s mass by 5 kDa per residue modified. Experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), however, show that MCU mobility on SDS-PAGE is not altered by PEGM treatment unless the mitoplast membrane is first disrupted by the mild detergent dodecyl maltoside (DDM). The results thus confirm MCU’s N<sub>in</sub>-C<sub>in</sub> orientation, with both the N- and C-termini residing in the matrix.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15545.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Transmembrane orientation of MCU and EMRE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of WT-MCU response to PEGM, in the absence or presence of DDM detergent, with molecular weight marker positions indicated on left.

Like WT, these mutants support MCU-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in EMRE-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In intact mitoplasts free of native EMRE protein, PEGM readily labels I97C-EMRE but fails to react with I49C or the cysteineless WT protein, while after detergent pretreatment both mutants are labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). EMRE thus adopts a N<sub>in</sub>-C<sub>out</sub> orientation, with its C-terminal tail facing the IMS.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> summarizes the inner-membrane topology of MCU and EMRE inferred here. This was further verified by fusing EMRE onto the C-terminus of MCU, thus forcing the orientation of the two proteins in tandem to conform to the above molecular picture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The fusion construct was tested in ME-KO cells, where it was expressed as a full-length protein detectable by both MCU and EMRE antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As with WT MCU, PEGM fails to modify any of the five native cysteines in the N-terminus without detergent pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), thus implying that the fusion protein is inserted homogeneously into the inner membrane in a proper N<sub>in</sub>-C<sub>out</sub> orientation. Moreover, the MCU-EMRE fusion protein mediates robust, Ru360-sensitive mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), a powerful result corroborating the transmembrane orientation cartooned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mapping the EMRE transmembrane helix</title><p>We next investigate how EMRE interacts with MCU to support Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation.

This classical strategy posits that the large tryptophan side chain introduced at a protein interface is more likely to disrupt helical packing and hence function than when projecting towards lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hong and Miller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sharp et al., 1995</xref>). The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) highlight a rather clean segregation of Trp-sensitive vs insensitive positions on a helical-wheel diagram. In particular, Trp substitution at G81 or S85 completely eliminates Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake via the uniporter complex. These two residues belong to a conserved Gxxx[G/A/S] motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), frequently found to mediate packing of TMHs in membrane protein structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Russ and Engelman, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments further confirm the GxxxS sequence as crucial to MCU-EMRE complex formation.

WT EMRE is captured by MCU, but disruption of the GxxxS region by the G81W or S85W mutation prevents this association, while Trp substitution of residues elsewhere on the TMH does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results taken together show that EMRE binds to MCU using a Gxxx[G/A/S] motif in the C-terminal half of its TMH, and that this binding is necessary to activate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting pore in the uniporter complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MCU recognition of EMRE</title><p>To examine the MCU side of the interaction with EMRE, we launched Trp-perturbation mutagenesis of both TMHs (residues L234 – T254 in TMH1; Y268 – V283 in TMH2).

We therefore introduced each of the eight high-impact Trp substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) into <italic>D. discoideum</italic> MCU to test the mutational effect in ME-KO cells. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) show that six of these mutations are functionally disruptive while two are fully active; these two active mutants correspond to L240W and A241W in TMH1 of human MCU, suggesting that these residues in human MCU contact EMRE.</p><p>A steric clash between a substituted Trp in MCU and a native residue in EMRE could in principle be alleviated by reducing the side-chain volume of that particular EMRE residue. We chose F77 in EMRE to test this idea, as it is on the same helical face as the GxxxS sequence identified above, and since the large Phe residue enables substantial shortening of the side chain. Accordingly, F77A EMRE was coexpressed with each of the 6 functionally defective MCU Trp mutants of TMH1. This EMRE mutant, which forms a functional channel with WT MCU, rescues Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport with A241W but not with any of the other mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similarly, the impaired uniporter function induced by A241F in MCU is rescued by F77A in EMRE. Co-IP experiments further show that A241F (or A241W) MCU pulls down F77A but not WT EMRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results demonstrate that the combination of a large and a small side chain (F or W, A) on EMRE position 77 and MCU position 241 leads to proper transport function regardless of which protein the residues occupy. This 'side chain swap' experiment argues strongly that A241 in MCU’s TMH1 is in close proximity to F77 in the TMH of EMRE in the uniporter complex.</p><p>While analyzing MCU/EMRE from various species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we noticed that human MCU (hMCU) forms functional Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with human EMRE (hEMRE) or with <italic>C. elegans</italic> EMRE (ceEMRE), but <italic>C. elegans</italic> MCU (ceMCU) supports mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake only with ceEMRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results present an opportunity to test which of ceMCU’s two TMHs is responsible for discriminating against hEMRE. Accordingly, we produced two MCU chimeras, with TMH1 or TMH2 of ceMCU substituted by the corresponding region in hMCU. The chimera containing hMCU TMH1, though well expressed, is transport-inactive in the presence of either hEMRE or ceEMRE. The chimera containing hMCU TMH2, however, is activated by ceEMRE, while remaining unresponsive to hEMRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This result independently supports the proposal that TMH1 of MCU contains the interaction region for EMRE.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Localization and inner membrane association of MICUs</title><p>With the membrane disposition of the MCU-EMRE complex in hand, we now ask how EMRE interacts with MICU proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sancak et al., 2013</xref>), which contain no apparent transmembrane sequences.

PEGM readily reacts with MICU1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), showing that this subunit resides on the outer, IMS side of the inner membrane. Two issues regarding this experiment require comment. First, the PEGM-treated sample appears as a smear instead of a defined band, consistent with heterogeneous modification of the protein's 7 native cysteines. Second, a significant western-blot signal is observed roughly corresponding to MICU1 dimers, stable in SDS-PAGE conditions, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Patron et al., 2014</xref>). This signal also shifts upward after PEGM treatment, suggesting that MICU1 dimers or higher oligomers are also localized to the IMS. Similar results in parallel experiments with MICU2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) argue that both MICU1 and MICU2 are associated with the outer leaflet of the mitochondrial inner membrane, a location in harmony with the cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing function of these proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Interaction of MICUs with the pore-forming region</title><p>It has been established, as we also confirm here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), that MICU1 forms a stable complex with MICU2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kamer and Mootha, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Patron et al., 2014</xref>), and that MICU1, but not MICU2, is tightly associated with the MCU-EMRE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kamer and Mootha, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sancak et al., 2013</xref>).

This highly charged tail alerts us to a complementary polybasic sequence (KKKKR), which though conserved in MICU1, is absent in MICU2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoffman et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, co-IP experiments demonstrate that MICU1 pulls down ΔN- but not ΔC-EMRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, a MICU1 mutant carrying an electrostatically neutered sequence (KKKKR =&gt;EQEQR) readily complexes with MICU2, but not with EMRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results strongly argue that the EMRE-MICU1 interaction is mediated by this electrostatic pair.

By binding to both MCU and MICU1, EMRE might serve as an anchor to retain the MICU1-MICU2 pair near the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting pore. If so, disrupting the MICU1-EMRE interaction would yield a population of channels free of MICUs, allowing unregulated, constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation from the cytosol into the matrix. To examine this idea, we quantify MCU-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by following accumulation of the <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> radioisotope into mitochondria in digitonin-permeabilized cells, an approach that allows free extramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> to be buffered at well-defined submicromolar concentrations without sacrificing sensitivity.</p><p>We first examine the effect of MICU1 knockdown (KD) on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake.

Although insufficiently sensitive antibodies frustrate quantification of MICU1, the MICU1-KD cell lines show a profound functional alteration in <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. At high Ca<sup>2+</sup> (30 μM), rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport into WT and MICU1-KD mitochondria are similar, while as expected, uptake is virtually undetectable in ME-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). At low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.5 μM), however, MICU1-KD mitochondria show massive Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in the matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), in dramatic contrast to WT, where very little Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake occurs. These observations confirm previous studies that identified MICU1 as a molecular element controlling Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of the uniporter complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Csordas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mallilankaraman et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Functional manifestations of the EMRE-MICU1 interaction were further examined by comparing <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake supported by EMRE variants expressed in EMRE-KO cells.

At low Ca<sup>2+</sup>, uptake is suppressed in mitochondria hosting WT or ΔN-EMRE, but is enhanced over 50-fold by MICU1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> rapidly enters mitochondria containing ΔC-EMRE, which cannot bind MICU1, and the rate is only trivially increased after MICU1 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

The present work focuses mainly on EMRE, the least understood component of the channel complex. Impressed by the functional dependence on EMRE arising as metazoan uniporters evolved, we have endeavored to enrich our current view of the uniporter subunits and the physiological purposes of the domain interactions mediating their assembly. Results here establish (1) EMRE orientation in the inner membrane, (2) the molecular contacts governing EMRE interactions with MCU and MICU1, (3) the disposition of the MICU1-MICU2 complex on the outer surface of the inner-membrane, and (4) the functional purpose of the EMRE-MICU1 interaction. These findings lead to a molecular model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) featuring a central role of EMRE in orchestrating uniporter responses to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15545.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The physiological role of EMRE.</title><p>Cartoon summarizing main findings here, illustrating how the two functions of EMRE, MCU activation and MICU1 retention, together prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> leakage through the uniporter complex in resting cellular conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15545.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15545.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15545-fig7-v4"/></fig></p><p>When a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in the plasma membrane opens, or when an intracellular store releases Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave is generated. Once the wave hits mitochondria, Ca<sup>2+</sup> can rise above ~1 μM, activating the uniporter to catalyze rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria can therefore serve as a buffer to shape intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demaurex et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry boosts ATP output by accelerating the citric acid cycle, but excessive, sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in the matrix triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, mitochondria can also decode Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation as either metabolic or death signals. Failure of the uniporter to appropriately respond to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals would perturb these crucial physiological processes and could also produce other serious problems. For instance, if the uniporter fails to stay inactive under resting conditions, the large negative inner membrane potential of energized mitochondria would drive continual Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Removing these Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions requires the action of Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers at a cost of 3 H<sup>+</sup> entering into the matrix for each Ca<sup>2+</sup> expelled. Unregulated, ‘leaky’ uniporters would therefore divert protons away from the F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase, partially uncoupling electron transport from ATP synthesis.</p><p>The recent discovery of MICU proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baughman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mallilankaraman et al., 2012</xref>) has enhanced our mechanistic understanding of how cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals control uniporter activity. It is now clear that the mitochondrial response to physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> is mediated by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing gate formed by the MICU subunits that engage the pore-lining MCU proteins at the external face of the inner membrane. This modular design comes with a potential danger: that the gating and ion-conducing subunits might dissociate sporadically, producing unregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. How could this problem be prevented? It is likely that MICU1 has a high intrinsic affinity to MCU, since at least part of the MICU1-MCU complex survives lengthy co-IP experiments. Moreover, diffusion of MICUs confined to two dimensions within the inner membrane raises the local density of MICUs near the MCU pore. These factors combined could in principle reduce the population of MICU-free, unregulated uniporters — a condition that might be particularly helpful to protist and plant mitochondria, where MCU and MICUs are the only components of the uniporter complex.</p><p>The small, single-pass membrane protein EMRE emerges in animals as a new subunit of the uniporter complex. A crucial finding here is that the presence of EMRE in the uniporter complex ensures that the channel conducts Ca<sup>2+</sup> only when cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises above resting levels. This requires EMRE to use its polyaspartate tail to bind MICU1, as if it functions as 'molecular glue' to prevent dissociation of MICU1 from the MCU pore, a circumstance that would produce catastrophic Ca<sup>2+</sup> leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Alternatively, EMRE might allosterically transmit the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal from MICUs to the pore; in this case, disrupting EMRE-MICU1 interaction would also prevent MICUs from properly gating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway. We consider this allosteric scenario unlikely, as the mechanism by which MICU1 gates MCU probably evolved in early eukaryotic evolution when EMRE was absent.</p><p>The understanding that EMRE safeguards mitochondria against inappropriate Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake helps us appreciate the physiological importance of the strict EMRE-dependence of uniporter function appearing in animals. As in any multisubunit protein, it is inevitable that EMRE might occasionally dissociate from MCU, and some tissues under natural or pathological conditions might express MCU in excess of EMRE. Under these situations, a population of EMRE-free uniporters could arise. These channels would also lack MICUs, which would no longer be EMRE-linked to the pore. But the MCU-activation function of EMRE would ensure that these channels would become inactive, preventing them from wreaking havoc on normal cell physiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>We should point out that our results clash with several published assertions regarding the uniporter complex. First, single-channel recordings in planar lipid bilayers have been used to argue that the human MCU protein alone is sufficient to reconstitute a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel without EMRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Stefani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Patron et al., 2014</xref>). These recordings, however, obtained with in vitro-expressed protein of uncharacterized purity, show channel properties vastly different from uniporter currents directly patch-recorded from intact mitoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kirichok et al., 2004</xref>). Second, a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vais et al., 2016</xref>) using protease digestion argues that EMRE adopts a N<sub>out</sub>-C<sub>in</sub> orientation, opposite to that deduced here. Interpretation of the assay, however, is based on an unjustified assumption that the N- and C- termini of EMRE are digested at similar rates. In contrast, our results are supported by two lines of direct and independent evidence – mass tagging of substituted cysteines and the functional competence of the MCU-EMRE fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This same study also claims that EMRE uses its C-terminal tail to sense matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup>, producing a biphasic response of uniporter activity to matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, this phenomenon, to our best knowledge, has not been observed in any mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake experiments in the literature or in previous patch recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kirichok et al., 2004</xref>). We also note a recent study appearing when our work was under review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yamamoto et al., 2016</xref>) that deduced, using an epitope-tagging method, a N<sub>in</sub>-C<sub>out</sub> EMRE orientation fully consistent with our results. That study also shows that a Pro-to-Ala substitution 3 residues N-terminal to the predicted TMH - a region left unperturbed in our 22-residue deletion ΔN-EMRE construct - abolishes EMRE-MCU interaction. Thus, a small portion in the N-terminus of EMRE near the TMH might also be involved in binding MCU.</p><p>In summary, our results argue that EMRE mediates two distinct functions – MCU activation and MICU retention - through two distinct types of subunit-subunit interactions. These functions conspire to achieve a single physiological outcome: obligatory linkage of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing machineries, a necessary condition for the uniporter complex to respond rapidly and accurately to the elaborate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling network that has evolved in animal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology, cell culture, and transient expression</title><p>Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Agilent).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, David Clapham, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see, all reviewers were enthusiastic about the quality and relevance of the work, and its publication after revision in <italic>eLife</italic>. Reviewers 2 and 3 had very minor points as listed below. Reviewer 2 made some extensive comments, but note these were considered &quot;suggestions&quot;. We ask that you consider these points in your revised manuscript.</p><p>Minor points from Reviewers 2 and 3:</p><p>1) A new paper in BBA reports functional mutagenesis of EMRE, showing that deletion of amino acids at EMRE's N terminus abolishes function, in conflict with the current paper. The discrepancy ought to be reconciled or at least discussed.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: Western blot: what was the molecular weight for EMRE?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>: The predicted mol. wt. for MICU1 and MICU2 are approximately 54 and 50 KDa respectively.

You also mentioned that MICU1 antibody was not good enough to quantify the MICU1 expression level in MICU1 knockdown cell lines. A comment on reliability of your MICU1 antibodies may be needed.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> indicates that MICU2 remains membrane-bound even after harsher Na2CO3 treatment where as MICU1 comes off. This result seems to contradict the reports indicating that MICU2 binds MCU-complex via MICU1 either by forming a disulfide bond or other (Patron et al, 2014 as well as Kamer et al, 2014). This result was not discussed at all considering its importance.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> shows that MICU1 can precipitate MCU in the absence of EMRE. Doesn't this observation contradict the strict requirement of EMRE C-terminal for MICU1 engagement with the pore-forming subunit (MCU)?</p><p>Reviewer #1 general assessment:</p><p>Tsai et al. investigate EMRE, a non- pore-forming subunit of the mitochondrial uniporter, (the MCU, or MiCa channel). They approach the relevant orientation and functional questions with a large number of experimental methods. First, the authors use gene editing to develop assays in permeabilized HEK cells. MCU homologs from amoeba and plants mediate Ca uptake alone, while worms, flies, and human MCU requires EMRE. Cysteine and tryptophan scanning/substitution mutagenesis then enables them to verify that MCU's N and C termini are inside the mitoplast, while EMRE's N terminus is inside the mitoplast and its C terminus outside. Chimeras and other experiments then suggest that TMH1 of MCU is the interaction region for EMRE. Other subunits, the relatively soluble subunits MICU1 and MICU2, are shown to associate with the outer leaflet of the inner mitochondrial membrane, and that EMRE associates with MICU1 by electrostatic interactions. MICU function is verified as regulating Ca entry, and the authors propose that MICU1 must bind EMRE to engage the MCU pore. Thus, MICUs regulate what would otherwise be an unregulated Ca pore. An important finding is that EMRE polyaspartate tail ensures that the channel conducts Ca only when cytoplasmic Ca rises above its resting levels. In short, EMRE mediates MICU retention and MCU retention. Based on the lack of EMRE in lower species, the authors conclude that EMRE arose as a safety mechanism, allowing MICU1 gating of MCU only if EMRE is present.</p><p>This work clarifies many of the issues that have plagued MCU subunit function and orientation. The methods are robust and the conclusions are likely sound. The only additional experiments the field needs to settle remaining conformational questions is the high resolution structure of the MCU/EMRE/MICU1/2/MCUR1 complex.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 general assessment and major comments:</italic></p><p>This is a new paper from a premiere ion channel biochemistry lab. The paper focuses on the macromolecular organization of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex, which in humans consists of five proteins: MCU (the pore), MICU1/2 (calcium sensors in the IMS), and EMRE (a small membrane protein that relays MICU1/2 calcium sensing to the open state of MCU). The study combines clever biochemical methods (e.g., artificial transmembrane domains, tryptophan mutagenesis, and protein fusions) to shed insight into the complex, with a focus on EMRE and its interactions with MCU and MICU1. The topic is timely. Some important suggestions designed to help the authors improve what could be a very important paper:</p><p>1) This paper reports a mix of novel and not so novel results – hence novel findings are buried. I would encourage the authors to emphasize the novel and de-emphasize results that are confirmatory. For example, the topology of MCU, IMS localization of MICU1/2, gatekeeping activity by MICU1, and dual functions of EMRE (keeping MCU open and linking MICU1/2 to MCU) are all well-established now. The novel findings include the topology of EMRE, the MCU-EMRE fusion (which could be a very important tool for the field), EMRE interaction with TM1, and interaction between MICU1 and EMRE.</p><p>2) In MCU knockout cell lines and mouse tissues, loss of MCU causes loss of EMRE expression. In many figures, the authors claim loss of interaction (by IP) between EMRE and MCU, but EMRE protein expression seems normal. This raises the possibility that the IP conditions used here do not reflect the in vivo binding status of these two proteins. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, the authors mutate EMRE and evaluate which variants are able to interact with MCU. The S85W mutant evidently expresses very well, yet does not interact with MCU. Can the authors provide additional evidence, e.g., BN-PAGE, demonstrating a lack of a shift of the MCU holocomplex?</p><p>3) The authors claim that the δ-N, δ-C and WALP EMRE localize to the mitochondria. However, it's not clear how pure their mitochondrial preps are without markers for other organelles. Alternatively, they could consider simple microscopy experiments to look for co-localization with mitochondrial markers. Again, it is surprising to see that WALP EMRE expresses so well, even though it does not bind to MCU. How do the activities of δ-N and δ-C compare to WT? Please add WT EMRE traces and expression to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>.</p><p>4) One of the important new claims relates to the nature of the interaction between MCU and EMRE. The authors have performed tryptophan scanning mutagenesis of both transmembranes of MCU and identify six in TM1 versus two in TM2 that disrupt function. Based on this difference (six versus two), the authors prioritize TM1 as being more important for EMRE binding. They then show that two of these mutations can be introduced into the DdMCU without impairing function – and since DdMCU operates independently of EMRE, prioritize these two as important for human MCU binding to EMRE. Finally, the authors perform an amino acid swap between MCU and EMRE to support the conclusion that A241 in MCU and F77 in EMRE directly interact.</p><p>I have some concerns about the logic and inference. First, it's not clear how the authors can exclude the possibility that the other four residues on TM1, or the other two residues on TM2, are important for EMRE binding. Second, if this model is correct, then the MCU chimera with TM1 from human, and TM2 from <italic>C. elegans</italic>, ought in principle be activated by human EMRE, yet it is not. Third, in these functional studies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, IPs are not performed, so we do not know if EMRE is actually bound or not bound to MCU. The authors ought to review these data, add the necessary controls, and then state their conclusions carefully. Also, the authors cannot claim direct interaction – this is nuanced in the text, but in the figure legends, direct interaction is claimed.</p><p>5) The co-IP data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> suggests that MCU can interact with MICU1 independent of EMRE, and that MICU1 can interact with EMRE independent of MCU. These experiments lack proper controls. The authors could express another mitochondrial IM protein as a negative control.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 general assessment:</italic></p><p>This is an extremely important paper that clarifies the general architecture of the MCU complex and sheds light on the physiological function of EMRE and MICU1. The experiments are carefully planned and conducted. The paper is essentially ready for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15545.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #2 major comments:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] Some important suggestions designed to help the authors improve what could be a very important paper:</italic></p><p><italic>1) This paper reports a mix of novel and not so novel results – hence novel findings are buried.

However, we disagree with the reviewer that the dual function of EMRE is established. Prior to our work, the only known function of EMRE is keeping MCU open, but the physiological significance of such function is unclear. To be sure, it has been reported that EMRE interacts with MICU1, but the purpose and mechanism of this interaction, and how this molecular contact regulates uniporter function, have remained unknown until this study. We have endeavored in the Abstract, the Introduction, and the Discussion to emphasize and highlight the major contribution of this work: to provide a unifying picture of how the MCU-activation and MICU1-rentention functions of EMRE together prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> leakage through the uniporter during resting cell conditions.</p><p><italic>2) In MCU knockout cell lines and mouse tissues, loss of MCU causes loss of EMRE expression.

Can the authors provide additional evidence, e.g., BN-PAGE, demonstrating a lack of a shift of the MCU holocomplex?</italic></p><p>There is so far no evidence that the steady-state expression level of EMRE directly reflects the integrity of the MCU-EMRE interaction. Protein expression is a complicated function of the rate of proteolysis, polypeptide synthesis, protein insertion into membranes, etc., a subject that we have currently under study, and one far beyond the scope of this manuscript. An EMRE mutation such as S85W can in principle influence any of these factors and can thus alter EMRE’s observed expression level.</p><p>We have in fact done proper controls for the CoIP experiment, showing that MCU pulls down WT and control Trp mutants, but not G81W and S85W EMRE. BN-PAGE would not provide additional information, since as in CoIP, it requires the protein complex to be first extracted into detergents before being analyzed by Western blot.</p><p><italic>3) The authors claim that the δ-N, δ-C and WALP EMRE localize to the mitochondria. However, it's not clear how pure their mitochondrial preps are without markers for other organelles. Alternatively, they could consider simple microscopy experiments to look for co-localization with mitochondrial markers. Again, it is surprising to see that WALP EMRE expresses so well, even though it does not bind to MCU. How do the activities of δ-N and δ-C compare to WT? Please add WT EMRE traces and expression to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>.</italic></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>, we show that ΔN and ΔC EMRE, but not WALP, support MCU function. There is certainly a low possibility that WALP EMRE fails to activate MCU because it is targeted to other organelles, despite its mitochondrial targeting sequence. This possibility could be ruled out by extensive control experiments, such as the co-localization experiment suggested by the reviewer. However, we cannot justify the time required for these experiments, as at the end of the day it is the extensive Trp mutagenesis screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>) and the side-chain swap experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>) that powerfully establish that TMH interactions between MCU and EMRE are necessary for uniporter function.</p><p>The activity of ΔN, ΔC, and WT EMRE are similar, as is compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> using a more sensitive <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux assay. Again, there is no evidence in the literature that EMRE steady-state expression is controlled solely by MCU binding.</p><p><italic>4) One of the important new claims relates to the nature of the interaction between MCU and EMRE.

Also, the authors cannot claim direct interaction – this is nuanced in the text, but in the figure legends, direct interaction is claimed.</italic></p><p>Our side-chain swap experiment allows us to identify A241 as a residue interacting with EMRE, but we certainly do not exclude the possibility that other residues sensitive to Trp substitution might also be important for EMRE binding. The reviewer is right that our model would predict that an MCU chimera made of human-MCU TM1 and <italic>C. elegans</italic> MCU TM2 should respond to human EMRE. Unfortunately, such chimera fails to respond to both human and <italic>C. elegans</italic> EMRE. We cannot interpret a negative result like this, as the failure to detect function could result from many potential issues, such as misfolding of the chimera protein.</p><p><italic>5) The co-IP data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> suggests that MCU can interact with MICU1 independent of EMRE, and that MICU1 can interact with EMRE independent of MCU. These experiments lack proper controls. The authors could express another mitochondrial IM protein as a negative control.</italic></p><p>The reviewer, citing precedents in the literature, suggests a common way to rule out non-specific binding of MICU1 to the affinity column: to show that another mitochondrial IM protein fails to bind to the column. However, we consider this kind of negative control to be a bit indirect. Instead, we opted for a more laborious but more powerful negative control that directly demonstrates that MICU1 is not retained in the column in the absence of MCU or EMRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p><italic>Minor points from Reviewers 2 and 3:</italic></p><p><italic>1) A new paper in BBA reports functional mutagenesis of EMRE, showing that deletion of amino acids at EMRE's N terminus abolishes function, in conflict with the current paper. The discrepancy ought to be reconciled or at least discussed.</italic></p><p>Yes, we saw this new paper when it appeared. It fully confirms our orientation results. There is in fact no discrepancy, as their substitutions and short deletion at the N-terminus were different from our more extensive deletion. We comment on these new results in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: Western blot: what was the molecular weight for EMRE?</italic></p><p>It is ~10 kDa. We have added this information to the legends.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>: The predicted mol. wt. for MICU1 and MICU2 are approximately 54 and 50 KDa respectively.

You also mentioned that MICU1 antibody was not good enough to quantify the MICU1 expression level in MICU1 knockdown cell lines. A comment on reliability of your MICU1 antibodies may be needed.</italic></p><p>We do not know why the MICUs travel more slowly than expected. Deviation from the expected ICU1 immunodetection: this is reliable, since MICU1 tagged with FLAG, and detected by anti-FLAG antibody. We have now revised the methods section to make sure that this is clear.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> indicates that MICU2 remains membrane-bound even after harsher Na2CO3 treatment where as MICU1 comes off. This result seems to contradict the reports indicating that MICU2 binds MCU-complex via MICU1 either by forming a disulfide bond or other (Patron et al, 2014 as well as Kamer et al, 2014). This result was not discussed at all considering its importance.</italic></p><p>In our Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> extraction experiments, either MICU1 or MICU2 is overexpressed so that one of them is in large molecular excess than the other. This allows us to test interaction of individual MICU with lipid, with minimized complication from MICU1-MICU2 interaction. Our results agree with the idea that MICU1 and MICU2 form a heterodimer, as in the Patron and Kamer paper.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> shows that MICU1 can precipitate MCU in the absence of EMRE. Doesn't this observation contradict the strict requirement of EMRE C-terminal for MICU1 engagement with the pore-forming subunit (MCU)?</italic></p><p>This is a good point but not a fatal one for our argument. Our results show that EMRE C-terminus is necessary for MCU to be “fully” gated by MICU1, but we did not rule out that without this interaction, there could be some MCU-MICU1 interaction that allows some binding and perhaps a less perfectly coupled form of uniporter gating. We actually think, as in Discussion, that this MCU-MICU1 interaction might be crucial for protist and plant uniporters, which do not have EMRE as a subunit.</p></body></sub-article></article>
