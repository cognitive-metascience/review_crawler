of mammalian innate antiviral immunity. Mouse IFIT1 selectively inhibits viruses that lack 2'O-methylation of their mRNA 5' caps. Surprisingly, human IFIT1 does not share this antiviral specificity. Here, we resolve this discrepancy by demonstrating that human and mouse IFIT1 have evolved distinct functions using a combination of evolutionary, genetic and virological analyses. First, we show that human <italic>IFIT1</italic> and mouse <italic>IFIT1</italic> (renamed <italic>IFIT1B</italic>) are not orthologs, but are paralogs that diverged &gt;100 mya. Second, using a yeast genetic assay, we show that IFIT1 and IFIT1B proteins differ in their ability to be suppressed by a cap 2'O-methyltransferase. Finally, we demonstrate that IFIT1 and IFIT1B have divergent antiviral specificities, including the discovery that only IFIT1 proteins inhibit a virus encoding a cap 2'O-methyltransferase. These functional data, combined with widespread turnover of mammalian <italic>IFIT</italic> genes, reveal dramatic species-specific differences in IFIT-mediated antiviral repertoires.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14228.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14228.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14228.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a virus is detected in the body, hundreds of different proteins in the immune system are rapidly produced as a first line of defense to limit the ability of the virus to multiply and spread. Many of these ‘innate’ immunity proteins have rapidly evolved in mammals in escalating molecular 'arms races' with the viruses they target. This makes it more difficult to work out exactly what job each protein performs. Even when the role of a specific protein has been determined in mice, for example, it does not always follow that the human protein with the same name will perform the same role.</p><p>The IFIT1 proteins are some of the most highly produced innate immunity proteins in mammals during viral infections. In the infected cell, host and viral proteins are both made from templates made of molecules of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Previous work showed that the IFIT1 protein in mice is able to exploit a critical chemical difference between host and virus RNA to selectively block the production of virus proteins. However, other research suggests that the human IFIT1 protein does not use the same chemical difference to distinguish between host and virus RNA.</p><p>Here, Daugherty et al. unravel the complicated evolutionary history of IFIT1 proteins to show that the mouse and human proteins are not as closely related to each other as first thought. Instead, they belong to two different protein families with distinct roles in fighting viruses. Further experiments show that the human and mouse IFIT proteins likely discriminate between host and viral RNA using different cues, leading to their action against different sets of viruses.</p><p>Daugherty et al.’s findings highlight that there are additional undiscovered chemical differences between host and viral RNA that the immune system can exploit to selectively target and stop viruses from multiplying. Furthermore, these findings re-emphasize the often-overlooked differences between the immune systems of mice and humans. The finding that mammals have such a diverse set of IFIT1 immunity proteins may directly explain why different species are susceptible to different viruses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14228.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14228.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>mRNA modification</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>gene conversion</kwd><kwd>phylogeny</kwd><kwd>host-virus interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1AI027762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geballe</surname><given-names>Adam P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daugherty</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Harmit S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daugherty</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI099936</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geballe</surname><given-names>Adam P</given-names></name><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Harmit S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evolutionary innovation and turnover in the <italic>IFIT1</italic> antiviral gene family has led to diverse repertoires of antiviral specificity across mammals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian antiviral defenses rely on the combined functions of a vast collection of immunity genes. One important arm of the immune system is innate, or cell intrinsic, antiviral immunity, which establishes an antiviral state in cells by signaling through the cytokine interferon (IFN) and subsequent upregulation of hundreds of genes known collectively as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs serve as the first line of defense against viruses and typically function to sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or directly restrict virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schoggins, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Among the most highly upregulated ISGs are members of the <italic>IFIT</italic> (interferon-induced with tetratricopeptide repeats) genes. Upon IFN-stimulation or viral infection, the mRNA levels of <italic>IFITs</italic> increase 100- to 1000-fold, and IFIT proteins have been implicated in inhibition of a broad range of viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diamond and Farzan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fensterl and Sen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vladimer et al., 2014</xref>). However, the number and identity of <italic>IFIT</italic> genes can vary substantially between species. For instance, while humans have five intact <italic>IFIT</italic> genes (<italic>IFIT1, 1B, 2, 3</italic> and <italic>5</italic>), rats have four (<italic>IFIT1, 1b, 2</italic> and <italic>3</italic>) and mice have six (<italic>IFIT1, 1b, 1c, 2, 3</italic> and <italic>3b</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fensterl and Sen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). The functional consequences of <italic>IFIT</italic> family evolution are unknown, in part because the antiviral functions and specificities of IFITs are incompletely characterized. Initial studies with IFIT1 and IFIT2 from humans and mice indicated that these proteins might mediate their antiviral activity by inhibiting mRNA translation through interactions with the translation initiation factor eIF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Terenzi et al., 2005</xref>). In this way, IFITs appeared to function similarly to another critical mediator of the innate immune system, Protein Kinase R (PKR), by globally inhibiting mRNA translation. In the case of PKR, the recognition of cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA, a by-product of viral replication, triggers its activity and the global repression of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dever et al., 2007</xref>). Such a 'self versus non-self' molecular pattern has been more enigmatic for IFIT proteins, and it has been challenging to determine how IFITs discriminate viral from host RNAs to repress viral replication specifically.</p><p>An elegant means by which one IFIT protein distinguishes 'self versus non-self' mRNAs was revealed by recent studies on mouse IFIT1. During mammalian mRNA processing, the 5' cap region is 2'O-methylated from a cap0-structure (7mGpppN, where 7mG is the 7-methyl guanosine, ppp is the triphosphate linkage, and N is any nucleotide) to a cap1-structure (7mGpppNm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee, 1980</xref>). This reaction is catalyzed in the host nucleus by a dedicated 2'O-methyltransferase, known as a cap1-methyltransferase (hCMTR1 in humans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belanger et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, many viruses have evolved ways to mimic host cap1-structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Decroly et al., 2012</xref>). For several viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, such as poxviruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and rhabdoviruses, 2'O-methylation of the cap is catalyzed by a virally-encoded cap1-methyltransferase. For other viruses, such as orthomyxoviruses, arenaviruses, and bunyaviruses, the effect is achieved by ‘cap-snatching’, in which a segment of cap1-modified host mRNA is appended to viral mRNAs. Either strategy results in methylated (cap1-) mRNAs, suggesting that unmethylated (cap0-) mRNAs could be recognized as a 'non-self' pattern that elicits host immunity. Indeed, mouse IFIT1 was discovered to inhibit replication of numerous viruses naturally lacking or mutated to lack 2'O-methylation by directly binding and inhibiting translation of cap0-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daffis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hyde et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Menachery et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szretter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zust et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Habjan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kimura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). In this way, mouse IFIT1 selectively inhibits viruses that translate proteins from 'non-self' cap0-mRNAs, while the host protects itself via 'self' cap1-structures on its mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diamond, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyde and Diamond, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given the importance of the cap0-mRNA versus cap1-mRNA specificity in directing mouse IFIT1’s repressive effects against viruses, we might expect that other mammalian <italic>IFIT1</italic> genes would preserve such discrimination. Surprisingly, studies on human IFIT1 have belied this expectation. For instance, human IFIT1 was shown to inhibit mRNA translation and replication of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), despite the fact that PIV5 encodes a cap1-methyltransferase and PIV5 mRNAs are 2'O-methylated on their caps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrejeva et al., 2013</xref>). Other studies have implicated human IFIT1 in inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raychoudhuri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2003</xref>), human papillomavirus (HPV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Terenzi et al., 2008</xref>), influenza A virus (IAV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pichlmair et al., 2011</xref>), none of which are predicted to translate proteins from cap0-mRNAs.</p><p>These seemingly contradictory results regarding the antiviral specificities of mouse IFIT1 and human IFIT1 have led to a conundrum in the field regarding the molecular functions and antiviral specificity of IFIT proteins in general. However, one implicit assumption underlying the expectation that human and mouse IFIT1 should function similarly is that mouse and human <italic>IFIT1</italic> represent orthologous genes. Here, we show that this is not the case. Using detailed phylogenetic analyses of <italic>IFIT</italic> genes in vertebrates, made possible by deconvolving the confounding effects of recurrent gene conversion, we show that human <italic>IFIT1</italic> and mouse <italic>IFIT1</italic> are two distinct paralogous genes that diverged early in mammalian evolution. Mouse genomes only have representatives of one of these paralogous genes (which we rename <italic>IFIT1B</italic>), whereas several primates have lost <italic>IFITB</italic> but retained <italic>IFIT1</italic>. We further show that these two divergent <italic>IFIT1</italic> paralogs have distinct specificities. Using a genetic assay we developed in budding yeast (which exploits yeast's inherent lack of a cap1-methyltransferase), we show that mouse and other IFIT1B proteins, but not IFIT1 proteins, discriminate cap0- from cap1-mRNA methylation by selectively inhibiting growth only when a cap1-methyltransferase is missing. Consistent with this activity, we show that only IFIT1B proteins can inhibit replication of a virus that lacks functional cap1-methylation. In contrast, we find that human and other IFIT1 proteins can inhibit the growth of yeast or of a virus that encodes a cap1-methyltransferase. Our findings thus resolve the apparent mystery of IFIT1’s altered antiviral discrimination mechanism in mouse and human and delineate an important role for human IFIT1 in restriction of viruses including those that produce cap1-mRNAs. Our analyses also reveal a high degree of dynamism and alternate retention of <italic>IFIT1</italic> or <italic>IFIT1B</italic> paralogs in mammalian genomes. This <italic>IFIT</italic> gene turnover might profoundly impact the spectrum of viruses that different mammalian species are capable of restricting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mouse IFIT1 and Human IFIT1 are not orthologous but belong to distinct gene families</title><p>The expectation that mouse and human <italic>IFIT1</italic> should have a similar antiviral function and specificity implicitly assumes that these two genes are orthologous, <italic>i.e.,</italic> they diverged when the common ancestors of humans and mice diverged as species. However, there is evidence suggesting that this assumption may not be valid. First, there have been extensive changes to the number and identity of <italic>IFIT</italic> genes between humans and mice ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fensterl and Sen, 2011</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, mouse IFIT1 is more similar at the sequence level to another human IFIT, the poorly characterized human IFIT1B, than to human IFIT1 (57% versus 53% pairwise amino acid identity). Based on these data, and the contradictory functional data for mouse IFIT1 and human IFIT1 antiviral activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrejeva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daffis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pichlmair et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pinto et al., 2015</xref>), we formally tested for <italic>IFIT1</italic> orthology between mouse and human. To do so, we first undertook detailed phylogenetic analyses of the <italic>IFIT</italic> genes found in several well-assembled mammalian genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14228.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Discordant signatures of synteny and phylogeny for mammalian <italic>IFIT</italic> genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alignment of the <italic>IFIT</italic> gene locus from several mammalian genomes.

For example, human chromosome 10 contains a single locus that encodes all five intact IFIT genes: <italic>IFIT1, IFIT1B, IFIT2, IFIT3</italic> and <italic>IFIT5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found the <italic>IFIT</italic> locus organization is similar in many other mammalian genomes including African green monkeys, rabbits, cats, ferrets, and armadillos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this shared syntenic arrangement, two <italic>IFIT1</italic> paralogs are found next to each other in the same sense orientation as <italic>IFIT2</italic> and <italic>IFIT3</italic>, suggesting that a single duplication of <italic>IFIT1</italic> may have occurred early in mammalian evolution, <italic>i.e.,</italic> before the radiation of placental mammals over 100 million years ago. In primates, rabbits and carnivores, the paralogs immediately adjacent to <italic>IFIT3</italic> are named <italic>IFIT1B</italic> in sequence databases, whereas the distal paralogs are named <italic>IFIT1</italic>. Based on this previous nomenclature, we will henceforth refer to these as the <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> gene families.</p><p>In contrast, the <italic>IFIT</italic> locus in mice and rats is arranged quite differently than other mammalian genomes. Instead of two paralogs, mice have three <italic>IFIT1</italic> paralogs, two of which are in the opposite orientation to <italic>IFIT2</italic> and <italic>IFIT3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, shared synteny analyses are not suitable for assigning orthology/ paralogy relationships for the mouse <italic>IFIT1</italic> genes. We, therefore, constructed maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of full-length <italic>IFIT</italic> gene sequences across these divergent mammalian species to determine how mouse <italic>IFIT1</italic> genes are related to those found in other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found unambiguous phylogenetic signatures that delineate <italic>IFIT2, IFIT3</italic> and <italic>IFIT5</italic> genes into distinct, monophyletic clades that diverged as expected based on known mammalian species evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O'Leary et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to these three gene families, we were unable to resolve <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes into distinct clades in our phylogenetic analyses. Instead, similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu, 2013</xref>), we found several instances of <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> from the same species (<italic>e.g.,</italic> cat) appearing more phylogenetically related to each other than to their similarly named genes from a sister species (<italic>e.g.,</italic> ferret) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The discordant phylogenetic signatures of <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> evolution could have two alternative explanations. The first is that species-specific duplication may have independently given rise to <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes in different genomes, as has been previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Such a duplication pattern might explain why cat <italic>IFIT1B</italic> is more phylogenetically related to cat <italic>IFIT1</italic> than to <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes from other genomes. However, such an explanation would require recurrent duplication of IFIT genes in many lineages into the same genetic location and orientation, and is thus unlikely.</p><p>We, therefore, considered an alternate explanation. In this alternative, <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes duplicated early in mammalian evolution but have recurrently recombined with each other. Resulting gene conversion would scramble the phylogenetic relatedness of the two genes without altering their genomic locations. Such gene conversion has been shown to contribute to the evolution of several multigene families including mammalian interferon alpha genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benovoy and Drouin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hurles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petronella and Drouin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Santoyo and Romero, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Song et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woelk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yasukochi and Satta, 2015</xref>). To address this possibility, we compared the sequences of <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes within species and between species to look for evidence of gene conversion. We found strong characteristic signatures of gene conversion frequently occurring between the 5' portions of <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes. For example, the sequences of <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes in cats are 86% identical at the whole gene level. However, these two genes are 97% identical in the 5' ends of the genes (nucleotides 1–948 in cat <italic>IFIT1</italic>) but only 63% identical in the 3' ends of the genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This dichotomy is apparent even if we restrict the analysis to just synonymous substitutions, where we observe a much higher rate of synonymous substitutions in the 3' region of the alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such an uneven distribution of sequence differences strongly suggests that the 5' ends of <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> underwent gene conversion recently in the evolution of the cat <italic>IFIT</italic> locus, leading to sequence homogenization of the first two-thirds of the gene. In contrast, comparing orthologous genes between species (e.g. <italic>IFIT1B</italic> between cat and ferret) reveals an even distribution of differences across the gene sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) indicating that both the 5' and 3' regions have diverged to the expected degree between species. Moreover, this pattern of gene conversion is seen in pairwise alignments of many <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes. For instance, between ferret <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic>, the 5' ends are 98% identical, but 3' ends are only 62% identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A similar dichotomy is evident in a comparison between rabbit <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> and between armadillo <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, all of these gene conversion events have a similar recurrent breakpoint approximately two-thirds of the way through the gene sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) that maps to a 'pivot' point between subdomains in the homologous IFIT5 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In all cases, the 5' ends of the <italic>IFIT1</italic> genes are largely homogenized, whereas the 3' ends appear to be consistently diverging. Thus, our findings suggest that recurrent gene conversion has confounded the phylogenetic relationships of the 5’ segment of IFIT1 and IFIT1B, which likely do not accurately represent the actual ancestry of these genes.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14228.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>An ancient gene duplication gave rise to paralogous <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> gene families.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of cat <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> indicating gene conversion between the two paralogs. The middle rectangle represents a pairwise sequence alignment, with black vertical lines indicating differences between the two gene sequences.

In contrast to the analyses using the full-length <italic>IFIT</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or the 5' end of the <italic>IFIT</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), we now discern clear separation of <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes. Both <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes form distinct monophyletic clades that diverge according to mammalian species evolution, similar to other <italic>IFIT</italic> genes. Based on this phylogenetic concordance, as well as the agreement with synteny data, we infer that this phylogeny reflects the actual ancestry of <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes in mammals. Importantly, these data indicate that <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> duplicated early in mammalian evolution. Following this duplication, the 3' ends of the two genes have been diverging according to speciation events, whereas the 5' ends have recurrently recombined. These data also reveal that all three mouse <italic>IFIT1</italic> paralogs (previously named mouse <italic>IFIT1, IFIT1b</italic> and <italic>IFIT1c</italic>) and both rat paralogs (previously named rat <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1b</italic>) unambiguously group within the <italic>IFIT1B</italic> gene family. We, therefore, infer that mouse and rat have lost all copies of IFIT1, likely through a deletion of both IFIT1 and the neighboring IFIT5. Instead, mouse and rat genomes now bear recently duplicated copies of <italic>IFIT1B</italic>. As a result of our phylogenetic analyses, we henceforth refer to these genes as mouse/rat <italic>IFIT1B</italic> (previously mouse/rat <italic>IFIT1), IFIT1B2</italic> (previously mouse/rat <italic>IFIT1b</italic>) and <italic>IFIT1B3</italic> (previously mouse <italic>IFIT1c</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Extending our surveys across all 51 sampled vertebrate species, we found numerous instances of <italic>IFIT</italic> gene birth, gene loss and gene recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In total, we found evidence for at least seven independent instances of <italic>IFIT1B</italic> loss, two separate instances of <italic>IFIT1</italic> loss, and at least 13 independent instances of <italic>IFIT1/1B</italic> gene conversion. Interestingly, it appears that most changes in the gene repertoire of <italic>IFITs</italic> across mammalian species are focused on <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic>, although there are also instances of lineage-specific gene births and loss in other IFIT genes as well. For example, <italic>IFIT3</italic> has duplicated in mice, whereas <italic>IFIT5</italic> has been lost in several rodents (which may have occurred coincident with <italic>IFIT1</italic> loss). These changes have led to a significant evolutionary turnover in the IFIT gene repertoire of different mammalian lineages, prompting us to investigate next the functional consequences of this evolutionary turnover of <italic>IFIT1/ IFIT1B</italic> paralogs in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Discriminating IFIT1 and IFIT1B molecular functions using a novel budding yeast assay</title><p>The ancient duplication and retention of <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> in most mammalian lineages suggested that they have non-redundant functions.

However, most previous studies investigating mRNA cap requirements for IFIT1B-mediated growth inhibition have been carried out in the context of a virus infection under interferon-induced conditions. These approaches to understanding the function of individual IFIT proteins are potentially complicated by the induction of hundreds of other ISGs, as well as the fact several IFIT paralogs have been reported to bind to each other and function in a heterooligomeric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Habjan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pichlmair et al., 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14228.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A yeast genetic assay recapitulates IFIT1B molecular specificity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of mRNA cap structures and the proposed role of mouse IFIT1B in recognition and inhibition of mRNAs containing cap0-structures.

To this end, we turned to the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, whose mRNAs only have cap0-structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee, 1980</xref>) due to a lack of a cap1-methyltransferase. Based on this absence of a cap1-methyltransferase, we hypothesized that expression of mouse IFIT1B in budding yeast might inhibit yeast growth just as IFIT1B inhibits replication of viruses with cap0-mRNAs. Indeed, using a galactose-induced IFIT1B expression system, we found that expression of mouse IFIT1B potently inhibits yeast growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, this growth inhibition occurs in the absence of any other IFIT or component of the innate immune system, indicating that mouse IFIT1B does not require any other mammalian-specific cofactor to perform this function. We next hypothesized that introducing the human cap1-methyltransferase hCRMT1 to yeast would rescue yeast growth by blocking the activity of IFIT1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Strikingly, we observed nearly complete rescue of yeast growth when we co-expressed the human cap1-methyltransferase (hCMTR1), but not a catalytic mutant of hCMTR1 (K239A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belanger et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We, therefore, conclude that the mouse IFIT1B-mediated growth inhibition of budding yeast is specifically due to the lack of a functional cap1-methyltransferase in yeast, accurately recapitulating the known antiviral molecular specificity of IFIT1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Based on our phylogenetic predictions, we next investigated whether other members of the <italic>IFIT1B</italic> gene family have similar properties as the well-characterized mouse IFIT1B. If so, we predicted that they would also cause growth inhibition of yeast, but be rescued by overexpression of the human cap1-methyltransferase. To test this hypothesis, we expressed IFIT1B from several primate species with or without co-expression of hCMTR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Consistent with our phylogenetic prediction, we observed robust growth inhibition as a result of expression of gibbon and African green monkey (AGM) IFIT1B that could be rescued by expression of hCMTR1. Thus, despite the long divergence separating mouse and primate <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes, they share molecular discrimination properties. Surprisingly, we observed no growth inhibition by human IFIT1B. This lack of activity even upon equivalent expression in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) is unusual among intact primate IFIT1Bs, suggesting that human IFIT1B lacks function. This result is consistent with previous suggestions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fensterl and Sen, 2011</xref>) that human IFIT1B may be non-functional even though it appears to be encoded by an intact open reading frame.</p><p>We next tested our hypothesis that IFIT1 has evolved a distinct molecular function from that of IFIT1B. Similar to mouse IFIT1B, we found that expression of human IFIT1 resulted in a potent inhibition of yeast growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, in contrast to mouse IFIT1B, we observed no rescue of human IFIT1-mediated growth inhibition upon overexpression of hCMTR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). IFIT1 proteins from gibbon and African Green Monkey (AGM) recapitulate the findings from human IFIT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data indicate that IFIT1 proteins do not distinguish between absence or presence of a cap1-methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) but instead, likely recognize another as-yet-undefined 'non-self' molecular pattern, other than Cap0-mRNA, which is present in yeast.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14228.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>IFIT1-mediated growth inhibition is not relieved by a cap1-methyltransferase.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Yeast growth inhibition assays as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> with the indicated <italic>IFIT1</italic>.

We, therefore, asked whether differences in the C-terminal end of the IFIT1 and IFIT1B were responsible for changes in their molecular specificity, as suggested by our phylogenetic analyses. Our initial chimeras between mouse IFIT1B and human IFIT1, or gibbon IFIT1 and IFIT1B, were unable to recapitulate the yeast growth inhibition. However, this result may be expected, as each of these proteins has diverged without gene conversion for &gt;30 million years and may have acquired epistatic interactions between the N-terminus and the C-terminus.</p><p>As an alternate strategy to test whether the C-terminus is responsible for differences between IFIT1 and IFIT1B function, we turned to a natural pair of IFIT1/IFIT1B proteins in which the N-termini had recently undergone gene conversion. Cat IFIT1 and IFIT1B are 96% identical at the amino acid level in the N-terminus of the protein whereas the C-terminus is only 46% identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Upon overexpression in yeast, both cat IFIT1 and IFIT1B were capable of causing growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). However, only inhibition by cat IFIT1B was rescued by hCMTR1, suggesting that the C-terminus of the IFIT1 paralogs is critical for the differences in the molecular specificity of these two proteins. We, therefore, conclude that <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> gene families perform distinct molecular functions in the species in which they are found and that recurrent gene conversion of the N-termini of <italic>IFIT1/IFIT1B</italic> genes in mammals has not led to a loss of their separate functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>IFIT1 and IFIT1B encode distinct antiviral specificities</title><p>We showed that IFIT1 and IFIT1B proteins are phylogenetically distinct and are functionally distinct in their dependence on cap1-methyltransferase in our yeast assay. Next, we hypothesized that they have non-overlapping antiviral activities. To test this hypothesis, we created cell lines that constitutively overexpress different <italic>IFIT1</italic> or <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), circumventing the need to stimulate <italic>IFIT</italic> expression with interferon and allowing us to evaluate different <italic>IFIT1</italic> or <italic>IFIT1B</italic> gene functions in an isogenic background. We then tested whether either human IFIT1 or mouse IFIT1B can specifically inhibit replication of a virus lacking a functional cap1-methyltransferase. For these experiments, we compared replication of a wildtype (cap1-mRNA expressing) vaccinia virus to replication of a vaccinia virus that has a catalytic mutation in its cap1-methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Latner et al., 2002</xref>). This assay allowed us to test whether cap1-methyltransferase could enable a virus to block IFIT-mediated antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Consistent with previous studies with these same viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daffis et al., 2010</xref>), we found that expression of mouse IFIT1B can potently inhibit replication of a mutant vaccinia virus that lacks cap1-methyltransferase activity, but was unable to inhibit replication of wildtype vaccinia virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). While the previous mouse knockout experiment had demonstrated that mouse IFIT1B is necessary for inhibition of viruses encoding cap0-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daffis et al., 2010</xref>), our findings show that singular overexpression of mouse IFIT1B is also sufficient for such inhibition. We next extended our analyses to other members of the <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> gene families to determine if cap0-mRNA dependence was a conserved feature of their antiviral activity. Consistent with our yeast assay data, we found that gibbon and AGM IFIT1B proteins function similarly to mouse IFIT1B, and can specifically inhibit the replication of a virus expressing cap0-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Also consistent with our analyses of IFIT1B in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), human IFIT1B lacks antiviral activity despite being expressed in these cell lines.

Immunity proteins are driven to innovate continually to maintain effective defenses against an evolving barrage of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>). One common genetic mechanism of innovation employed by host genomes is gene duplication, which enables hosts to either escape viral antagonism or evolve new inhibitory mechanisms through subfunctionalization. Indeed, many antiviral genes expressed as part of the interferon response represent members of multigene families, whose lineage-specific expansions and contractions have shaped contemporary repertoires of antivirals in mammalian genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunette et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Munk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tareen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).

Previously, several IFITs, including mouse IFIT1B (previously IFIT1) and human IFIT1, were shown to inhibit protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Terenzi et al., 2005</xref>). These findings are consistent with mRNA translation control being a major axis of regulation of viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mohr and Sonenberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the finding that mouse IFIT1B represses the translation of mRNAs lacking Cap1-structures appeared to resolve the conundrum of how at least this IFIT protein discriminates between 'self' and 'non-self' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daffis et al., 2010</xref>). However, the broad application of this result for IFIT1 function was complicated by apparently contradictory findings that mouse and human representatives of IFIT1 have different antiviral specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrejeva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daffis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pichlmair et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pinto et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it remained unclear how different IFIT proteins recognize and inhibit replication of different viruses, and whether and how the changes in IFIT gene composition between species (e.g. humans and mice) have altered their antiviral repertoire.</p><p>To provide an evolutionary framework for understanding how the IFIT antiviral repertoire evolved in mammals, we performed in-depth phylogenetic analyses. We find unambiguous evidence that, although they were initially assumed to be orthologs, mouse IFIT1B (previously mouse <italic>IFIT1</italic>) and human <italic>IFIT1</italic> represent paralogous genes that diverged close to the origin of placental mammals. We further showed that the <italic>IFIT</italic> gene family, especially <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes, have undergone recurrent bouts of gene duplication, gene loss, and gene conversion. These processes have resulted in a wide diversity of <italic>IFIT</italic> genes across mammalian species. Such changes in <italic>IFIT</italic> gene composition might be expected to affect the range of viruses that can be inhibited by IFITs in different mammalian genomes.</p><p>Based on their long divergence, we predicted that mouse (and other) IFT1B and human (and other) IFIT1 protein might possess different antiviral specificities. Consistent with this prediction, our data indicate that only IFIT1B proteins distinguish 'self from non-self' mRNAs by recognizing an unmethylated (cap0-) mRNA structure, a molecular pattern that is absent on 2'O-methylated (cap1-) host mRNAs. However, the general antiviral effectiveness of IFIT1B proteins is limited due to the fact that every mammalian virus family, except alphaviruses, has evolved a way to produce cap1-mRNAs. Viral cap1-mRNAs are produced either by nuclear transcription and use of the host nuclear capping machinery (e.g., retroviruses and many DNA viruses), or cap-snatching (e.g., orthomyxoviruses), or virally encoding cap1-methyltransferases (e.g., poxviruses and rhabdoviruses) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Decroly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyde and Diamond, 2015</xref>). Even in the case of alphaviruses, which produce cap0-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee, 1980</xref>) and are therefore predicted to be susceptible to IFIT1B-mediated inhibition, secondary structure changes at the 5' end of alphaviral mRNAs can blunt IFIT1B antiviral action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hyde et al., 2014</xref>). Given all of these viral counter-strategies, it might appear that IFIT1B is on the losing side of the arms race between host and most viruses. These counter-strategies may partially explain why we find that <italic>IFIT1B</italic> has been deleted or pseudogenized at least seven separate times in mammalian evolution. Even in humans, which encode a full-length <italic>IFIT1B</italic> ORF, IFIT1B activity appears to have been lost both due to lack of interferon-inducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fensterl and Sen, 2011</xref>) as well as loss of protein function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>).</p><p>Humans and most other mammalian species (excluding rodents) do, however, have an intact member of the <italic>IFIT1</italic> gene family. IFIT1 mechanism and antiviral specificity have been enigmatic in part due to incorrect comparisons with mouse IFIT1B. By experimentally separating the functions of IFIT1 and IFIT1B from the rest of the innate immune system, we now show that IFIT1 has evolved a molecular specificity that differs from IFIT1B and is not blocked by cap1-methyltransferase. For example, using a yeast genetic assay, we show that IFIT1, unlike IFIT1B, potently inhibits yeast growth independent of whether human cap1-methyltransferase is co-expressed. Moreover, IFIT1, but not IFIT1B, inhibits replication of VSV, a virus encoding a cap1-methyltransferase. These results establish that these two paralogous immunity factors have distinct molecular function and highlight a significant role for IFIT1 in specific antiviral defense that is distinct from IFIT1B.</p><p>Our study does not elucidate the molecular means by which human IFIT1 inhibits viral replication. While several possibilities exist for how IFIT1-mediated translational repression might be controlled, we favor the possibility that IFIT1, like its paralog IFIT1B, distinguishes a 'self versus non-self' pattern on mRNA to selectively inhibit viral replication. Supporting this model is the fact that in addition to IFIT1B, IFIT2 and IFIT5 have been reported to have sequence- or structure-specific binding to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Habjan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katibah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that numerous IFITs may restrict viral replication through recognition of distinct viral RNA patterns. Although the presumed molecular pattern that IFIT1 recognizes remains unknown, our data suggest that mammalian hosts, as well as vaccinia virus, possess a 'self' molecular pattern to prevent IFIT1-mediated inhibition whereas yeast and VSV display a 'non-self' molecular pattern that cannot block IFIT1 action. One previous proposal suggested that human IFIT1 antiviral activity resulted from direct binding and sequestration of 5' triphosphate ends of viral replication intermediates, thus interfering with replication rather than directly inhibiting translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pichlmair et al., 2011</xref>). We instead favor a model in which IFIT1 recognizes a distinct 'self versus non-self' pattern to inhibit mRNA translation directly, similar to IFIT1B. Biochemical data suggests that IFIT1, like IFIT1B, binds to cap-proximal RNA and prevents binding of mRNAs by the translation initiation factor eIF4F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, human IFIT1 was shown to not just inhibit replication of PIV5, but to inhibit translation of PIV5 2'O-methylated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrejeva et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, our observation that IFIT1 expression also inhibits yeast growth suggests that it is not a viral replication intermediate, but rather a 'non-self' pattern, which is recognized by IFIT1, similar to the lack of mRNA 2'O-methylation for IFIT1B. While the methylation state of the first transcribed nucleotide (cap0-structure versus cap1-structure) is not the determinant of IFIT1 specificity, other chemical modifications near the cap, or mRNA sequence determinants, may allow IFIT1 to distinguish 'self' from 'non-self' to selectivity inhibit viral replication.</p><p>Although gene conversion and gene turnover initially confounded <italic>IFIT</italic> phylogenetic analysis, it may now present a significant opportunity to understand the biochemical basis of the different antiviral specificities of IFIT1 and IFIT1B. For instance, two cat IFIT proteins, which are practically identical in their N-terminal two-thirds, but divergent in their C-terminus, fully recapitulate the expected properties of IFIT1 and IFIT1B in our yeast assay. Use of other such ‘natural’ chimeras can help guide the biochemical dissection of what provides IFIT1B with its unique cap0-mRNA recognition properties and provide insight into how IFIT1 has evolved its distinct specificity. The naturally occurring recombination breakpoint in the IFIT1/1B gene conversion tracts also suggests features of IFITs that are critical for a common aspect of IFIT1/1B activity versus those that promote their distinct molecular specificity. In the structures of IFIT5 bound to the 5' triphosphate containing end of RNA, three 'subdomains' surround the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2013</xref>). The recombination breakpoint we observed falls within the 'pivot' region separating the second and third subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting the first two subdomains may be important for a common conserved function of IFIT1 and IFIT1B whereas the third subdomain might confer changes to the molecular specificity. We also note that the breakpoint occurs just outside of the homooligomerization domain in the structure of IFIT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). As some IFITs are thought to oligomerize for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Habjan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pichlmair et al., 2011</xref>), the homogenization of the region corresponding to the oligomerization domain in IFIT2 suggests that IFIT1 and IFIT1B might also need to hetero-oligomerize in species in which both are present.</p><p>Based on our new understanding of the divergent functions of IFIT1 and IFIT1B, we hypothesize that duplication or loss of different <italic>IFIT</italic> genes might directly influence the ability of a particular host species to defend against specific viral pathogens. For instance, the duplication of <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes in rodents might have been driven by pressure from alphaviruses or other undiscovered cap0-mRNA expressing viruses, and may augment the defenses of rodent hosts against such viruses. In contrast, the loss of <italic>IFIT1</italic> in many rodents might leave them more susceptible to infection by viruses inhibited by IFIT1, such as VSV. Similarly, loss of IFIT1B function in a broad range of species, including humans, may result in greater ability of cap0-mRNA expressing viruses to replicate in those species. In that regard, rodents may be better prepared than humans, chimpanzees, New World monkeys and several other species to defend against cap0-mRNA expressing viruses such as alphaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, <italic>IFIT</italic> gene duplication may be the host's response to the evolutionary arms race where viruses are continually masking their RNAs with 'self' features. On the other hand, when the selective pressure from viruses displaying a given 'non-self' feature (e.g. Cap0-mRNAs) has been relaxed, the specific <italic>IFIT</italic> gene that restricts those viruses may be pseudogenized or lost permanently. Although compensatory mechanisms may have evolved that mitigate the consequences of loss of a single IFIT, our results indicate that lineage-specific loss of <italic>IFIT</italic> genes eliminates an elegant means to discriminate ‘self versus non-self’ RNAs from the host's armament. We predict that the dynamic evolution of IFIT genes across mammals will have important consequences for species-specific antiviral immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Phylogenetic analyses</title><p>Mammalian <italic>IFIT</italic> genes were identified in genomes of the indicated species using human IFIT protein sequences to query the non-redundant (nr) database using tBLASTn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> for accession numbers).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom, Wesley Sundquist, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>The authors describe the evolutionary history of the IFIT genes, and convincingly demonstrate that they fall into two separate families, IFIT1 and IFIT1B. Their analyses reveal that the two protein families recognize different features on mRNAs, with IFIT1B proteins recognizing mRNAs that lack 2'O-methylation at their 5' caps. The analyses also: 1) sort out the true relationships between murine and human <italic>IFIT1</italic> genes, demonstrating that human <italic>IFIT1</italic> and murine <italic>IFIT1B</italic> (new names) are paralogs, not orthologs, 2) demonstrate that the C-terminal domains define the IFIT1- vs. IFIT1B-type target specificity, and 3) a number of different primate lineages have lost either <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT1B</italic> genes, or undergone <italic>IFIT/IFIT1B</italic> gene conversion/recombination events.</p><p>Overall, this paper is very clearly written, the experimental and computational analyses are convincing, a clever new yeast assay for restriction activity is presented (as are complementary viral restriction data), and the field has been clarified.

Instead we now state that “However, the general antiviral effectiveness of IFIT1B proteins is limited due to the fact that every mammalian virus family, except alphaviruses, has evolved a way to produce cap1-mRNAs.”</p><p> <italic>In Discussion, the authors clearly prefer a model in which IFIT1-like proteins discriminate &quot;self from non-self&quot; (I might prefer &quot;viral&quot; from &quot;cellular&quot;), but they could use a clearer outline of the arguments for their preference over a model in which it is simply a tightly regulated but otherwise global repressor of translation? – for example, via a combination of IFN induction and active repression, a second messenger, synergy with other IFIT proteins, or some other mechanism not present in yeast, IFIT1 may act globally under conditions when a cell has been breeched by a virus. Can this be ruled out, or at least can arguments be made that this is less likely?</italic> </p><p>Although in this instance the reviewer is correct that “self vs non-self” is similar to “host vs viral” this is how the discrimination is referred to in the field in general. However, we now lay out a clear rationale for why we parsimoniously favor the model that IFIT1 recognizes a novel mRNA pattern to inhibit translation: “Our study does not elucidate the molecular means by which human IFIT1 inhibits viral replication. While several possibilities exist for how IFIT1-mediated translational repression might be controlled, we favor the possibility that IFIT1, like its paralog IFIT1B, distinguishes a 'self versus non-self' pattern on mRNA to selectively inhibit viral replication. Supporting this model is the fact that in addition to IFIT1B, IFIT2 and IFIT5 have been reported to have sequence- or structure-specific binding to RNA (Habjan et al., 2013; Katibah et al., 2013; Katibah et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2012), suggesting that numerous IFITs may restrict viral replication through recognition of distinct viral RNA patterns. Although the presumed molecular pattern that IFIT1 recognizes remains unknown, our data suggest that mammalian hosts, as well as vaccinia virus, possess a 'self' molecular pattern to prevent IFIT1-mediated inhibition whereas yeast and VSV display a 'non-self' molecular pattern that cannot block IFIT action.”</p><p><italic>The study of how large gene families evolve is not new, and the authors should make sure to cite some of the prior work in this vein.
