they were exposed to during their development in the thymus, a phenomenon known as positive selection. The structural basis for positive selection has long been debated. Here, using mice expressing one of two different T cell receptor β chains and various MHC alleles, we show that positive selection-induced MHC bias of T cell receptors is affected both by the germline encoded elements of the T cell receptor α and β chain and, surprisingly, dramatically affected by the non germ line encoded portions of CDR3 of the T cell receptor α chain. Thus, in addition to determining specificity for antigen, the non germline encoded elements of T cell receptors may help the proteins cope with the extremely polymorphic nature of major histocompatibility complex products within the species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T cell receptor</kwd><kwd>major histocompatibility complex</kwd><kwd>CDR3 alpha</kwd><kwd>thymus</kwd><kwd>selection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI 18785</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marrack</surname><given-names>Philippa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI 092108</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gapin</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI 103736</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gapin</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kappler</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK099317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakayama</surname><given-names>Maki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The alleles of the major histocompatibility complex present in an individual affect the sequences, including, surprisingly, the nongerm line encoded amino acids, of the receptors on T cells that allow recognition of antigens.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many T lymphocytes in the body express clonally distributed T cell antigen receptors composed of alpha and beta chains (TCRs) that react with peptides derived from pathogens and other foreign materials bound in a groove on the surface of host major histocompatibility proteins (MHCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babbitt et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haskins et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Meuer et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shimonkevitz et al., 1983</xref>). The genes encoding these MHC proteins are the most polymorphic genes in a given species. Most of the polymorphisms tend to be concentrated within the residues that line the peptide-binding groove of the molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bjorkman et al., 1987</xref>). Hence, in general, different MHC alleles within a species preferentially bind, and present to TCRs, different peptides from any given invading organism. Thus the pathogen is unlikely to mutate such that none of its peptides bind to any of the MHC proteins expressed within the target species and the immune responses of at least some individuals within the infected species will be able to deal with the invading pathogen.</p><p>Many years ago another consequence of MHC polymorphisms was recognized. The allelic variants of MHC expressed in one individual are very frequently recognized by 1% or more of the T cells of other individuals expressing different MHC alleles, a phenomenon called ‘alloreactivity’. While differences in bound peptides play an important role in alloreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hunt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crumpacker et al., 1992</xref>), structural studies show that some of the allelic variations in MHC proteins themselves interact with the TCRs of alloreactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grandea and Bevan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archbold et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colf et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Experiments have shown that T cells in one individual are more likely to react with foreign peptides bound to the grooves of self MHC than to foreign peptides bound to foreign MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fink and Bevan, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zinkernagel et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kappler and Marrack, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sprent, 1978</xref>). This phenomenon, known to be the consequence of thymic positive selection, is caused by the fact that thymocytes are allowed to develop into mature T cells only if the TCR they bear reacts with low affinity/avidity with MHC proteins bound to self peptides in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sprent et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashton-Rickardt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sebzda et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hogquist et al., 1994</xref>). Paradoxically, in an apoptotic process termed ‘negative selection’, the thymus generally weeds out T cell progenitors that react with too high affinity/avidity with self MHC plus self peptide, thus preventing the maturation of many potentially self reactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kappler et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">von Boehmer et al., 1989</xref>). Thus the collection of TCRs on mature T cells in any individual bears the footprint of positive selection, reacting almost undetectably with self MHC bound to self peptide and being more likely to react with foreign peptides bound to alleles of MHC to which they were exposed in the thymus than to peptides bound to unfamiliar MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fink and Bevan, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zinkernagel et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kappler and Marrack, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sprent, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hünig and Bevan, 1981</xref>).</p><p>The simplest explanation for the effects of positive selection on the reactivity of mature T cells is that the phenomenon involves interactions between TCRs and allele-specific amino acids of MHC in the thymus. However, since different MHC alleles will bind different self peptides, positive selection may instead or, in addition, depend on interactions between TCRs and the MHC-bound self peptides. These ideas make different predictions about the portions of TCRs contributing to positive selection.</p><p>Mutational and structural studies have shown that the alpha and beta chains that comprise TCRs each usually engage MHC + peptide via three complementary determining loops (CDRs 1,2 and 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garcia et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reinherz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dai et al., 2008</xref>). For both the TCR alpha and beta chains, two of these loops, CDR1 and CDR2, are encoded by the germ line <italic>Trav</italic> (for the TCRα chain) and <italic>Trbv</italic> (for the TCRβ chain) genes. The third, CDR3, loop for each chain, on the other hand, is produced during TCR gene rearrangement as the cells develop in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis, 1985</xref>). Thus, the sequence coding for CDR3α, for example, is created when one of many <italic>Trav</italic> gene segments rearranges to fuse with one of the many <italic>Traj</italic> gene segments with the total number of possible CDR3α sequences increased by removal and/or addition of bases at the joining points of <italic>Trav</italic> and <italic>Traj</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gellert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cabaniols et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moshous et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). This process creates the DNA coding for the entire Vα domain. The stretch of DNA coding for CDR3β is constructed along the same lines, by joining of one of a number of <italic>Trbv</italic>, <italic>Trbd</italic> and <italic>Trbj</italic> gene segments, again with bases removed or introduced at the joining points to form the CDR3 loop of the complete Vβ domain.</p><p>The fact that the TCR CDR1 and CDR2 loops are germline encoded and therefore relatively fixed, whereas the TCR CDR3 loops are at least partially somatically generated and therefore very variable led investigators to suggest that the CDR1 and CDR2 loops would contact germline encoded MHC whereas the CDR3 loops would contact the extremely variable and unpredictable foreign peptide. Indeed evidence that the CDR3 loops contact peptide rapidly appeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Danska et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kelly et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wither et al., 1991</xref>). Other studies investigated the orientation of the TCR on MHC and suggested that the TCR might always lie approximately perpendicularly on MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jorgensen et al., 1992</xref>) and that TCR/MHC interactions would always have the same orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sant'Angelo et al., 1996</xref>). However, when crystallographically solved structures of TCRs on MHC became available it was soon apparent that TCRs are usually oriented diagonally on the MHC, but the angle of their interaction varies quite considerably from one structure to another. Moreover, the solved structures also showed that the predictions about contact points between CDR loops and MHC and peptide are by no means absolute. Although the TCR CDR3 regions are often focused on the peptide, amino acids in these regions sometimes also contact MHC and, vice versa, CDR1 and CDR2 amino acids sometimes contact peptide in addition to their predicted interactions with MHC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garboczi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garcia et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hennecke and Wiley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Meuer et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rudolph et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>These results bear on our understanding of positive selection in the thymus. Were positive selection to depend only on TCR/MHC interactions, and CDR1 and CDR2 to react only with MHC amino acids, one might predict that positive selection selects TCRs that react well with peptides bound to self rather than foreign MHC by picking out TCRs bearing TRAVs and TRBVs that react favorably with self MHC. Indeed there is evidence that this is the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pircher et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Merkenschlager et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sim et al., 1996</xref>). Conversely, if positive selection were to depend only on TCR/self peptide interactions, as suggested by some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ignatowicz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tourne et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nikolić-Zugić and Bevan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hogquist et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashton-Rickardt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wong and Rudensky, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barton et al., 2002</xref>), and CDR3 loops to react only with the MHC-bound peptide, then CDR3 regions might be the determining factor. However, as discussed above, amino acids in CDR1s and CDR2s sometimes react with the presented peptide and CDR3 amino acids can interact with MHC. Understanding of this issue is complicated by the cooperative nature of TCR interactions with its ligands, by which an interaction at one site on the TCR/MHC/peptide surface adjusts interactions elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mazza et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2016</xref>) and a study that indicated that the entire sequence of the TCRα chain, including the TRAV, TRAJ and CDR3α, is involved in positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Merkenschlager et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>We set out to resolve these issues. We analyzed the TCRα repertoires of naïve CD4 T cells in mice that each expressed one of two TCRβ chains, DOβWT or DOβ48A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Scott-Browne et al., 2009</xref>), and a single MHCII protein, IA, of alleles b, f or s (for simplicity and ease of reading we will use IA to describe what are often termed I-A proteins, and we will not use superscripts to denote MHC and IA alleles). As predicted by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pircher et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Merkenschlager et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sim et al., 1996</xref>), the frequency with which mature T cells used different TRAVs was indeed affected to some extent by the MHCII allele on which they were positively selected and by the coexpressed TCRβ. Likewise the TRAJs used were affected by the selecting MHCII allele and coexpressed TCRβ, but demonstrated unexpected biases towards use of the TRAJs that were furthest from the TRAV locus.</p><p>Most surprisingly, however, the CDR3α sequences differed markedly depending on the MHCII allele and partner TCRβ in the mouse. This was true even if we compared, between MHC alleles, the TCRα sequences constructed from rearrangements involving the same TRAVs and TRAJs, indicating that the non germ line encoded portions of CDR3αare involved in MHCII allele specific selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The generation and properties of mice expressing a single TCR beta chain</title><p>The impact of positive selection on the TCR repertoire of mature T cells cannot be understood by sequencing only the expressed <italic>Tcra</italic> or <italic>Tcrb</italic> chain genes. This is because others and we have found a fairly high percentage of individual TCRα or TCRβ sequences are expressed in animals regardless of their MHC haplotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Robins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Warren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Presumably this is at least in part possible because each individual chain is paired with a different partner(s) in animals with different MHC alleles. Therefore, the pairs of TCR chains expressed in individual T cells must be known in order to understand the impact of thymus selection on the TCR repertoire of mature T cells.</p><p>The T cells in any given mouse or human have been reported to bear, collectively, more than 10<sup>5</sup> different TCRαand about the same number of different TCRβ chain sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Venturi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Thus the T cells might bear up to 10<sup>10</sup> different combinations of these chains. Although methods for sequencing and accurately pairing the TCRα and TCRβ (or immunoglobulin heavy and light chain) RNAs from many individual T (or B) cells have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeKosky et al., 2013</xref>), in our experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Munson et al., 2016</xref>) these are still not able to cope with the large numbers of individual chains and combinations we expect in normal animals. Therefore we decided to limit our analyses to the T cells in animals that expressed a single TCRβ and any possible TCRα. This choice has two advantages. It allowed accurate knowledge of the TCRβ on the T cells and, because it was expected that only a limited number of TCRα chains can be positively selected with a single TCRβ, it limited the numbers of different TCRαsequences we expected to find in the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Merkenschlager et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fukui et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hsieh et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We chose two TCRβ chains for these experiments. These were the TCRβ originally isolated from a T cell hybridoma constructed from BALB/c T cells specific for IA<sup>d</sup> or IA<sup>b</sup> bound to a peptide from chicken ovalbumin, the DOβWT TCRβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">White et al., 1983</xref>) and the same TCRβ with a mutation in its TRBV region such that the tyrosine at position 48 was changed to an alanine, DOβ48A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Scott-Browne et al., 2009</xref>). This mutation reduces the ability of the TCRβ chain to react with the alpha chain alpha helix of MHCII and with the alpha1 alpha helix of MHCI. The chain was chosen for our analyses because we thought that the TCRα sequences that could successfully overcome the deficits in MHC recognition by the TCRβ chain might more clearly illustrate the properties of the TCRα needed for successful positive selection.</p><p>The goal of these studies was to find out how the allele of MHC involved in thymic selection affects the sequences of the TCRs on the selected T cells. To achieve this we studied TCRs on naïve CD4 T cells that had been selected in some of the readily available mice that expressed a single MHCII protein, IAb, IAf and IAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mathis et al., 1983</xref>). Transgenic mice that expressed either DOβWT or DOβ48A and no other TCRβ were crossed such that they each expressed one of these MHCII alleles. The numbers of mature CD4 and CD8 T cells in the thymuses of the H2 b, f or s strains of mice were measured. As predicted by our previous data using retrogenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Scott-Browne et al., 2009</xref>), the numbers of mature CD4 or CD8 thymocytes in mice expressing DOβ48A were much lower than those in mice expressing DOβWT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). This was true regardless of the MHC allele on which the cells were selected. Thus the TCRβ 48A for 48Y substitution affects MHC interactions regardless of the MHC class or allele, as we have previously predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Scott-Browne et al., 2009</xref>). The difference in numbers of mature T cells between mice expressing DOβWT and DOβ48A was less marked in peripheral lymph nodes than in the thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), probably because of increased homeostatic expansion, as exemplified by the increased percentages of CD44hi T cells amongst those few that could mature in DOβ48A mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30918.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CD4 selection in mice expressing single TCRβ chains and different MHC alleles.</title><p>Cells were isolated from the thymuses and lymph nodes of mice expressing a singl;e TCRβ, DOβWT or DOβ48A, and different MHC haplotypes and stained for expression of CD4 and CD8 and CD44.

The phenomenon may be due to the fact that DOβWT was found in a TCR that reacts with IAd or IAb plus a foreign peptide (OVA 327–339) and not from an MHCI-reactive TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">White et al., 1983</xref>).

However, the potential inadequacies of DOβ48A allowed us to test whether or not the TCRαs that, on mature T cells, paired with it did indeed react preferentially with the MHCII allele on which they were positively selected. We guessed that introduction of the more prominently MHC-reactive DOβWT chain into DOβ48A T cells might reveal the underlying reactivity of the TCRα sequences in these T cells for various MHC alleles. Thus we isolated CD4 T cells from mice expressing the DOβ48A transgene, stimulated them with anti-TCR, transduced them with a GFP+ retrovirus expressing the DOβWT chain, and tested the ability of the transductants to react with cells expressing different alleles of MHC. CD69 expression was used as a marker of activation. Non transduced (GFP-) cells in the same cultures were used as controls. In no case did the nontransduced cells show a significant response. However, some of the DOβWT transduced cells responded. Notably, the percentage of the transduced cells that responded to challenge was always greatest if the antigen presenting cells expressed the MHC allele on which the T cells were positively selected <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). For example, T cells from a DOβ48A H2b mouse, after transduction to express DOβWT, were most likely to react with H2b presenting cells and DOβWT transduced cells from DOβ48A H2s mice reacted only with challenge cells expressing H2s. These experiments show that the TCRα chain that pairs with the transgenic DOβ48A does indeed contribute to the preference of CD4 T cells to react with peptides bound to the MHCII allele involved in positive selection.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30918.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TCRα contributes to the MHCII allele bias of selected naïve CD4 T cells.</title><p>Naïve CD4 T cells were isolated from the lymph nodes of DOβ48A H2b, f or s mice and incubated for 2 days in wells coated with anti-TCRβ and anti-CD28.

PCR and sequencing errors in the germ line encoded portions of these sequences were corrected as described in the Materials and methods section. To deal with possible sequencing errors in the non germ line encoded portions of CDR3α, sequences that occurred only once in any given sequencing run were eliminated from further analysis. In fact this decision affected the conclusions of all the experiments show below only slightly. Conclusions from analyses that included all sequences, or that eliminated sequences that occurred with the lowest 5% frequency in each sample were similar (data not shown).</p><p>Others have previously reported that the T cells in mice expressing a single TCRβ chain have a limited repertoire of TCRα chains by comparison with WT animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fukui et al., 1998</xref>). To find out whether this applied to CD4 T cells expressing the DOβWT or DOβ48A TCRβ we constructed species accumulation curves for TCRα sequences in B6 and the TCRβ transgenic animals. These were performed by combining the TCRα sequences from all mice of the same genotype or by plotting the TCRα sequences for individual mice of each genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, the source data for these and all subsequent figures are at GEO accession GSE105129). Species accumulation curves show that the total number of TCRα sequences we could detect on naïve CD4 T cells in the TCRβ transgenic animals ranged from less than 5000 to a maximum of about 30,000. These numbers are less than those found in CD4 naïve T cells from B6 mice, which we found to be similar in number to those found on mouse CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Genolet et al., 2012</xref>), &gt;than 10<sup>5</sup> in number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The numbers of TCRα sequences that could partner with DOβWT in selection of CD4 T cells varied considerably with the selecting MHCII allele. More than four times more TCRα sequences were apparent in mice expressing IAb versus IAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>), perhaps because the TCR from which DOβWT is derived can be selected by IAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 1996</xref>). This effect of MHC allele on the numbers of selected TCRα chains was not evident in animals expressing DOβ48A. Notably, the numbers of different TCRα chains associated with DOβ48A was lower than those associated with DOβWT regardless of the MHCII allele involved, possibly because of the extra demands imposed on TCRα chains by the inadequate TCRβ chain lacking an important MHC contact residue, Y48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Scott-Browne et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30918.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Expression of a single TCRβ chain, DOβWT and, even more markedly, DOβ48A, reduces the number of different TCRα chains that can be positively selected, regardless of the selecting MHCII allele.</title><p>Naïve CD4 T cells were isolated from the spleens (B6) or lymph nodes of mice expressing MHC b, f or s, single TCRβ chains and heterozygous for expression of functional TCRα chains.

Data of this type can be compared in several ways. The data can be analyzed to find out whether a particular TRAV/TRAJ/CDR3 sequence occurs in each sample, regardless of how often it appears in the set (comparison of unique sequence use). In this case, Jaccard similarity coefficients can be used to measure the similarity between samples. On the other hand, use of particular TRAV/TRAJ/CDR3 sequences can be compared taking into account the number of times a particular combination occurs. In this case Anne Chao Jaccard abundance based indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chao et al., 2012</xref>) are an appropriate statistical tool. Both methods were used in the comparisons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Jaccard analyses showed that the same combination of TRAV/TRAJ/CDR3 sequences were likely to appear in samples from mice of the same TCRβ and MHC genotype but were very unlikely to be shared with the T cells from mice expressing a different MHC allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This was just as apparent when the abundance with which the sequences were expressed was taken into account (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus these data show that, given a single TCRβ, the TCRα sequences that can participate in positive selection are dramatically affected by the selecting MHCII allele. Moreover, the fact that the values of the Anne Chao Jaccard analyses for mice of the same MHCII allele are much larger than those of the Jaccard analyses shows that sequences that appear frequently in one mouse of a given genotype are more likely to be found in other mice of the same type. Such a result is a manifestation of the fact that some sequences were repeated many times in all mice of a given MHCII type, whereas other sequences were rare. This uneven and certainly non-Poissonian distribution of TCR sequences has been observed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Correia-Neves et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fazilleau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freeman et al., 2009</xref>).

TRAVs whose genes are most proximal to the TRAJ locus (TRAVs 17–21) were frequently rearranged, as predicted by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Villey et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shih et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Genolet et al., 2012</xref>) (note that the TRAVs are arranged by family and not by position in the TRAV locus).

In the cases of the TRAV families the frequently rearranged TRAVs were not always those which are most proximal to the TRAJ locus. For example, amongst the TRAV7 family, the most frequently rearranged member was TRAV7-2D, one of the family members that is furthest from the TRAJ locus, whereas the close relative of TRAV7-2D, TRAV7-2A, was not frequently rearranged.

Differential use of TRAVs was much more marked in DOβ48A mice and illustrated the TRAV preferences of mice selected on different MHCII alleles more strikingly. For example, DOβWT cells selected on IAs used most members of the TRAV6 family whereas DOβ48A expressing cells selected on the same MHC allele used, of the TRAV 6 family, almost entirely TRAV6-5D and TRAV6-7DN and also used more frequently than T cells selected on other MHCII alleles, members of the TRAV16 family. Perhaps this reflects a greater need for basic amino acids in TRAV CDR1 and CDR2 for selection of H2s with DOβ48A as a partner, since, of the TRAV6 family, TRAVs6-5D and TRAV6-7DN (and TRAV6-5A and TRAV6-7DN) have a total of two basic amino acids in these elements whereas other members of the family have none. Likewise all expressed members of the TRAV16 family contain 2 or 3 basic amino acids in their CDR1 and CDR2 segments. This narrowing in TRAV choice by DOβ48A cells may reflect the increasing demands for selection imposed by the absence of the tyrosine at position 48 of the TCRβ chain.</p><p>Our analyses are based on a method in which cDNAs from individual mouse T cells are amplified simultaneously with a reverse TRAC oligo and oligos built to match each TRAV family (see Materials and methods Section). Therefore the differences in TRAV discovery could be due to more efficient PCR amplification of some TRAV genes than others. However, since the efficiencies of detection will be similar between members of the same family, it is legitimate to compare the frequency of rearrangement between different members of the same family, or the frequency of use of the same TRAV in mature T cells selected on different MHCs or with different TCRβ partners (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>TRAJ usage depends on the selecting MHCII haplotype and the partner TCRβ chain</title><p>TRAJ use by preselection thymocytes was similar regardless of the selecting MHC haplotype or co-expressed TCRβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). TRAJ use by naïve CD4 T cells from B6 mice was fairly uniform across the locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, and in contrast to preselection thymocytes and naïve CD4 T cells from B6 mice, TRAJ use by T cells from mice expressing a single TCRβ was much more uneven and tended towards TRAJs whose genes were distal to the TRAV locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–L</xref>). Regardless of MHC allele, CD4 T cells in DOβWT animals used TRAJ21 most frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). The reasons for this bias are unknown. TRAJ21 contains a tyrosine at or near the contact point with MHC but other TRAJs have a tyrosine similarly situated and they are not overexpressed. Moreover TRAJ21 is not overexpressed in T cells expressing DOβ48A, T cells that might be expected to be even more readily selected with an added tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Scott-Browne et al., 2009</xref>). The bias towards use of distal TRAJ genes was even more marked in animals expressing DOβ48A.

In another study with a fixed TCRβ chain, a bias towards proximal TRAJs was noted with TRAV17, a TRAV that is close to the TRAJ locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casanova et al., 1991</xref>). The same publication described biases, depending on MHC allele towards use of Type 1 (G rich) or type 2 TRAJs. These explanations don’t apply here, since in the experiments presented here TRAV expression was not particularly biased towards the distal TRAVs and the used TRAJs don’t fall particularly into Types 1 or 2. It is possible that the choice is related to the DOβ chain itself. Alternatively it maybe that, because it is difficult for thymocytes expressing a single TCRβ to find a TCRα that can pair with the TCRβ and contribute to positive selection, multiple TCRα rearrangements have to occur in each thymocyte before a suitable TCRα partner is found. This will inevitably drive expressed TCRαs towards use of the distal TRAJs, although why these should satisfy the demands of positive selection more frequently than the proximal TRAJs do, is not obvious, at least from their amino acid sequences. It has recently been reported that prolonged expression of RAG protects cells, to some extent, from death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Karo et al., 2014</xref>). If the thymocytes in TCRβ transgenic mice have to express RAG for a longer time to find a suitable TCRα partner, then the prolonged expression of RAG needed for the multiple rearrangements required to access the TRAC proximal TRAJs might preferentially allow survival of the thymocytes in which this prolonged expression has occurred. Preliminary analyses of the naïve CD4 T cells in the various mice did not, however, suggest that the T cells in the TCRβ transgenic mice were more resistant to death than the equivalent cells in B6 animals. Finally, it is possible that, during the multiple rearrangements that may occur as TRAJ use moves to those at the distal portion of the TRAJ locus, in thymocytes the strength of signal received from the TCR/MHC/peptide interaction needed to drive positive selection might be reduced. Thus selection may occur more easily for thymocytes using distal rather than proximal TRAJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Seiler et al., 2012</xref>).

The observations in the paper applied to CD4+ CD8+ (double positive thymocytes) that had been positively, but not negatively, selected, identified by their expression of CD69, and to regulatory T cells compared to preselection thymocytes. Such cells have not been examined in the experiments described here, so we cannot tell directly whether a similar observation applies to TCRα sequences. On the whole the evidence is that cells with aromatic amino acids at positions 6 and 7 on CDR3α are not particularly eliminated by clonal deletion in the thymus (data not shown). Nevertheless, we evaluated individual amino acids that would probably be at the tips of CDR3αs in CDR3α of different lengths. The results show MHCII allele and TCRβ specific selection for particular amino acids and also changes in amino acid preference at CDR3α positions depending on the length of the CDR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). For example, arginine was very frequently used at position 4 in 12 amino acid long CDR3αs selected by IAs with DOβ48A, and similarly over selected at position 5 in 14 amino acid long CDR3αs selected on IAf with DOβWT, but much less frequently used by other MHC selection, TCRβ, CDR3α length combinations.

This phenomenon, known as positive selection, has been ascribed to a requirement for a low affinity/avidity reaction between the developing thymocyte and MHC proteins to which the cell is exposed in the thymus cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sprent et al., 1988</xref>). However, the peptides presented to immature T cells in the thymus are also controlled by the allele of MHC involved. Thus, the MHC allele specificity of positive selection might be dictated by TCR contact with the MHC-engaged peptides rather than the MHC protein itself. If this were the case, positive selection might be dominated by the portion of TCRs that most consistently engages the peptides bound to MHC, CDR3 sequences of TCRs, rather than the germ line encoded TRAVs and TRBVs. This idea is supported by the fact that, in some cases, peptides related to the activating antigen can stimulate positive selection of thymocytes bearing particular TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashton-Rickardt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sebzda et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hogquist et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kraj et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smyth et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover MHC proteins that were supposed to differ only in amino acids that bind peptide and that don’t contact TCRs nevertheless were found to differ in their ability to select thymocytes bearing certain TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nikolić-Zugić and Bevan, 1990</xref>).</p><p>During positive selection could TCRs detect allelic differences between MHCs directly? Although that MHC amino acids that contact TCRs are quite well conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bjorkman et al., 1987</xref>) they do vary somewhat between alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Reche and Reinherz, 2003</xref>). For the MHCII alleles studied here, the amino acids pointing towards the TCR are, at most positions, uniform, but IA<sup>b</sup> differs from IA<sup>f</sup> and IA<sup>s</sup> with a two amino acid insertion on the surface of its beta chain alpha helix, an insertion that causes an allele specific bulge in this helix. IA<sup>s</sup> also differs from the other MHCII alleles we studied with alpha chain H68Y and beta chain R70Q changes and position 72 of the MHCIIα alpha helix is a V in IA<sup>b</sup>, an I in IA<sup>f</sup> and IA<sup>s</sup>. Therefore the solvent exposed residues on the alpha helices of the MHCII proteins themselves could contribute to allele specific positive selection. These amino acids are contact points, not only for the CDR1 and CDR2 loops of TCRs, but also, sometimes for the TCR CDR3 regions. For example, in the structure on a TCR bound to the complex of IA<sup>u</sup> bound to a myelin basic protein, CDR3α engages polymorphic amino acids at positions 55 and 81 of the IA<sup>u</sup> alpha chain and CDR3β engages polymorphic amino acids at positions 65 of the IA<sup>u</sup> alpha chain and positions 67 and 70 of the IA<sup>u</sup> beta chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maynard et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The findings presented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Merkenschlager et al., 1994</xref>) and here, demonstrate that the allele of MHCII involved in positive selection affects the frequencies with which TRAV and TRAJ elements are selected and, most dramatically, the CDR3α sequences that appear on mature T cells, as previously indicated for CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferreira et al., 2006</xref>). The N terminal portion of CDR3α is provided by the TRAV, so the effects of MHCII on TRAV choice by a particular TCRα could actually be due to demands placed on the CDR3α rather than on the TRAV itself. On the other hand, since the CDR3α sequence is affected in part by its co-expressed TRAV, the demands of positive selection could be entirely on the TRAV, not the CDR3α. We think it likely that all three of the TCRα CDRs can play a role in positive selection. However, clearly CDR3α is involved since the sequences in the center of this element vary depend on the selecting MHCII allele, even if the accompanying TRAV and TRAJ are the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the results strongly suggest that positive selection allele specificity involves recognition of both MHC and peptide (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vrisekoop et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, given the geometry with which TCRs engage their MHC/peptide ligands, it is difficult to imagine that this would not be the case.</p><p>The data here also show that the sequence of the TCRβ chain affects the TCRα and CDR3α that can participate in positive selection almost as much as the selecting MHC allele does. Not only does the TCRβ affect which TCRαs and which CDR3αs will be successful, it also determines how many different TCRαs can do the job since, regardless of the MHCII allele involved, fewer TCRαs can be selected with DOβ48A than with DOβWT. These results are similar to those observed earlier that showed that fewer CD4 T cells are selected in DOβ48A-expressing versus DOβWT-expressing mice. Together these suggest that DOβ lacking an important MHC contact amino acid, the ‘Y’ at position 48, places more stringent requirements on TCRα for successful thymus selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Scott-Browne et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the results show that the entire TCR sequence plays a role in positive selection. How can this be, given that selection is thought to occur during low affinity reactions? Naively one might have predicted that relatively few TCR-to-MHC/peptide interactions would be needed to reach the needed energy of interaction and these could be provided by just a portion of the TCR, not the entire molecule as suggested here. Some TCR configurations may interfere with contact with MHC/peptide or prevent the proper engagement of CD4 or CD8. Other TCR configurations may react too strongly with their ligand, leading to negative selection. This idea may apply to up to 70% of all TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ignatowicz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stritesky et al., 2013</xref>). Competition for selecting ligands may also play a role. Also to be bourne in mind is the fact that here we are observing the consequences of many TCR selection events, some TCRs may be selected based on their TRAVs, others via their TCRβs, with the observed results showing biases by both of these. Nevertheless the detrimental effects of an inappropriate CDR3α cannot be overcome by other elements of TCRα.</p><p>There are problems with the notion that the bound peptide is a determinant of MHC allele specific positive selection. Most notably, the fact that mature T cells, after selection on a single MHCII allele bound to a single peptide can respond to peptides that are unrelated in sequence to the selecting peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pawlowski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ignatowicz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nakano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ebert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lo et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, teleologically, the idea that the selecting peptides in the thymus are the only feature that governs T cell specificity doesn’t seem evolutionarily favorable. Such might limit the ability of T cells to respond to foreign peptides that are unrelated to those in the thymus. Nevertheless, self peptides might provide an advantage anyway, by supporting the survival of mature T cells and also, perhaps, T cell responses to unrelated peptides when the self and foreign peptides are presented on the same cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kirberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wülfing et al., 2002</xref>). However, MHC-bound peptides on thymus cortical epithelial cells are not necessarily the same as those on peripheral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Honey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Murata et al., 2007</xref>) so this advantage may not be available for all T cells. It has also been suggested that positive selection on self peptides, by selecting for TCRs that react with peptides that are similar to self, might protect hosts from infection by organisms that have mutated such that their proteins resemble self. If negative selection were the only criterion for thymocyte maturation, invading organisms might be able to avoid recognition by T cells. Positive selection on self prevents such evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Forsdyke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vrisekoop et al., 2014</xref>)</p><p>In the studies presented here, the total number of TCRαs that can be selected with a single TCRβ ranges between about 4600 and 30,000, depending on the selecting MHCII allele and partner TCRβ . Are these numbers surprisingly low or high? Based on the estimated numbers of TCRβs and TCRαs that appear in the periphery of an individual, it has previously been estimated that each TCRβ chain can be successfully selected with up to 25 different TCRαs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arstila et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casrouge et al., 2000</xref>). Yet here, and in previous studies, it appears that, for a single TCRβ, the number of possible TCRα partners is at least 3 orders of magnitude larger. How to account for this large disparity? Probably it is caused by competition for selection in the thymus, a phenomenon that has been previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Martins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Visan et al., 2006</xref>). In a wild type thymus, each of the immature thymocytes is competing with a huge number of others bearing disparate TCRβ and TCRα sequences. In the thymus of a mouse expressing a single TCRβ, the immature thymocytes bear the same large number of TCRαs, and now all those expressing an even approximately suitable TCRα have the opportunity to be positively selected. This idea may be related to the profound bias towards distal TRAJs reported here, and therefore a predicted increased time available for rearrangements for the thymocytes in single TCRβ transgenic animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>T cell receptor beta chain from <break/>the DO11.10 hybridoma <break/>(mus musculus musculus)</td><td>DObWT</td><td valign="top">Haskins, K., Kubo, R., White, J., Pigeon, M., <break/>Kappler, J. and Marrack, P.

Post-sequencing analysis was performed to identify the <italic>Trav</italic> and <italic>Traj</italic> genes for each sequence along with its corresponding CDR3. <italic>Trav</italic> family and subfamily members were assigned based on the IMGT designations with modifications based on our own analysis of expressed TRAV sequences in B6 mice. IMGT has identified two gene duplication events in the B6 <italic>Trav</italic> locus, the ‘original’ genes, most of which are closest to the TRAJ locus are designated by their family number and a number indicating their subfamily membership. Here, for ease of analysis, we have added the letter ‘A’ to their designation, eg TRAV01-1A. TRAV subfamily members in the IMGT designated duplicated ‘D’ and new ‘N’ genes we add the letters ‘D’ or ‘N’, eg TRAV07-6D or TRAV07-6N. In some cases the entire nucleotide sequences of subfamily members are identical and, therefore, indistinguishable by our analyses. In these cases the subfamily members are designated to include all possible source genes, eg TRAV06-3ADN or TRAV06-6AD.</p><p>Errors occur during sequencing reactions and accumulate as the numbers of sequences acquired increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolotin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). The sequences were all corrected for errors in the <italic>Trav</italic> and <italic>Traj</italic> elements, which do not somatically mutate. However, because the amino acids in and flanking the non germ line encoded portions of CDR3 regions could not be corrected, sequences with errors in these elements are bound to appear at some low frequency and cause a gradual rise in the species accumulation curves. To eliminate these misreads we decided to include in our analyses only those TCRαsequences that occurred more than once in each sample. To correct for sequencing errors within the CDR3, the sequences were modified by replacing erroneous nucleotides with the appropriate germline-encoded nucleotides whenever a discrepancy was observed. Such correction was possible only when a nucleotide difference could be resolved by aligning to the germline <italic>Trav</italic> and/or <italic>Traj</italic> genes. To avoid making inappropriate changes to the potentially non germline encoded portions of CDR3α, such corrections were applied only if the change from the germline sequence occurred more than three nucleotides before the predicted end of the <italic>Trav</italic> genes or more than three nucleotides after the predicted end of the <italic>Traj</italic> gene. Finally, the amino acid usage within the CDR3α was determined for each sequence to identify any patterns in the CDR3 regions in sequences belonging to T cells from one MHC haplotype versus another.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Arup Chakraborty (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nilabh Shastri (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>You reveal new insights into the mechanisms regulating positive selection of T-cell receptors (TCRs) by MHC class II molecules. You show that the bias in the specificity of TCRs for self-MHC expressed in the thymus results not only from germ-line encoded elements of the TCR α chain, but also from its somatically generated CDR3 region. The findings help explain the structural basis for positive selection of T cell receptors in the thymus that is known to be skewed by thousands of polymorphic MHC alleles.</p><p>A clever approach is used to analyze the structural features of the TCR compatible with positive selection, transgenic mice that express the β chain (DOβWT) of the TCR isolated from a T cell hybridoma specific for either the Ad or Ab MHC class II molecules presenting the same OVA-derived peptide. In these mice, due to allelic exclusion, all T cells express the same β TCR transgene, but the T cells are free to pair with any α TCR chain. They compare TCRs selected in these transgenic mice with another transgenic mouse produced using the same β TCR (DOβ48A) with a mutation (Y48A) known to reduce its ability to interact with MHC II molecules and thus serve as a control for MHC specific factors. These two transgenes were then bred onto mice expressing either Ab, Af or As MHC class II molecules. As expected, the TCRs of CD4 T cells selected by each of these MHC II alleles were distinct in their bias for the self-MHC molecule.</p><p>Large-scale careful and statistically-sound analysis of the TCR α chains was then carried out among the CD4 T cells in the various mice. To ensure that only a single α chain was expressed by the T cells mice were bred onto the TCR β-/- homozygous and TCR α +/- heterozygous backgrounds. Extensive analysis of TCRs expressed by pre-selected versus naïve CD4 T cells showed that the selection of TCR α chains was clearly dependent upon the MHC II allele expressed in the thymus. Furthermore, the selected α chains showed clear impact of both the germline (CDR1 and CDR2) as well as somatically generated CDR3 containing the V-J junctions.</p><p>This is a nicely written paper. You are commended for presenting a thoughtful commentary of your well-controlled and carefully executed experiments and an excellent discussion of relevant issues of the role of MHC versus peptide residues in the positive selection interactions with features of the TCR. Although this study, like others, cannot distinguish whether the observed changes are caused by unique features of the MHC or the peptide, it advances the field by providing a new perspective. The study's novelty and importance lie in the characterization of the impact of MHC alleles on thymic selection of PAIRS of TCRαβ chains, not just TCRα or TCRβ-so they are really characterizing the impact of MHC alleles on the antigen-binding TCR repertoire. The results are clearly presented (which is truly challenging for this dataset) and persuasively discussed. Overall, the results strongly support the notion that the presented self peptides govern the allele bias of positive selection.</p><p>One could ask what would be observed in F1 mice, but this is likely beyond what is feasible within the scope of this study. The manuscript as is presents an appropriate amount of work, and is very definitive. Appropriate quantitative tools are employed to characterize the repertoire. Controls are employed at multiple steps that ensure the quality of the sequencing data. Overall, we found very little lacking in this report and have only minor suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Please follow the following recommendations for revision:</p><p>1) Paragraph 1 should include citations to relevant literature.</p><p>2) Relevant to point 1 above, it would be informative to include a discussion of models for TCR recognition of MHC-peptide complexes. For example, when the first crystal structures of TCR-pMHC complexes were solved (note that Garboczi et al., 1996 should be cited along with Garcia et al., 1996), they revealed TCRs that were aligned diagonally across the pMHC such that the prevailing model at the time (CDRs 1 and 2 recognize the MHC helices and the more diverse CDR3s would recognize the bound peptide) had to be rethought. Subsequent structures showed variability in TCR orientation on MHC/peptide complexes, ranging from close to the perpendicular orientation predicted by the above-described model (predicting that CDR3alpha would interact only with the bound peptide) to the diagonal orientations in which CDR3alpha could interact with the MHC helices as well as the bound peptide (nicely reviewed in Hennecke and Wiley, 2001, Cell 104:1-4). Thus for a TCR that orients diagonally across a pMHC, it would not be surprising that changes in CDR3alpha could affect positive selection of TCRs.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> is difficult to understand. Perhaps the legend could explain more fully what exactly is plotted, and what results are meaningful (when points are skewed off the line).</p><p>4) We agree with the authors in their final point of the Discussion – that the strong bias for distal Js and the large number of paired V's does seem to suggest that the TCRβ is &quot;desperate&quot; in TCRβ transgenic mice. But distal Js are not any more likely to generate selectable CDR3s than proximal, I would imagine. So I wonder if the overall threshold of selection ends up being changed in TCRβ transgenic mice. Have the authors examined the level of Nur77GFP in CD4 T cells in mice on a non-Tg versus TCRβ transgenic background?</p><p>5) The TCR sequences should be deposited in appropriate databases.</p><p>6) Nomenclature: is it misleading to refer to the CDR3 loops as &quot;somatically generated&quot; given that at least some of the residues are germline encoded within the J (for Vα) and D plus J (for Vβ) gene segments?</p><p>7) The rigor and extent of statistical information is appropriate, although it could be argued that the data are better visualized using error bars that indicate standard deviation, rather than standard error of the mean.

We have added the Garboczi et al. and Hennecke and Wiley references, that were suggested by the reviewers, as well as several other appropriate references. We agree that the structural studies suggest that the CDRs loops might affect positive selection, by recognizing either MHC and/or peptide and have tried to make that point more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> is difficult to understand.

Therefore we used intracellular staining to measure the levels of Nur77 and Egr2 in CD69+ TCR+ thymocytes undergoing selection in normal C57BL/6 mice and the DOβWT and DOβ48A mice (3 of each) that were the subjects of the studies in our manuscript. We found that Nur77 was at slightly (statistically significantly) lower levels in thymocytes undergoing selection in the DOβWT and DOβ48A mice by comparison with the same kinds of cells in B6 mice. Levels of Egr2 were also lower in the TCRβ transgenic mice, but this was only statistically significant in the DOβ48A animals. (see Table below) This is an interesting but subtle result that will require extensive experiments to follow up, so we haven’t included the result in the current manuscript, simply mentioned the idea as a possibility.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="4" valign="top">Nur77 levels are lower in positively selected thymocytes from TCRb transgenic mice than in the equivalent thymocytes in B6 animals.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td colspan="3" valign="top">Average +/- SE Geometric mean levels in CD69high TCRhigh thymocytes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">B6</td><td valign="top">DOβWT</td><td valign="top">DOβ48A</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Nur77</td><td valign="top">823.0 +/- 34.1</td><td valign="top">675.0 +/- 28.9*</td><td valign="top">600.3 +/- 39.6*</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Egr2</td><td valign="top">1055.0 +/- 20.9</td><td valign="top">951.3 +/- 122.8</td><td valign="top">777.0 +/- 52.4**</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td colspan="4" valign="top">* p&lt;.05 by comparison with B6</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" valign="top">** p&lt;.01 by comparison with B6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The TCR sequences should be deposited in appropriate databases.</p></disp-quote><p>The sequences are now deposited in GEO accession number GSE105129.
