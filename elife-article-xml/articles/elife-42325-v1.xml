Understanding the neural consequences of such damage may aid the development of rehabilitation methods. In this rare case of a Rhesus macaque (monkey S), likely born without V1, the animal’s in-group behaviour was unremarkable, but visual task training was impaired. With multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging, visual structures outside of the lesion appeared normal. Visual stimulation under anaesthesia with checkerboards activated lateral geniculate nucleus of monkey S, while full-field moving dots activated pulvinar. Visual cortical activation was sparse but included face patches. Consistently across lesion and control monkeys, functional connectivity analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even without V1. Despite robust subcortical responses to visual stimulation, we found little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42325.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Vision depends on the brain as well as on the eyes. Almost all information from the eyes travels to a brain region called the primary visual cortex. This large expanse of tissue at the back of the brain contains a detailed map of the visual world. Adults who suffer damage to part of the primary visual cortex become blind in the corresponding area of visual space, a phenomenon known as cortical blindness. Yet, adults with cortical blindness can also experience ‘blindsight’: they can still point correctly to bright, moving images, even though they claim they cannot see them.</p><p>One of the roles of primary visual cortex is to act as a gateway to other, ‘higher’ visual areas of the brain. These regions process the input they receive from the primary visual cortex to generate a rich and coherent visual representation. But how do adults with blindsight, in whom the major gateway from the eyes to higher visual areas has been damaged, still manage to respond to visual stimuli?</p><p>By chance, Bridge et al. discovered a monkey whose unusual brain anatomy provides clues as to why this is possible. The monkey behaved much like its peers, leaping between the perches of its enclosure with ease. But when Bridge et al. tried to train the animal on a visual task, it proved unable to learn like the other monkeys. A brain scan revealed that it had almost no primary visual cortex, probably because of an abnormality that arose early in development.</p><p>Further studies of the monkey’s brain showed that the other structures involved in visual processing were in their usual places and were of normal size. Connections from the eyes to higher visual areas that bypass the primary visual cortex were normal, but were no stronger than in other monkeys. In fact, areas beyond the primary visual cortex showed no fundamental changes in how they processed visual information.</p><p>The brain of this monkey had thus adapted to early loss of the major gateway from the eyes to higher visual cortex. Visual areas of the brain beyond the primary visual cortex continued to work as normal, helping to minimize vision loss. Because the visual brain differs little between primates, this discovery could also benefit patients with blindsight. It suggests that targeting higher visual areas could further improve vision in patients with damage to the primary visual cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>imaging</kwd><kwd>connectivity</kwd><kwd>subcortical</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>blindsight</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101092/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Buckley</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Krug</surname><given-names>Kristine</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Anna S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/H016902/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krug</surname><given-names>Kristine</given-names></name><name><surname>Bridge</surname><given-names>Holly</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Karla L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K014382/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bridge</surname><given-names>Holly</given-names></name><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N019814/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mars</surname><given-names>Rogier B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Even when the primary visual cortical area is absent bilaterally from early life, the rest of a primate visual brain can develop and function normally to support day-to-day visual behaviour.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary visual cortex (V1) of primates is the major gateway for feedforward input of visual information from the retina via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) into a network of over 30 extrastriate visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Markov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmidt et al., 2018</xref>). V1 contains a complete, high resolution retinotopic map and contributes to cortical processing by computing local spatio-temporal correlations of the input, which is evident in its neural representations of local visual features (orientation, spatial frequency, temporal frequency, direction, colour, binocular disparity) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hubel and Wiesel, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Movshon et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parker et al., 2016</xref>). The direct contribution of V1 signals to conscious sight is a subject of ongoing scientific debate (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stoerig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ffytche and Zeki, 2011</xref>) and is thought to involve feedback as well as feedforward input to V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ress and Heeger, 2003</xref>). At the centre of this debate have been patients with V1 lesions exhibiting residual vision - often without visual awareness - a condition termed Blindsight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riddoch, 1917</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weiskrantz et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowey, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Previous data on bilaterally cortically blind macaque monkeys suggest that there is a dissociation between use of vision for guiding movement and for awareness and recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leopold, 2012</xref>). Specifically, monkey Helen, who had V1 removed bilaterally, was able to navigate around the world but unable to recognise faces or food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Humphrey, 1974</xref>). The lesions to Helen were made in adulthood, which may have affected the amount of residual vision. Macaque monkeys who received a unilateral V1 lesion at two months of age exhibited more residual vision as adults than monkeys who received their lesions in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Cortical blindness due to bilateral damage to the primary visual cortex of humans is fortunately rare. There are a few cases of damage acquired in adulthood, some of whom have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Gelder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hervais-Adelman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arcaro et al., 2018</xref>), but also a number of children who acquired lesions congenitally or through perinatal stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mundinano et al., 2017</xref>). The presence of residual visual function suggests that functional visual networks can develop or be sustained in the absence of the main visual input to cortex.</p><p>In monkeys, in the absence of primary visual cortex, a number of potential pathways have been proposed to convey visual information from the eyes to extrastriate visual cortex. Direct input to extrastriate visual cortex bypassing V1 may arise from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) or the pulvinar nucleus directly to extrastriate visual areas V2, V3, V4, V5/MT and inferotemporal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wong-Riley, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sincich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaas and Lyon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Warner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gattass et al., 2014</xref>). In humans, both pulvinar and LGN inputs to V5/MT have been implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Gelder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajina et al., 2015b</xref>). In addition to its direct retinal input, the LGN also receives projections from the superior colliculus (SC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harting et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stepniewska et al., 1999</xref>). The pulvinar nucleus receives input from the SC, although likely not into the appropriate subdivision for projectiions to V5/MT, and pulvinar might receive surviving early projections directly from the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stepniewska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Warner et al., 2010</xref>). It has been suggested that early-life V1 lesions in particular might lead to less pruning of the retina-pulvinar-V5/MT pathway and that this might contribute to ‘blindsight’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Warner et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Macaque monkey S in the current study showed bilaterally enlarged lateral ventricles that appeared to have expanded into space usually occupied by V1. This gross pathology of the cerebral cortex was most likely to have been acquired developmentally or perinatally. Previous data have implicated roles in residual vision for the LGN, pulvinar, SC and the extrastriate visual cortical networks including motion area V5/MT. Our aim here was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the integrity of the structural and functional networks underlying residual visual function in this monkey with a long-standing anatomical lesion of primary visual cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Case history of monkey S</title><p>A female Rhesus macaque (monkey S; 7 years; 6.25 kg) initially showed comparable behaviour to cage mates, and successfully followed the same familiarisation and training pattern for coming out from the home enclosure into a transport box or primate chair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mason et al., 2019</xref>). Training in both cases was completed in a comparable time frame to other monkeys trained at the same time. Subsequently, task training took place five days per week over 18 months – this involved visual tasks but was intended for a decision-making study, rather than for measurement of visual performance. Training began with a simple task in a transport box, ‘anytouch’, where monkey S was rewarded for touching the screen anywhere during presentation of an array of colourful typographical characters. Monkey S managed to complete 10 trials in 3 min within one week of training and thus progressed to the next training stage. Task ‘oneplace’ involved targeted touching of a single coloured typographical character at a random location. Monkey S reached 40–50 trials in increments of 10 trials, but continued with the lowest complexity of visual presentations over six weeks of training. The 40–50 trials were completed in a time window ranging between 30–91 min per session. This was a particularly poor performance compared with other monkeys progressing through this auto-shaping programme. Monkey S was unable to progress further from the initial stages of ‘oneplace’.</p><p>At this phase of the training, monkey S was transferred to a primate chair (seated, but without head clamp or eye movement control) and to a different reward schedule (juice instead of pellets), and ‘oneplace’ was attempted again. Monkey S still worked much more slowly than other monkeys, attaining 40 rewarded trials in 33 min over many weeks of training sessions, whereas typical performance is expected to be closer to 100 rewarded trials in 18–25 min. Monkey S would typically no longer respond to the task when the number of trials or the complexity of the task were increased.</p><p>We tried using different effectors (e.g. a response lever and a metal knob) in an attempt to improve task learning and performance. Initially, monkey S was trained to hold the lever and then release it for reward. Although she did well during this initial behavioural training, monkey S was unable to learn to release the lever in response to visual stimulation. When monkey S was required to do a simple spatial search using the lever in response to a change in target colour on the screen, she typically only completed up to 10–20 trials towards the end of six months of training and only when the trainer remained present in the room. During this time, rudimentary checks determined that, while seated in the primate chair, monkey S could orient towards rewards and objects when held up in front of her and when moved around in her visual field.</p><p>Finally, monkey S was returned to the transport box touch screen training with ‘oneplace’. She completed up to 40 trials for banana pellets after 6 weeks of training, but still required 41–103 mins to complete a session, making between 23–51 errors. An error was recorded when monkey S touched the touch screen anywhere apart from the alphanumeric character.</p><p>In spite of the inability of S to perform these tested psychophysical tasks, behavioural assessment in the home enclosure by a clinical neurologist and two neuroscientists showed no qualitatively different patterns of locomotion and visual orienting towards other monkeys and people in the room. There was some indication that patterns of eye fixation might be atypical, but no quantitative assessment was undertaken. However, when monkey S was offered treats, she would start repeatedly running past the treat and pick it up with a sideways reach while running - rather than coming forwards, fixating the treat and reaching for it in a more controlled way.</p><p>As monkey S so obviously differed from the animals co-housed with her, we performed a brain scan.

The control monkeys included in these analyses showed similar activation in the LGN in response to this stimulus. In contrast to the strong activation in the LGN, there was less activation evident in visual cortical regions, especially in the primary visual cortex of monkey S (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> for a complete series of sections). Even in the control monkeys there was considerable variability in the location and extent of cortical BOLD activation. The checkerboard stimulus is expected to activate V1, but even in some control animals where V1 is intact, the activation was not extensive.

To quantify activation and compare responses in monkey S with the control monkeys, the % BOLD signal was extracted from the LGN, pulvinar, V1 and area V5/MT. Masks were defined anatomically on the brains of each individual monkey in structural space using a standard atlas as a guide (National Institute of Mental Health Macaque Template - NMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seidlitz et al., 2018</xref>). The activation levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> support the observation that the activity in LGN is greatest to the checkerboards across all animals, including monkey S. For control monkeys, V1 activation tended to be lower than for the LGN, with a median ratio of V1:LGN of 0.83 (range 0.2–0.92), but this was 0 for monkey S as she showed no V1 activation. Furthermore, monkey S did not show significant activation in anatomically defined area V5/MT to either stimulus but did in the pulvinar, though only in response to the moving dots. The timeseries from the LGN (checkerboard) and the pulvinar (moving dots) activation for monkey S illustrate the variability of the BOLD signal in these regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This would be expected since both sides of the brain received the same visual stimulation. In addition to the STS, a large swathe of dorsal extrastriate cortex and parietal areas showed significant correlation, both in the control monkeys and in monkey S.

The discovery of this monkey allowed a non-invasive approach to understanding the consequences of this damage to the structure and function of the visual brain similar to one that might be taken in human patients. In spite of the large occipital lesion, the structure and function of the remaining visual brain appeared largely unaltered. There are several parallels in behaviour between children with cortical visual impairment (CVI) and this monkey. Children with CVI can easily be misdiagnosed and their behaviour can manifest as a variety of other conditions, including learning disability, without careful investigation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chokron and Dutton, 2016</xref>). Without access to imaging it would not have been possible to determine the loss of tissue in the occipital lobes in this animal.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Visual structures outside of the lesion appeared structurally normal, although thalamocortical connections appeared to be reduced</title><p>The majority of literature relating to residual visual ability following damage to V1 describes adult-onset, unilateral damage due to stroke or trauma (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowey, 2010</xref>). In these cases, the comparison between the intact and damaged hemispheres appears to show that the LGN and optic tracts are atrophied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bridge et al., 2011</xref>). There are far fewer cases of peri-natal damage, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Millington et al. (2014)</xref> showed that even when the damage to occipital cortex is congenital, there is reduction of optic tract size in the affected hemisphere, implying a reduction in LGN size. A recent imaging study of a patient with bilateral occipital damage suggested atrophy of the LGN bilaterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arcaro et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giaschi et al. (2003)</xref> described a young man with bilateral damage to the occipital cortex suffered at birth. hMT+ in that case also appeared to be structurally normal, but did not show evidence of activation to visual stimulation. It was not possible to determine whether the LGN was intact from the images provided in that paper.</p><p>Despite the large cortical lesion, in contrast to much of the human ‘Blindsight’ literature, we found the LGN in monkey S to be intact. Combined lesion and silencing studies in macaques reinforce the requirement for an intact LGN to support remaining visual function after V1 lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmid et al., 2010</xref>). Preservation of structure and function of the LGN after a visual cortical lesion might depend on age at the time of lesion as well as the extent of the lesion, as studies in marmosets suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atapour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hendrickson et al., 2015</xref>). This would be consistent with a very early loss of V1, possibly in utero, for monkey S.</p><p>The increased resolution of the structural scanning and consistent location of V5/MT in the macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zeki, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Van Essen et al., 1981</xref>) allowed the myelination of this area to be identified in vivo. Even with such extensive loss in the occipital lobe and thus, the loss of a major input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maunsell and van Essen, 1983</xref>), this region of the STS appeared normal in monkey S. Conversely, the variability of hMT+ location in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Large et al., 2016</xref>) makes analysis of the myelin more challenging, and thus limits our opportunities to compare across the two species.</p><p>In spite of the apparent structural integrity of the LGN and V5/MT, the tracts between these regions appeared to be weaker, both in terms of the number of streamlines identified between them and the necessity for a more circuitous route to avoid the lesion. The circuitous route also points to an early, developmental origin for the lesion. Previous work in adult-acquired hemianopia in humans has indicated that tracts between LGN and hMT+ are similar in microstructure to sighted tracts in those showing some form of residual vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bridge et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajina et al., 2015b</xref>). However, monkey S had very large bilateral lesions that may have caused greater disruption to the normal pattern of white matter connectivity. Nonetheless, the microstructure of these tracts appeared to be close to control values, as was also the case in previous human studies, so the reduction in size could reflect a reduction in feedback connections into the LGN rather than a change in feedforward connectivity into cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations of analysing visual activation under general anaesthesia</title><p>Performing BOLD fMRI in anaesthetised macaques is challenging even when the monkey has a healthy visual system; this is evident in the variability in the amount of cortical activation in the control monkeys. The level of BOLD activation is affected by general anaesthesia parameters such as type and depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hutchison et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vincent et al., 2007</xref>), although previous results do not explain the potential differences in dorsal and temporal visual activations we see. We used isoflurane anaesthetic agent, under which it is known that some visual cortical activation is preserved, at least at low doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Logothetis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vincent et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goense and Logothetis, 2008</xref>). We mitigated some of this effect, by restricting our quantitative analyses to those sessions that showed significant activation of the LGN with a checkerboard stimulus. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the variability in cortical activity, specifically for area V5/MT, is due to effects of the anaesthetics which vary at shorter time scales within a fMRI session. It has also been suggested that some variability in cortical activation and functional connectivity as measured with fMRI could be linked to inter-individual differences in the morphology of sulcal patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lopez-Persem et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). In the same context, some of the small patches of activations that we see around dorsal and ventral STS in monkey S could be spurious signal fluctuations. However, for monkey S, looking through the whole brain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), we find only few regions with significant activation. A further challenge in monkey S is that the damage is bilateral. In much of the previous work in humans, the sighted hemisphere has been used as a control area, therefore controlling for any global variation in activation levels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Local activation patterns are preserved</title><p>The most evident activation is clearly in the LGN in response to checkerboard stimulation, which is equivalent to that seen in controls and suggests the visual pathway prior to V1 is intact. The activation level to moving dots was considerably lower, but that would be predicted from the properties of LGN cells. By contrast, the activation pattern in the pulvinar to moving dots for monkey S appeared to be as great as in the best control subject, which is consistent with an increased role for this structure due to the perinatal nature of the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Warner et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Moving dot stimuli in the healthy and hemianopic human brain consistently lead to activation of hMT+, even when damage is bilateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arcaro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bridge et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the lack of consistent activation in V5/MT in monkey S and some controls suggests a suppressive effect of the anaesthetic, which was most evident with larger doses of the volatile anaesthetic. Also, drifting eye movements and inappropriate ocular accommodation under anaesthesia could have affected the functional activation we measured. Nevertheless, for visual motion stimuli we saw in monkey S foci of activation in the region of V5/MT in dorsal STS of both hemispheres, suggesting any activation may be sub-threshold and difficult to detect with BOLD.</p><p>Even without the strong visually-evoked V5/MT responses, it was possible to map out a functional network of cortical areas showing a similar BOLD response over time to V5/MT. This was very similar in monkey S and the control monkeys, suggesting that this inter-cortical activity in the macaque visual brain was not affected by the loss of V1. Interestingly, none of the monkeys included LGN in this functional network, perhaps reflecting the weak anatomical connectivity between these areas in typical animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sincich et al., 2004</xref>). For all monkeys, FEF was included in the functional network, as would be predicted from a knowledge of the V5/MT connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schall et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we also found activation of two of the most pertinent face patches along the STS in monkey S – in the context of little other consistent activations. Without the comparison to scrambled faces, this result needs further scrutiny. However, if confirmed, this result would suggest other intact subcortical inputs in this monkey to temporal visual cortex from pulvinar, claustrum, and amygdala supporting these activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grimaldi et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Likely pathway for supporting residual visual function</title><p>Given that the day-to-day behaviour of monkey S did not cause concern, the monkey presumably had a reasonable amount of residual vision, in spite of the extensive cortical lesions. Considering all the evidence, it appears that the dorsal visual network was intact, and would have the potential to support active vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davare et al., 2011</xref>), as seen in a number of human patients with damage to the visual cortical system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goodale and Milner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bridge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodale, 2011</xref>). Retinal information may reach the dorsal visual areas via the weak pathways with LGN and pulvinar, but the lack of consistent visual cortex activation, possibly due to the anaesthesia, makes this question difficult to answer. The lack of significant differences between monkey S and controls in the pathways between LGN-V5/MT and pulvinar-V5/MT suggests either or both could support residual visual abilities.</p><p>So, what might be the source of visual input that supports visual function and presumably shaped an intact extrastriate visual brain network? One possibility could be some preserved V1 connectivity. But given the size and location of the bilateral lesion, this argument is difficult to sustain. Another possibility would parallel, alternative inputs to cortex. Earlier MRI studies in V1-lesioned monkeys have shown parallel activation in early visual areas, like V2, V3 and V4 as well as V5/MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmid et al., 2010</xref>). It has been suggested that V2 might be a crucial contribution to visual function and awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Merigan et al., 1993</xref>). These visual cortical areas also receive direct subcortical input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wong-Riley, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaas and Lyon, 2007</xref>). Based on our knowledge of functional representations, the activation of face patches in temporal cortex discussed above must be driven by a visual subcortical input other than to V5/MT. Since it is likely to be a wider pattern of cortical activation that underpins visual awareness and behaviour (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Papanikolaou et al., 2019</xref>), it might be supported by a wider pattern of weak, parallel subcortical inputs directly to extrastriate visual cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Visual structures, both cortical and subcortical, outside of the large lesion of primary visual cortex remained intact in monkey S with little evidence of atrophy. This suggests a role in residual visual function, consistent with an intact network of extrastriate cortical visual areas that was comparable to control monkeys. While the structural connectivity between the subcortical regions and area V5/MT was weak, the microstructure was intact. Thus, unlike adult-acquired lesions, there appeared to be a maintenance of structural integrity of the visual system when V1 is damaged neonatally. This may explain the increased residual function both, in monkey S and in children with early damage to the visual cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Seven macaque monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, two female and five male), weighing 6.25 to 12.3 kg (mean weight ± SE: 9.1 kg ± 0.8) underwent functional and structural MRI scans under general anaesthesia. Previously collected anatomical data from a further 10 macaque monkeys (four females for myelin/structural scans; six males for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)/structural scans; weighing 4.35 kg to 11 kg) were analysed from MRI scans (MPRAGE, T2w, DWI), also obtained under general anaesthesia.

For task training, monkey S was usually trained once a day for five days per week (typically 30 min – 105 min per day). But for double transport device acclimatization (transition from transport box to primate chair), monkey S was trained twice a day for five days per week. Task training in the transport box took place in the morning and acclimatization to enter a primate chair in the afternoon.</p><p>For touchscreen training, monkey S was brought in the transport box from the home enclosure to a test cubicle (as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>). In brief, the transport box was fixed to a touch-sensitive video screen (380 × 280 mm, 800 × 600 pixel). Stimulus presentation, recording of screen touches, and reward delivery were computer-controlled. For a correct touch, a dispenser delivered 190 mg banana-flavoured pellets accompanied by a click. In this training environment, monkeys progress through increasing the number of completed trials day-by-day and following a set of tasks of increasing difficulty. The first two simple tasks in this sequence were attempted by monkey S: (i) In ‘anytouch’, monkeys were rewarded for touching the screen anywhere during presentation of an array of colourful, alphanumeric characters (length up to 34 mm) on a black background; (ii) in ‘oneplace’, a single coloured typographical character was presented on a black background in a random location and remained on the screen until the monkey had touched it. A touch caused the character to disappear and a reward pellet to be delivered.</p><p>Working with the touch screen while seated upright in a primate chair was another training set. Once acclimated to the primate chair, reward pellets were re-placed with banana smoothie taken from a spout and delivered by a reward pump. The primate chair was positioned directly in front of the touchscreen monitor (as described above). Monkey S’s head was approximately 160 mm away from the touchscreen and her hand reach 100 mm. Tasks were the same as described above for the transport box.</p><p>Further training switched to a different effector, using a paddle lever touch sensor attached to the front of the primate chair. This task required monkey S to press a lever for less than 500 msec, while a red circle (5 mm in diameter, approx. 1.8° of visual angle) was displayed in the centre of the touchscreen and to release the lever when the circle switched to green. In addition, monkey S had to reach out to touch one of two white squares (50 mm in size, approx. 18° of visual angle) that were then presented on the touchscreen to the left and right of the circle.</p><p>In another version of the task, the lever was replaced with a metal knob. Here, the training program displayed a red circle (diameter = 40 mm, approx. 14° of visual angle) on the touchscreen, directly above the knob. Touching the metal knob for 200 msec delivered the reward and the red circle disappeared for a 2 s inter–trial interval (ITI). Monkey S was initially trained to hold a metal bolt and her hand was guided toward the metal knob.</p><p>During training, different fluid rewards (e.g. different banana smoothie concentrations, blackcurrant juice, apple juice) were used to determine preferences. For the later part of the task training, monkey S was on a fluid control protocol to increase motivation: water bottles were removed each night before the next day’s training session and replaced after each daily training session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Anaesthesia</title><p>The seven monkeys undergoing functional MRI scans were sedated with a mixture of ketamine (7.5 mg/kg), xylazine (0.125 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg). They were intubated, an i.v. cannula was inserted into the saphenous vein for fluid infusion (Hartmann’s solution, 2 ml/kg/hr) and non-invasive BP, rectal temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation were continuously monitored. They were placed in an MRI compatible stereotaxic frame with anaesthetic cream (EMLA cream) applied to pressure points, and ‘viscotears’ applied to stop the eyes from drying. During the scan, they were ventilated with a gaseous mixture of isoflurane in oxygen (range 0.8% to 2.0%) with end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> maintained around 38 mmHg. Between scan sequences approximately hourly, legs were massaged and ‘viscotears’ were re-applied. The isoflurane anaesthetic gas mixture during scanning sequences was kept to a level commensurate with adequate anaesthesia through monitoring of physiological parameters (heart rate, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, blood pressure) and, between sequences, through pinch test. In the majority of monkeys during visual presentation, isoflurane concentration was at 1% (range: 0.8% to 1.6%). In anaesthetised monkeys, visual activation can vary for a number of reasons, including accommodation, drifting eye movements and level of anaesthesia. In our data, there was some indication that lower average levels of isoflurane were associated with significant visual stimulation responses, but the pattern was variable (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This relatively liberal threshold was chosen due to the anaesthesia reducing the BOLD signal in the monkeys, although our isoflurane levels were below those shown to induce significant resting network changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hutchison et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>For the fMRI analyses, visual areas masks for LGN, pulvinar and V5/MT were transformed into EPI space and a region of interest analysis was performed by extracting the % BOLD change from each area using Featquery, another tool from the FSL toolbox.</p><p>Timeseries shown for monkey S were extracted from one of the two scans obtained for each stimulus, specifically the one with the highest z-statistics, because signal modulation was likely to be noisy. Data were averaged across the 16 stimulus cycles to give a mean cycle of the timeseries. In the case of the LGN and pulvinar timeseries, the data were averaged across all voxels in the mask, rather than using peak voxels. In the case of the STS, the timeseries data were extracted from the region of activation (z &gt; 2.3) indicated by the arrow in the figure.</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Functional connectivity analysis</title><p>To determine whether the pattern of functional connectivity within the cerebral cortex in the healthy visual system was evident in monkey S, the BOLD time series was extracted from the V5/MT ROIs using the FSL function ‘fslmeants’. The timeseries was then used as the explanatory variable in a FEAT analysis to identify the brain areas showing a significant statistical relationship with V5/MT. This was performed for both the checkerboard and motion scans, and a fixed effects analysis was used to combine the two repeats of each stimulus type. For the quantitative analysis, we defined broad regions of interest and counted the ratio of activated voxels to total voxels in this region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Faces</title><p>Data were analysed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM12, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friston et al., 2006</xref>). Pre-processing steps consisted of realignment and co-registration to the monkeys’ own structural images. Images were smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel (full-width at half maximum: 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). Realignment parameters were included as covariates of no interest in the design. To localise face-related activations we calculated the contrast [Faces Vs Blank], and resulting z-scores were displayed on the monkeys’ own structural images using FSLEyes (z-score &gt;2.3).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of DWI data and probabilistic tractography</title><p>Probabilistic tractography was performed using ProbtrackX2 from the FSL FDT toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>). We traced two unilateral pathways in each hemisphere: pulvinar to V5/MT and LGN to V5/MT. Masks for these three structures were obtained from a standard atlas (NMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seidlitz et al., 2018</xref>) and later modified by hand. The pulvinar mask was reduced in size to focus on the inferior pulvinar as this is the portion that relays visual information from the SC to area V5/MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berman and Wurtz, 2010</xref>). Anatomical masks used for tractography were further modified to eliminate potential overlap between masks for neighbouring subcortical regions. For example, the LGN and pulvinar masks were modified so that they were always separated by at least 1–2 coronal slices. We used exclusion masks to eliminate streamlines passing anterior of the LGN or across hemispheres. In the case of the V1-lesioned monkey S, we also included a mask encompassing the bilateral lesion.</p><p>We modified the default parameters of ProbtrackX2 in order to optimise the procedure for NHP data, based on previous work in our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tang-Wright, 2016</xref>). Specifically, we limited the streamline length to 100 steps, with step length of 0.5 mm. The value of each voxel represented the total number of streamline passing through. Each voxel was thresholded at 10% of the maximum number of streamlines found in any voxel. A recent study that directly compared diffusion tractography with tracers in monkeys reported that a threshold of 10% most reliably reflect the anatomy when compared with tracers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Azadbakht et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>John Duncan for making this project possible.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Michael Schmid (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Bridge et al. present a very interesting case report of monkey S with a likely congenital bilateral occipital lesion visible as enlarged ventricles in structural MRI. The monkey presents without an apparent visual deficit in the home cage. Six intact controls were also studied. The authors use MR based methods during anaesthesia to report functional activation and connectivity of thalamic and cortical regions. While BOLD fMRI signal modulation is observed in LGN and pulvinar, no such activation is observed at significance level in striate or extrastriate visual cortex (apart from face patches, interestingly). Further analysis reveals residual connectivity of area MT with other extrastriate areas and visual thalamus. The phenomenon of Blindsight continues to fascinate neuroscientists and neurologists interested in consciousness ever since the initial discovery by Weisskrantz et al. and is of clinical relevance for cortical blindness resulting from stroke or atrophy. This new study provides an important link between earlier monkey work that relied on experimental lesions and the human Blindsight work with neurological cases of this study's first author (Bridge). The paper is well written and presents a number of intriguing observations that are suitably contextualized and discussed by the authors in terms of relevant studies in both humans and monkeys. The new research is important, timely and fills a critical gap in the literature. However, the reviewers have expressed important concerns that need to be addressed before the manuscript can be accepted for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The lesion extent needs to more clearly be described. What exactly do the authors mean by “almost complete loss of V1”? The lesion description is too vague: “A structural MRI identified bilateral hemianopia with almost complete loss of primary visual cortex (V1) (Figure 1, top)”. From Figure 1 it is clear that the monkey has enlarged ventricles that appear to affect predominantly the ventral occipital lobe. But for the reader it is impossible to determine which areas (in addition to V1?) are affected, how they are affected (thinning of gray matter?). There is some calcarine clearly present in the top left (sagittal) image of animal S in Figure 1, and more importantly, some of the occipital pole surface cortex does seem to be present in the both sagittal and horizontal images of Monkey S; in the myelin-weighted horizontal image of Figure 2, that occipital pole tissue even seems to look much like that of the controls. From this MR image it appears that opercular / parafoveal V1 (my estimate is up to ~8 degrees eccentricities) seems intact and the lesion might primarily affect higher eccentricities. Without additional information (e.g. histology), describing V1 as &quot;missing&quot; (or implying that it's completely nonfunctional) seems premature. This leaves the possibility that any visual guided behavior (or the face patch activation in Figure 10) is carried out by some parts of V1 that are currently not clear due to insufficient anatomical description and insensitive fMRI methodology.</p><p>2) The authors need to clearly demonstrate that there is no or only very spatially confined BOLD activation in V1. It seems that the current protocol is insensitive to reveal reliable V1 BOLD activation even in normal animals. The variability in activation across the controls and the many areas of puzzling activation in some of them detract from the believability of small areas of activation in Monkey S (or any of the monkeys) as being something meaningful and specific. For example, cortical activation illustrated for the flickering checkerboard (Figure 3) is not only (maybe) &quot;less consistent&quot; across the controls than activation in LGN, it seems to encompass numerous nonvisual areas in Monkey M902. Face stimuli (Figure 10) seem to activate a wide swath of nonvisual cortex laterally in the same monkey, and parts of the caudate, insula, etc., in M901. It would be good to know a bit more about why there seem to be these spurious (?) activations so that we can better trust that the activations identified as specific face patches or portions of MT are indeed &quot;signal&quot;. In addition, I infer from the &quot;Visual Stimuli&quot; section that only some of the controls showed visual responses in the LGN at all to the flickering checkerboard. In general, the paper would benefit from a section in the Discussion explicitly devoted to limitations on interpretation given variability among the controls and discussing possible artifacts or other sources of activations that may not be meaningful. The authors might provide a more substantial series of sections (ideally in all three planes) illustrating the lack of BOLD activation in these potential spared portions of V1.</p><p>3) In the absence of a clearer demonstration of Blindsight, the title needs to be revised. &quot;Blindsight&quot; seems inappropriate on two counts: not only does it appear possible that a substantial portion of V1 is spared (see above), but also the term &quot;blindsight” has a contentious history as applied to monkeys, as the authors probably know. In terms of the behavior, Blindsight, even in monkeys, has been taken to mean a dissociation between essentially reflexive behavior and behavior that reflects some judgment of the absence of the stimulus. E.g., responding to a peripheral target when cued vs. not responding when there is no cue or categorizing a stimulus in the same way as a blank trial. Assuming that even if monkey S could be trained on tasks that would provide such a dissociation, those types of training often take months even with animals with (partial) visual lesions and a (partial) fovea or pseudofovea. However, the authors could include something like &quot;Implications for blindsight&quot; as the terminal part of their title (i.e., it's not the word blindsight that's the problem, it's what can and can't be inferred about it from the study that's at issue). A more accurate overall title would be something like &quot;Preserved extrastriate visual network in a monkey with naturally occurring substantial damage to V1.&quot;</p><p>4) A more complete behavioral description of S. In the present form of the manuscript, there is no description of the psychophysical testing procedure in the Materials and methods section and the reader has no chance to form his own impression and has to rely on the authors description. Suggestions include a video of S (although there is also acknowledgement that this might be problematic) and determining if the animal can fixate. At minimum, a more detailed description of the behavioral tasks that were already used is needed and additional behavioral documentation is encouraged.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Preserved extrastriate visual network in a monkey with substantial, naturally occurring damage to primary visual cortex&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Joshua Gold (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Abstract: the authors should more accurately describe their functional activation pattern. In light of the existing literature with acquired lesions in monkeys and humans, the lack of functional activation of area MT (and presumably other retinotopic areas) should be spelled out in parallel with the presence of such activation of the face patches in the temporal lobe. In light of this activation pattern in monkey S, the authors should be cautious about their conclusion of 'an intact network of visual cortical areas even without V1', which appears to draw primarily on the functional connectivity analysis.</p><p>2) Face patch activation: Please specify where the patches in this study are located in reference to the pattern reported by Tsao/Freiwald and others. Many colleagues would find this information very useful. In the Materials and methods section the authors mention neutral vs threatening expressions – are there any activation differences associated with this (Hoffman et al., 2007)?</p><p>3) Figure 2: Thank you for providing this post mortem scan. While this helps to appreciate the reduced gray matter thickness of V1, I am wondering about the variability across V1. In particular the lateral region (foveal representation) appears thicker, but this may just be an impression.</p><p>4) Figure 1—figure supplement 1: It is not clear how the authors derive the eccentricities for the expected visual field loss.</p><p>5) Introduction paragraph four: LGN also receives SC input (Harting, 1991; Stepniewska, Qi and Kaas, 1999)</p><p>6) Subsection “Case history of monkey S” paragraph two: Did this training on oneplace in the lab involve head fixation and eye movement control?</p><p>7) Discussion paragraph three: I believe stronger wording could be justified: our study (Schmid et al., 2010) did not only suggest this, but actually tested and demonstrated the effect of LGN inactivation on behaviour and cortical activation. Although you could argue that the inactivation might also include pulvinar due to its proximity to LGN, and as we did not present results from pulvinar testing.</p><p>8) Subsection “Limitations of analysing visual activation under general anaesthesia”: but the use of anaesthesia does not explain the residual activation in the temporal lobe</p><p>9) Abstract: I completely concur with including a mention of blindsight here, but in the new version the term seems a bit shoehorned into the second sentence, interrupting the expository flow of the Abstract. The authors might consider removing the &quot;including blindsight&quot; in that sentence, and instead conclude the Abstract with a statement about the results &quot;having implications for residual visual capacities even if they are not conscious, as in the blindsight phenomenon&quot; (or something to that effect – nothing too strong, but still including and even highlighting the blindsight connection a bit more, if desired).</p><p>10) Figure 2: Which piece of the image are the white arrows pointing at exactly? The figure legend says the stripe of Gennari, but it is very hard to see anything within the gray matter strip corresponding to cortex. Or are the arrows meant to demarcate the extent (borders) of V1 as inferred by the stria of Gennari? That would not seem to entirely make sense in terms of the arrow placement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42325.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The lesion extent needs to more clearly be described.

It is unclear at this stage how useful the histology would be, as the remaining tissue at the occipital pole is very thin and fragile – therefore we focussed on the post mortem high resolution (0.27x0.27x0.27mm3) scans at 7T. Evidence of the fragility is the partial collapse of the cortical ribbon shown in the post mortem image. In the paper, we now include additional results and further images of V1 at high resolution, a more detailed description of the extent of lesion, measurements of cortical thickness and the visibility of the stria of gennari in the putative remains of V1 shown as new Figure 2 (and see Legend and Results subsection “Cortical structure: V1 appears much thinner in monkey S but area V5/MT shows similar pattern</p><p>of dense myelination to control monkeys”).

It would be good to know a bit more about why there seem to be these spurious (?) activations so that we can better trust that the activations identified as specific face patches or portions of MT are indeed &quot;signal&quot;. In addition, I infer from the &quot;Visual Stimuli&quot; section that only some of the controls showed visual responses in the LGN at all to the flickering checkerboard. In general, the paper would benefit from a section in the Discussion explicitly devoted to limitations on interpretation given variability among the controls and discussing possible artifacts or other sources of activations that may not be meaningful. The authors might provide a more substantial series of sections (ideally in all three planes) illustrating the lack of BOLD activation in these potential spared portions of V1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to document the patterns of activity (or the lack thereof) more fully, so that the reader can check our reported results for themselves. We have now added a complete series of 1mm-spaced sections through the whole brain for animal S for both the checkerboard and the motion stimulus (see Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). These document the patterns of activity in V1, V5/MT and the rest of the brain comprehensively across the whole brain. Since all regions of interest are shown, we did not feel it was necessary to provide the other planes. We also make the functional imaging source data available online for monkey S and the controls through the Oxford Wellcome Imaging Centre GitHub https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/hb/BrainWithoutV1.</p><p>We also amended what is now Figure 6, to show the quantitative activation in V1 for monkey S and across all of the controls. We provide in the text the ratio of V1/LGN activation for all monkeys included in this study (Results subsection “LGN shows significant activation to visual stimulation in monkey S”, paragraph four).</p><p>These results underpin that in monkey S, there is no activation of V1, which contrast with patchy activation in dorsal STS and the face patches in ventral STS.</p><p>We have also amended the Discussion with a new section for a more explicit debate about the limitations of our BOLD results given the variability among the controls and discussing possible artefactual activations we might see (Discussion subsection “Limitations of analysing visual activation under general anaesthesia”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the absence of a clearer demonstration of Blindsight, the title needs to be revised. &quot;Blindsight&quot; seems inappropriate on two counts: not only does it appear possible that a substantial portion of V1 is spared (see above), but also the term &quot;blindsight” has a contentious history as applied to monkeys, as the authors probably know. In terms of the behavior, Blindsight, even in monkeys, has been taken to mean a dissociation between essentially reflexive behavior and behavior that reflects some judgment of the absence of the stimulus. E.g., responding to a peripheral target when cued vs. not responding when there is no cue or categorizing a stimulus in the same way as a blank trial. Assuming that even if monkey S could be trained on tasks that would provide such a dissociation, those types of training often take months even with animals with (partial) visual lesions and a (partial) fovea or pseudofovea. However, the authors could include something like &quot;Implications for blindsight&quot; as the terminal part of their title (i.e., it's not the word blindsight that's the problem, it's what can and can't be inferred about it from the study that's at issue). A more accurate overall title would be something like &quot;Preserved extrastriate visual network in a monkey with naturally occurring substantial damage to V1.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the title to ‘Preserved extrastriate visual network in a monkey with substantial, naturally occurring damage to primary visual cortex’. We mention ‘blindsight’ into the Abstract and the keywords, so that the article can be more easily found by the relevant communities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A more complete behavioral description of S. In the present form of the manuscript, there is no description of the psychophysical testing procedure in the Materials and methods section and the reader has no chance to form his own impression and has to rely on the authors description. Suggestions include a video of S (although there is also acknowledgement that this might be problematic) and determining if the animal can fixate. At minimum, a more detailed description of the behavioral tasks that were already used is needed and additional behavioral documentation is encouraged.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this omission – we have now added a complete description of the training regime and attempted task training with animal S in the Materials and methods section (new section ‘Behavioural training and tasks’). Where available, we also added quantitative measures of task performance in the Results (see subsection “Case history of monkey S”). We also added further details of a clinical, behavioural observation by a neurologist carried out at the time. We regret to say that we have no video material and the animal is not alive anymore.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Abstract: the authors should more accurately describe their functional activation pattern. In light of the existing literature with acquired lesions in monkeys and humans, the lack of functional activation of area MT (and presumably other retinotopic areas) should be spelled out in parallel with the presence of such activation of the face patches in the temporal lobe. In light of this activation pattern in monkey S, the authors should be cautious about their conclusion of 'an intact network of visual cortical areas even without V1', which appears to draw primarily on the functional connectivity analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Abstract – including the concluding sentence – in the light of the comments above. We now have an explicit statement of the sparsity of visual cortical activation except for the face patches. We would prefer to be cautious about specifically highlighting the absence of activation in a specific area, especially since we deal here with functional activations under general anaesthesia. In the Abstract, the network result only appears now in its specific analysis context. We would like to point out that extrastriate visual cortical areas, particularly V5/MT appear also structurally intact, see myelin results.</p><p>We did our very best include all the requested elements of the results in the Abstract’s 150 words. See also Comment 9 for further requested changes to the Abstract. See new Abstract:</p><p>“Lesions of primary visual cortex (V1) lead to loss of conscious visual perception with significant impact on human patients. Understanding the neural consequences of such damage may aid the development of rehabilitation methods. In this rare case of a Rhesus macaque (monkey S), likely born without V1, the animal’s in-group behaviour was unremarkable, but visual task training was impaired. With multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging, visual structures outside of the lesion appeared normal. Visual stimulation under anaesthesia with checkerboards activated lateral geniculate nucleus of monkey S, while full-field moving dots activated pulvinar. Visual cortical activation was sparse but included face patches. Consistently across lesion and control monkeys, functional connectivity analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even without V1. Despite robust subcortical responses to visual stimulation, we found little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Face patch activation: Please specify where the patches in this study are located in reference to the pattern reported by Tsao/Freiwald and others. Many colleagues would find this information very useful. In the Materials and methods section the authors mention neutral vs threatening expressions – are there any activation differences associated with this (Hoffman et al., 2007)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have set our results more specifically into the context of the Tsao/Freiwald pattern (naming AF and MF as the relevant patches). We would prefer to be cautious in interpreting these results, as we mentioned in the manuscript that we have only two controls available and the specific activations are small.</p><p>We did not find evidence for specific activations for threatening vs neutral faces in the STS in line with the results in awake Rhesus macaque reported by Hoffman et al., 2007 and Hadj-Bouziane et al., 2008. We have amended the Results accordingly. See last paragraph of Results:</p><p>“When we compared the BOLD response to all face stimuli compared to a mid-gray background (similar to the localizer used by Liu et al., 2015, we found clearly defined clusters of activation for the two most commonly identified temporal lobe face patches in the Rhesus macaque: the anterior (likely AF, Tsao et al., 2008, and middle (likely MF, Tsao et al., 2008) face patch located in the fundus of ventral STS (Figure 11). One control showed only the anterior face patch. While the locations of these areas are as previously described in macaques (Tsao et al., 2003, Pinsk et al., 2005, Tsao et al., 2008, Bell et al., 2009), we did not check the contrast against scrambled faces. We did not observe any specific differences in activation between threatening and neutral facial expressions in the STS, consistent with previous studies (Hoffman et al., 2007, Hadj-Bouziane et al., 2008).”</p><p>There might be a small activation near the amygdala, but we had two experts in MRI face responses check the scans and they thought that these specific responses in this small data set obtained under general anaesthesia might be too weak for a meaningful comparison on this subtle difference.</p><p>We also provide the full functional scan data through a weblink, so readers can inspect the original data in full:</p><p>https://web.gin.g-node.org/hbridge_oxford/brainwithoutv1</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2: Thank you for providing this post mortem scan. While this helps to appreciate the reduced gray matter thickness of V1, I am wondering about the variability across V1. In particular the lateral region (foveal representation) appears thicker, but this may just be an impression.</p></disp-quote><p>On further inspection, this is a consequence of the angle of the cut through the cortical ribbon at this point. We have amended the figure legend to make readers aware of this. See Figure legends: Figure 2:</p><p>“Figure 2: A post mortem T2*-weighted structural scan at high field (7T) revealed the stripe of Gennari in V1 (white arrows for example sites) of both monkey S and a control monkey (M131), although the position relative to the cortical surface within the cortical ribbon appeared to differ. The V1 gray matter in monkey S was reduced in thickness to 0.9-1.3 mm around the enlarged ventricles (1.4-1.8 mm in the control). The appearance of increased thickness more laterally in the sulcus is due to the angle of the slice through cortex at this point. By contrast, the gray matter at the location for V5/MT appeared intact with a typical thickness of 1.9-2.0 mm. Note that the lesion is partially light gray in appearance as well partially black. As the brain was still inside the skull during the scan, we speculate that this might be a result of slow incursion of ‘fluorinert’, in which the skull was immersed for this scan.”</p><p>We also provide the full scan data through a weblink, so readers can inspect the original data in full:</p><p>https://web.gin.g-node.org/hbridge_oxford/brainwithoutv1</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1—figure supplement S1: It is not clear how the authors derive the eccentricities for the expected visual field loss.</p></disp-quote><p>We estimated visual eccentricities based on the cortical folding pattern and slice position using the neurophysiological map of retinotopy obtained by van Essen et al., 1984 (see their Figure 11). We have clarified this in the figure legend. See Figure legends: Figure 1–figure supplement 1:</p><p>“Figure 1—figure supplement 1: Based on established neurophysiological maps of V1 retinotopy in relation to the cortical folding pattern and approximate slice position (their Figure 11, Van Essen et al., 1984), we estimated the visual field loss of monkey S. Visual map is shown on post mortem T2*-weighted images – deformations of the occipital cortical surface were post mortem. Given the extent of the loss of white matter directly underneath V1, we expect bilateral visual field loss, for the central 10° as well as for more peripheral parts, potentially around 15°-20° eccentricity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Introduction paragraph four: LGN also receives SC input (Harting, 1991; Stepniewska, Qi andKaas, 1999)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the references, which we have added:</p><p>“In addition to its direct retinal input, the LGN also receives projections from the superior colliculus (SC) (Harting et al., 1991, Stepniewska et al., 1999). The pulvinar nucleus receives input from the superior colliculus (SC), although probably not in the most appropriate subdivision for projecting to V5/MT, or surviving early projections directly from the retina (Stepniewska et al., 1999, Warner et al., 2010).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “Case history of monkey S” paragraph two: Did this training on oneplace in the lab involve head fixation and eye movement control?</p></disp-quote><p>Monkey S did not have a head implant. Whether in the transport box or upright in the primate chair, head fixation and eye movement tracking could not be implemented. We have now made this more explicit in the text:</p><p>“At this phase of the training, monkey S was transferred to a primate chair (seated, but without head clamp or eye movement control) and to a different reward schedule (juice instead of pellets), and ‘oneplace’ was attempted again.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion paragraph three: I believe stronger wording could be justified: our study (Schmid et al., 2010) did not only suggest this, but actually tested and demonstrated the effect of LGN inactivation on behaviour and cortical activation. Although you could argue that the inactivation might also include pulvinar due to its proximity to LGN, and as we did not present results from pulvinar testing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the wording as requested (p11, lines 353-354). The sentence now reads:</p><p>“Combined lesion and silencing studies in macaques reinforce the requirement for an intact LGN to support remaining visual function after V1 lesions (Schmid et al., 2010).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “Limitations of analysing visual activation under general anaesthesia”: but the use of anaesthesia does not explain the residual activation in the temporal lobe</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct and we now point this out more explicitly in the Discussion:</p><p>“The level of BOLD activation is affected by general anaesthesia parameters such as type and depth (Hutchison et al., 2014, Vincent et al., 2007), although previous results do not explain the potential differences in dorsal and temporal visual activations we see.”</p><p>We also explain in the same section that we cannot exclude that the level of anaesthesia might vary at different times during the scan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Abstract: I completely concur with including a mention of blindsight here, but in the new version the term seems a bit shoehorned into the second sentence, interrupting the expository flow of the Abstract. The authors might consider removing the &quot;including blindsight&quot; in that sentence, and instead conclude the Abstract with a statement about the results &quot;having implications for residual visual capacities even if they are not conscious, as in the blindsight phenomenon&quot; (or something to that effect – nothing too strong, but still including and even highlighting the blindsight connection a bit more, if desired).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have removed ‘including blindsight’ from the 2nd sentence and worked it in at the end, albeit a bit shorter than suggested because of the 150 words limitation. We agree that this has improved the flow of the Abstract. (See Abstract – under point 1 above – for changes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 2: Which piece of the image are the white arrows pointing at exactly? The figure legend says the stripe of Gennari, but it is very hard to see anything within the gray matter strip corresponding to cortex. Or are the arrows meant to demarcate the extent (borders) of V1 as inferred by the stria of Gennari? That would not seem to entirely make sense in terms of the arrow placement.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry that this was unclear. The arrow placement was at a selection of example points where we identified the stripe of Gennari in the image. We clarify this now in figure legend 2 (see full figure legend under point 3 above).</p><p>We checked the original figure and the embedded figure in our Word document both on screen and as printouts. We agree that especially the Word embedded version was too small and of too low quality to identify the stripe of Gennari clearly. We have now adjusted the overall brightness of the displayed images and provide them as high resolution image at full page size (see new Figure 2). We have also repositioned one arrow to a clearer site.</p><p>Again, since these data are available on</p><p>https://web.gin.g-node.org/hbridge_oxford/brainwithoutv1</p><p>and the reader is free to explore the location.</p></body></sub-article></article>
