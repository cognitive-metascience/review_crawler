(LOAD). In this study, we use multiple rodent and human brain tissue and neural cell models to demonstrate that CLU is expressed as multiple isoforms that have distinct cellular or subcellular localizations in the brain. Of particular significance, we identify a non-glycosylated 45 kDa CLU isoform (mitoCLU) that is localized to the mitochondrial matrix and expressed in both rodent and human neurons and astrocytes. In addition, we show that rodent mitoCLU is translated from a non-canonical CUG (Leu) start site in Exon 3, a site that coincides with an AUG (Met) in human CLU. Last, we reveal that mitoCLU is present at the gene and protein level in the currently available CLU<sup>–/–</sup> mouse model. Collectively, these data provide foundational knowledge that is integral in elucidating the relationship between CLU and the development of LOAD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD)</kwd><kwd>clusterin (CLU)</kwd><kwd>apolipoprotein J (ApoJ)</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG061038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Liqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AG055964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Liqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AG059177</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Liqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005496</institution-id><institution>American Foundation for Pharmaceutical Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pre-doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herring</surname><given-names>Sarah K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30AG035982 Pilot Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Liqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM103418 Pilot Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Liqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification and characterization of multiple brain clusterin isoforms, including a mitochondrial matrix-targeted isoform, provides foundation to potentially clarify the link between these proteins and the development of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is the most common form of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) representing more than 95% of all AD cases. The etiology of LOAD is currently unknown, but prevailing hypotheses suggest that it probably includes an intricate interaction of genetic and environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Verheijen and Sleegers, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stoccoro and Coppedè, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nativio et al., 2018</xref>). Of the dozens of genetic risk factors that have been associated with increased risk for LOAD, two members of the apolipoprotein family reside in the top three: apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), also known as clusterin (CLU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alzforum Networking, 2019</xref>). While the risk conferred by ApoE has been extensively characterized, the identification of CLU as a genetic risk factor is relatively recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harold et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lambert et al., 2009</xref>). Despite this novelty, it is established that the CLU polymorphism rs11136000 confers an increased risk of developing LOAD that is independent of ApoE ε4 status. As nearly 36% of the Caucasian population carries this CLU risk genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertram et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braskie et al., 2011</xref>), a thorough understanding of the physiological properties and roles of CLU in the brain is crucial for understanding the pathophysiological impact of CLU in LOAD.</p><p>The CLU gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 8 (8p21.1) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dietzsch et al., 1992</xref>), chromosome 14 (14 D1; 14 34.36 cM) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">The Jackson Laboratory, 2019</xref>) and chromosome 15 (15p12) in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2019a</xref>). The CLU gene is organized into 11 exons (two exons are untranslated) of different sizes, spanning a region of 18,115 bp (human), 13,065 bp (mouse) or 39,246 bp (rat). Transcription of the CLU gene results in the production of at least three mRNA isoforms in humans and mice (NM_001831.3, NR_045494.1, and NR_038335.1 in humans; NM_013492.3, XM_006518504.3, and XM_006518503.3 in mice) and one mRNA transcript in rats (NM_053021.2). The translated protein isoforms share a high degree of sequential homology across species, with the highest degree of similarity occurring in the disulfide bonding region located near Exon 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Londou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Purrello et al., 1991</xref>). Within Exons 1–2, the variance between transcripts is limited to Exon 1, with three Exon 1 variants existing: Exon 1A, Exon 1B, and Exon 1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ling et al., 2012</xref>). The Exon 1A-9-containing mRNA transcript [NCBI Reference # NM_001831.3 (human) and NM_013492.3 (murine)] is thought to be translated into the mature secreted CLU (mCLU) protein isoform. mCLU [70–75 kDa (dimerized) and 36–39 kDa (reduced)] is initially translated from Exon 2 into a 448 (mouse) or 449 (human) amino acid (aa) pre-protein, which contains an N-terminal 22-amino-acid endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-signaling peptide (SP; located in Exon 2) and two nuclear localization sequences (NLS; located in Exon 3 and Exon 8). Following translation, the mCLU pre-protein is immediately targeted to the ER, where the SP is removed and the protein is glycosylated at six N-linked glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kapron et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jordan-Starck, 1994</xref>). The intermediate glycoprotein is then directed to the Golgi body, where glycan trimming and additional modifications occur. The resultant glycoprotein is then cleaved to form the two glycosylated mCLU subunits: the alpha subunit [mCLUα, 34–37 kDa (mice) or 40 kDa (human)] and the beta subunit [mCLUβ, 36–39 kDa (mice) or 40 kDa (human)]. Prior to secretion, mCLUα and mCLUβ are disulfide-bonded to form the antiparallel, heterodimeric glycoprotein commonly referred to as mCLU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkey et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>In addition to mCLU, several ‘minor’ or alternative protein isoforms have been reported. The primarily discussed alternative isoform, generally referred to as nuclear or intracellular CLU (nCLU or icCLU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caccamo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Debure et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leskov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2012a</xref>), lacks Exon 2 and is translated from an in-frame methionine (Met) in Exon 3, which results in the generation of a CLU protein isoform that has an approximate molecular weight of 45–50 kDa (primarily detected in human cells in the cytosol and nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leskov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prochnow et al., 2013</xref>]). However, the data concerning the physiological role of the nCLU/icCLU protein isoform(s) are less clear. The predominant hypothesis is that the 45–50 kDa protein isoform is solely pro-apoptotic in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Debure et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dia and Mejia, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2012b</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, studies have demonstrated that mCLU and nCLU regulate certain cellular processes in opposite manners. For example, mCLU promotes cellular survival in human osteosarcoma cells by interacting with and stabilizing the Ku70/Bax complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Trougakos et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, overexpression of the proposed nCLU protein isoform is associated with significantly reduced cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2000</xref>) and increased anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caccamo et al., 2003</xref>), and has been shown to induce cell-cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scaltriti et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, the data concerning the subcellular distribution and/or localization of CLU are, at best, controversial. Widespread, robust expression of CLU mRNA is detectable in the postnatal mouse brain beginning at postnatal day 7, with predominant CLU immunoreactivity localized to astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charnay et al., 2008</xref>). Parallel to these findings, another study demonstrates prominent astrocytic CLU expression with no detectable CLU mRNA in oligodendrocytes, microglia, or neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morgan et al., 1995</xref>). By contrast, an examination of CLU immunoreactivity during neuronal development indicates prominent CLU immunoreactivity in both cortical and hippocampal neurons in postnatal day 6 mouse pups, suggesting an important role for CLU in neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Bryan et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, inconsistencies in the understanding of CLU neurophysiology still exist, most predominantly relating to the interplay between neurotoxic stimuli and CLU expression. For instance, CLU expression is significantly altered in the brain following traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Troakes et al., 2017</xref>), ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Imhof et al., 2006</xref>), drug-induced seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schreiber et al., 1993</xref>), and ethanol exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trindade et al., 2016</xref>). However, these studies, which demonstrate the stress-mediated response of CLU, provide conflicting evidence as to whether CLU expression ameliorates or exacerbates cellular stress.</p><p>The aforementioned research gaps exist primarily because the majority of brain-based CLU research lacks an in-depth characterization of the CLU mRNA transcripts and protein isoform expression and distribution in a healthy un-challenged brain. Moreover, although CLU is sequentially homologous across species, the similarities between the rodent and human brain CLU protein expression profiles have not been thoroughly addressed. Thus, the primary goal of this study was to bring clarity to the field of brain-based CLU research by performing a thorough examination of the CLU expression profile in the rodent brain, in primary cultures of rodent and human neurons and astrocytes, and in rodent and human brain-derived cell lines. In doing so, we have identified the mRNA transcripts present in the rodent brain and the corresponding protein isoforms that are translated from each transcript. We have also characterized the cellular and subcellular distribution of individual CLU protein isoforms in the whole rodent brain, as well as the cell-type and organelle-specific location of each isoform. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the previously detected Exon-2-lacking CLU protein isoform is a mitochondrial CLU protein isoform (thus deemed mitoCLU), and that this isoform is 1) present in both neurons and astrocytes of rodent and human origins, 2) present in the mitochondrial matrix of healthy rodent brain, 3) translated from an mRNA transcript containing Exons 3–9, and 4) translated from a CUG start codon in rodents and from a canonical AUG start site in humans: all of which are novel findings in the field of CLU research. Last, we reveal for the first time that mitoCLU is present in the commercially available CLU<sup>–/–</sup> mouse model that was developed to mimic total CLU deficiency. Collectively, the data presented herein provide a complete picture of CLU gene transcription and of protein isoform expression and distribution in the healthy rodent brain, prove that the rodent brain may be utilized to study human brain-based CLU physiology and pathophysiology, and highlight a novel avenue of mitochondria-focused CLU research.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multiple CLU protein isoforms are robustly expressed in rodent brain tissue</title><p>Previous studies have indicated the expression of CLU mRNA in multiple tissue types, with mRNA predominantly detected in the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connor et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Silva et al., 1990a</xref>). However, robust mRNA levels do not always translate to robust protein levels. Therefore, CLU protein expression was examined in a panel of rodent (male and female) tissues that were known to contain CLU mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Silva et al., 1990a</xref>). The data indicate the expression of four major CLU immunoreactive bands in a whole-brain lysate [CLU_49 kDa, CLU_45 kDa, CLU_39 kDa, and CLU_36 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)], an expression pattern that was consistent throughout multiple brain regions [cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum; (Supplementary Figure A)]. Consistent with the previous literature, several CLU immunoreactive bands were also detected in peripheral tissues. However, because the primary focus of this study is brain CLU, these tissues were not investigated further in this study. As LOAD predominantly affects the cortex and hippocampus and is more prevalent in the female population, cortical and hippocampal tissues from female animals were utilized for the remainder of this study (where applicable).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48255.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CLU protein is expressed in the brain as multiple protein isoforms that have distinct cellular localizations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole brain, liver, lung, and heart tissues were isolated from age-matched male (left panel) and female (right panel) wild-type (WT) mice and homogenized as indicated.

Analysis of astrocytic fractions indicates the expression of four CLU immunoreactive bands in the cytosolic fraction (CLU_60 kDa, CLU_49 kDa, CLU_45 kDa, and CLU_39 kDa) and one CLU immunoreactive band in the nuclear fraction (CLU_60 kDa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; right panel). Although several consistencies were noted between the neuron and astrocyte CLU protein expression profiles (CLU_60 kDa, CLU_49 kDa, CLU_45 kDa, and CLU_39 kDa), two CLU protein isoforms were observed exclusively in neurons (CLU_53 kDa and CLU_68 kDa). Collectively, these data confirm the presence of multiple CLU mRNA and protein isoforms in primary cultures of rodent neurons and astrocytes. In addition, as the neuronal CLU expression profile indicates neuron-specific expression of Exon 1C mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; right panel) and of a CLU_53 kDa/CLU_68 kDa protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; left panel), these data suggest that CLU_53 kDa and CLU_68 kDa protein isoforms are probably derived from an Exon 1C-containing CLU mRNA transcript.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48255.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of neuronal and astrocytic CLU protein isoforms.</title><p>(<bold>A:</bold> left panel) Schematic of known murine CLU mRNA transcripts provided in the NCBI database.

CLU_45 kDa immunoreactivity decreases approximately 8% between the 0.1%- and 0.2%-treated groups, but in the 0.3%-treated group, there is a sharp decline that results in the loss of 94% of mitochondrial CLU_45 kDa expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; black line).

By contrast, the data indicate a certain degree of similarity between CLU_45 kDa and CoxIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; purple line) expression changes. Specifically, the expression of CLU_45 kDa and CoxIV decline sharply between the control group and the 0.1%-treated group, with relatively little change occurring between the 0.1%- and 0.2%-treated groups. However, unlike CLU_45 kDa expression, which decreases by 54% between the 0.2%- and 0.3%-treated groups, the addition of 0.3% digitonin results in only a 10% decrease in CoxIV immunoreactivity when compared to the 0.2%-treated group. This suggests that CLU_45 kDa is localized to the mitoplast but not specifically to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Consistent with CoxIV, Grp75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; blue line) immunoreactivity decreases sharply between the control and the 0.1%-treated groups, with only a slight decrease occurring between the 0.1%- and 0.2%-treated groups.

Therefore, it was presumed that translation of CLU_45 kDa was initiated in Exon 3. However, sequential analysis and alignment of human and murine CLU indicates that Exon 3 of murine CLU does not contain an ATG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Instead, murine Exon 3 contains a CTG, which encodes a Leu that is capable of functioning as a non-canonical translational start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kearse and Wilusz, 2017</xref>). To determine whether CLU_45 kDa is translated from this CTG, Myc-tagged Exon 2–9-containing or Exon 3–9-containing murine CLU constructs were overexpressed in Neuro-2a cells, and cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; upper panel) or culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; lower panel) were analyzed for CLU immunoreactivity.

Although the presence of the 45-kDa protein isoform was expected in these animals on the basis of the location of the targeting cassette used to generate the CLU<sup>–/–</sup> model, the presence of CLU_49 kDa, which we show to be the Exon-2-initiated non-glycosylated precursor of CLU_60 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), was not expected. Moreover, because our initial examination of gene and protein expression in primary neurons and astrocytes suggests that CLU_53 kDa is translated from Exon-1C-containing mRNA, the presence of this isoform was also not predicted. One possible explanation for the presence of CLU_53 kDa would be that this protein isoform is translated from an mRNA transcript containing Exon 1C and Exons 3–9, but not Exon 2, a hypothesis that is consistent with the mRNA and protein data presented here. An exact explanation for the presence of CLU_53 kDa and CLU_49 kDa is not available at this time, but these data demonstrate that the currently available CLU<sup>–/–</sup> mouse model actually represents a model of mCLU<sup>–/–</sup>. This crucial information will aid in the generation of novel mouse models that may be utilized to examine and compare the effects of mCLU deficiency, mitochondrial CLU deficiency, and total CLU deficiency in the normally aging mouse brain.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48255.012</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial CLU_45 kDa is present in the CLU<sup>–/–</sup>animal model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Total RNA was isolated from WT and CLU<sup>–/–</sup> cortical tissue. 1.5 µg RNA was reverse transcribed and 50 ng cDNA was analyzed for Exon 2- and Exon 3–4-containing mRNA.

The present study provides a detailed examination of brain CLU in various rodent and human models, including healthy rodent brain tissue, primary rodent and human neurons and astrocytes, and rodent and human brain-derived cell lines. The data presented herein provide a comprehensive list of CLU protein isoforms and the corresponding mRNA transcripts in the rodent brain, and of the cellular and subcellular localization of each identified isoform. Key among the findings is the identification of a non-glycosylated 45-kDa CLU protein isoform (deemed mitoCLU), which is localized to the mitochondrial matrix of healthy rodent brain tissue and expressed in both rodent and human primary neurons and astrocytes. The data indicate that mitoCLU is translated from Exon 3, specifically from a non-canonical CUG [aa 33 (Leu), murine] or from an in-frame AUG [aa 34 (Met), human], and that mitoCLU is present in the commercially available CLU<sup>–/–</sup> mouse model. We believe that this foundational knowledge is crucial for our ultimate understanding of the relationship between CLU and the development of LOAD.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Brain CLU protein isoforms and their localization: clarification of current understandings</title><p>The conventional understanding of CLU describes a single secreted, heterodimeric glycoprotein that is upregulated following cellular stress or the onset of neurotoxicity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Valeria Naponelli, 2018</xref>). However, in recent years, alternative CLU protein isoforms have been detected, most predominantly in cancer and cardiovascular research using immortalized human and/or rodent cells. Chief among these protein isoforms is the non-secreted, pro-apoptotic, Exon-2-deficient CLU protein isoform previously referred to as nuclear CLU (nCLU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leskov et al., 2003</xref>) and the briefly researched Exon-5-deficient protein isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>). Parallel to these findings, we demonstrate that rodent brain expresses multiple CLU immunoreactive bands of various molecular weights (CLU_68 kDa, CLU_60 kDa, CLU_53 kDa, CLU_49 kDa, CLU_45 kDa, and CLU_36 kDa, and CLU_39 kDa) that are located in distinct cellular compartments, findings that provide much needed clarity for multiple aspects of the currently available literature.</p><p>First, consistent with previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caccamo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reddy et al., 1996</xref>), we observe the expression of one nuclear-localized CLU protein isoform in rodent brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), primary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; left panel) and Neuro-2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This finding is further supported by prominent CLU immunoreactivity in the nuclei of neurons located in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, contrary to previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reddy et al., 1996</xref>), the nuclear-localized isoform has a MW of ~68 kDa, not ~45 kDa. Although no 45-kDa protein isoform is present in the nuclear fraction, 45-kDa and 49-kDa protein isoforms are detected in the organelle-containing fraction as well as in the cytosol. These isoforms are designated as mitoCLU and the pre-glycosylated form of mCLU, respectively (discussed later). Thus, our data both confirm and correct current assumptions that are made in the literature pertaining to ‘nuclear’ CLU. As the 68-kDa nucleus-localized CLU protein isoform was only detected following stringent chemical and mechanical lysis of the nuclear pellet, it is possible that this ~68-kDa protein isoform was not observed in previous studies due to incomplete extraction of nuclear proteins. Moreover, as the 45-kDa and 49-kDa CLU protein isoforms are detected in both the cytosol and the organelles, it is possible that prior detection of the 45-kDa protein isoform in the nuclear fraction was due, in part, to the use of crude cellular fractions for analysis.</p><p>Second, our data clarify the cellular localization of brain CLU protein isoforms. Specifically, the data presented here indicate that CLU mRNA and protein are abundant in both neurons and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). As relatively few studies have compared CLU mRNA and protein expression profiles between neurons and astrocytes, these data consolidate much of the early research that has provided variable evidence pertaining to brain CLU localization. For example, consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charnay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Bryan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garden et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Danik et al., 1993</xref>), we observe multiple CLU mRNA transcripts and protein isoforms in the cytosol and the nucleus of primary neurons. In addition, our analysis of astrocytic CLU directly supports previous data that demonstrate clear CLU immunoreactivity in astrocytes and/or other glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morgan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Imhof et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pasinetti et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charnay et al., 2012</xref>). The data also identify the CLU mRNA transcripts that are present in neurons and astrocytes [neurons (Exons 1B, 1C, 2, and 3–4); astrocytes (Exons 1A, 1B, 2, 3–4, and low levels of 1C)]. When examined in the context of the neuronal and astrocytic CLU protein expression profile, these data provide key insight into CLU transcription and translation. For example, neurons and astrocytes express CLU_39 kDa, CLU_49 kDa, and CLU_60 kDa as well as mRNA from Exon 1B-3, Exon 2, and Exon 3–4. It has been established that CLU_60 kDa and CLU_39 kDa represent different forms of the mature secreted CLU protein isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stewart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rohne et al., 2014</xref>) and that mCLU is translated from an AUG (Met) in Exon 2. Analysis of the CLU sequence provided by the NCBI database indicates that this Exon-2-containing mRNA also contains the untranslated region that is known as Exon 1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2019b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). As both cell types contain the mCLU protein isoforms as well as Exons 1B, 2, and 3–4, our mRNA expression data indicate that Exon 1B-9 CLU mRNA translates into CLU_49 kDa (known in the literature as the precursor or pre-protein of mCLU). Furthermore, our deglycosylation data indicate that CLU_49 kDa is glycosylated to form CLU_60 kDa (a high-mannose intermediate glycoprotein) and CLU_36–39 kDa (mCLU subunits modified by complex glycans). In addition, both cell types express CLU_45 kDa. On the basis of the data presented herein, we conclude that this protein isoform is derived from an mRNA transcript beginning in Exon 3 (discussed later). Another noted difference is the presence of Exon 1A in astrocytes but not neurons. The NCBI database indicates that both Exon-1A-containing and Exon-1B-containing mRNA translate into CLU_49 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Therefore, our mRNA data indicate that astrocytes contain two mRNA transcripts that are capable of being translated into mCLU, whereas neurons contain only one. These data provide a possible molecular explanation for early publications that postulated that astrocytes were the sole source of secreted mCLU in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pasinetti et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zwain et al., 1994</xref>). Consistent with this postulation, the astrocytic protein expression profile reveals that astrocytes primarily express mCLU protein isoforms (CLU_49 kDa, CLU_60 kDa, and CLU_36 kDa and/or CLU_39 kDa). Thus, although neurons are capable of producing de novo mCLU, it is highly probable that astrocytes generate and secrete more mCLU than neurons, probably as a means of regulating extracellular homeostasis. This possibility is supported by publications that indicate that astrocyte-secreted mCLU is necessary for maintaining the health of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dragunow et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cordero-Llana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gregory et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48255.013</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Summary of CLU mRNA transcripts and translated protein isoforms in the brain.</title><p>Three previously described and one newly hypothesized CLU mRNA transcript result in the production of five distinct protein isoforms, including one mature isoform with associated intermediates and three intracellular isoforms. The mCLU pre-protein is generated via translation of Exon-1B-containing mRNA (astrocytes and neurons; middle panel) and Exon-1A-containing mRNA (astrocytes only; upper panel). Once the mCLU pre-protein is translated, the 21-amino-acid ER-targeting sequence (majority of Exon 2) is cleaved and the resultant 427-amino-acid protein (CLU_49 kDa) is glycosylated, first by high mannose glycans (CLU_60 kDa) and then by complex glycans, followed by proteolytic cleavage to form mCLUβ (CLU_34–36 kDa) and mCLUα (CLU_36–39 kDa). Heterodimerization by five disulfide bonds results in the formation of mature CLU (mCLU; CLU_70–75 kDa), which can then be secreted into the extracellular space. In addition, on the basis of our data, we hypothesize that the Exon -C-containing mRNA transcript results in the production of the intracellular CLU protein isoform, icCLU_53 kDa, which is then post-translationally modified to form nCLU_68 kDa. The spliced transcript containing Exons 3–9 results in the production of mitoCLU_45 kDa, which is present in both human and rodent brain mitochondria and is translated from a non-canonical CUG start site in rodents.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48255-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Last, several pieces of data point to the possibility that one or more additional non-secreted CLU protein isoforms are expressed specifically in primary neurons: CLU_53 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; left panel) and CLU_68 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>; left panel, and 4A). Moreover, CLU mRNA transcript expression indicates more abundant expression of Exon-1C-containing mRNA in primary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; right panel). Collectively, these data suggest that CLU_53 kDa and CLU_68 kDa are translated from Exon-1C-containing mRNA in primary neurons, a hypothesis supported by a lack of CLU_53 kDa/CLU_68 kDa expression in cells overexpressing mouse or human pCMV6-CLU Exon 2–9 or pCMV6-CLU Exon 3–9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, analysis of the amino-acid sequence generated by the translation of Exon 1 C-9 indicates a length of 458 amino acids with a predicted MW of 52.74 kDa. Therefore, we hypothesize that CLU_53 kDa is translated from an mRNA transcript containing Exons 1 C-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Furthermore, on the basis of 1) the nuclear localization of CLU_68 kDa, 2) the cytosolic location of CLU_53 kDa, 3) the MW differences between the two isoforms, 4) the importance of ubiquitination and SUMOylation on nuclear protein localization and/or function, and 5) the fact CLU is a known target for ubiquitin, we hypothesize that CLU_53 kDa is post-translationally modified via ubiquitination or SUMOylation to form CLU_68 kDa. However, more research is needed to understand the origin and function of these alternative protein isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mitochondrial CLU is expressed in both human and murine brain and is translated from Exon 3</title><p>Preliminary immunostaining of primary cortical neurons indicated overlap between CLU immunoreactivity and the mitochondrial marker Mitotracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting a possible association between a CLU protein isoform and mitochondria. This finding is congruent with recent literature which demonstrates a mitochondria-associated CLU protein that regulates or interacts with various aspects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex-I (MRCC-I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>) and/or the Bax/Bak/Bcl-2 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Trougakos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pereira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The aforementioned publications suggest that the mCLU protein isoform is responsible for these interactions/associations; however, our data indicates that a single CLU protein isoform, CLU_45 kDa (mitoCLU), is expressed in pure rodent brain mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), specifically within the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first publication to demonstrate the expression of a CLU protein isoform in healthy brain mitochondria (rodent or human). The potential impact of this finding as it pertains to the etiology of LOAD is substantial, particularly because mitoCLU was found to be expressed in human primary neurons and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and is localized to the mitochondrial matrix — the location of mitochondrial DNA, ribosomes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the enzymes that facilitate mitochondrial respiration. Bioenergetic dysfunction is known to occur throughout the pre-clinical phase of LOAD, with observable reductions in glucose utilization occurring several decades prior to clinical onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mosconi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mosconi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoyer, 1998</xref>). Therefore, with the discovery of a mitochondria-localized CLU protein isoform, and the knowledge that the CLU AD risk allele is associated with reduced CLU protein levels, several hypotheses can easily be generated. For example, it is plausible that mitoCLU may regulate mitochondrial ribosomes, thus directly affecting mitochondrial protein synthesis and eventually ATP production. Alternatively, mitoCLU may regulate one or more steps in the TCA cycle or may directly influence one or more components of oxidative phosphorylation. However, these hypotheses require further testing before a definitive conclusion can be made.</p><p>The discovery of mitoCLU raises several questions pertaining to the mRNA transcript that results in the production of mitoCLU. Our glycosylation studies indicate that although CLU_60 kDa and CLU_36–39 kDa (murine) or 37 kDa (human) are glycosylated, CLU_45 kDa [endogenous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) or overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>)] is not impacted by endoglycosidase treatment, thus indicating a lack of Exon 2 in mitoCLU. On the basis of these data, we hypothesized that mitoCLU was translated from an Exon-3–9-containing CLU mRNA transcript. This hypothesis is consistent with data from human cells, which indicates the presence of an Exon-2-deficient protein isoform translated from amino acid 34 in Exon 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leskov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reddy et al., 1996</xref>). This hypothesis was confirmed using a series of overexpression constructs [human and murine pCMV6-CLU Exon 2–9 (Exon 2–9) or pCMV6-CLU Exon 3–9 (Exon 3–9)] in both human and murine neuroblastoma cells. Specifically, overexpression of the Exon 2–9 construct in rodent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) or human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) cells produces all of the previously observed mCLU protein isoforms [CLU_49 kDa, CLU_60 kDa, and CLU_36–39 kDa (murine) or 37 kDa (human)]. By contrast, CLU_45 kDa was consistently observed in Exon 3–9-transfected cells. Unlike human CLU, murine CLU contains a non-AUG translational start site at amino acid 33 (Leu) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Starck et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that mitoCLU is translated from a Leu (CUG) rather than a Met (AUG) start site in rodents, a possibility that is confirmed by the data presented herein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). As translation is preferentially initiated at an AUG rather than a CUG, this provides a plausible explanation as to why early literature may indicate more robust expression of this previously uncharacterized protein isoform in human cell lines, and/or a complete absence of this isoform in rodent cells and tissues. In rodent models, production of CLU_49 kDa would be predominant due to the type of translational start site present. Therefore, although Exon-3–9-containing mRNA is translated, the Exon 2–9 translated protein product(s) would be present at higher levels in a whole cell or tissue lysate. This supposition was confirmed upon the generation of three human CLU amino acid 34 variants: one representing WT human Exon 3–9 (34_ATG), one representing human CLU with the rodent amino acid 33 Leu codon (34_CTG), and the third containing a Leu codon that is incapable of initiating translation (34_CTA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The CLU<sup>–/–</sup> mouse model represents a model of mature CLU deficiency</title><p>Since the generation of the CLU<sup>–/–</sup> mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McLaughlin et al., 2000</xref>), this animal model has been utilized to study the impact of CLU deficiency in various pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Imhof et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chayka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Seo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shirasawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jung et al., 2012</xref>) and developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Our lab and others have demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McLaughlin et al., 2000</xref>) that the CLU<sup>-/-</sup> model lacks the mRNA transcript that results in the production of the secreted form of mCLU (CLU_60 kDa and CLU_39 kDa). However, mRNA and protein characterization indicate robust expression of Exon 3–4 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) and mitoCLU protein (Figure 90215624B) in the CLU<sup>-/-</sup> brain. The presence of mitoCLU was expected on the basis of the location of its translational start site, but the data also indicate the presence of CLU_49 kDa and CLU_53 kDa in CLU<sup>-/-</sup> brain tissue. It is plausible that CLU_53 kDa may be present in the CLU<sup>-/-</sup> model, but an explanation for the presence of CLU_49 kDa is currently unavailable. Despite these unexpected findings, the data clearly demonstrate that the previously utilized CLU<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model is, in actuality, a model of secreted mCLU<sup>–/–</sup>. As several studies utilize this mouse model to understand the overall impact of total CLU deficiency in pathological conditions, these data highlight the importance and a provide rationale for the development of novel mouse models that accurately represent different forms of CLU deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Strengths, limitations, and future directions</title><p>As the bulk of currently available CLU research is performed in cancer-derived immortalized cell lines and/or models of brain injury or toxicity, a major strength of the present study is the use of multiple physiological models, which provides a more accurate representation of CLU in the brain. Another strength in this study is the multi-antibody strategy that was utilized to generate an accurate representation of the total CLU protein expression profile. In addition, the data presented herein clarify the few inconsistencies between human and mouse CLU mRNA transcription and translation through sequential analysis and comparison of human and murine CLU. However, despite the in-depth examination performed, some deficiencies were noted. First, the subcellular localization of CLU_49 kDa appears to differ between adult cortical tissue and embryonic neurons/astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). It is possible that CLU protein isoforms are redistributed as needed through the developmental and aging process to differing subcellular compartments, but more work is needed to confirm this postulation. Second, deglycosylation studies indicate that mCLU protein isoforms are generated via N-linked glycosylation of CLU_49 kDa. However, CLU_49 kDa was detected in animals devoid of Exon 2. Therefore, as no explanation is available, future investigations including an in-depth analysis of CLU expression in the currently available CLU<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model are needed. Last, the data presented here demonstrate the localization of mitoCLU to the mitochondrial matrix. However, the amino-acid sequence that comprises mitoCLU does not contain a mitochondrial targeting sequence. Therefore, the mechanism of protein recognition and import is currently unknown and should be explored in future studies. In addition, as this is the first publication to identify and characterize mitoCLU conclusively, information pertaining to the function of mitoCLU in the mitochondrial matrix is not available. As recent studies have indicated that CLU may regulate various aspects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>), the impact of mitoCLU deficiency on mitochondrial function should be considered in future studies. These proposed studies are expected to further our foundational understanding of CLU physiology and its role in LOAD development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The use of animals was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kansas and followed NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.

While the membrane was being washed, TMB solution was generated by diluting 2 drops of buffering solution, 3 drops of TMB substrate, 2 drops of stabilizing solution, and 2 drops of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 5 mL ddH<sub>2</sub>O. TBST was dumped and the residual buffer was removed with a P1000 pipette. TMB solution was added and the membrane was incubated at RT with continual rocking. Following incubation, TMB solution was removed and the membrane was washed, dried, and scanned using a standard scanner.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have performed a thorough characterization of CLU protein, which is the third most prominent genetic risk factor in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. By the use of immunoblots, they confirmed the existence of several CLU isoforms, which, up to now, have been poorly characterized. A 45 kDa isoform has been demonstrated to exist in humans, but not in mice. The authors convincingly demonstrated that CLU_45 kDa protein isoform is also present in C57BL/6 mouse brains. They assumed that the CLU_45 kDa protein is present in lower levels in mice, presumably because the putative translation start site is a non-AUG codon, although they do not provide hard evidence for these claims. They proved that the CLU_45 kDa protein does not seem to have any large glycosylation patterns and they showed that it localizes to the mitochondrial matrix in female C57BL/6 mouse brains. Furthermore, they demonstrated an important flaw in commercially available CLU<sup>-/-</sup> mouse models as some CLU isoforms are still present in this model (CLU_45 kDa protein isoform, CLU_53 kDa and CLU_49 kDa).</p><p>Overall, this manuscript has the potential to significantly add to current knowledge of CLU, and the experiments seem to be rigorously conducted. Nonetheless, we do have some comments to improve the manuscript, which you can find below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The manuscript is too long, and needs to be shortened. Many methods are described in the Results section reducing the flow of the manuscript. Also, the titles of the Results sections are vague, e.g. &quot;exhibit distinct subcellular location&quot;. This should be more concise yet more specific. In general, the sentences should be shorter; currently, they are too complicated for a busy reader to quickly grasp the essential concepts. All sections, including the Introduction, Results, and Discussion, should be shortened. Similarly, figure legends include methods which are unnecessary and misleading as the reader cannot quickly access the information regarding the results.</p><p>- It is important that the (raw) data that was not shown in the manuscript would be available (preferably annotated) somewhere in publicly available repositories and/or supplementary material; e.g. &quot;it possible that this isoform is detected due to the presence of Exon 1C mRNA in the knockout model (data not shown).&quot;</p><p>- &quot;Of particular significance, we discovered for the first time a novel CLU isoform that was localized to the mitochondrial matrix and was translated from Exons 3-9.&quot; This sentence in the Abstract is misleading, because after reading the article, it becomes apparent that the 45 kDa isoform has already been detected in human cell lines before, but was never characterized.</p><p>- Figure 1A: the authors claimed the lack of differences in the CLU protein expression profiles between male and females. However, the variance in some bands is striking, specifically in lungs and heart. It would be desirable to know if the authors analyzed these samples in the same gel in order to justify their conclusion. Moreover, as the authors remarked, LOAD more frequently impacts the female population, hence, it could be interesting to decipher whether the cellular localization of the different CLU isoforms vary between female and male brains, given that both sexes have similar protein expression profile in the brain. As claimed by published study from this group, clusterin could be a link between hypometabolic phenotype and increased amyloid dyshomeostasis in early onset of AD in female mice (Zhao et al., Neurobiology of aging, 2016).</p><p>- Figure 1C. It is unclear which brain region (and consequently cell type) is analyzed in this immunohistochemistry experiment. Moreover, since the authors investigate the cell type-specific location of brain CLU proteins, I consider that a whole brain section should be tested with the same technique for this aim.</p><p>- The deglycosylation studies performed by the authors to claim that the proposed mitochondrial isoform of CLU is not glycosylated, consist in differences of molecular weight in protein immunoblots. However, some glycosylation patterns can be small, e.g. many O-linked glycosylation, not necessarily clear in a gel. Thus, I suggest to conduct a more robust experiment for post-translational modifications.</p><p>- The authors declared that human CLU_45 kDa is translated from an AUG start site in Exon 3. This conclusion is solely based on overexpression of an Exon 3-9 construct in human SH-SY5Y cells. Here, I would suggest to refer to previously published evidence that this protein isoform is indeed expressed at basal levels in human cell lines and to show more evidence of this AUG codon being, indeed, the translation start site. There is the possibility that this protein isoform is also translated from a non-canonical start site, or that the translation is even initiated from another exon. The authors should perform a transfection experiment with a mutated AUG site to show that the AUG codon on Exon 3 is effectively the translation start site.</p><p>- &quot;Moreover, as CLU_45 kDa is generated from a canonical translational start site in humans and is therefore likely translated at higher levels in the human brain, these data highlight the potential importance of mitochondrial CLU in human brain.&quot; This claim is overstating due to the lack of hard evidence about the nature of the translational start site and about the supposed higher level of translation in the human brain.</p><p>- &quot;Moreover, we have identified a novel 45 kDa mitochondrial CLU protein isoform (deemed mitoCLU) present in healthy rodent brain tissue and both human and rodent brain-derived cells.&quot; &quot;To our knowledge, this is the first publication to conclusively demonstrate the expression of a CLU protein isoform in healthy brain mitochondria (rodent or human).&quot; The authors claim the expression of the mitoCLU isoform in human brains, while they only detected it in an overexpression study in human cell cultures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48255.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The manuscript is too long, and needs to be shortened.
