In contrast, unphosphorylated CPEB4 phase separates into inactive, liquid-like droplets through its intrinsically disordered regions in the N-terminal domain.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez-Miranda and Mendez, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ivshina et al., 2014</xref>]). All four CPEBs share similar C-terminal RNA-binding domains, composed of two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) in tandem, followed by a ZZ domain, which is a zinc-binding domain with a cross-braced zinc binding topology. Consequently, the different CPEBs recognize similar <italic>cis</italic>-acting cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) on target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afroz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Igea and Méndez, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merkel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ortiz-Zapater et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pavlopoulos et al., 2011</xref>). Although up to 20–30% of vertebrate genes are regulated by CPEs, they are not all activated simultaneously. Rather, the CPEs define a combinatorial code, based on their number and distance to the polyadenylation signal (PAS), as well as the presence of additional <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, to determine the transcript-specific spatiotemporal translation pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belloc and Mendez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eliscovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mendez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pique et al., 2008</xref>). The CPE-mediated spatiotemporal patterns of translational control are further determined by the differential regulation of the CPEBs. All four CPEBs have dual functions as translational repressors and translational activators (by promoting cytoplasmic polyadenylation). This duality is differentially regulated for individual CPEB family members through post-translational modifications. Thus, it is plausible that distinct regulatory pathways provide a platform to support translational activation by cytoplasmic polyadenylation in different biological scenarios. At least for CPEB1 and CPEB3, the regulatory elements are localized in the N-terminal domain (NTD), which is highly variable both in length and composition across various CPEB orthologs and paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang and Cooper, 2010</xref>). Notably, CPEBs’ NTDs contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDR), which are more extended in CPEB2, CPEB3 and CPEB4. IDR are particularly prevalent in RNA-binding proteins and, over the last years, have been shown to drive the formation of dynamic membraneless organelles (such as P-bodies, germ granules, stress granules and the nucleolus) through phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For CPEB3 and its <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Aplysia</italic> orthologs, Orb2 and ApCPEB respectively, the switch from repressor to activator has been proposed to be regulated through a prion-like multimerization mechanism in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kruttner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Majumdar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raveendra et al., 2013</xref>). These CPEBs contain polyglutamine stretches in their NTDs that promote the formation of amyloid-like fibrils. CPEB3 multimerization is regulated by non-proteolytic mono-ubiquitination and SUMOylation, and the aggregated form promotes the polyadenylation and translational activation of its target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drisaldi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pavlopoulos et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>CPEB1 is regulated by two sequential phosphorylation events during the first meiotic division. In prophase I (PI)–arrested <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, unphosphorylated CPEB1 recruits the deadenylase poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) to inhibit translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim and Richter, 2006</xref>). Upon progesterone stimulation, Aurora kinase A (AurKA) phosphorylates CPEB1 at S174, which remodels CPEB1-mRNP from a repressor to an activator complex, thereby inducing the early wave of cytoplasmic polyadenylation required for the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and MI entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mendez et al., 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pique et al., 2008</xref>). Once the oocytes reach metaphase I (MI), Cdk1 and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) target CPEB1 to ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and this is required to activate the second or ‘late’ wave of polyadenylation and the MI–MII transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mendez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pique et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Setoyama et al., 2007</xref>). In the second meiotic division, a third or ‘late-late’ wave of polyadenylation is supported by CPEB4, which is synthesized during the early and CPEB1-mediated wave of polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belloc and Mendez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Igea and Méndez, 2010</xref>). Thus, CPEB4 is only present in the second meiotic division. However, the synthesis of CPEB4 alone is not sufficient to promote cytoplasmic polyadenylation, and progesterone stimulation is still required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2010</xref>). These observations suggest that CPEB4 is not constitutively active but has to be post-translationally modified to become active. Unlike CPEB1, CPEB4 does not harbour a consensus AurKA phosphorylation site; therefore, it is most likely activated by distinct phosphorylation event(s) during later meiotic phases. Hence, we sought to elucidate the post-translational regulation of CPEB4 that is required for it to support cytoplasmic polyadenylation after CPEB1 has been degraded and to drive the second meiotic division. Unravelling how CPEB4 activity is regulated will contribute to the overall understanding of the CPEB network in mRNA translational control and to defining the phase-specific contributions of individual CPEBs to the unidirectional progression through meiotic and mitotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giangarra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Igea and Méndez, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that CPEB4 activity is regulated by ERK2- and Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation at 12 residues surrounding two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in CPEB4’s NTD. These phosphorylation events additively activate CPEB4 for cytoplasmic polyadenylation and, consequently, are required for proper meiotic progression. Furthermore, CPEB4 hyperphosphorylation keeps CPEB4 in a monomeric and active state. In contrast, unphosphorylated CPEB4 sequesters CPE-containing mRNAs into inactive, liquid-like droplets formed through intermolecular interactions between residues in CPEB4’s NTD. These results illustrate how phase transitions can be regulated through post-translational modifications and explain how CPEB-specific mechanisms of regulation sustain and coordinate cytoplasmic polyadenylation during cell cycle progression, adapting to the cell signalling transduction pathways activated at each cell cycle phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>xCPEB4 is phosphorylated in 12 residues by ERK2 and Cdk1</title><p>To address whether <italic>Xenopus</italic> CPEB4 (xCPEB4) is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation or by alternative modifications in a cell cycle–dependent manner, we first microinjected mRNA coding for HA-tagged xCPEB4 in stage VI–arrested oocytes and then triggered meiotic resumption with progesterone. Progression from the PI arrest (stage VI) to MI (shown as germinal vesicle breakdown, GVBD) caused a change in mobility, which was maintained through anaphase/interkinesis (GVBD + 1 hr) and in the MII arrest (MII). This mobility shift was abrogated by treatment with lambda-phosphatase, indicating that xCPEB4 was phosphorylated in response to progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To further define the xCPEB4 region(s) phosphorylated in a cell-specific manner, we subdivided xCPEB4 into four fragments, with three (1–3) comprising sections of its NTD and the fourth comprising the whole RNA-binding domain (RBD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> phosphorylation of full-length (FL) xCPEB4 or the four xCPEB4 fragments with extracts from MII oocytes indicated that multiple residues were targeted in fragments 1–3 but none, or only very few, in the RBD fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To further define the phase specificity of the phosphorylation events, we tested each fragment for <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation with extracts from oocytes collected either prior to progesterone stimulation (PI arrested; VI) or at various times after GBVD, corresponding to MI (GBVD and +30 min), anaphase/interkinesis (+60 min and +90 min) and MII-arrest (+120 min and +150 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Neither FL xCPEB4 nor any of the fragments were phosphorylated by PI-arrested oocyte extracts. FL xCPEB4 and fragment 1 were phosphorylated in MI and remained phosphorylated throughout the subsequent cell cycle phases. In contrast, fragment 3 was differentially phosphorylated by the extracts from the distinct meiotic phases, following the characteristic kinetics of Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mendez et al., 2002</xref>), as shown by the phosphorylation of histone H1. The phosphorylation kinetics of fragment 2 was intermediate between fragments 1 and 3. In sum, these results indicate that xCPEB4 is phosphorylated at multiple residues in its NTD by distinct kinases that are differentially active during meiotic progression, one of which is most likely Cdk1.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19298.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>xCPEB4 NTD is phosphorylated in response to progesterone.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of xCPEB4 protein.

All these kinases are active in MII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tunquist and Maller, 2003</xref>) (for Cdks and ERK, Cdk1 and ERK2 are the active kinases in MI and MII). Phosphorylation of the FL protein was strongly inhibited by FR180204, partially inhibited by roscovitine and BI-2536, and unaffected by SL0101 and U0126, suggesting that ERK2, Cdk1 and Plk1, but not MEK or p90Rsk, target xCPEB4. Phosphorylation of fragments 1 and 2 was specifically inhibited by FR180204, whereas that of fragment 3 was more sensitive to roscovitine, suggesting that ERK2 and Cdk1 target specific regions of the xCPEB4 NTD. We further confirmed the role of ERK2 and Cdk1 in xCPEB4 phosphorylation by immunodepleting the kinases from phase-specific meiotic extracts, with the subsequent reduction of xCPEB4 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To determine the number of phosphorylated residues in each fragment, we phosphorylated the fragments 1–3 <italic>in vitro</italic> with extracts from oocytes collected at MI (GVBD), interkinesis (+1 hr) or MII arrest. The phosphorylated fragments were purified, digested and analysed by 2D phosphopeptide mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Fragment 1 yielded four main phosphopeptides (pp 1–4), with a weaker one detectable only after a long exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, pp 5). Fragment 2 contained a single phosphopeptide (pp 6), while fragment 3 had six additional phosphopeptides (pp 7–12). These phosphopeptide patterns were qualitatively maintained from MI to MII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We then compared these 2D phosphopeptide maps with those obtained using recombinant ERK2 or Cdk1/cyclin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). ERK2 generated pp 1–6 and pp 10, whereas Cdk1/cyclin B produced pp 1–3 (albeit with low efficiency), 8, 9 and 11–12. In addition, both purified kinases generated other phosphopeptides not observed after phosphorylation with oocyte extract (marked with an asterisk). The migration of some of the phosphopeptides was consistent with phosphorylation at multiple residues in the same peptide. To determine the identity of these residues, we analysed by mass spectrometry either FL xCPEB4 or N-terminal fragments that had been phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> with MII oocyte extracts or recombinant ERK2 or Cdk1/cyclin B. A total of twelve phosphorylation sites in the NTD of xCPEB4 were identified, all of which were evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

These mutated fragments were phosphorylated with MII extracts or recombinant ERK2 or Cdk1/cyclin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). Based on the resulting 2D phosphopeptide maps, we determined that most of the xCPEB4 phosphorylation sites had been identified. However, the mutated xCPEB4 fragments still contained three phosphorylation sites, corresponding to pp 1, 2 and 7, that were not detected in the mass spectrometry analysis. Accordingly, mutation of the 12 identified residues to alanine (12A) did not abolished the slower migration of xCPEB4 expressed in MII oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Thus, we conclude that xCPEB4 is phosphorylated in at least 12 sites, which most likely correspond to ERK2-mediated (S18/38/40/97/250/253/351) and Cdk1-mediated (T324/S328/330/357/362) target residues.

For this purpose, we followed the polyadenylation of a radioactive <italic>Emi2</italic> 3′-UTR probe microinjected into oocytes. Due to its arrangement of CPEs and the presence of AU-rich elements (AREs), <italic>Emi2</italic> mRNA is polyadenylated in the third (late-late) wave of cytoplasmic polyadenylation that takes place in interkinesis and MII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belloc and Mendez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pique et al., 2008</xref>) and which is supported by xCPEB4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Igea and Méndez, 2010</xref>). In this assay, overexpression of active or activatable xCPEB4 functionally replaces the endogenous xCPEB4 and therefore sustains <italic>Emi2</italic> mRNA polyadenylation, whereas a non-activatable CPEB4 variant reaches a competitive equilibrium with the endogenous protein, shortening the poly(A) tail of the target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afroz et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutation of all 12 xCPEB4 phosphorylated residues to alanine (12A) not only inactivated the protein, abolishing its capacity to support cytoplasmic polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) but was also a better competitor of polyadenylation than a truncated variant of xCPEB4 lacking the NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that the 12A mutant promotes poly(A) tail shortening. The mutant 12Am, an xCPEB4 phospho-null mutant that additionally cannot bind RNA (with mutations at Y490A and K595A), did not influence competition for polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afroz et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), indicating that the competition effect requires RNA binding. In contrast, a phospho-mimetic xCPEB4 variant (12D), in which all the phosphosites were mutated to aspartic acid, was even less competitive than the WT xCPEB4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that this mutant is constitutively active. xCPEB4 mutants in which only the seven ERK2 phosphorylation sites (7A) or the five Cdk1 phosphorylation sites (5A) were mutated to alanine showed partial and additive effects, indicating that these two kinases contribute equally to the activation of xCPEB4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Other partial mutations (10A and 8A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) also showed a partial and additive effect for the combined accumulation of mutations, indicating that all 12 phosphorylation events, mediated by the two kinases, are equally important to fully activate xCPEB4, and that a minimum of 10 phosphosites are required. Compared to 12Am, the wild-type CPEB4 (WT) was slightly competitive with endogenous CPEB4 protein, most likely due to inefficient activation or recruitment of co-factors. For this experiment, xCPEB4 variants were expressed from an mRNA where CPEB4-3’UTR was substituted by a non-CPE regulated 3’-UTR, allowing the mutant expression to scape the cell cycle regulation of endogenous CPEB4.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19298.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>xCPEB4 hyperphosphorylation is required for cytoplasmic polyadenylation and meiotic progression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>) <italic>In vivo</italic> competition assays.

Oocytes depleted of xCPEB4 completed the first meiotic division normally but failed to properly assemble chromosomes into a single metaphase plate in MII, displaying scattered chromosomes as compared to control oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Nevertheless, xCPEB4-depleted oocytes were able to properly extrude the polar body, indicating that the first meiotic division was completed successfully. Furthermore, xCPEB4 depleted oocytes failed to properly polyadenylate <italic>Emi2</italic> mRNA in the second meiotic division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We next overexpressed xCPEB4, using WT and phosphorylation mutants under the control of xCPEB4 3′-UTR, in xCPEB4-depleted oocytes. The WT and 12D xCPEB4 forms, but not the 12A mutant, rescued chromosomal assembly in the MII metaphase plate, as well as <italic>Emi2</italic> polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

We overexpressed HA-tagged 12A (phospho-null) and 12D (phospho-mimetic) xCPEB4 mutants in oocytes and, after progesterone stimulation, analysed the co-immunoprecipitated proteins by SDS silver staining and mass spectrometry. Most of the identified interacting proteins were enriched for both mutants, with some exceptions, such as chaperones (Hspd1) and RNA helicases (Ddx1 and Ddx20), which were present only in the 12A immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We specifically tested whether the two mutants could still recruit GLD2, the cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase directly responsible for poly(A) tail elongation. Again, we did not detect any differences between the phospho-mimetic and the phospho-null xCPEB4 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><p>We next addressed whether phosphorylation of xCPEB4 causes changes in its subcellular localization that could explain the differences in its activity. We overexpressed FL or NTD GFP-tagged xCPEB4 constructs, using either the wild-type or the 12A and 12D mutants for each, in U2OS cells. GFP and the GFP-xCPEB4 RNA-binding domain (RBD) were used as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both WT and 12A GFP-xCPEB4 phase-separated into cytoplasmic spherical granules when expressed in U2OS cells. In contrast, the 12D mutant exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>). The WT, 12A and 12D xCPEB4 NTDs expressed in U2OS cells distributed in patterns similar to their corresponding FL variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). The controls, of either GFP alone or the GFP-xCPEB4 RBD, exhibited diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution, suggesting that the RBD does not contribute to the granular distribution of xCPEB4. The analysed cells showed equivalent fluorescence intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>), implying that the differential ability to phase separate is not a consequence of distinct protein concentration. These results indicate that, when non-phosphorylated, the intrinsically disordered NTD of xCPEB4 phase separates into large assemblies in non-mitotic cells. Co-staining of P-bodies and stress granule markers (4E-T and DDX6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) showed no clear co-localization of these with xCPEB4. Thus, although CPEB4 re-localizes to stress granules in response to arsenite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang and Huang, 2014</xref>), inactive xCPEB4 in non-stressed cells forms cytoplasmic granules that differ from P-bodies or stress granules. To better characterize the nature of these assemblies, we performed FRAP experiments with FL or NTD GFP-xCPEB4. We determined a half-time of maximum recovery (Half Max) of 1.8 ± 0.11 s for FL GFP-xCPEB4 and of 0.76 ± 0.07 s for the NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These fast recovery rates indicate that the molecules forming the granules had a liquid-like behaviour and were in constant exchange with the surrounding cytoplasm. This feature, together with the spherical shape of the granules and the fact that we could observe fusion events over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), suggests that xCPEB4 is able to phase separate into liquid-like droplets. The difference in recovery between the FL and the NTD forms indicates that the RBD of xCPEB4, and most probably the bound mRNA, are not required for the self-assembly but influence the dynamics of these droplets.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19298.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Non-phosphorylated NTD promotes xCPEB4 distribution in cytoplasmic granules.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Representative image of (<bold>A</bold>) full-length eGFP-xCPEB4 or (<bold>B</bold>) the N-terminal domain, using the wild-type (WT) or phosphorylation mutants 12A or 12D (with the 12 phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine or aspartic acid, respectively), transfected in U2OS cells.

During meiosis, xCPEB4 accumulates in MII, during which ERK2 and Cdk1 are already active; consequently, xCPEB4 only exists in a phosphorylated active state. Thus, to evaluate the transition between the liquid-like droplet state and the monomeric active state of endogenous CPEB4, we studied human CPEB4 (hCPEB4) during the mitotic cell cycle in U2OS cells (hCPEB4 and xCPEB4 share 93% of identity and the identified phosphorylation sites are conserved). To this end, cells were synchronized in mitosis (with nocodazole or RO-3306) and selected by mitotic shake-off. As in meiosis, endogenous hCPEB4 presented a mobility shift in M-phase that disappeared upon lambda-phosphatase treatment, indicating that hCPEB4, like xCPEB4, is phosphorylated in M-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To assess if this phosphorylation reflected the transit from the liquid-like droplet state to the monomeric state, we first detected endogenous hCPEB4, in mitotic and non-mitotic cells, by immunofluorescence. Even though it did appear that in mitotic cells the distribution of hCPEB4 was more diffuse than in G1 cells, the change in size/shape of mitotic cells, as well as the increase of hCPEB4 levels during mitosis, made it difficult to quantify the distribution of hCPEB4 along the cell cycle phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To avoid these limitations, we analysed the formation of hCPEB4 assemblies by sedimentation in sucrose gradients. Vinculin was used as a reference control. 75% of unphosphorylated hCPEB4 from asynchronous cells was located in dense sucrose fractions (15–23), indicating that CPEB4 is forming large assemblies. In contrast, 84% of phosphorylated hCPEB4 from mitotic cells was located in lighter sucrose fractions (1–13), suggesting that it is in a monomeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We next analysed the association of known CPEB1-co-factors (PARN, Symplekin, CPSF2 and GLD2) with phosphorylated/monomeric or unphosphorylated/phase-separated CPEB4. First, we tested the distribution of those cofactors along the sucrose gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Symplekin, CPSF2 and GLD2 were found in both dense and light fractions, co-migrating with CPEB4 in both the liquid-like droplet state and the monomeric state. CPEB4 Co-IPs confirmed that Symplekin and CPSF2 interact with phosphorylated and unphosphorylated CPEB4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), as did GLD2 with xCPEB4 12A and 12D mutants in the oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results are consistent with the association of Symplekin, CPSF and GLD2 to both repressor and activator CPEB1-complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim and Richter, 2006</xref>). However, PARN distribution was restricted to light fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that PARN is not responsible of mRNA deadenylation in CPEB4 liquid-like droplets. We also analysed ribosome association (S6), which despite of being in the dense fractions of the gradients were not part of CPEB4 liquid-like droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figuers 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). Thus, suggesting that CPEB4 liquid-like droplets are not active in translation. Altogether, these results are consistent with the mass spectrometry results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), indicating that the change in CPEB4 activity upon phosphorylation are linked to its phase-transition and not to the differential recruitment of cofactors.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19298.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Endogenous hCPEB4 is phosphorylated and monomeric in M-phase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lambda-phosphatase assay (λ) of cell extracts from asynchronous (Async.) or M-phase U2OS cells synchronized with either nocodazole (Noco.) or RO-3306.

However, CPEB4 has to be activated before it can sustain polyadenylation in the second meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2010</xref>). Our results indicate that CPEB4 activation is driven by ERK2- and Cdk1-mediated hyperphosphorylation of at least 12 residues in the intrinsically disordered NTD. Therefore, the sequential functions of CPEB1 and CPEB4 to drive unidirectional progression through the two meiotic divisions result from two redundant mechanisms that are both translational and post-translational (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, CPEB1 is activated by AurKA upon meiotic resumption from PI arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mendez et al., 2000a</xref>), leading to the translation of the mRNAs encoding Mos, cyclin B1 and CPEB4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Igea and Méndez, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pique et al., 2008</xref>). This in turn activates the kinases ERK2 and Cdk1, which phosphorylate CPEB4 and allow it to sustain cytoplasmic polyadenylation after MI, when AurKA is inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pascreau et al., 2008</xref>) and PPI (which dephosphorylates CPEB1 S174) expression increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belloc and Mendez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tay et al., 2003</xref>).

Hence, CPEB1 and CPEB4 activities are coordinated, not only because CPEB1 controls the synthesis of CPEB4, but also because the same kinase that triggers the degradation of CPEB1—namely, Cdk1—activates CPEB4.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19298.025</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model to illustrate the sequential and coordinated functions of CPEB1 and CPEB4 in the meiotic cell cycle.</title><p>The different meiotic phases, as well as the activity profiles of ERK2 (light grey) and Cdk1/cyclin B (dark grey) along meiosis, are shown at the top.

Instead, CPEB4 phosphorylation controls its phase separation into liquid-like droplets, which are inactive for cytoplasmic polyadenylation and sequester CPE-containing mRNAs. Thence, our data support the idea that it is the phosphorylation-regulated phase-transition itself, and not the differential binding to positive or negative cofactors, what controls CPEB4 function. Interestingly, this correlation between phosphorylation and dissociation of the liquid-like droplets also occurs during the mitotic cell cycle, indicating that this regulation contributes to the CPEB4-dependent and M-phase–specific activation of CPE-regulated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giangarra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>CPEB4 assemblies share the key features of non-membrane–bound organelles that behave like dynamic liquid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</xref>). These dynamic, high-density liquid-like droplets are usually formed by repetitive, low-complexity intrinsically disordered regions, which self-assemble in micrometre-sized, near-spherical particles separated spontaneously from aqueous solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nott et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, CPEB4 assemblies are structurally and functionally distinct from the more static and inheritable amyloid-like filaments formed by active CPEB3 multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, CPEB4 liquid-like droplets are reminiscent of other two-component models for mRNA recruitment to intracellular granules: RBPs bind to mRNA via an RBD and phase separate by the interaction of their low-complexity sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</xref>). The dynamism of these structures renders potential for regulated reversibility. In the case of CPEB4, its hyperphosphorylation results in the dissociation of the liquid-like droplets, most probably through the disruption of electrostatic interactions along its disordered NTD. This mechanism provides a novel example of how phase-transitions driven by disordered regions can be regulated post-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2012</xref>), and unveils a new mechanism of translational regulation during cell cycle.</p><p>Given that CPEB4 has the potential to regulate up to 20% of the genome, with the flexibility of the high-specificity but low-affinity interactions promoted by the NTD and the hysteresis provided by the multisite phosphorylation regulation, it generates a system ideally suited to serve as a hub in scale-free networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunker et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, the regulation of CPEB4 by the additive effect of multisite phosphorylations is reminiscent of the ultrasensitive responses that drive irreversible, discrete phase transitions in meiosis, as exemplified by the switch-like regulation of Cdc25C by Cdk1 hyperphosphorylation. Partial phosphorylation of half of the possible sites already provides the highest ultrasensitivity, which may explain the polyadenylation and cell cycle progression effects of the 12A CPEB4 mutant, although it is also phosphorylated in unidentified residues (reviewed in ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferrell and Ha, 2014</xref>]). Thus, the ultrasensitivity may be driven at least in part by cumulative electrostatic interactions between NTDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borg et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte preparation</title><p>Stage VI oocytes were obtained from <italic>X. laevis</italic> females as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Moor and Richter, 1999</xref>).

Samples were in-gel digested with 0.3 μg of trypsin (Promega) (fragment 3) or trypsin followed by chymotrypsin (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (full length, fragments 1 and 2). After digestion, peptides were extracted and cleaned up on a homemade Empore C18 column (3 M, St. Paul, MN). Samples were analysed using a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled to an EasyLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific (Proxeon), Odense, Denmark). Peptides were loaded directly onto the analytical column at 1.5–2 μl/min and were separated by reversed-phase chromatography using a 12 cm column with an inner diameter of 75 μm, packed with 5 μm C18 particles (Nikkyo Technos Co., Ltd. Japan). Chromatographic gradients started at 97% buffer A and 3% buffer B with a flow rate of 300 nl/min, and gradually increased to 93% buffer A and 7% buffer B in 1 min, and to 65% buffer A/35% buffer B in 60 min. Buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in water. Buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ionization mode with nanospray voltage set at 2.2 kV and source temperature at 250°C. The instrument was operated in DDA mode and full MS scans with 1 micro scans at a resolution of 60,000 were used over a mass range of m/z 250–2000 with detection in the Orbitrap. Auto gain control (AGC) was set to 1E6, dynamic exclusion (60 s) and charge state filtering disqualifying singly charged peptides was activated. In each cycle of DDA analysis, following each survey scan, the top twenty most intense ions with multiple charged ions above a threshold ion count of 5000 were selected for fragmentation at normalized collision energy of 35%. Each sample was injected twice: fragment ion spectra produced via collision-induced dissociation (CID) and via high-energy collision dissociation (HCD). An isolation window of 2.0 m/z, activation time of 0.1 ms and maximum injection time of 100 ms were used. All data were acquired with Xcalibur software v2.2. For data analysis, the Mascot search engine (v2.3, Matrix Science) was used for peptide identification. The data were searched against NCBInr (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>). A precursor ion mass tolerance of 10 ppm at the MS1 level was used. Up to three miscleavages for trypsin were allowed. The fragment ion mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da. Oxidation of methionine, protein acetylation at the N-terminal, and phosphorylation at serine, threonine and tyrosine were defined as variable modifications; whereas carbamidomethylation on cysteines was set as a fix modification. Peptides were filtered using an expectation value [EXPECT] cutoff of 0.1.</p><p>Mass spectrometry analysis of xCPEB4 phosphorylation sites generated with ERK2 or Cdk1/cyclin B recombinant kinases was done at the Mass Spectrometry Core Facility at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona) as follows: samples were in-gel digested with trypsin at the Proteomics Platform at the Barcelona Science Park. After the digestion, samples were dried in the speed-vac and resuspended in 20 μl of 1% formic acid for LC-MS/MS analysis. Digested peptides were diluted in 1% FA. Samples were loaded into a 180 μm × 2 cm C18 Symmetry trap column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) at a flow rate of 15 μl/min using a nanoAcquity Ultra Performance LCTM chromatographic system (Waters Corp.). Peptides were separated using a C18 analytical column with a 60 min run, comprising three consecutive steps with linear gradients from 1% to 35% B in 60 min, from 35%delete to 50% B in 5 min, and from 50% to 85% B in 3 min, followed by isocratic elution at 85% B in 10 min and stabilization to initial conditions (A = 0.1% FA in water, B = 0.1% FA in CH<sub>3</sub>CN). The column outlet was directly connected to an Advion TriVersa NanoMate (Advion, Ithaca, NY) fitted on an LTQ-FT Ultra mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Up to six of the most intense ions per scan were fragmented and detected in the linear ion trap. Target ions already selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 30 s. Spray voltage in the NanoMate source was set to 1.70 kV. The spectrometer was working in positive polarity mode and singly charge state precursors were rejected for fragmentation. For data analysis, a database search was performed with Proteome Discoverer software v1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the Sequest search engine and SwissProt database (Xenopodinae, release 2013_06 and the common Repository of Adventitious Proteins, cRAP database). Searches were run against targeted and decoy databases to determine the false discovery rate (FDR). Search parameters included trypsin enzyme specificity, allowing for two missed cleavage sites, carbamidomethyl in cysteine as static modification and methionine oxidation, and phosphorylation at serine, threonine and tyrosine as dynamic modifications. Peptide mass tolerance was 10 ppm and the MS/MS tolerance was 0.8 Da.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom, Nick Proudfoot (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study describes the discovery and role of multiple phosphorylations on the regulatory RNA binding protein CPEB4 in both <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte development and in a human cell line, U2OS. The study begins by showing that the N-terminal half of this protein (NTD) is subject to multiple phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Both the sites of phosphorylation as well as the likely kinases involved (Erk2 and Cdk1) are identified by using specific kinase inhibitors together with biochemistry and mass spec analysis. The study goes on to show that phosphorylation of these specific residues are required for efficient polyadenylation activation. The final and arguably most important remaining parts of this study show that CPEB4 NTD when unphosphorylated coalesces into large structures/particles visualised as cytoplasmic bodies. These are detected by transfecting GFP-tagged CPEB4 constructs into human U2OS cells or as liquid droplets characterized by sucrose gradient fractionation and <italic>in vitro</italic> EM studies.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers find this study interesting and topical. However we have identified several points that need additional experimentation. Also reviewer 2 has provided a list of more detailed points that should also be addressed in the revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be valuable to back up the kinase chemical inhibition experiments by specifically depleting Erk2 and Cdk1 to confirm their role in CPEB4 phosphorylation. Presumably this can be done using antisense RNAs – successfully used in later experiments to deplete CPEB4.</p><p>2) In these studies exogenously expressed xCPEB4 protein mutants (dominant negative) were employed to compete with endogenous xCPEB4 in activating synthetic substrate RNA polyadenylation. These data provide evidence that xCPEB4 NTD phosphorylation is required for polyadenylation. Even though this competition assay has been employed in previous studies, it still appears to be a somewhat indirect approach to measure polyadenylation. It would be desirable to test the critical xCPEB4 protein mutants in oocytes depleted for endogenous xCPEB4 so that a direct measurement of their effects on substrate RNA polyadenylation can be tested.</p><p>3) A major issue is that it is assumed that the inactivation of the CPEB4 is due to the formation of liquid droplets that may sequester the mRNA targets. However, this conclusion has not been directly addressed. By definition the protein in liquid droplets is in equilibrium with the cytoplasmic soluble pool and therefore the reason why the protein is inactive could be indirect. For example, the protein fails to recruit some protein partner or cofactor. Liquid droplet formation may be a consequence not the cause of the inactivity. Also, it is not clear what fraction of the mRNA pool is sequestered in droplets and whether this can explain why the poly(A) tails are not extended. Therefore, this value and the proportion of the total CPEB4 population that is in the liquid droplet state need to be directly measured. In addition, are the interactions with known CPEB4 binding partners affected, as determined, for example, using co-immunoprecipitation with the human protein in human cells? This has been partially addressed for a subset of binding partners. But whether PARN or GLD2 colocalize together with CPEB4 in the droplets has not been investigated and should be. If the interactions are not affected as the authors claim, these proteins should also be present in the droplets and this raises the question of why the complexes are inactive. Such an outcome would need to be discussed in the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19298.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It would be valuable to back up the kinase chemical inhibition experiments by specifically depleting Erk2 and Cdk1 to confirm their role in CPEB4 phosphorylation. Presumably this can be done using antisense RNAs – successfully used in later experiments to deplete CPEB4.</italic> </p><p>The identification of the kinases that phosphorylate CPEB4 is based in three evidences. As the reviewer points, each approach has its own limitations, but together we believe make a strong argument for the identity of the kinases. (i) The time course of xCPEB4 (FL and fragments) phosphorylation shows that xCPEB4 is not phosphorylated in Prophase I (PI) but only after metaphase I (MI), moreover one of the fragments follows the well-characterized, and unique in oocytes, profile of Cdk1. Based on the very numerous studies dealing with kinase-activities during meiosis, these profiles narrow down the suspected kinases to a very limited number. (ii) Then, we test these candidates with inhibitors. (iii) We phosphorylate recombinant xCPEB4 with purified/recombinant kinases and compare the resulting phosphopeptide maps with those obtained with phase-specific oocyte extracts.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have now added another approach to verify the identity of the kinases. However, mRNA-targeting (to deplete the encoded protein) has two relevant technical and conceptual limitations in this case. First, in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes, this approach is only feasible for maternally encoded proteins (like xCPEB4). For proteins that are already present in PI-arrested oocytes (like ERK2 and Cdk1), targeting their mRNAs does no result in reduction of the proteins within the timeframe of the experiments. The second one, and this would apply also to mRNA-targeting in cell cultures, inhibition of ERK2 and Cdk1 in cells/oocytes will block the entry of the cell/oocyte into Metaphase. Because CPEB4 is only phosphorylated in Metaphase, the result of the experiment will be similar to the above-mentioned time-course. It will say that CPEB4 kinases are activated in metaphase but not whether CPEB4 is a direct or indirect target of ERK2 and Cdk1. This is the reason why, in the kinase-inhibitor experiments, first we obtain oocyte extracts synchronized for each meiotic-phase and then treat the extracts with the inhibitors. This approach, with the intrinsic limitations of the specificity of the inhibitors, points to a direct phosphorylation of CPEB4 by the targeted kinase(s).</p><p>To complement these approaches, we have now immunodepleted ERK2 and Cdk1 from oocyte extracts synchronized in metaphase II (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Cdk1 immunodepletion leads to a 21% reduction of xCPEB4 phosphorylation (note that Cdk1 is responsible for the phosphorylation of 5 out of the 12 identified phosphorylation sites). In the case of ERK2, which phosphorylates at least 7 residues on xCPEB4 NTD, its immunodepletion results in a 26% further reduction of xCPEB4 phosphorylation, even though ERK2 depletion was not complete. Although it is almost impossible to immunodeplete two kinases to get a near-complete abolishment of their activities, we have found a significant reduction, but not complete inhibition, of xCPEB4 phosphorylation.</p><p><italic>2) In these studies exogenously expressed xCPEB4 protein mutants (dominant negative) were employed to compete with endogenous xCPEB4 in activating synthetic substrate RNA polyadenylation. These data provide evidence that xCPEB4 NTD phosphorylation is required for polyadenylation. Even though this competition assay has been employed in previous studies, it still appears to be a somewhat indirect approach to measure polyadenylation. It would be desirable to test the critical xCPEB4 protein mutants in oocytes depleted for endogenous xCPEB4 so that a direct measurement of their effects on substrate RNA polyadenylation can be tested.</italic> </p><p>That was the rationale behind the meiotic progression rescue experiment performed in the original submission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), where endogenous xCPEB4 was replaced by xCPEB4 phospho-mutants 12D or 12A and the progression into Metaphase II was assessed (as shown by the extrusion of the polar body and the assembly of the MII metaphase plate). Because transition from MI to MII and MII arrest requires xCPEB4-mediated polyadenylation of <italic>Emi2</italic> mRNA (Belloc 2008 and Igea 2010), this was an indirect measurement of xCPEB4 activity.</p><p>Now we have repeated the experiment, depleting endogenous xCPEB4, expressing xCPEB4 12D or 12A mutants and measuring directly endogenous <italic>Emi2</italic> mRNA polyadenylation (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The result confirms the competition assay in polyadenylation of a reporter and the rescue of meiotic progression, showing that xCPEB4 12D, but not xCPEB4 12A, rescues <italic>Emi2</italic> mRNA polyadenylation.</p><p><italic>3) A major issue is that it is assumed that the inactivation of the CPEB4 is due to the formation of liquid droplets that may sequester the mRNA targets. However, this conclusion has not been directly addressed. By definition the protein in liquid droplets is in equilibrium with the cytoplasmic soluble pool and therefore the reason why the protein is inactive could be indirect. For example, the protein fails to recruit some protein partner or cofactor. Liquid droplet formation may be a consequence not the cause of the inactivity.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the cause/consequence relationship between phase-separation and translational inhibition is a difficult issue to be addressed directly (just looking at the P-body literature, for many years, gives an idea of the complexity).</p><p>In the case of CPEB4-phosphorylation/phase-separation, we think that a causal effect is more probable based in our observations. Thus, CPEB4 12A is not active in cytoplasmic polyadenylation and mediates the assembly of liquid-like droplets (LLDs), whereas CPEB4 12D drives polyadenylation and translational activation and prevents LLDs. These observations are consistent with both models:</p><p>(i)”Consequence”: CPEB4 12A assembles a repression complex, by recruiting specific cofactors, and then this complex is “stored” in LLDs.</p><p>(ii) “Cause”: CPEB4 12A, bound to mRNAs, assembles LLDs, which in turn prevent the translational activation (i.e. polyadenylation and ribosomal recruitment).</p><p>However, the first model implies that CPEB4 12A should specifically recruit cofactors that mediate the translational repression. Proteomic analysis of the proteins bound to CPEB4 12A and 12D did not identify such cofactors. Moreover, this model would imply that the LLDs would only be generated after the repression complex has been assembled, through the recruitment of co-factors. But, not only the LLDs are generated in the absence of the RRMs required to assemble the repression complex, but also purified recombinant CPEB4 (or CPEB4 N-terminal IDRs) forms LLDs <italic>in vitro</italic>, regulated by phosphorylation, in the absence of co-factors. Thus, the formation of LLDs is an intrinsic property of CPEB4 IDRs and, when the RRMs are present, CPEB4 recruits mRNAs to these LLDs, sequestering the mRNA.</p><p>As the reviewer mentions, LLDs and soluble CPEB4 are in equilibrium, which is displaced toward the LLD state when CPEB4 is not phosphorylated, and even further when the LLDs contain mRNA (as shown by FRAP experiments). Thus, in an equilibrium between translation and repression, non-phosphorylated CPEB4 would favor the repression state.</p><p>We have included the core of these arguments in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Also, it is not clear what fraction of the mRNA pool is sequestered in droplets and whether this can explain why the poly(A) tails are not extended. Therefore, this value and the proportion of the total CPEB4 population that is in the liquid droplet state need to be directly measured.</italic></p><p>To address these points we have expanded the analyses of CPEB4 phase-separation in somatic cells, comparing asynchronous cells, where CPEB4 is mainly in LLDs, with M-phase arrested cells (please note that in an asynchronous population 5-8% of cells will be in mitosis). CPEB4 complexes from these two populations were resolved by sucrose gradient-centrifugation and the resulting fractions were analyzed for CPEB4 distribution and for CPEB4-associated mRNAs.</p><p>New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> shows the distribution of CPEB4 along the gradient (as % of total intensity). In asynchronous cells, 75% of CPEB4 is in LLD (dense fractions 15-23), while in M-phase 84% is in a monomeric state (light fractions 1-13).</p><p>New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> shows the association of CPEB4 (monomeric and LLD state) to its target mRNAs: <italic>Cdc20</italic>, <italic>Spop</italic> and <italic>Mnt</italic>. These three candidates were chosen because they are specifically polyadenylated and activated in mitosis and in a CPEB4 dependent manner (Novoa et al., 2010). Thence, RNA-immunoprecipitation from specific sucrose gradient fractions shows: (i) In asynchronous cells, where the majority of CPEB4 is in the LLD state, 63% of <italic>Cdc20</italic>, 92% of <italic>Spop</italic> and 78% of <italic>Mnt</italic> mRNAs bound to CPEB4 are bound by CPEB4 in the LLD state (dense fractions). (ii) In M-phase, when CPEB4 LLDs disassemble, 75% of <italic>Cdc20</italic>, 83% of <italic>Spop</italic> and 88% of <italic>Mnt</italic> mRNAs bound to CPEB4 are bound by monomeric CPEB4 (light fractions). These results show that both physical states of CPEB4 are equally able to bind target mRNAs. We conclude that when CPEB4 is not phosphorylated its target mRNAs are majorly bound by the LLDs, while upon phosphorylation these target mRNAs are bound by monomeric CPEB4. Together with the finding that CPEB4-LLDs do not contain ribosomes, these percentages are consistent with the translational repression and activation of the mRNAs encoding these three cell cycle regulators.</p><p><italic>In addition, are the interactions with known CPEB4 binding partners affected, as determined, for example, using co-immunoprecipitation with the human protein in human cells? This has been partially addressed for a subset of binding partners. But whether PARN or GLD2 colocalize together with CPEB4 in the droplets has not been investigated and should be. If the interactions are not affected as the authors claim, these proteins should also be present in the droplets and this raises the question of why the complexes are inactive. Such an outcome would need to be discussed in the paper.</italic> </p><p>Please, note that there are no known “repression specific” co-factors for CPEB4. Identification of such repressor complex was the original aim of the CPEB4 12A IP followed by mass spectrometry, with the conclusion that no such co-factor was detected. Moreover, the association with the poly(A) polymerase GLD2 was unaffected by the phosphorylation state of CPEB4 in oocytes. These results drove us to explore if, unlike CPEB1, where the phosphorylation of a single site changes the identity of the associated proteins, for CPEB4 a change of its physical state itself and not a specific cofactor could be the cause of the regulation of its activity.</p><p>Now, we have further analyzed possible CPEB4 co-factors shared with CPEB1 repression/activation complexes. To this aim, we have performed CPEB4 co-IP in mammalian cells followed by western blot for known CPEB1 co-factors and we have checked the distribution of these co-factors along sucrose gradients. We found that both CPSF2 and Symplekin, which are distributed in both dense and light fractions of the gradients, are bound to CPEB4, without differences between the free and the LLD state (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). The association with GLD2 in mammalian cells was difficult to address by co-IP (it co-migrates with the heavy chain of the antibodies used in the IP). Nevertheless, we show that GLD2 is present in both dense and light fractions of the gradients (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which fits with the result obtained in oocytes where we show that GLD2 is equally associated with the 12A (LLD) and the 12D (monomeric) CPEB4 mutants. We failed to detect PARN in the co-IPs and, in fact, PARN is not present in the dense fractions of the gradient (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that it does not co-localize with CPEB4 in the LLD. We did also look for the presence of ribosomes in the LLD (S6) and we found that there are no ribosomes associated with CPEB4 (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, we could not find any co-factor of CPEB4 associating differently depending on its phosphorylation/physical state. However, GLD2, Symplekin and CPSF are present in both CPEB1 repression/deadenylation and activation/polyadenylation complexes (Barnard 2004. Kim 2006). So it seems difficult to extract any functional conclusion from these associations. In conclusion, we believe that our data support the idea that it is the phosphorylation-regulated phase-separation itself, and not the differential binding to positive or negative co-factors, what defines the dual role of CPEB4 as a translational repressor or activator. We have included this argument in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
