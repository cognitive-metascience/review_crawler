Asymptomatic malaria infections are not normally diagnosed or treated, posing a major hurdle for elimination efforts. One solution to this problem is mass drug administration (MDA), with success depending on adequate population participation. Here, we present a detailed spatial and temporal analysis of malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections in four villages undergoing MDA in Myanmar. In this study, individuals from neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had 2.85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-MDA in comparison to those from high adherence neighborhoods, regardless of individual participation, suggesting a herd effect. High mosquito biting rates, living in a house with someone else with malaria, or having an asymptomatic malaria infection were also predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA, even in villages with high overall participation, may frustrate elimination efforts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41023.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The global burden of malaria has decreased over the last decade. Many countries now aim to banish malaria. One obstacle to elimination is people who carry malaria parasites without showing symptoms. These asymptomatic people are unlikely to be diagnosed and treated and may contribute to further spread of malaria. One way to clear all malaria infections would be to ask everyone in a community to take antimalarial drugs at the same time, even if they do not feel ill. This tactic is most likely to work in communities that are already reducing malaria infections by other means. For example, by treating symptomatic people and using bed nets to prevent bites from malaria-infected mosquitos.</p><p>Several studies have shown that mass drug administration is a promising approach to reduce malaria infections. But its success depends on enough people participating. If enough community members take antimalarial drugs, then even those who cannot participate, such as young children or pregnant women, should be less likely to get malaria. This is called the herd effect.</p><p>Now, Parker et al. demonstrate that mass antimalarial drug administration reduces infections with malaria caused by the parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. The analysis looked at malaria infections among residents of four villages in the Kayin State of Myanmar that used mass antimalarial drug administration. People who lived in neighborhoods with high participation in mass drug administration were almost three times less likely to get malaria than people who lived in communities with low participation. Even people who did not take part benefited.</p><p>The analysis suggests that mass antimalaria drug administration benefits individuals and their communities if enough people take part. To be successful, malaria elimination programs that wish to use mass drug administration should approach communities in a way that encourages high levels of participation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>plasmodium</kwd><kwd>mass drug administration</kwd><kwd>spatial epidemiology</kwd><kwd>herd effect</kwd><kwd>elimination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101148/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1081420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dondorp</surname><given-names>Arjen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Given sufficient population adherence, mass drug administration for falciparum malaria can provide group level benefits, also known as ‘herd effects’.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mass drug administration (MDA) is the provision of medications to entire target populations and the approach has been used for many infectious diseases, including lymphatic filariasis, soil-transmitted helminths, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, and trachoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Keenan et al., 2013</xref>). MDA has historically been used for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Poirot et al., 2013</xref>) and has recently been trialed in several locations in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Gitaka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mwesigwa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shekalaghe et al., 2011</xref>) and Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Manning et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tripura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pongvongsa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Landier et al., 2017a</xref>). It is being considered by several nations as a tool (to be used in unison with other interventions) for elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zuber and Takala-Harrison, 2018</xref>), and has already been implemented as an operational strategy in at least one modern setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Parker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Landier et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>Given that drug pressure (through provision of antimalarial drugs) provides a survival advantage for resistant parasites, there has been some hesitance in using MDA for malaria. One historical malaria eradication campaign relied on the inclusion of sub-therapeutic levels of antimalarials distributed in table salt across large populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pinotti et al., 1955</xref>). This program likely led to the emergence of parasite resistance in the same regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wootton et al., 2002</xref>) and this has in part led to hesitance among some institutions (i.e. the World Health Organization and ministries of health) to implement MDA for malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">World Health Organization, 2015a</xref>). MDA should ideally be used in settings with strong public health infrastructure, including easy access to diagnosis and treatment; an up-to-date and responsive surveillance system; and effective community engagement. Used appropriately, MDA can quickly reduce or eliminate parasite reservoirs and can act as a catalyst for subregional elimination of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Landier et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>While antimalarials are usually administered following diagnosis (confirmed or presumed) or used as a prophylactic, MDA is used because of an intended population- or community-level effect. The rationale is that the transmission potential or reproductive rate of malaria is so high that a sufficient amount of the parasite reservoir needs to be removed in order to disrupt transmission. This group-level effect is also referred to as a ‘herd effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">John and Samuel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pollard et al., 2015</xref>) and the concept applies to most communicable diseases. If a sufficient amount of the population participates in MDA, transmission chains cannot be sustained and transmission will cease, ultimately leading to a reduction in malaria morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>). There is likely to be a context-specific critical threshold for MDA coverage, below which the reduction of the parasite reservoir is not sufficient to halt ongoing transmission. Some literature has suggested that at least 80% coverage and adherence of MDA in the targeted population is necessary in order for the MDA to be successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">World Health Organization, 2015b</xref>). If the aim for antimalarial MDA is to interrupt transmission, the notion of a herd effect providing additional levels of population protection is plausible but has not been examined empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cotter et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Drawing from detailed micro-epidemiological and spatial data from an MDA trial in Kayin State, Myanmar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we describe geographic and epidemiological patterns of clinical and subclinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in villages undergoing MDA. We investigate associations between individual- and group-level participation in MDA (potential direct and indirect effects, respectively); subclinical infections; and clinical episodes of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> post-MDA. Such empirical research is important for providing an evidence base for further research, intervention, and policy work.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41023.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Map indicating the locations of the study villages along the Myanmar-Thailand border; and the distribution of houses, mosquito catch sites and malaria posts within study sites.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41023-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>3229 villagers (1689 male) were included in this study.

There was an apparent group level effect from MDA adherence, suggesting herd protection and evident from three lines of evidence.</p><p>First, clinical episodes decreased among all groups for a longer period than the prophylactic effect (approximately 1 month) of the administered antimalarials. This group level protective effect from MDA was also evident in the rainy season following MDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) which corresponded to a surge in vector activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). Once the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> outbreak began (M12), there was a lag of approximately 1 month between the onset of clinical episodes in neighborhoods with mid and low MDA adherence and then occurred in neighborhoods with high MDA adherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Second, neighborhoods with high MDA adherence never experienced the same levels of infection as those with mid or low MDA adherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Individuals who participated in MDA but lived in a neighborhood with low adherence had the highest risk of having a clinical episode whereas those who did not participate in MDA but lived in a neighborhood with high adherence had the lowest risk of having a clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> episode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As has been described in other settings, this individual-level finding may be related to relative perceptions of risk; with potential complacency among individuals living in areas with lower levels of malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Koenker et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Third, the results from the multivariable logistic regression also suggest that living in a neighborhood with a high proportion of people who did not adhere to MDA was a significant risk factor for acquiring a clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> episode, after adjusting for individual MDA adherence and other important predictors of having a clinical episode (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of a herd effect conferred by MDA for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria.</p><p>The increase in clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> episodes post-MDA also corresponded to an increase in village HBR. HBR also peaked in one other village (HKT) at the same time as in village TOT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>), but occurred in the absence of a detectable parasite reservoir and the HBR did not persist at high levels. Evidence also suggests that the MP in TOT was not functioning well in the first year of the study (reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Landier et al., 2017a</xref>). The combination of a persisting parasite reservoir and persistently high HBR (from M13 – M18) in TOT likely explains the drastically different results between the study villages with regard to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria elimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A better functioning MP in TOT would likely have reduced the size of the outbreak.</p><p>Clustering of uPCR-detected <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections across houses occurred for limited periods of time only prior to MDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This clustering suggests that interventions such as reactive case detection would have resulted in the detection of extra cases (of both clinical and uPCR-detected <italic>P. falciparum</italic>) when searching within houses and occasionally in neighboring houses, but these would have only been a small proportion of all infections within the villages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Parker et al., 2016</xref>) and would not have halted transmission. Conversely, community based early diagnosis and treatment and MDA with high participation, targeted at the village scale or larger, appear effective at reducing prevalence, incidence, and transmission of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Landier et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>There are several limitations to this work. Individuals who did not participate in MDA also did not participate in blood screenings immediately after MDA (i.e. M3 in village TOT). uPCR-detected infections are therefore likely to be underdiagnosed for these individuals, and it is likely that such infections clustered and overlapped with the clusters of non-adherence to MDA. While no genetic analyses were done with samples from the village, it is likely that these underdiagnosed infections, combined with the high HBR, led to a resurgence of clinical episodes. There is also evidence of a poorly functioning MP in this village, which could have led to undiagnosed clinical episodes, especially during the beginning of the study. Some infections are likely to be acquired outside of the village, leading to complex spatial patterns in infections that are mapped at the house level. Within-household clustering can be the result of within-household transmission, or shared exposure outside of the household or village among household members. Finally, these data come from a limited number of villages (total of 4), with analysis of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> episodes coming from the sole village that continued to have <italic>P. falciparum</italic> after MDA. Given that clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> episodes post-MDA were only possible to analyze in a single village, and that neighborhoods were not discrete and overlapped (100 m buffer around each house), a neighborhood-level effect was not included in this analysis. It is possible that the confidence intervals around the neighborhood MDA adherence variable are therefore too small and would not have been statistically significant had a neighborhood effect been included. This work would benefit from analyses with larger datasets.</p><p>This work has relevance with regard to further research and practice concerning MDA. While participation is obviously crucial to success, there is unlikely to be a single adherence proportion that can be applied in all situations. In this study, the elimination efforts were successful in three out of four villages even though one of those villages (HKT) had a similar overall adherence to the village with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> remaining after MDA (TOT). Likewise, this work points toward the need for considering spatial scale in MDA and in MDA adherence. Most current MDA trials and programs in the GMS and elsewhere consider a single village or community as the target unit. In some cases, especially when high prevalence villages are spatially clustered across a landscape, it may be necessary to target units above the village level (i.e. groups of villages).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study location and design</title><p>The study site consisted of four villages (KNH, TPN, HKT, and TOT) along the Myanmar-Thailand border, in Kayin (Karen) State, Myanmar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Landier et al., 2017b</xref>).

During model selection, a random intercept was also tested for household but resulted in no significant model improvement and was therefore excluded in subsequent models.</p><p>Different specifications (continuous, binary, ordinal) for individual and neighborhood level MDA adherence were tested in initial models. The continuous specification for individual level MDA adherence was calculated as the proportion of all doses of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine taken (total of 9 possible). A binary specification for whether or not an individual had taken one or more rounds of MDA was also tested. The continuous specification for neighborhood level MDA non-adherence was the proportion of all individuals within a 100 m radius who took no rounds of MDA. An ordinal specification was also tested, based off of the distribution of the data and categorized by tertiles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). The use of categorical or binary variables allowed us to test for temporal effects by different levels of neighborhood participation and by whether or not an individual participated in MDA via hazards curves for each category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) These categorical specifications were chosen for the final models in the manuscript based on model fit statistics (AIC and BIC did not indicate that models with continuous predictors provided a better fit) and in order to maintain consistency with the visualizations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

Understanding the effect of community-level protection that results from mass drug administration campaigns is currently a key gap in planning for malaria elimination activities. The data are impressively detailed.</p><p>However, we have concerns around the presentation of ideas, results, and conclusions with the overall narrative lacking cohesion/focus. For example, the aim of the work is to look at the presence of herd immunity as a result of MDA but the majority of the introduction section focuses on justifying the use of MDA instead of the literature around adherence being a critical factor in the success of MDA, the concept of herd immunity, how critical thresholds for coverage do not exist but potential ways of estimating them etc. Also, the subsequent sections jump between outcome of temporal and spatial analysis, between Pf vs. Pv and infection vs. clinical case making it hard to follow. Overall, the aims, results, and discussion do not match the title and conclusions of paper. We suggest that the authors take time to carefully frame the story they are trying to tell. One suggestion would be to include the Pv work as supplemental information. The outcome of the MDA on Pv is essentially a null result with the MDA implementation not being designed to have an impact on transmission (no radical cure). The findings are important but not surprising and therefore could be included as supplemental so it doesn't detract from the main and more interesting outcome of the impact on Pf.</p><p>A second major concern is that the work does not appear to be placed within the larger research and programmatic context. A lot of the research from the GMS region come from this institution, but degree of self-citation is concerning with ~50% of references coming from the research group. Furthermore, the authors appear to be drawing conclusions achieved in other papers without referencing instead of focusing on the aims of this specific piece of work. For example, the Discussion section comments on individual-level results, that were not presented in this paper but have been highlighted in other papers, on the same data without referencing (e.g. &quot;no protective effect.[…] at the individual level&quot;; &quot;those who lived in […] regardless of their individual participation in MDA&quot;).</p><p>Third, the approach taken to estimate HBR, a key factor suggested to contribute to reintroduction of Pf transmission is questionable. Although a pragmatic approach, what level of spatial bias has been introduced by attributing household-level HBR values based on the nearest trapping site? Given the known high-degree of spatial heterogeneity at small scales in mosquito abundance, would this add an additional level of bias when just selecting the nearest sampling point? Would it be more appropriate to aggregate HBR according to neighborhood as has been defined by the adherence variable to ensure spatial congruence? This can be achieved by creating prediction surfaces using model based geostatistical methods with the HBR variable as outcome and then taking the mean predicted HBR using the same window size as for adherence.</p><p>That said, there are many strong points about the analysis e.g. the possibility to look at both individual level and area-level covariates, and the measurement of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and relationship between the two.</p><p>An interesting result was the apparent clustering of resurgent cases in the area with lower adherence to MDA in one village (apparent smaller herd effect). But the evidence for this was rather weak – it was based mainly on one cluster of non-adherence in one village, which also happened to experience a higher number of cases. This seems potentially explained by the higher biting rate of mosquitoes in this part of the village rather than the non-adherence, but it was not clear whether there was multivariate adjustment to check this? Also, the asymptomatic infections did not seem to follow the same pattern. Including this finding in the title and as a key result elsewhere in the paper places too much confidence in this result, and the conclusions should be more cautious. Perhaps generally the limitations of spatial analysis within only 4 villages could be further acknowledged.</p><p>We also suggest the authors explore further the effect of individual level adherence vs area-level average adherence, specifically are non-adherent individuals living in high-adherence neighbourhoods protected, compared with non-adherent individuals in low-adherence neighbourhoods? (and vice versa) It is not really clear at the moment whether this is a spatial effect, or whether it's just perhaps that non-adherent people are both more likely to be infected and to live in non-adherent neighbourhoods (subsection “Spatiotemporal patterns in uPCR-detected infections, clinical episodes and MDA adherence” and subsection “Longitudinal analysis of clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> episodes”). If a critical cutoff value for adherence levels to achieve a 'herd immunity' during MDA campaigns could be estimated using these data, it would be a major finding and significant improvement to this work. This would be possible to do with these data using ROC analysis with the continuous adherence variables.</p><p>Last, in general it was not clear whether multivariate analysis was done – if so, it would be important to see the effect of each variable after adjustment. If not, the authors need to explain why multivariate analysis was not performed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Herd protection against <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infections conferred by mass antimalarial drug administrations&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The revised version of the paper is much improved but could be further strengthened by focusing the Introduction and Discussion section around the objective of the paper, instead of the more general role of MDA as is currently written. Specifically, I suggest that the authors should address the following comments.</p><p>Introduction: Are the authors trying to say that MDA should supplement existing malaria programs/used when the full package doesn't eliminate transmission (as is already stated)? There is an argument that this intervention could bypass weak health systems to interrupt transmission and it has been used under alternative scenarios (e.g. Ebola epidemic response). Should this be 'should ideally be used in settings…'</p><p>The potential risks associated of using MDA are missing from the introduction (i.e. developing drug resistance). Why has the WHO avoided recommending it for so long? What's changed their stance?</p><p>Introduction: The justification that MDA is used to achieve a population level effect is missing important nuances (and offers some repetition). The rationale of MDA is typically argued from the biological perspective whereby the transmission potential/reproductive rate of malaria is so high, to achieve interruption, enough of the parasitic reservoir needs to be removed before it has the chance to fuel subsequent infections. The concept of a &quot;herd effect&quot; applies in most communicable disease systems: If enough of the population is protected, transmission chains cannot be sustained and transmission with die out. What is 'enough' is unknown as stated and is affected by the propensity for diseases to cluster in populations (defined either spatially or demographically). If the aim of MDA for malaria is to interrupt transmission chains, the notion of a herd effect providing additional levels of population protection is plausible but has never been examined empirically.</p><p>Subsection “Analysis”: what was the rationale for using a 100m radius. Are the results affected according to size of buffer?</p><p>Subsection “Analysis”: is there an impact when considering individual level (e.g. proportion of individuals non-compliant) vs household level (e.g. households with &lt;/&gt; 80%? compliance) non-compliance?</p><p>Discussion section: MDA adherents in low-adherence areas had highest risk? Even compared to those in the same neighborhoods with low-adherence? This is an interesting finding consistent with what has been observed with bednets: those who have the most malaria are more likely to adhere to interventions, potentially related to perceptions of risk.</p><p>Discussion section: I would encourage authors to split this paragraph into 3 sections to ensure that these key observations can be discussed in depth.</p><p>Discussion section: do the authors have evidence to support this counterfactual? Or do they mean would have likely/may have resulted in… ?</p><p>Discussion section: I'm not sure of the relevant of this paragraph to the objectives of the work. The focus is on the herd protection or am I missing a connection between adherence and the more general rational for MDA? What are the potential limitations to MDA when considering the potential impacts of herd protection that may be specific to this setting?</p><p>Discussion section: Similar to point above, the objective is the work is related to herd immunity and the concluding remarks seem to focus on the general impact of MDA. Here, I would encourage the authors to include some insight revolving around the potential that comes with an improved understanding of the herd effect for malaria control and elimination activities. Next steps for further exploring this phenomenon?</p><p>Discussion section: The objective of the study was to look at the herd effect and the impact of non-adherence. I would encourage the authors to re-write this first paragraph of the discussion to focus on this instead of what has been reported in other publications.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Potential herd protection against <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infections conferred by mass antimalarial drug administrations&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Neil Ferguson (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some minor remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below in the individual reports.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>I had no substantive concerns with the previous version and feel that the manuscript is essentially suitable for publication.</p><p>However, in the course of the review process the authors have made incremental amendments that understate the very real concerns that exist around the potential for selection of resistance by MDA. In particular, reference 18 (one of the authors' own publications, which is not so easy to access because of a paywall) is cited to support the contention that there is &quot;no evidence of resistance emerging as a result of controlled, targeted MDA with the use of therapeutic drug levels&quot;. Arguable, such evidence is exactly what was reported by Trigg et al. for pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine in Tanzania (Trig.et al., 1997). Even if there were no evidence, the absence of evidence is not good evidence for absence of an effect, and the case for no effect seems to be summarised in the Abstract of von Seidlein and Dondorp 2015 by the statement &quot;it is difficult to conceptualize how targeted malaria elimination could contribute to artemisinin resistance…&quot;. The wording here is critical: it is rather easy to conceptualise how failed attempts at elimination using MDA could lead to resistance, especially if drug use is not well controlled. Since this paper is not about drug resistance, I think that the claims about resistance in the Introduction should be removed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>I copy here my previous review and the authors' response, with my current response below:</p><p>“The authors have made substantial revisions based on the previous reviews and most points are thoroughly addressed. I like the new Figure 4.</p><p>The idea of a herd effect is interesting and certainly worth reporting, but my only remaining concern is that the conclusions and title are too strong based on the limited data from one village and also analytical problems.

At the very least the authors should consider wording the abstract and title more cautiously – to clarify that this herd effect was only seen in one village and more investigation is needed to verify whether this is a real phenomenon.”</p><p>“Yes, this is an approach used, for example, by Ali et al. (2005, Lancet, &quot;Herd immunity conferred by killed oral cholera vaccines in Bangladesh&quot;) and in some ways it would be ideal. With our data some problems would remain though because any discrete spatial units (&quot;neighborhoods&quot;) that are imposed on the villages would be arbitrary and since the villages are quite small, there would only be 4-5 each (unless using very small &quot;neighborhoods&quot;). For the one village with Pf after MDA, we'd only have 4 or 5 neighborhoods and we would question if a random intercept would actually be useful, given that there are assumptions about the mean and variance of the random intercept.</p><p>There is also a spatial argument to be made in that an arbitrary boundary or line that would split such areas within the village would be creating a boundary between houses that are extremely close to each other. If geographic proximity is important here, and we believe it is, then we would actually lose a lot of information by using this approach.</p><p>Regardless, the reviewer is correct that we need to be cautious in our wording here. We have taken the suggestion to word the Title and Abstract more cautiously, and we discuss some of these issues in the Discussion section.”</p><p>Thank you for addressing these points very well in terms of altering the abstract and title. For my last suggestion, please can the authors either (a) explicitly state that the confidence interval reported for the paper's main result is likely to be much too narrow, because it tests for the effect of a neighbourhood level variable (coverage within 100m of a household) using individual level data without allowing for neighbourhood effects. Or (b) remove the confidence interval entirely and explain why it could not be calculated. Or (c) try an alternative analysis.</p><p>I appreciate the difficulties of doing an analysis which incorporates neighbourhood effects, but the confidence interval of the main result in the Abstract, shown in subsection “Longitudinal multivariable analysis of clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> episodes” as it stands must therefore be incorrect (AOR: 2.85; CI: 1.28 – 6.37). It would be unlikely to be a significant result if neighbourhood effects were included. It is still an interesting result, which could be explored further in other larger datasets.</p><p>Otherwise the manuscript is very interesting and useful, and I have no further comments.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This work is much improved. I have no additional comments and recommend the work for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41023.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>[…] 1) However, we have concerns around the presentation of ideas, results, and conclusions with the overall narrative lacking cohesion/focus.

The analysis of risk factors for acquiring a clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> episode after MDA (results in Table 2) uses a multivariable regression which includes both individual and group (“neighborhood”) level variables for MDA adherence.

We agree that a smoothed surface would be better, however we don’t believe that these data are appropriate for making prediction surfaces. There were only 5 catch sites per village and most villages are not in geographic proximity to each other (therefore not appropriate to make a single surface for all villages). The catch sites are not systematically distributed through the villages and their geographic extent is not as broad as the geographic extent of houses in each village. We would therefore have to create interpolations from only 5 points and then extrapolate outside of the 5 points to meet the geographic range of the villages. To address this problem in our analysis we have therefore opted to use HBR calculations at the village level in the regressions. This is still simplistic and doesn’t address micro-scale heterogeneities. In the absence of detailed human movement data and HBR outside of the village, we believe that this specification for HBR is the best possible approach with these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) An interesting result was the apparent clustering of resurgent cases in the area with lower adherence to MDA in one village (apparent smaller herd effect).

If the aim of MDA for malaria is to interrupt transmission chains, the notion of a herd effect providing additional levels of population protection is plausible but has never been examined empirically.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now attempted to incorporate these nuances and some of this text (reworded) into this part of the manuscript:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>“While antimalarials are usually administered following diagnosis (confirmed or presumed) or used as a prophylactic, MDA is used because of an intended population- or community-level effect. […] If the aim for of antimalarial MDA is to interrupt transmission, the notion of a herd effect providing additional levels of population protection is plausible but has not been examined empirically [22].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Analysis”: what was the rationale for using a 100m radius. Are the results affected according to size of buffer?</p></disp-quote><p>The 100m radius was relatively arbitrary, but we did do a sensitivity analysis on the buffer size. We’ve added this detail in the Appendix now:</p><p>“The sensitivity of the model results with regard to the neighborhood MDA non-adherence buffer size was also tested. Neighborhood MDA-non-adherence was tested with varying buffer sizes, beginning with a radius of 20m and going up to a radius of 220m, by 40m intervals. Neighborhood buffers from 60m to 140m were statistically significant and had comparable model adjusted odds ratios (at 60m: AOR = 2.33; CI: 1.03 – 5.25; at 100m: AOR = 2.84; CI: 1.29 – 6.27; at 140m: AOR = 2.35; CI: 1.06 – 5.19). Small buffers (i.e. 20m) included only one or very few households. At larger buffer sizes (<underline>&gt;</underline> 180m) most houses were included within a buffer (furthest distance between any two houses was approximately 1km) leading to little spatial heterogeneity in participation across the village.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Analysis”: is there an impact when considering individual level (e.g. proportion of individuals non-compliant) vs household level (e.g. households with &lt;/&gt; 80%? compliance) non-compliance?</p></disp-quote><p>For this analysis we’ve only considered the individual level. We prefer to not do the analysis using the household level because of the variation in household size (histogram attached here). For example, a house with 10 members and 80% adherence could still have 2 members with parasites in their blood while a house with 5 members and only 60% adherence would still have 2 members with parasites in their blood. Arguably, these 2 individuals are equally infective for others in the neighborhood, but would be treated as though they were completely different if we analyzed based on the house level.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41023-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion section: MDA adherents in low-adherence areas had highest risk?

In particular, reference 18 (one of the authors' own publications, which is not so easy to access because of a paywall) is cited to support the contention that there is &quot;no evidence of resistance emerging as a result of controlled, targeted MDA with the use of therapeutic drug levels&quot;. Arguable, such evidence is exactly what was reported by Trigg et al. for pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine in Tanzania (Trig et al., 1997). Even if there were no evidence, the absence of evidence is not good evidence for absence of an effect, and the case for no effect seems to be summarised in the Abstract of von Seidlein and Dondorp 2015 by the statement &quot;it is difficult to conceptualize how targeted malaria elimination could contribute to artemisinin resistance…&quot;. The wording here is critical: it is rather easy to conceptualise how failed attempts at elimination using MDA could lead to resistance, especially if drug use is not well controlled. Since this paper is not about drug resistance, I think that the claims about resistance in the Introduction should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We were unsure of whether or not the reviewer wanted us to discard all discussion/claims about resistance in the paragraph – but we agree with a previous suggestion that the hesitancy for using MDA should at least be mentioned. We felt that the most contentious statement was the one referred to above (“with no evidence of resistance emerging as a result of controlled, targeted MDA…”) and we have therefore removed this statement from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] For my last suggestion, please can the authors either (a) explicitly state that the confidence interval reported for the paper's main result is likely to be much too narrow, because it tests for the effect of a neighbourhood level variable (coverage within 100m of a household) using individual level data without allowing for neighbourhood effects. Or (b) remove the confidence interval entirely and explain why it could not be calculated. Or (c) try an alternative analysis.</p><p>I appreciate the difficulties of doing an analysis which incorporates neighbourhood effects, but the confidence interval of the main result in the Abstract, shown in subsection “Longitudinal multivariable analysis of clinical P. falciparum episodes” as it stands must therefore be incorrect (AOR: 2.85; CI: 1.28 – 6.37). It would be unlikely to be a significant result if neighbourhood effects were included. It is still an interesting result, which could be explored further in other larger datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>Done. We have included the following statement at the end of the Discussion section, immediately before stating our conclusions:</p><p>“Given that clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> episodes post-MDA were only possible to analyze in a single village, and that neighborhoods were not discrete and overlapped (100m buffer around each house), a neighborhood-level effect was not included in this analysis. It is possible that the confidence intervals around the neighborhood MDA adherence variable are therefore too small and would not have been statistically significant had a neighborhood effect been included. This work would benefit from analyses with larger datasets.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
