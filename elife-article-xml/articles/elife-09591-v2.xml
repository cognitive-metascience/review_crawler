silencing of transposons and a subset of genes. 24 nt siRNA biogenesis requires nuclear RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2) and DICER-like 3 (DCL3). However, siRNA precursors are mostly undefined. We identified Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs (P4R2 RNAs) that accumulate in <italic>dcl3</italic> mutants and are diced into 24 nt RNAs by DCL3 in vitro. P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nt and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. RDR2 terminal transferase activity, also demonstrated in vitro, may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P4R2 RNA 3’ termini. The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5’ or 3’ ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model whereby siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09591.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09591.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09591.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes contain instructions for processes in cells and therefore their activities must be carefully controlled. The addition of small chemical tags called methyl groups to DNA is one of the many ways by which cells can influence gene activity. These methyl groups can silence genes by altering the DNA so that is more tightly packed within the nucleus of the cell. Virus genes and mobile sections of DNA called transposable elements (sometimes known as jumping genes) are also silenced by DNA methylation to keep them from doing harm.</p><p>In plants, methyl groups can be attached to DNA by proteins that are guided to the DNA by molecules called short interfering ribonucleic acids (or siRNAs for short). Each siRNA is made of a chain of 24 building blocks called nucleotides and is able to bind to matching RNA molecules that are attached to the target DNA. The siRNAs are made from longer RNA molecules in a process that involves trimming by an enzyme called DCL3. However, it is not clear how long these “precursor” molecules are before DCL3 cuts them down to size.</p><p>Here, Blevins, Podicheti et al. studied how siRNAs are made in a plant called <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The experiments show that RNAs containing around 26-45 nucleotides accumulate in cells that lack DCL3 and these cells are unable to make 24 nucleotide long siRNAs. Furthermore, the purified DCL3 enzyme can cut these precursor RNAs to make the siRNAs. Because the precursors are relatively short, the experiments suggest that DCL3 only cuts each precursor RNA once when making siRNAs.</p><p>Blevins, Podicheti et al. also show that the siRNA precursors are made by a partnership of two RNA synthesizing enzymes. Therefore, a challenge for the future will be to understand exactly how they work together.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09591.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09591.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>RNA silencing</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>RNA-directed DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>noncoding RNA</kwd><kwd>RNA interference</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM077590</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pikaard</surname><given-names>Craig S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pikaard</surname><given-names>Craig S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF3036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pikaard</surname><given-names>Craig S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The 24-nucleotide long siRNAs that guide cytosine methylation in Arabidopsis are made by dicing short double-stranded RNAs that are only around 30 nucleotides long.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In plants, transposable elements, transgenes, repetitive sequences and endogenous genes can be transcriptionally silenced by RNA-directed DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pikaard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wierzbicki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang and Zhu, 2011</xref>).

These enzymes are nuclear RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Onodera et al., 2005</xref>), nuclear RNA polymerase V (Pol V; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanno et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pontier et al., 2005</xref>) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xie et al., 2004</xref>). Pol IV and Pol V are 12-subunit enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ream et al., 2009</xref>) that evolved as specialized forms of DNA-dependent RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haag et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haag and Pikaard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lahmy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ream et al., 2009</xref>). RDR2 is one of six single-subunit RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wassenegger and Krczal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xie et al., 2004</xref>). Pol IV and RDR2 are each essential for the biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs and they physically associate in Arabidopsis and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haag et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Law et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that their activities are coupled for the production of double-stranded siRNA precursors from initial DNA templates. Pol V is not required for siRNA biogenesis at most loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mosher et al., 2008</xref>) but generates non-coding RNAs to which siRNA-AGO4 complexes bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wierzbicki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2009</xref>). The C-terminal domain of the Pol V largest subunit also interacts with AGO4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">El-Shami et al., 2007</xref>). Together, these RNA and protein interactions bring AGO4 to the vicinity of the DNA transcribed by Pol V, allowing recruitment of DNA methylation and chromatin-modifying activities that bring about transcriptional gene silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Genetic evidence suggests that coordinated Pol IV and RDR2 transcription yields double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that are then cleaved by DICER-like 3 (DCL3) to produce 24 nt siRNA duplexes, one strand of which is incorporated into AGO4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zilberman et al., 2003</xref>) or a closely related Argonaute protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mallory and Vaucheret, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>). Because Pol IV localization is unaffected in <italic>rdr2</italic> null mutants, but RDR2 is mis-localized in Pol IV null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pontes et al., 2006</xref>), Pol IV has been thought to act first in the pathway, generating single-stranded RNAs that then serve as templates for second strand synthesis by RDR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pikaard, 2006</xref>). Current models have also presumed that dsRNAs made by Pol IV and RDR2 are long, perfectly paired duplexes that can be diced into multiple siRNAs, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Pol IV and RDR2 will synthesize short transcripts from oligonucleotide templates in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haag et al., 2012</xref>), but the sizes of transcripts they are capable of generating is unclear, in vitro or in vivo. Recently, Pol IV and RDR2-dependent transcripts that accumulate in vivo in <italic>dcl2 dcl3 dcl4</italic> (<italic>dcl2/3/4</italic>) mutants were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In that study, RNAs were fragmented prior to sequencing and short sequence reads that overlapped were then assembled, computationally, into longer contiguous sequences. These analyses led to the conclusion that Pol IV and RDR2 generate transcripts that can be many hundreds of nucleotides in length, and thus large enough to encode multiple siRNAs, as in current models. Here, we present RNA blot hybridization, deep sequencing, in vitro transcription and in vitro DCL3 dicing results that yield a different interpretation, showing that Pol IV and RDR2 primarily generate dsRNAs shorter than 45 nucleotides. Based on sequence alignments and sequence motifs shared by Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNAs (P4R2 RNAs) and siRNAs, we propose that siRNAs are typically generated by a single internal DCL3 cleavage event whose position is measured from either end of a short P4R2 RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>siRNA precursors accumulate in mutants defective for DCL3</title><p>Previously published RNA blot analyses have shown that in <italic>dcl3</italic> null mutants, loss of 24 and 23 nt siRNAs is accompanied by accumulation of RNAs longer than 25 nt but typically shorter than 50 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blevins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daxinger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henderson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pontes et al., 2006</xref>). A prime example is the intergenic region that separates tandemly arranged 5S ribosomal RNA (5S rRNA) genes, where RNAs of ∼26–45 nt accumulate in <italic>dcl3</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 3,5,7,8). These longer RNAs accumulate to their highest levels in <italic>dcl2/3/4</italic> triple mutants, in which multiple siRNA processing pathways are impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 8; see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henderson et al., 2006</xref>]). The longer RNAs that accumulate in <italic>dcl2/3/4</italic> triple mutants fail to accumulate in the absence of Pol IV (<italic>nrpd1</italic> subunit mutant) or RDR2 (lanes 9,10). This indicates that Pol IV and RDR2 are each required for the biogenesis of the longer RNAs, paralleling their requirement for 24 and 23 nt siRNA biogenesis (lanes 13,14). The longer RNAs (&gt;25 nt) are also reduced in abundance if Pol V or AGO4 are mutated in the <italic>dcl2/3/4</italic> triple mutant background (lanes 11,12), analogous to the degree to which siRNA levels are reduced, but not eliminated, in <italic>ago4</italic> or <italic>pol V</italic> single mutants (lanes 15,16).

In wild-type plants (ecotype Col-0), 24 and 23 nt siRNAs represent the most abundant small RNA class, as expected, outnumbering unique 21 nt small RNA species, which include miRNAs as well as siRNAs, by approximately 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In <italic>dcl2/3/4</italic> triple mutants, the small RNA profile is substantially altered.

Collectively, these observations suggest that P4R2 RNAs that begin with A might tend to give rise to 24 nt siRNAs from their 5’ ends, whereas P4R2 RNAs that begin with G might tend to give rise to 24 nt siRNAs from their 3’ ends. It is noteworthy that P4R2 RNAs that begin with G show a strong tendency to end with U, such that the complementary strand (which can be considered the bottom strand) is expected to begin with A. Thus, it may be that DCL3 cutting of precursor duplexes preferentially takes place at a fixed distance from a 5’ terminal adenosine present on either strand of the duplex.

RDR2 catalyzes the addition of one or two non-templated radioactive cytosines to the 3’ end of the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, lane 2). This 3’ end-labeling fails to occur using an active site mutant version of RDR2 (RDR2-ASM), in which the magnesium-binding aspartates of the catalytic center have been changed to alanines (lane 3). Labeling also fails to occur if the 3’ terminal nucleotide of the RNA substrate lacks a 3’ hydroxyl group on the ribose, but instead has a 2’, 3’-dideoxy ribose (lane 5). The end-label added by RDR2 is sensitive to RNase 1, indicating that labeling occurs in the context of single-stranded RNA (lane 4). Analogous terminal transferase activity has not been detected in Pol IV fractions. Collectively, these results suggest that the 3’ mismatches observed at low frequency among P4R2 RNAs might be telltale signs of RDR2 terminal transferase activity, potentially acting on completed Pol IV transcripts, RDR2 transcripts, or both.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A recent study reported the identification of Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs whose characteristics included a 5’-monophosphate group, a correspondence to known 24 nt siRNA-producing loci and accumulation in <italic>dcl2/3/4</italic> triple mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015</xref>). These transcripts were deduced to be hundreds of nucleotides in length, on average, based on the computational joining of overlapping RNA-seq reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In general, the P4R2 RNAs we identified have similar properties to the RNAs defined by Li et al., with 20 of the 22 loci scrutinized most carefully by Li et al. matching P4R2 RNAs from our study. Thus, our results extend the results of Li et al., but indicate that the vast majority of Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs are smaller than 45 nt (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Dozens of P4R2 RNAs can overlap at a given locus, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, but we conclude that individual P4R2 RNAs represent individual Pol IV-RDR2 transcription units.</p><p>Our data indicate that the short double-stranded P4R2 RNAs that accumulate in <italic>dcl3</italic> mutants are the immediate precursors of siRNAs, based on the ability of DCL3 to cut these precursors into 24 nt RNAs in vitro. These results are consistent with those of Nagano et al., who showed that DCL3 preferentially cleaves short synthetic dsRNAs of 30–50 nt, but not longer RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nagano et al., 2014</xref>). Our analyses indicate that 24 nt siRNAs are preferentially generated from the 5’ or 3’ ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting that P4R2 duplex RNAs can be diced from either end, also in agreement with Nagano et al.’s studies. Generation of siRNAs from the ends of P4R2 RNAs, rather than from internal sequences, leads to the prediction that each P4R2 RNA sequence has limited capacity to specify multiple alternative siRNAs. Thus, the multitude of unique 24 nt siRNA sequences present in wild-type cells can be expected to be derived from a similarly large number of P4R2 precursors, depending on whether one or both strands of diced duplexes are utilized as siRNAs. Consistent with this prediction, our sequenced datasets included 1,055,471 unique 23 or 24 nt siRNA sequences (in wild-type plants) and 933,453 unique P4R2 RNAs of 26–94 nt (in <italic>dcl2/3/4</italic> triple mutants).</p><p>An expectation is that if Pol IV generates single-stranded RNAs that serve as templates for RDR2, these transcripts would accumulate in an <italic>rdr2</italic> mutant and be detectable on RNA blots using sense or antisense probes that detect abundant siRNAs (such as the 5S gene intergenic spacer siRNAs). Alternatively, if RDR2 were to act upstream of Pol IV, which is contrary to current models, but a formal possibility, one might similarly expect to detect RDR2 transcripts in a <italic>pol IV</italic> mutant. However, our RNA blot results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) defy these predictions, as do the RNA-seq data for <italic>pol IV</italic> and <italic>rdr2</italic> mutants. Instead, precursors are depleted if either RDR2 or Pol IV is absent. This suggests that Pol IV and RDR2 are each required for the synthesis of both strands of P4R2 RNA duplexes, as was also noted by Li et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015</xref>), which fits with the physical association of Pol IV and RDR2 and the hypothesis that the two enzymes function as a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haag et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Law et al., 2011</xref>). We have shown previously that RDR2 activity detected in vitro using affinity-purified Pol IV–RDR2 complexes from wild-type plants is not apparent using RDR2 affinity purified from a <italic>pol IV</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haag et al., 2012</xref>). Although Pol IV isolated from an <italic>rdr2</italic> null mutant is active in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haag et al., 2012</xref>]), it is possible that Pol IV may require RDR2 association for activity in vivo.</p><p>An important ramification of Pol IV and RDR2 co-dependence is that it is unclear if the P4R2 RNAs we cloned and sequenced in our study represent Pol IV transcripts, RDR2 transcripts, or both. Although we detect P4R2 RNAs corresponding to both strands at many (but not all) loci, as can be seen in the browser displays of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9A</xref>, these could be transcripts of only Pol IV or, conversely, only RDR2. Sequences enriched at the ends of P4R2 RNAs preclude easy assignment of which polymerase generated them. For instance, P4R2 RNAs tend to begin with a purine and end with a pyrimidine such that the complementary strands should also be enriched for purines at the 5’ end and pyrimidines at the 3’ end. The terminal transferase activity inherent to RDR2 provides a plausible explanation for mismatched, untemplated nucleotides at the 3’ ends of some (∼5%) P4R2 RNAs, but this activity could modify completed RNA transcripts made by Pol IV, RDR2, or both. Despite these uncertainties, P4R2 RNAs preferentially begin with a purine that, in the context of the genome sequence, tends to occur immediately downstream of a pyrimidine (in the equivalent DNA strand). This pyrimidine–purine rule is a characteristic of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, in general, and has a structural basis that involves base-stacking interactions between the initiating (+1) RNA nucleotide (a purine) and −1 DNA template nucleotide (also a purine), in addition to the base-pairing that occurs between the +1 RNA and +1 DNA template bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basu et al., 2014</xref>). The pyrimidine–purine rule has been shown to apply to protein-coding genes throughout the Arabidopsis genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cumbie et al., 2015</xref>), to Arabidopsis pre-rRNAs transcribed by multisubunit RNA Pol I (these initiate with an A downstream of a T; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doelling et al., 1993</xref>) and to 5S genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III (initiating with a G downstream of a T). Our in vitro transcription studies using affinity-purified Pol IV or Pol II also recapitulate the pyrimidine–purine rule. Moreover, Pol IV generates relatively short RNAs in vitro, with size distributions and 3’ ends resembling those of P4R2 RNAs. Collectively, these observations suggest that P4R2 RNA biogenesis is initiated by Pol IV, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, with limited processivity of Pol IV accounting for the relatively short size of P4R2 RNAs. In our model, designed to account for the consensus sequences of P4R2 RNAs and 24 nt siRNAs (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), Pol IV generates first strands that initiate with a purine. Those RNAs that initiate with A best account for siRNA 5’ end sequences, whereas RNAs that initiate with G best account for siRNA 3’ end sequences, suggesting that resulting duplexes, following second strand synthesis by RDR2, are diced from opposite ends. Because first strand RNAs that begin with G tend to end with U, their complementary strands would tend to begin with A. Thus dicing measured from a 5’ adenosine might be a preference underlying the alternative dicing of P4R2 duplexes from either end.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09591.017</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model for the biogenesis of 24 nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) via single dicing events.</title><p>Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNAs (P4R2 RNAs) tend to begin with a purine (A or G) at position 1, adjacent to what would be a T at position −1 in the corresponding DNA strand and an A (or U) at position 2. A similar signature is detected at the 5’ end of 24 nt siRNAs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), except that only A (not G) is enriched at the 5’ terminus of these siRNAs. Thus, DICER-like 3 (DCL3) cleavage measured from the 5’ adenosine of those P4R2 RNAs that begin with A could account for the similar 5’ end sequences of P4R2 RNAs and 24 nt siRNAs. P4R2 RNAs that begin with A tend to end with ACU, which is not reflected in siRNAs. However, P4R2 RNAs that begin with G tend to end with a 3’ U, with U &gt; C &gt; A being the order of preference, which matches the 3’ end consensus for 24 nt siRNAs. Because P4R2 RNAs that begin with G most often end with U, their complementary strands (purple bottom strands in the figure) would tend to have A at their 5’ ends. DCL3 dicing, measured from this 5’ A, would liberate a top strand (red in the figure) whose 3’ end could account for the 3’ consensus (U &gt; C &gt; A) of 24 nt siRNAs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09591.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09591.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09591-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials</title><p>The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> mutants <italic>rdr2-1, nrpd1-3 (pol IV</italic>) and <italic>nrpe1-11 (pol V</italic>) were described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Onodera et al., 2005</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pontes et al., 2006</xref> respectively.

Briefly, 1 g of NRPB2-FLAG transgenic line leaf tissue or 4 g of NRPD1-FLAG transgenic line leaf tissue (for Pol IV) was ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and then resuspended in 3.5 ml extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mM sodium sulfate, 5 mM magnesium sulfate, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1% plant protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma]) per gram of tissue. The resulting lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C and the supernatant was subjected to centrifugation again using the same conditions. 50 μl of anti-FLAG agarose resin was then added to the supernatant and incubated 3 hr at 4°C on a rotating mixer. The resin was collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 2 min and the supernatant was discarded. Resin was washed twice with wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mM sodium sulfate, 5 mM magnesium sulfate, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.5% IGEPAL) and once with CB100 (25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCL, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF). Between each wash, the resin was collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 2 min and the supernatant was discarded. For Pol II, the washed NRPB2-FLAG resin was resuspended in a final volume of 1ml CB100 buffer. For Pol IV, the washed NRPD1-FLAG resin was brought to a final volume of 50 μl CB100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>In vitro transcription assays</title><p>50 μl of washed NRPB2-FLAG or NRPD1-FLAG resin was mixed with 50 μl of 2 × transcription reaction mix (18 nM M13mp18 template [Bayou Biolabs, Metairie, LA], 2 mM each rNTP, 120 mM ammonium sulfate, 40 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 24 mM magnesium sulfate, 20 uM zinc sulfate, 20 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, 1.6 U/ul RNase inhibitor) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr on a rotating mixer. Reactions were subjected to centrifugation through Performa spin columns (EdgeBiosystems, Gaitherburg, MD), the filtrate was adjusted to 0.3M sodium acetate, and nucleic acids were precipitated with isopropanol. The pellets were resuspended in 8 μl water and DNase-treated using Turbo DNA-<italic>free</italic> kit reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). The samples were then treated with Terminator exonuclease (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) to remove potentially degraded RNAs with 5’ monophosphates, cleaned with RNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA), and then treated with RNA 5’ Polyphosphatase (Epicentre Biotechnologies) to convert 5’ triphosphate groups to monophosphates. All enzyme treatments were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Adapter ligation and library construction was performed using a TruSeq small RNA kit (Illumina). Paired-end sequencing was conducted using an Illumina MiSeq instrument. Paired reads were mapped to the M13 sequence using default settings of BWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>) for Illumina. Insert sizes were calculated using the CollectInsertSizeMetrics Picard tool. BWA and Picard tools were accessed via The Galaxy Project public server (UseGalaxy.org).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Over-expression and purification of RDR2</title><p>RecRDR2 was overexpressed in insect cells using the BaculoDirect baculovirus protein expression system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). <italic>RDR2</italic> cDNA, amplified by PCR using primers 5’-CACCATGGTGTCAGAGACGACGACGAAC-3’ and 5’-TCAAATGGATACAAGTCCACTTGTTTT-3’, was cloned into pENTR and recombined into the baculovirus vector using LR clonase. The resulting baculovirus vector was transfected into Sf9 insect cells and recombinant virus was harvested according to the instructions of the manufacturer. RecRDR2 was purified from High Five cells infected with the recombinant virus and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 400 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM benzamidine-HCl and 10% glycerol. The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 39,000 <italic>×g</italic> for 30 min at 4°C. Anti-V5 agarose beads were used to selectively bind rec_RDR2 in the cleared lysate. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 170 <italic>× g</italic> for 5 min, washed 3 times with the same buffer, and eluted using V5 peptide in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 0.01% of NP-40 and 10% glycerol. The protein was concentrated and washed by buffer exchange using a Centricon column.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RDR2 terminal transferase assay</title><p>RDR2 terminal transferase assays were performed according to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curaba and Chen, 2008</xref>) with some modifications. RDR2 or RDR2-ASM (∼250 ng) was added to activity buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 0.2 mCi/ml α-<sup>32</sup>P-CTP, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM DTT, 0.8 U/µl RNaseOUT and 1 µM of RNA template in a 50 µl reaction and incubated at room temperature (∼24°C) for 60 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and then a clean-up step was performed using EdgeBio Performa (EdgeBiosystems, Gaithersburg, MD) spin columns. RNA products were ethanol precipitated and separated on a denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred on Whatman 3MM filter paper and dried under vacuum at 80°C prior to phosphorimaging. The RNase treatment assay was conducted using a 20 µl RDR2 reaction with 0.05 U/µl of RNase ONE in 1 × reaction buffer. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and terminated by 0.2% SDS .</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>TB and CP designed the study.

Your submission has been evaluated by Jim Kadonaga (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers feel the discovery that RNA Pol IV creates short transcripts is of major interest, as it substantially alters the existing model of RNA-directed DNA methylation. However, the reviewers expressed substantial concerns regarding the strength of the proof that the short RNA molecules described in the manuscript represent primary Pol IV transcripts.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The evidence that short RNA molecules depend on Pol IV and RDR2 is provided for only one locus. This is insufficient evidence to claim that all such RNAs are made by Pol IV instead of Pol II or Pol V. Please provide additional evidence for Pol IV dependence, such as additional Northern blots or sequencing RNAs from POL IV dcl234 mutants. Depending on the strength of the additional evidence, the &quot;P4R2&quot; nomenclature may have to be reconsidered.</p><p>2) The data presented do not exclude the possibility that short RNAs are processed from longer primary Pol IV transcripts. Given the central conclusion of the paper, please strengthen the evidence that primary Pol IV transcripts are indeed short. This might be done through analysis of nascent transcripts, expanding the analysis that links short RNAs to Pol II consensus start sites that is briefly presented in the discussion, or through other approaches. Depending on the strength of the additional evidence, the authors may need to discuss the possibility that longer Pol IV transcripts are processed into the detected short molecules.</p><p>3) The data regarding Pol V dependence may be confusing by suggesting that all short RNAs depend on Pol V, whereas this is probably not the case. This could be resolved by probing the Northern for loci that do not depend on Pol V for 24-nt sRNA production (in conjunction with addressing point 1) or by a clear explanation in the text.</p><p>4) For the DCL3 in vitro assay, please include a time zero control to ensure that there were indeed larger RNAs present in the extracts from the dcl234 mutant plants that are processed by the Flag tagged DCL3 protein.</p><p>5) Please include information describing RDR2 expression and purification and remove the &quot;data not shown&quot; parts of the Results and Discussion.</p><p>6) The treatment of sRNA phasing is confusing. A new analysis is referenced in the Introduction, and lack of phasing could easily result from random Pol IV initiation or DCL3 cleavage. Please present the phasing analysis in the Results and consider discussing its significance in the Discussion section.</p><p>7) Please provide significance information (P values) of the motifs or the parameters used to identify the motifs presented in the manuscript.</p><p>8) Please define the &quot;R&quot; lane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09591.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The evidence that short RNA molecules depend on Pol IV and RDR2 is provided for only one locus.

To address this comment we have added four new figures or supplemental figures to the revised manuscript, namely <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data SD2-data">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. In the initial version of the manuscript, we focused solely on the comparison of RNA-seq datasets from wild-type (ecotype Col-0) plants and <italic>dcl2 dcl3 dcl4</italic> (abbreviated as <italic>dcl2/3/4</italic>) mutants, in which P4R2 RNAs accumulate to their highest levels. However, in parallel with these Col-0 and <italic>dcl2/3/4</italic> datasets, we had also performed RNA-seq analyses for <italic>nrpd1</italic> and <italic>rdr2</italic> mutants (with 2 biological replicates for each genotype). In the revised manuscript, we now make use of all of these datasets to show that the P4R2 RNAs that accumulate in <italic>dcl2/3/4</italic> mutants are also detected (albeit at lower levels) in wild-type Col-0 but are absent or depleted in <italic>nrpd1</italic> or <italic>rdr2</italic> mutants. A genome browser view making this point graphically for three representative loci is shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> shows browser views for three additional loci. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> is a table showing more than 5500 genomic intervals (with a window size of 100 bp) in which 24 nt siRNAs are detected, and in which putative P4R2 RNAs (&gt;25 nt, &lt;95 nt) are also detected, in both <italic>dcl2/3/4</italic> and wild-type, but are depleted in <italic>nrpd1</italic> or <italic>rdr2</italic> mutants. In this table, data are provided for both independent biological replicates for each genotype, with high confidence P4R2 RNA – generating intervals being those in which the RNAs are depleted in both <italic>nrpd1</italic> and r<italic>dr2</italic> replicates. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, we also show that 20 of the 22 Pol IV-dependent transcript loci confirmed by Li et al. (2015) to be capable of generating Pol IV transcripts are included among our P4R2 loci. These authors also provided genetic evidence for Pol IV and RDR2-dependence of the transcripts. Collectively, we think that these data show convincingly that P4R2 RNAs are, indeed, dependent on both Pol IV and RDR2, thus justifying the P4R2 nomenclature.</p><p><italic>2) The data presented do not exclude the possibility that short RNAs are processed from longer primary Pol IV transcripts. Given the central conclusion of the paper, please strengthen the evidence that primary Pol IV transcripts are indeed short. This might be done through analysis of nascent transcripts, expanding the analysis that links short RNAs to Pol II consensus start sites that is briefly presented in the discussion, or through other approaches. Depending on the strength of the additional evidence, the authors may need to discuss the possibility that longer Pol IV transcripts are processed into the detected short molecules.</italic> </p><p>This request by the reviewers was not trivial. To address this concern as best we can, we have included data from a separate, ongoing study by student, and new author, Michelle Marasco. We show, as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, that affinity-purified Pol IV makes relatively short transcripts when provided with a &gt;7 kb long, single-stranded M13 virus DNA template. These transcripts are similar in size distribution to those of P4R2 RNAs observed in vivo. Moreover, the start site consensus we observed for P4R2 RNAs is also observed for these in vitro transcripts. In addition, the 3’ ends of the Pol IV transcripts also resemble the 3’ end sequences of P4R2 RNAs. These new data support the hypothesis that P4R2 RNAs are Pol IV transcripts.</p><p><italic>3) The data regarding Pol V dependence may be confusing by suggesting that all short RNAs depend on Pol V, whereas this is probably not the case. This could be resolved by probing the Northern for loci that do not depend on Pol V for 24-nt sRNA production (in conjunction with addressing point 1) or by a clear explanation in the text.</italic> </p><p>We have clarified this point by adding a sentence to the Results section stating that <italic>pol V</italic> and <italic>ago4</italic> mutants most likely affect P4R2 and siRNA levels indirectly via their involvement in DNA methylation and histone modifications that have been shown to recruit Pol IV to target sites. We cite several relevant, recent papers.</p><p><italic>4) For the DCL3 in vitro assay, please include a time zero control to ensure that there were indeed larger RNAs present in the extracts from the dcl234 mutant plants that are processed by the Flag tagged DCL3 protein.</italic> </p><p>Apparently, we did a poor job of explaining the controls for this figure, as these controls satisfy the reviewer (s)’s concern. We have re-written this section to make it clearer. The two controls (no added protein, or potentially FLAG-purified proteins from non-transgenic plants that don't express FLAG-tagged DCL3) were conducted side-by-side with the affinity-purified DCL3 sample, and they show that undigested precursor RNAs remain even after the incubation period allowed for DCL3 digestion. Thus the precursor RNAs must also have been present at time zero.</p><p><italic>5) Please include information describing RDR2 expression and purification and remove the &quot;data not shown&quot; parts of the Results and Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We have added two new panels to what is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, showing the purity of the recombinant RDR2. We have removed any reference to data not shown.</p><p><italic>6) The treatment of sRNA phasing is confusing. A new analysis is referenced in the Introduction, and lack of phasing could easily result from random Pol IV initiation or DCL3 cleavage. Please present the phasing analysis in the Results and consider discussing its significance in the Discussion section.</italic> </p><p>Frankly, the phasing data are unnecessary, as it is obvious from our study that the dicing of precursors so short that they can only produce single siRNAs precludes the possibility of phasing. Thus we have deleted the figure panel in question and any discussion of phasing. This has helped keep the manuscript a manageable length while discussing the numerous new figures.</p><p><italic>7) Please provide significance information (P values) of the motifs or the parameters used to identify the motifs presented in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We now provide bit scores for the sequence logos. We neglected to include them in the original version of the manuscript, which was an oversight.</p><p><italic>8) Please define the &quot;R&quot; lane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.</italic> </p><p>This is a lane showing end-labeled template RNA, as a size marker. This is now made explicit in the figure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
