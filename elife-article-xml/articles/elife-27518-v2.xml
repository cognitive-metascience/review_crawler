Yet, how the UPR achieves ER homeostatic readjustment is poorly investigated, as in most studies the ER stress that is elicited cannot be overcome. Here we show that a proteostatic insult, provoked by persistent expression of the secretory heavy chain of immunoglobulin M (µ<sub>s</sub>), is well-tolerated in HeLa cells. Upon µ<sub>s</sub> expression, its levels temporarily eclipse those of the ER chaperone BiP, leading to acute, full-geared UPR activation. Once BiP is in excess again, the UPR transitions to chronic, submaximal activation, indicating that the UPR senses ER stress in a ratiometric fashion. In this process, the ER expands about three-fold and becomes dominated by BiP. As the UPR is essential for successful ER homeostatic readjustment in the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> model, it provides an ideal system for dissecting the intricacies of how the UPR evaluates and alleviates ER stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006781</institution-id><institution>Giovanni Armenise-Harvard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Anken</surname><given-names>Eelco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003196</institution-id><institution>Ministero della Salute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF-2011-02352852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Anken</surname><given-names>Eelco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MFAG 13584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Anken</surname><given-names>Eelco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003196</institution-id><institution>Ministero della Salute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PE-2011-02352286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sitia</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name><name><surname>van Anken</surname><given-names>Eelco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG 2016-18824</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sitia</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002426</institution-id><institution>Fondazione Telethon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GGP15059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sitia</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002803</institution-id><institution>Fondazione Cariplo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-0591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sitia</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Restoration of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostatis occurs when levels of the key ER resident chaperone BiP exceed those of accumulating ER clients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Key to survival is that organisms adapt their behavior—or on the cellular level, their molecular machineries—according to need. An example is the ability of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to accomodate fluctuations in the load of client proteins that fold and assemble in this organelle before being dispatched to travel further along the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). A vast array of ER resident chaperones and folding factors assist the maturation of client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Anken and Braakman, 2005</xref>). BiP is an ER resident HSP70 family chaperone, whose function is regulated by at least seven different HSP40 co-chaperones, named ERdj1–7, and two nucleotide exchange factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Melnyk et al., 2015</xref>), as well as through reversible AMPylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>). The ER also hosts an HSP90 family member, GRP94, for which CNPY family proteins may be co-chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anelli and van Anken, 2013</xref>), and several peptidylprolyl isomerases (PPIases), such as cyclophilin B and a few FKBP family members. Special to the ER are the protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) that assist disulfide bond formation, and the lectin chaperones, such as calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT), that associate with client proteins through binding their N-glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Anken and Braakman, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The chaperones and folding factors retain folding and assembly intermediates in the ER in order to minimize the secretion or deployment throughout the endomembrane system of immature client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003</xref>). A consequence of client retention is that when the protein folding machinery is not adequate to facilitate maturation of clients, they accumulate in the ER, which causes stress and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). The circuitry of the UPR has been mapped to impressive detail: the three well-studied branches of the UPR are initiated by the UPR transducers IRE1α, PERK and ATF6α, each of which has an ER stress-sensing domain in the ER lumen and a UPR signaling effector domain in the cytosol. Activated IRE1α and PERK are kinases that trans-autophosphorylate. This step triggers IRE1α to assume endonuclease activity, such that it removes an intron from <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA. Upon its religation, the spliced mRNA encodes the XBP1 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>). Activated PERK transiently attenuates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harding et al., 1999</xref>). At the same time, eIF2α phosphorylation favors the expression of a few transcripts, in particular ATF4, a transcription factor that activates further downstream effectors, such as CHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). The third UPR branch is activated by ATF6α, which undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis in the Golgi and thus a transcriptionally active N-terminal portion of 50 kDa is liberated that acts as a transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). The UPR transcription factors jointly initiate genetic programs that drive the expression of all of the components that are necessary to expand the ER, including the chaperones and enzymes for membrane synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). In fact, overexpression of for instance XBP1 alone leads to ER expansion even in the absence of any perturbation of the ER client protein folding and assembly process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sriburi et al., 2004</xref>). Altogether, the UPR homeostatically readjusts the ER folding machinery by expanding the organelle according to need, and regulates cell fate decisions depending on the severity of ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>).</p><p>To date, most studies on the UPR circuitry have focused on the signaling pathways themselves, and little is known about how the UPR evaluates the severity of ER stress and the success of the homeostatic readjustment of the ER. Here, we show that the widely used strategy of employing ER stress-eliciting drugs obscures how ER homeostatic readjustment may be achieved, and instead, we present a HeLa cell model that allows us to evaluate just that. By inducible overexpression of orphan immunoglobulin M (IgM) secretory heavy chain (µ<sub>s</sub>), we provoke a full-blown UPR, which is essential for the cells to cope with the proteostatic insult. As µ<sub>s</sub> accumulates in the ER, it transiently eclipses BiP levels, at which point the UPR output is strongest. UPR-driven upregulation then allows BiP to reach levels that exceed µ<sub>s</sub> levels again, while the ER expands in the process. The activation of the UPR is maximal only when there is a relative shortage of BiP, whereas it subsides to chronic, submaximal output levels when ER homeostatic readjustment is achieved. Co-expression of Ig light chain (λ) instead leads to productive IgM secretion, such that BiP is not sequestered by µ<sub>s</sub>, the UPR is not activated and the ER does not expand. Thus, the UPR senses the levels of client proteins that sequester BiP versus those of BiP itself in a ratiometric fashion, which determines the amplitude of the response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cytotoxicity of UPR-eliciting drugs</title><p>Drugs that are typically used to study the UPR include tunicamycin (Tm), which prevents the addition of N-glycans to nascent ER client proteins, dithiothreitol (DTT), which impedes disulfide bond formation, and thapsigargin (Tg), which depletes Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER lumen. Their immediate effect is a general collapse of productive protein folding in the ER, and these drugs therefore activate the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). In the longer run, however, these drugs likely have pleiotropic effects. Evidently, non-productive folding in the ER causes ER client proteins to be retained in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003</xref>), and thus they no longer reach their destination, be it anywhere throughout the endomembrane system of the cell or extracellular. As a result—depending on their half-life—these proteins will be depleted at the site where they have to exert their functions, which ultimately may cause a plethora of perturbations to the homeostasis of the cell.</p><p>In order to unmask pleiotropic effects of UPR-eliciting drugs, taking Tm as an example, we serially diluted the drug starting from a concentration (5 µg/ml), which is widely used to study the effects of ER stress and UPR activation, and monitored cell survival after 7 days by a cell growth/colony formation assay. At this high concentration, a full-blown UPR was triggered, as is evident from the maximal extent of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing in HeLa cells, that is, the appearance of a band of higher mobility, corresponding to the RT-PCR product of the <italic>XBP1<sup>S</sup></italic> transcript from which the intron has been removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Yet, there was no cell survival after 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), not even when the cells were treated with Tm only on the first day for 4 hr. At a 100-fold dilution of the ‘standard’ concentration, Tm induced the splicing of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA to submaximal levels, and only transiently so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but still provoked a substantial cell growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Even at a further two-fold dilution of Tm to 25 ng/ml, when no <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), there was some loss of cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). These findings thus reveal that an overall impairment of ER client protein folding has cytotoxic consequences aside from the activation of the UPR. Indeed, Tm readily causes morphological aberrations of the ER at these low concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rutkowski et al., 2006</xref>). Strikingly, upon deletion of IRE1α by CRISPR/Cas9 and concomitant ablation of PERK and ATF6α by siRNA-mediated silencing (with good efficiency; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), cell growth was hardly impaired. The cytotoxic effects of Tm, however, became apparent in these cells at even lower concentrations than in cells with a functional UPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which implies not only that the UPR is predominantly cyto-protective but also that UPR-mediated pro-apoptotic pathways cannot play a decisive role in cell fate upon Tm-driven ER stress. Thus, the use of ER stress-eliciting drugs inevitably obscures how ER homeostatic readjustment can be achieved.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27518.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tunicamycin has pleiotropic cytotoxic effects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa S3 cells were treated with Tm at various concentrations and for various durations, as indicated, before mRNA was isolated from cells for RT-PCR analysis with oligos specific for XBP1.

We therefore sought to circumvent the shortcomings of using ER stress-eliciting drugs, and we hypothesized that overexpression of an ER client protein would be a better tool to allow us to appreciate UPR-driven adaptations to ER stress. The impressive ER expansion during B cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wiest et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Anken et al., 2003</xref>) inspired us to choose the bulk product of plasma cells, secretory antibody, as an ideal candidate to serve as a proteostatic insult that would drive the UPR. More specifically, we decided to employ the secretory heavy chain of IgM, µ<sub>s</sub>, because µ<sub>s</sub> expression in bulk coincides with elaborate ER expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sitia et al., 1987</xref>) and UPR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reimold et al., 2001</xref>) during plasma cell differentiation.</p><p>The precise role of the UPR in ER expansion during plasma cell development is, however, difficult to assess. B cells anticipate that they will secrete IgM in bulk once they differentiate into plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Anken et al., 2003</xref>), such that ER expansion is also driven by developmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iwakoshi et al., 2003</xref>). Accordingly, ER expansion occurs in differentiating B cells even when µ<sub>s</sub> is ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). To assess the effect on cellular homeostasis solely of sudden µ<sub>s</sub> overexpression, we decided to create a HeLa cell model that allowed inducible expression of murine µ<sub>s</sub>, for which we exploited the GeneSwitch system (Thermo Fischer Scientific). By subsequent lentiviral delivery and cloning of integrant cells, we introduced the hybrid nuclear receptor that is activated by the synthetic steroid mifepristone (Mif), yielding HeLa-MifON cells. The µ<sub>s</sub> transgene under the control of the promoter element responsive to that hybrid nuclear receptor was then integrated into the HeLa-MifON cells, yielding HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> cells.</p><p>Expression of µ<sub>s</sub> in HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> cells in the absence of Mif was undetectable by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The GeneSwitch system is amplified through an autoregulatory feedback loop, whereby the Mif-bound hybrid nuclear receptor upregulates expression of its own gene. This feature likely means that the titration of µ<sub>s</sub> expression levels by varying Mif concentration was not easily reproducible, and that the Mif-driven inducibility was instead an OFF/ON effect (data not shown). A proxy for tunable expression of µ<sub>s</sub> was offered instead by comparing different HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> clones, which—due to differences in genomic locus or copy number of integrations—each expressed µ<sub>s</sub> at a different level upon induction with Mif, as shown for three individual clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As illustrated by immunofluorescence of µ<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), expression was remarkably uniform among cells because they were clonal. Moreover, µ<sub>s</sub> is retained in the ER lumen, as shown by its strict co-localization with the ER marker CRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27518.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A model for proteostatically induced ER stress.</title><p>(<bold>A–F,H–J</bold>) Expression of µ<sub>s</sub> in HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> cells was induced with 0.5 nM Mif.

Synthesis of µ<sub>s</sub> reached a plateau after 1–2 days of consistently high levels, as assessed by radiolabeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Thus, the proteostatic UPR stimulus is permanent, which implies that the cells must undergo homeostatic readjustment to meet the increased demand on the ER folding machinery.</p><p>Using a series of standard assays, we then demonstrated that µ<sub>s</sub> triggered a full-blown UPR.

Treatment of the parental HeLa-MifON cells with a high dose of Mif (10 nM) did not provoke <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

We deleted IRE1α by CRISPR/Cas9 and reconstituted it with GFP-tagged murine IRE1α (IRE1α-GFP) under the control of a tight Tet-responsive element (Clontech) by lentiviral transduction. The GFP-tag was introduced such that it did not interfere with function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), as has been shown before for human IRE1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2010</xref>) or yeast Ire1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>). With doxycycline (Dox), we tuned IRE1α-GFP expression to near-endogenous levels that allowed visualization by fluorescent microscopy and found that IRE1α-GFP clustered not only upon Tm treatment but also upon µ<sub>s</sub> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Altogether, we concluded that µ<sub>s</sub> expression drove the activation of all branches of the UPR that we tested, in a similar manner and to a similar extent as when they were triggered by ER stress-eliciting drugs.</p><p>Strikingly, in spite of the expression of µ<sub>s</sub> in bulk, the cell growth of the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> cells almost paralleled that of the Mif-treated parental MifON cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,J</xref>). Thus, the full-blown UPR that was elicited by µ<sub>s</sub> expression was well tolerated by the cells, unlike prolonged treatment with Tm at concentrations that triggered a full-blown UPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In all, we concluded that the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> cells offer a suitable model to assess ER homeostatic readjustment and the role of the UPR in this process, as the cells apparently cope well with the proteostatic insult that is unabated once µ<sub>s</sub> expression is induced.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>UPR activation correlates with accumulation of ER load rather than with the secretory burden</title><p>By expressing µ<sub>s</sub>, we burden the cells with a Sisyphean task because, in absence of immunoglobulin light chain λ, no IgM can be produced, a situation that mimics the storage of mutant ER client proteins in disease. Inspired by B cell to plasma cell differentiation, we argued that λ in contrast to µ<sub>s</sub> would likely provide a poor if any proteostatic insult to the cells, as it is expressed in B lymphocytes when they still are quiescent, and—by definition—minimally stressed. Moreover, ER retention of λ is far less stringent than that of µ<sub>s</sub>, such that λ can be secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hendershot and Sitia, 2005</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether it is the folding load of client proteins passing through the ER or their accumulation that determines the amplitude of UPR signaling, we created clones that co-express the two IgM subunits and selected clones based on stoichiometric differences in λ and µ<sub>s</sub> expression.

Indeed, using recombinant BiP and commercially obtained pure IgM (of which ~70% of the protein mass is µ<sub>s</sub>) as standards, we assessed the absolute quantities in cell lysates of BiP and µ<sub>s</sub> upon induction of µ<sub>s</sub> expression. BiP levels increased ~12.5 fold. On the basis of cell counting, determination of the protein weight of the samples and the known molecular weight of BiP of ~70 kDa, we estimated that BiP levels rise from ~2×10<sup>7</sup> to ~2×10<sup>8</sup> copies per cell. Importantly, from the absolute quantitation, we deduced that BiP levels were in excess of µ<sub>s</sub> once the cells had adapted to the proteostatic insult (with µ<sub>s</sub> reaching an estimated ~1.5–1.8×10<sup>8</sup> copies per cell). Early upon the onset of µ<sub>s</sub> expression and before BiP induction was fully underway, however, µ<sub>s</sub> levels were transiently at a 1:1 stoichiometry with those of BiP, or possibly, µ<sub>s</sub> levels even slightly exceeded BiP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Following the activation of the UPR over time upon onset of µ<sub>s</sub> expression, we found that all three UPR branches transiently reached an output that was maximal, that is at least on a par with the output that was induced by a conventional drug-elicited UPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). Levels of cleaved ATF6α (p50) reached a maximum at ~6 hr after the onset of µ<sub>s</sub> expression before it subsided to submaximal levels. The full-length precursor ATF6α (p90) was in large part depleted after this intial burst of ATF6α (p50) release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), such that the determining factor for the amplitude of signaling through the ATF6α branch was inevitably, the de novo synthesis of p90 rather than the severity of the proteostatic insult, at least for a while before levels of p90 were fully restored.</p><p>Levels of spliced <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA likewise reached a maximum at ~6 hr of µ<sub>s</sub> expression, and remained maximal for about 24 hr (with perhaps some oscillations) before they subsided to submaximal levels. Levels of CHOP, which provides a readout for PERK activity, reached a maximum slightly later, at 12–16 hr after the onset of µ<sub>s</sub> expression, before reaching submaximal levels, as further illustrated in a ‘heatmap’ of UPR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Treatment with ER stress-eliciting drugs during the chronic phase when the UPR had submaximal output readily triggered close to maximal output of all three UPR branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that prolonged µ<sub>s</sub> expression had not exhausted the signaling capacity of the UPR, and thus, that homeostatic readjustment of the ER accounted for lowered UPR output levels upon chronic µ<sub>s</sub> expression. Strikingly, the highest output of the three UPR branches did not coincide with µ<sub>s </sub>having reached maximal expression levels. Instead, UPR signaling reached maxima when the ratio µ<sub>s</sub>/BiP was highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>).

In fact, at day 7, BiP became the second most abundant protein in the cells (after β-actin), amounting to ~4% of the total proteome mass. Put together with the absolute quantitation of BiP levels, we estimate that the cells harbor an average of 5 × 10<sup>9</sup> proteins, which fits with earlier assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Milo, 2013</xref>). Moreover, from these quantitations, we estimated BiP levels to be at ~0.5 mM (or 30–40 mg/ml) before induction and to reach ~1.5 mM (or 90–120 mg/ml) in the ~3-fold expanded ER at day 7, accounting for about a third of the estimated ~200–300 mg/ml overall protein concentration in the lumen of the organelle. Other ER resident chaperones, such as GRP94, CRT and some members of the PDI family (most notably ERp72 and P5), also increased albeit to a lesser extent. As a consequence, levels of BiP within the ER increased from ~15% before the onset of µ<sub>s</sub> expression to 30–40% of the expanded ER proteome. Levels of GRP170, which acts as a nucleotide exchange factor of BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behnke et al., 2015</xref>), also increased markedly. The ERdj co-chaperones of BiP were upregulated upon µ<sub>s</sub> expression as well, but, surprisingly perhaps, to levels that were still about two orders of magnitude lower than the levels of BiP itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, their co-chaperone function must be executed in a sub-stoichiometric fashion in the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> model.</p><p>Before induction, µ<sub>s</sub> was barely detectable (~1 ppm) but levels rapidly increased to become ~10×10<sup>3</sup> ppm, that is ~1% (after 1 day) and ~2% (from day 3 onward) of the total protein content in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, upper panels; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Strikingly, 1 day of expression was sufficient for µ<sub>s</sub> levels to exceed that of any chaperone in the ER except those of BiP, which still outmatched µ<sub>s</sub> 3:2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lower panels; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Yet, BiP levels had increased 3–4-fold during that first day to keep pace with the burden imposed on the ER folding machinery by µ<sub>s</sub>. At later times, the margin by which BiP levels were in excess of µ<sub>s </sub>levels increased again, with BiP and µ<sub>s</sub> together constituting about half of the ER protein mass when it had fully expanded. Thus, upon µ<sub>s</sub> expression in bulk, the ER content not only changed quantitatively (i.e. undergoing a ~ 3–4-fold expansion), but also qualitatively (i.e. becoming dominated by µ<sub>s</sub> that is held in check by excess levels of its most devoted chaperone BiP).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>UPR signaling is key for ER homeostatic readjustment</title><p>As cell growth and survival were hardly perturbed upon µ<sub>s</sub> expression, we reasoned that ER homeostasis was successfully readjusted.

First, our results highlight that the UPR predominantly acts as a pro-survival pathway. By confronting cells with a proteostatic stimulus (i.e. bulk µ<sub>s</sub> expression) that these cells could well cope with, we confirmed that the UPR is key for their capacity to do so. Yet, the finding that µ<sub>s</sub> expression readily causes cells to undergo apoptosis in the absence of these UPR transducers implies that other, as yet unknown, ER stress-induced mechanisms can be invoked to mediate cell death. These mechanisms may well play such a role also when the UPR is functional. For instance, hyperoxidizing conditions in the lumen of the ER activate NADPH oxidases, leading to efflux of radical oxygen species to the cytosol that may cause activation of pro-apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Second, our data confirm that the accumulation of client proteins in the ER drives ER expansion. Interestingly, ER expansion is not necessarily provoked by bulk synthesis of client proteins per se, as co-expression of sufficient quantities of λ led to bulk secretion of IgM but failed to trigger a strong UPR, and, thus, did not result in augmented BiP production (which served as a proxy for ER expansion). Our findings indicate moreover that the ER folding machinery seems to be underused in HeLa cells. Apparently, mobilization of the default ER folding machinery is sufficient for a task that can be productively executed, such as the folding and assembly of IgM from subunits that are expressed in bulk but in the correct stoichiometry. In most cells, the basal size of the ER and its folding capacity may indeed exceed the need for folding assistance from the default secretory burden. In line with such a notion, a substantial fraction of BiP is kept in reserve in an inactive, AMPylated form under non-ER stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Third, our results highlight the key role of BiP in ER homeostasis. In fact, our choice to employ µ<sub>s</sub> as a proteostatic insult to challenge the ER was motivated in part by the reasoning that if there were ever an ER client protein that would be excellent in sequestering BiP, it would be µ<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haas and Wabl, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bole et al., 1986</xref>). Furthermore, it is well-conceivable that even the slightest leakiness of unpaired µ<sub>s</sub> from the ER has been evolutionarily selected against. As antigen recognition is likely to be compromised if µ<sub>s</sub> is released from the cell when unaccompanied by λ, such a release would potentially lead to ill-fated off-target effects. Thus, BiP binding to µ<sub>s</sub> must be highly stringent out of immunological necessity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anelli and van Anken, 2013</xref>), which correlates with the fact that mutations in µ<sub>s</sub> that lead to lowered affinity for BiP are associated with disorders of the immune system, such as lymphoproliferative heavy chain disease or myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hendershot et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anelli and Sitia, 2010</xref>).</p><p>To ascertain stringent ER retention of the accumulating load of µ<sub>s</sub>, the pool of BiP and the ER at large expanded to an impressive extent, echoing ER expansion during B cell to plasma cell development. In the course of B to plasma cell differentiation, however, all cellular machineries develop in a strict sequential order that allows them to anticipate bulk IgM production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Anken et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, the purely µ<sub>s</sub>-driven stimulus that we investigated in this study resulted almost exclusively in ER expansion. We found only meager indications of the expansion of even the remainder of the secretory machinery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). One could argue that the stringent retention of µ<sub>s</sub> in the ER by BiP would obviate the need to reinforce the secretory pathway downstream of the ER. Accordingly, homeostatic regulation of the Golgi and compartments beyond appears to be governed foremost by dedicated signaling mechanisms distinct from the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luini and Parashuraman, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we found that maximal UPR activation correlated with a shortage of BiP in matching the accumulating load of µ<sub>s</sub>, rather than with accumulation of client protein in the ER per se. Indeed, the transitioning of UPR signaling to chronic submaximal levels coincided with the ER becoming dominated by BiP. Our findings are in line with the idea—which was first coined by David Ron and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>)—that sequestering of BiP by ER clients (such as µ<sub>s</sub>) is key for activating the UPR, as activation of the main three UPR sensors (IRE1α, PERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>] and ATF6α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shen et al., 2002</xref>]) goes hand in hand with BiP dissociation from their respective luminal ER stress-sensing domains, whereas overexpression of BiP dampens UPR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>). Accordingly, despite its accumulation in the ER, the PiZ mutant of α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin does not sequester BiP and fails to trigger the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 1990</xref>). An in vitro study moreover suggests that sequestering of BiP by µ<sub>s</sub> would be sufficient to activate IRE1α and PERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrara et al., 2015</xref>). However, based on the crystal structure of yeast Ire1’s lumenal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Credle et al., 2005</xref>), Peter Walter and colleagues proposed instead that Ire1 activates through direct binding of unfolded proteins, for which in vitro evidence has subsequently been obtained for both yeast Ire1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>) and mammalian IRE1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karagöz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Assuming that the UPR signaling amplitude is commensurate with that of ER stress sensing by the UPR transducers, it is tempting to conclude that the UPR transducers are in the OFF state (as ER stress sensors) when bound to BiP, and in the ON state when bound to clients. So in a three-way competition between formation of sensor-BiP, sensor-client, and BiP-client complexes, the ratio between sensor-client (ON) and sensor-BiP (OFF) will most robustly report on the ratio between client and BiP. Thus, the two models for ER stress sensor activation can be reconciled easily in a model of ratiometric ER stress sensing, in line with our observations that the UPR signaling output is highest when the levels of the ER client µ<sub>s</sub> eclipse those of BiP, and that UPR signaling subsides to submaximal levels when an excess of BiP over the client is restored.</p><p>The finding that homeostatic readjustment of the ER entails that the UPR output becomes submaximal is also relevant for disease. Various genetic disorders stem from mutations in ER client proteins that lead to their misfolding and accumulation in the ER. On the basis of our results, cells that suffer from such conditions will likely adapt and display submaximal UPR signaling levels similar to those that we found for chronic µ<sub>s</sub> expression. In other words, submaximal UPR signaling is not a sign of ‘mild’ ER stress, but rather reflects that the stress is chronic.</p><p>Finally, since successful ER homeostatic readjustment upon µ<sub>s</sub>-driven proteostatic ER stress critically depends on the UPR, the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> cell model provides an excellent tool to dissect in greater detail how the UPR alleviates ER stress, and how it may serve to evaluate the success of ER homeostatic readjustment. The latter aspect is key, because a variety of disorders, ranging from cancer to diabetes, tie in with aberrant or maladaptive UPR-driven cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Kaufman, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and Reagents</title><p>All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy, unless otherwise stated.

Protein quantitation of samples was performed using a bicinchoninic acid.</p><p>Detection of fluorescent antibody signals on blots was performed by scanning with the Typhoon FLA-9000 reader, except for IRE1α and ATF6α, which were detected on films using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL. Signal intensities were analyzed with Image J. For absolute quantitation of BiP and µ<sub>s</sub> protein levels, standard µ<sub>s</sub> and BiP curves were obtained. To that end, we used purified mouse-myeloma-derived IgM (#02–6800, Thermo Fischer Scientific), of which we estimated 70% of the protein mass to be µ<sub>s</sub>, and purified recombinant hamster BiP, which save for two conservative changes, Y313F and A649S, is identical in sequence to human BiP and therefore, in all likelihood, is recognized equally well by the goat anti-BiP antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany). Recombinant BiP was expressed and purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marcinowski et al., 2011</xref>) from a pPROEX expression construct that was a kind gift from Dr Johannes Buchner. To avoid potential crossreaction of secondary antibodies against µ<sub>s</sub>, we used an anti-IgM antibody that was itself Alexa-546-conjugated to allow fluorescent detection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Radiolabeling</title><p>Cells were starved for 10 min in standard medium, containing 1% dialyzed FBS but lacking cysteine and methionine, prior to 10 min pulse labeling with Express [<sup>35</sup>S] Protein labeling mix (Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy) containing 40 µCi <sup>35</sup>S-methionine and <sup>35</sup>S-cysteine per 10<sup>6</sup> cells. Cells were harvested and washed twice in ice-cold HBSS (Thermo Fischer Scientific). After a wash in ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing NEM and protease inhibitors for 10 min on ice, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagioli and Sitia, 2001</xref>). Lysates were cleared for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4°C. Before immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were pre-cleared for 1 hr with 30 μl FCS-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and μ<sub>s</sub> was immunoprecipitated for 16 hr using a rabbit anti-mouse IgM (H) antibody (#61–6800, Life Technologies). Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein G-Agarose beads (Thermo Fischer Scientific), washed twice in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl and 0.5% NP-40, and once in 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), before gel electrophoresis.

Light microscopic images were acquired with an UltraView spinning disc confocal microscope operated by Volocity software (PerkinElmer). Images were processed with Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA). Antibodies used were: Alexa-546 anti-mouse IgM (µ) 1:1000 (Life Technologies, Monza, Italy); rabbit anti-calreticulin 1:200, and secondary Alexa-488-anti-rabbit 1:300 (Life Technologies).

Samples were rinsed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4), and post-fixed with 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide, 1% OsO<sub>4</sub>, sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 1 hr on ice. After en bloc staining with 0.5% uranyl acetate overnight at 4°C in the dark, samples were dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol, embedded in EPON and cured in an oven at 60°C for 48 hr. Ultrathin sections (70–90 nm) were obtained using an ultramicrotome (UC7, Leica microsystem, Vienna, Austria), collected, stained once more with uranyl acetate and Sato’s lead solutions, and visualized in a transmission electron microscope (Leo 912AB, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Digital micrographs were taken with a 2K × 2K bottom-mounted slow-scan camera (ProScan, Lagerlechfeld, Germany) controlled by EsivisionPro 3.2 software (Soft Imaging System, Münster, Germany). Images of randomly selected cells (10 for each condition) were acquired at a nominal magnification of 1840x. Using ImageJ software, cytoplasmic regions were selected manually and ER profiles were segmented, thanks to the electron-dense DAB precipitate, by means of an automatic macro based on threshold intensity, yielding the percentage of the area within the cytoplasm that was ER. For simplicity, we used the formula: volume (%) = (area (%))<sup>3/2</sup>—which would be fully accurate only if the ER were cuboidal, but which we considered a good approximation nonetheless—to obtain a rough estimate of the ER volume.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Proteomics analysis</title><p>SILAC heavy and light collected serum-free cell media were mixed proportionally to a 1:1 cell number ratio and lysed with 8 M Urea 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer. Proteins were then quantified by Bradford.

Survey full scan MS spectra (300–1650 Th) were acquired in the Orbitrap with 60,000 resolution, AGC target 3<sup>e6</sup>, IT 20 ms. For HCD spectra, resolution was set to 15,000 at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 200, AGC target 1<sup>e5</sup>, IT 80 ms; NCE 28% and isolation width 2.0 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>.</p><p>For identification and quantitation, raw data were processed with MaxQuant version 1.5.2.8 searching against the database uniprot_cp_human_2015_03 + sequences of µ<sub>s</sub> and the Mif responsive hybrid nuclear receptor Switch setting labeling Arg10 and Lys8, trypsin specificity and up to two missed cleavages. Cysteine carbamidomethyl was used as fixed modification, methionine oxidation and protein <italic>N</italic>-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. Mass deviation for MS-MS peaks was set at 20 ppm. The peptides and protein false discovery rates (FDR) were set to 0.01; the minimal length required for a peptide was six amino acids; a minimum of two peptides and at least one unique peptide were required for high-confidence protein identification.</p><p>The lists of identified proteins were filtered to eliminate known contaminants and reverse hits. Normalized H/L ratios were analyzed via Perseus (version 1.5.0.6). Statistical analysis was performed using the Significance B outlier test where statistical significance based on magnitude fold-change was established at p&lt;0.05. To look for proteins that changed over time, we considered Intensity L and Intensity H normalized by the correspondent Summed Intensity and the statistical ANOVA test analysis was performed using Perseus (ver. 1.5.0.6) with p&lt;0.01. All proteomic data as raw files, total proteins, and peptides identified with relative intensities and search parameters have been loaded into Peptide Atlas repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://PASS01009:PJ3566i@ftp.peptideatlas.org/">ftp://PASS01009:PJ3566i@ftp.peptideatlas.org/</ext-link>). To obtain approximations for absolute protein quantities, we followed a MaxLFQ label-free quantification strategy, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). We then assessed the relative abundance of total protein per subcellular compartment, that is cytosol, nucleus, mitochondrion, ER, and other organelles, as well as µ<sub>s</sub>, as well as the relative abundance of protein species, including or excluding µ<sub>s</sub>, within the ER as detailed in the legend of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs Bernhard Gendtner, Frank Park, and Johannes Buchner for sharing plasmids.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Davis Ng (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Walter (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors set the case that commonly used agents to induce the UPR, while useful to study signaling, are less desirable for studying the physiological decisions made by the cell to cope with stress due to their pleiotropic effects. The system set up is the controlled expression of the immunoglobulin M heavy chain in HeLa cells. The inspiration for their choice is the established system of B cell development into antibody secreting plasma cells. The process involves the UPR to remodel the ER for differentiation. Here, µs high-level expression causes strong UPR induction that is moderated when the lamda chain is co-expressed consistent with other studies where it is not the volume of the flux but the nature of the protein that is the primary determinant for the extent of UPR induction. The authors then combine quantitative proteomic analysis with ultrastructural measurements of growing ER to their induction profile. Together, these data were used to estimate the changes in steady state protein levels throughout the cell with a focus on ER localized proteins involved in protein homeostasis. Perhaps not surprisingly, BiP and other glucose regulatable chaperones showed the greatest changes over an expanding ER proteome that correlates with ER membrane expansion. The system is well suited the answer the long-standing question of when the UPR switches from being cyto-protective towards being pro-apoptotic.</p><p>Although there are specific concerns (see below), the study has many strengths. Of particular interest is the analysis of µs accumulation and how that correlates with the extent of UPR induction. One interesting finding was the following. &quot;Instead, UPR signaling reached maxima when the ratio μ<sub>s</sub>/BiP was highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). These findings support a scenario in which the UPR signals are commensurate with the extent of μ<sub>s</sub> sequestering the folding machinery, in particular BiP, rather than its accumulation per se.&quot; The idea of BiP limitation has been proposed for how the UPR activates, particularly Ire1 but to my knowledge, this is the first time the ratio of a specific stressor has been measured against BiP coordinately with all 3 arms of the UPR. However, the authors should be cautioned that the data in the manuscript do not distinguish the alternate mechanisms so such speculation should be stated as such.</p><p>The study is generally well designed and executed. It does an excellent job in validating the protein-based approach to induce ER stress. However, it is in the application of the method where authors encounter problems. In a number of experimental lines, the authors draw conclusions that are not fully supported by the data. In such cases, it is recommended that the text be changed to better reflect the data and any speculation be moved from the Results to the Discussion. In some cases, it might be better to move the data for future publication when the conclusions can be better substantiated. Of broad concern to reviewers is the writing style. There is an overuse of colorful/ornate terms that muddle up the authors' intended points. Because this occurs throughout the manuscript (some examples are outlined below), another round of careful editing is necessary. In the revision, it is also recommended that the text be shortened significantly to improve readability.</p><p>The manuscript in the present form is not yet suitable for publication. However, with substantial reorganization of the manuscript and figures, along with clarifications, this study will be of significant interest to the broad audience of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The authors state that 50 ng/ml Tm induces &quot;marginal&quot; XBP1 mRNA splicing. Looking at the data, the level of XBP1 mRNA splicing seems to approach 50%, which is by no means modest even when not maximal. Please correct. In addition, it is not accurate to state that a dose of 25 ng/ml Tm &quot;fails&quot; to engender XBP1 mRNA splicing. This is an assumption based on their PCR data, but it should be tested whether or not such low dose induces XBP1 mRNA splicing using specific primers to pick up on spliced from only.</p><p>2. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, there seems to be a missing a gel crop in the PERK blot between lanes 4-5. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the Ig levels are not &quot;comparable&quot; to plasma cells; they appear to be much higher. Please correct or rephrase.</p><p>3. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The authors overstate how their results distinguish flux of proteins entering the ER from simple accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Flux is not measured directly in this experiment, and an alternative explanation for the data is that IgL simply competes with BiP for binding sites on μ<sub>s</sub>, resulting in an apparent &quot;rescue&quot; that results from the freeing of BiP that would otherwise be bound to μ<sub>s</sub>.</p><p>4. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The rise in BiP levels over those of Ig heavy chain is marginal. The authors should include metrics for statistical significance for each data point.</p><p>5. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The authors should include quantification next to the corresponding pie chart slices for other organelles.</p><p>6. The conclusion that BiP behaves essentially as the ER &quot;fuel gauge&quot; enabling the cell to continue to expand the ER and attempt homeostasis is well supported by the data. However, there are no data to dismiss that direct binding of unfolded Ig heavy chain peptides could not engage the ER stress sensors as well. It could be possible that by flooding the ER with a single type of client, UPR activation results from the concomitant actions of the single ER client serving as BiP sink and unfolded peptides engaging the ER stress sensors. Moreover, it could be possible that the direct binding model could also help in fine-tuning the response. The data in this paper in no way refute the model that ER sensors are activated directly by unfolded protein binding.</p><p>7. Why is there no increase in BiP levels in the positive control (far left lane)?</p><p>8. The authors claim that Ire1a was replaced with Ire1a-GFP in cells. I don't see any description of CRISPR tagging, use of IRE1 KO cells or otherwise. This needs to be fully described.</p><p>9. How long were cells induced with Mif? While growing in the plates, only prior to placing on plates? This is not clear from the figure legend.</p><p>10. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> is a misrepresentation of the data. The data are not collected continuously. The time line and shading suggest continuous sampling. A standard plot with time points is the proper way to display these data.</p><p>11. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> lower panels. The dark blue histograms are often difficult to see against the dark EM background. Please use a better color or make a distinct histogram figure. Separating the histograms is not a great way to compare the data. The histograms should be presented side by side. This is true for 8F and 9E, too.</p><p>12. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The choice of two dark blues for the pie charts is confusing as it inadvertently suggests the total protein increase is BiP. Pick a different color for the ER in the total proteome.</p><p>Since lumenal J proteins are key BiP co-chaperones and known to increase robustly with ER stress, it would make sense to include these in the analyses.</p><p>13. Abstract: &quot;the UPR transitions from acute to full-geared activation…&quot;. The terms &quot;acute&quot; and &quot;full-geared&quot; are confusing in this context. Aren't they the same? Acute is generally meant to mean severe.</p><p>14. The authors may wish to restate that the µs induced HeLa cells &quot;triggered a full-blown UPR&quot; (page 5 bottom) for a number of reasons. First, the time of induction with tunicamycin or thapsigargin is 1.5 h versus 16 h for µs expression. They really aren't directly comparable. Second, the extent of induction is different. The extent of XBP1 splicing and ATF6 processing is less in the µs lanes. There is more BiP protein at steady state in the µs expressed cells but that's misleading because that's 16 h of induced expression versus 1.5 h and BiP is a very stable protein. Third, if µs expression did lead to &quot;full-blown&quot; UPR activation (vague, but defined in the text as Tm/Tg treatment), I see that as problematic because the authors have argued persuasively that such treatment is non-physiological and toxic. Based on that argument, I would expect that ER stress that is manageable would cause a more modest level of induction, which is exactly what is observed.</p><p>15. The passage: &quot;Thus, the full-blown UPR that was elicited by μ<sub>s</sub> expression was well tolerated by the cells, unlike prolonged treatment with Tm at concentrations that triggered a full-blown UPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).&quot; Is tolerance due to UPR induction? Has this experiment been performed in cell lines deficient in any of the 3 UPR branches?</p><p>16. The passage: &quot;Since the cells that inducibly overexpress μ<sub>s</sub> showed maximal UPR activation with no major negative impact on cell growth-unlike cells treated with UPR eliciting drugs-we surmised that the μ<sub>s</sub> expressing cells underwent successful homeostatic readjustment of the ER.&quot; This statement seems to contradict the stated basis for setting up this system, that the drugs are toxic, not because they simply induce the UPR, but that they disrupt the function of many proteins.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The unfolded protein response turns from pro-survival to pro-death to cap the extent of endoplasmic reticulum expansion&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>Although the manuscript is improved from the original version, there are claims that reviewers view as not fully supported. While the consensus view remains that the µs overexpression system of ER stress is well designed and characterised, the use of the system to understand specific questions of UPR physiology are not as well designed. Because the study is extensive, it is the advice of the reviewers to restate the claims as instructed and/or remove data that can be published elsewhere with additional work. It is our view that the manuscript can be published after some extensive reorganisation of the data and major text changes.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the following was also passed to the authors via correspondence with the editorial staff, further an author query.]</p><p>Regarding splitting the paper into two, it is the consensus view of the reviewers that the innovation of establishing a more physiological form of inducing ER stress and its validation to be the strength of the manuscript. That should be the focus of paper one. For paper two, we would caution the authors to consider very carefully how to proceed. We believe this is where the authors wish to use the system to answer specific questions regarding how the UPR responds to and alleviates ER stress. While the goal is important and an excellent use of the system, it is clear that the authors tried to do too much here, which made the supporting data incomplete at this point. Unless the authors have expanded this part of the study significantly and completely addressed reviewer concerns, it is not recommended that this part to be co-submitted. It should be submitted separately at another time.</p><p>[Editors' note: following the editors’ advice, the authors resubmitted and further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work now entitled &quot;Ratiometric sensing of BiP-client versus BiP levels by the unfolded protein response determines its signaling amplitude&quot; for further consideration at eLife.

The data in 4C are not continuous. They are discrete. I have no problem with the authors presenting their data as a heat map. That is fine. However, it should be clear that each data point is a defined block representing a specific time point. The data, as currently plotted, in a smeared form indicate that there are multiple data points that blur together, as if data were sampled every few minutes. Just present the heat map as blocks instead of a smear and I accept the revised manuscript.</p><p>The request from the reviewer does not involve any additional experimentation but modification in presentation of the data.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the original Decision letter and Author response included references to data which have subsequently been omitted and are therefore not discussed in this edited version.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27518.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We were of course delighted to read that the reviewers found that “there are many strengths to the study”, that “the study is generally well designed and executed”, and that “this study will be of significant interest to the broad audience of eLife”.

Between 16-32 hrs again there is no statistical difference between µ<sub>s</sub> and BiP levels, whereupon BiP levels exceed µ<sub>s</sub> levels in a highly significant manner in the chronic phase.</p><p>To report on the significance of the differences in expression levels in an intuitive manner (see also the response below to minor point 18), we thought to display a time bar with a color-coding scale, ranging from dark blue (BiP &gt; µ<sub>s</sub>; p &lt; 0.001) to purple (BiP ≈ µ<sub>s</sub>) to red (µ<sub>s</sub> &gt; BiP; p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Since we do not think that the method is accurate enough to establish exactly by what margin µ<sub>s</sub> eclipses BiP levels, we want to emphasize the opposite of which we are very confident, namely, that BiP levels transiently <italic>do not</italic> eclipse those of µ<sub>s</sub>. We therefore feel that the accompanying sentence in the text still best expresses how the data should be interpreted: “Early upon the onset of µ<sub>s</sub> expression and before BiP induction was fully underway, however, µ<sub>s</sub> levels transiently were at a 1:1 stoichiometry with those of BiP, or possibly, μ<sub>s</sub> levels even slightly exceeded BiP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.

While we believe the approach we have chosen was ideal for demonstrating just that, we would be hesitant to give too much credence to the absolute values we obtained per organelle. To display them next to the graphs would distract from the message and suggest an accuracy that we cannot vouch for.

The conclusion that BiP behaves essentially as the ER &quot;fuel gauge&quot; enabling the cell to continue to expand the ER and attempt homeostasis is well supported by the data. However, there are no data to dismiss that direct binding of unfolded Ig heavy chain peptides could not engage the ER stress sensors as well. It could be possible that by flooding the ER with a single type of client, UPR activation results from the concomitant actions of the single ER client serving as BiP sink and unfolded peptides engaging the ER stress sensors. Moreover, it could be possible that the direct binding model could also help in fine-tuning the response. The data in this paper in no way refute the model that ER sensors are activated directly by unfolded protein binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We reconsidered this issue and concluded that the models of UPR sensor activation are only in apparent contradiction, but physiologically interchangeable and therefore easy to reconcile.

Since cells were treated for only 4 hrs with 5 µg/ml Tm no increase of BiP is detectable at the protein level – it would require a longer Tm treatment (12 hrs) to perceive changes for BiP at the protein level, but at that stage cells are already quite sick from the Tm treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

The tendency in -omics studies to focus on fold changes leads to a particular emphasis in the interpretation of biological phenomena, which sometimes even may obscure other biologically meaningful aspects. In our study we have chosen to estimate protein levels in ppm of the total proteome, which gives another perspective on what are robust increases.</p><p>For instance, according to our proteomics data, PDI is upregulated “only” 1.6 fold, but since PDI is an abundant protein at basal conditions, being already 4.5x10<sup>4</sup> ppm, which equates to approximately 2x10<sup>7</sup> copies per non-stressed cell, it implies that more than 1x10<sup>7</sup> extra molecules of PDI are present after 7 days of µ<sub>s</sub> expression. Ten million extra copies of PDI seems to us a rather robust change, despite the low fold change!</p><p>From the data presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary File 1</xref> it is evident that four ERdj proteins were so lowly expressed or not expressed at all in our model cell line that we did not detect them by proteomics: ERdj1 (DNAJC1), ERdj2 (SEC63), ERdj4 (DNAJB9), and ERdj7 (DNAJC25), while ERdj5 (DNAJC10) was barely detectable by proteomics. ERdj3 (DNAJB11) and ERdj6 (DNAJC3) were well-detectable by proteomics, but still in low amounts. Our proteomics survey estimated ERdj3 and ERdj6 to go up about 3-6 fold from about 2-6x10<sup>2</sup> ppm to 2x10<sup>3</sup> ppm, which would amount to 1x10<sup>6</sup> copies per cell for either ERdj protein after 7 days of µ<sub>s</sub> expression; in other words there are about 1-2x10<sup>6</sup> total ERdj protein extra copies per cell, which arguably is a less robust change than that of PDI, even though at the mRNA level the fold change may be much more flagrant than for PDI. For comparison: we estimated BiP levels after 7 days of µ<sub>s</sub> expression to be about 2x10<sup>8</sup> copies per cell. Thus, altogether it seems that BiP levels exceed those of its co-chaperones about a hundred fold. From these estimates it thus appears that either a single ERdj protein can cater 100 BiP proteins simultaneously or that a majority of BiP molecules operates without co-chaperoning.</p><p>Since our aim was to obtain an idea of how the cell, and, in particular the ER, changes in terms of protein (mass) content, we chose the “cut off” for in-depth analysis such that it pertained only to the proteins that were among the 500-600 most abundant proteins, as explained in the manuscript. The ERdjs did not make that cut and if we would display them in the way we display our data in the proteomics figure, the ERdjs would be still invisible, as the most lowly abundant protein within this top 500-600, TRAPd, is already barely visible in the pie diagram.</p><p>We therefore do not feel we should add data on ERdjs to the figure. For who would be interested in the ERdjs, their expression data are readily available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary File 1.We</xref> did however decide to briefly touch in the results on the finding that BiP vastly outnumbers its co-chaperones, the ERdjs.

Abstract: &quot;the UPR transitions from acute to full-geared activation…&quot;. The terms &quot;acute&quot; and &quot;full-geared&quot; are confusing in this context. Aren't they the same? Acute is generally meant to mean severe.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid confusion we corrected the abstract such that there is now a comma between acute and full-geared (which lacked before): “acute, full-geared activation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. The authors may wish to restate that the µs induced HeLa cells &quot;triggered a full-blown UPR&quot; (page 5 bottom) for a number of reasons. First, the time of induction with tunicamycin or thapsigargin is 1.5 h versus 16 h for µs expression. They really aren't directly comparable. Second, the extent of induction is different. The extent of XBP1 splicing and ATF6 processing is less in the µs lanes. There is more BiP protein at steady state in the µs expressed cells but that's misleading because that's 16 h of induced expression versus 1.5 h and BiP is a very stable protein. Third, if µs expression did lead to &quot;full-blown&quot; UPR activation (vague, but defined in the text as Tm/Tg treatment), I see that as problematic because the authors have argued persuasively that such treatment is non-physiological and toxic. Based on that argument, I would expect that ER stress that is manageable would cause a more modest level of induction, which is exactly what is observed.</p><p>15. The passage: &quot;Thus, the full-blown UPR that was elicited by μ<sub>s</sub> expression was well tolerated by the cells, unlike prolonged treatment with Tm at concentrations that triggered a full-blown UPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).&quot; Is tolerance due to UPR induction? Has this experiment been performed in cell lines deficient in any of the 3 UPR branches?</p><p>16. The passage: &quot;Since the cells that inducibly overexpress μ<sub>s</sub> showed maximal UPR activation with no major negative impact on cell growth-unlike cells treated with UPR eliciting drugs-we surmised that the μ<sub>s</sub> expressing cells underwent successful homeostatic readjustment of the ER.&quot; This statement seems to contradict the stated basis for setting up this system, that the drugs are toxic, not because they simply induce the UPR, but that they disrupt the function of many proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>The above three points that the reviewers raise are a bit bewildering to us as they seem to suggest (contrary to the earlier points that were raised) that the reviewers do not see what the merits of our model using a proteostatic insult are with respect to “traditional” ER stress eliciting drugs.</p><p>In short: Tm etc. may trigger full-blown UPR output levels, i.e. maximally obtainable levels of splicing, ATF6a cleavage and CHOP expression, but ER homeostatic readjustment cannot be achieved, since the cells succumb to pleiotropic effects before. From the time course experiment that we show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) it is evident that inducible µ<sub>s</sub> expression leads to similar full-blown UPR output levels (albeit that maximal splicing levels are reached at a slower pace), but the cells do not suffer from pleiotropic effects and, thus, ER homeostatic readjustment can be achieved. As such, we were in a position to demonstrate that the UPR is essential for this ER homeostatic readjustment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Thus, full-blown UPR output levels are not detrimental to the cells per se. It is the pleiotropic effects of the ER stress eliciting drugs that kills them. Cells die from Tm treatment likely due to glycoproteins being depleted at destinations where they have to exert their function, and similar reasoning would explain the toxic effects of DTT or Tg. The UPR to some extent mitigates these problems and thereby even prolongs the life of cells treated with Tm etc. Accordingly, we found that cells in which UPR pathways are ablated succumb at even lower doses of Tm than WT cells. This finding demonstrates that strategies to investigate potential pro-apoptotic roles of the UPR in the context of cells treated with ER-stress-eliciting drugs by default are in vain.</p><p>Since we apparently did not make this notion clear enough to the reviewers, as it seemed from minor points 24-26, we decided to include this finding in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to highlight better why strategies to elucidate how the UPR can transition from a cyto-protective to pro-apoptotic output are in vain when ER-stress eliciting drugs are used.
