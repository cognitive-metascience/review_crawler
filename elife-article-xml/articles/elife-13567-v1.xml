sequences with a type IV IRES are able to initiate translation without any host initiation factors. Initial recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit as well as two translocation steps before the first peptidyl transfer are essential for the initiation of translation by these mRNAs. Using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) we have structurally characterized at high resolution how the Cricket Paralysis Virus <underline>I</underline>nternal <underline>R</underline>ibosomal <underline>E</underline>ntry <underline>S</underline>ite (CrPV-IRES) binds the small ribosomal subunit (40S) and the translocation intermediate stabilized by elongation factor 2 (eEF2). The CrPV-IRES restricts tvhe otherwise flexible 40S head to a conformation compatible with binding the large ribosomal subunit (60S). Once the 60S is recruited, the binary CrPV-IRES/80S complex oscillates between canonical and rotated states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2014</xref>), as seen for pre-translocation complexes with tRNAs. Elongation factor eEF2 with a GTP analog stabilizes the ribosome-IRES complex in a rotated state with an extra ~3 degrees of rotation. Key residues in domain IV of eEF2 interact with pseudoknot I (PKI) of the CrPV-IRES stabilizing it in a conformation reminiscent of a hybrid tRNA state. The structure explains how diphthamide, a eukaryotic and archaeal specific post-translational modification of a histidine residue of eEF2, is involved in translocation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13567.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13567.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>IRES</kwd><kwd>cricket</kwd><kwd>paralysis</kwd><kwd>virus infection</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>translocation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105184332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name><name><surname>Savva</surname><given-names>Christos G</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramakrishnan</surname><given-names>Venki</given-names></name><name><surname>Fernández</surname><given-names>Israel S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT096570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramakrishnan</surname><given-names>Venki</given-names></name><name><surname>Fernández</surname><given-names>Israel S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009344</institution-id><institution>Agouron Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramakrishnan</surname><given-names>Venki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name><name><surname>Dever</surname><given-names>Thomas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A Internal Ribosomal Entry Site RNA has been visualised by high resolution cryoEM, trapped in the ribosome in an intermediate state of translocation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During initiation of translation, a crucial step is the placement of the start codon and initiator tRNA in the P site of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmeing and Ramakrishnan, 2009</xref>). In eukaryotes, initiation involves almost a dozen protein initiation factors (IFs), several of which are large multi-subunit complexes. A subset of IFs bind to the capped 5’ end of a mRNA followed by recruitment of a 43S complex of the small subunit (with additional IFs). Subsequently, the resulting 48S complex scans along the mRNA to reach the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aitken and Lorsch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>). The complexity of initiation in eukaryotes is used by cells to regulate translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). However, viruses, which rely on the host machinery to translate their genomes, often target initiation to hijack host ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jackson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walsh and Mohr, 2011</xref>). One strategy employed by viruses relies on the use of structured sequences in their mRNA that allow them to bypass many or all aspects of canonical initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kieft, 2009</xref>). These structured RNA sequences, termed IRES (for <underline>I</underline>nternal <underline>R</underline>ibosomal <underline>E</underline>ntry <underline>S</underline>ite) elements, play a critical role in translation of their messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jackson, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Viral IRES sequences can be classified according to their level of dependence on IFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Filbin and Kieft, 2009</xref>). Type IV IRESs form a homogenous class of viral RNAs, which completely dispense with the requirement for any IFs and thus are able to directly recruit and assemble a translating 80S ribosome by themselves. These IRESs are typically found in the intergenic region (IGR) of a family of + sense RNA viruses called <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> hence they are also known as IGR-IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sasaki and Nakashima, 1999</xref>). Extensive biochemical and structural characterization of these IRES sequences has provided a detailed picture on how they work at a molecular level. The approximately 190 nucleotide sequence folds into a compact, well-defined three-dimensional structure making use of three internal pseudoknots (PKI-III, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costantino and Kieft, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costantino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pestova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schüler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pestova and Hellen, 2003</xref>). Two of these pseudoknots (PKII and PKIII) and accessory sequences, fold into a compact domain following a scheme also seen in other structured RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kieft, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Au et al., 2015</xref>). As a result, two stem loops (SL-IV and SL-V) are exposed and are responsible for the bulk of interactions with the small ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schüler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Spahn et al., 2004a</xref>). Two additional regions of the IGR-IRES are functionally relevant: the L1.1 region, responsible for the interaction with the L1 stalk of the large ribosomal subunit and PKI. This latter pseudoknot, a structural mimic of a canonical tRNA-mRNA interaction, is responsible for the correct positioning of the viral RNA in the decoding center of the small ribosomal subunit, and is recognized by the ribosome in the same way as a cognate mRNA-tRNA pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costantino et al., 2008</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13567.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Interaction of PKI of CrPV-IRES in the 40S mimics decoding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the type-IV IRES, colored according to different structural motifs.

More recent higher-resolution cryo-EM studies showed that the IRES coexists in equilibrium between canonical and rotated states of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of PKI in the A site is consistent with evidence that translocation of the IRES is required to bring the first codon of the mRNA into the A site and allow delivery of the first animoacyl tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). It also implies that translation of these mRNAs begins in the middle of what is normally the elongation cycle, thus bypassing normal initiation completely and avoiding any regulation over initiation.</p><p>Translocation is defined as the concerted movement of tRNAs and mRNA with respect to the ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodnina and Wintermeyer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Voorhees and Ramakrishnan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Munro et al., 2009</xref>). Upon the acceptance of a cognate tRNA on the A site, peptidyl transfer from the peptidyl tRNA in the P site to the newly accepted aminoacyl tRNA on the A site occurs spontaneously and allows the ribosome to reach an intermediate state of translocation characterized by hybrid A/P and P/E states of the tRNAs and intersubunit rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moazed and Noller, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank and Agrawal, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agirrezabala et al., 2008</xref>). This intermediate state is in equilibrium with the original canonical conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blanchard et al., 2004</xref>). The GTPase elongation factor EF-G in bacteria stabilizes the intermediate state and catalyzes the next step of the process, which involves movement of the mRNA and tRNAs with respect to the small subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moazed and Noller, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodnina et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spiegel et al., 2007</xref>). Both EF-G and its eukaryotic counterpart eEF2 exhibit a high degree of sequence homology and hydrolyze one molecule of GTP into GDP per translocation cycle. The result of translocation is the movement of the A-site tRNA to the P site and the P-site tRNA to the E site and its subsequent dissociation from the ribosome. Translocation results in an empty A site that can bind the next incoming aminoacyl tRNA. Frameshifting is avoided by coordinate movement of mRNA and tRNAs, which is facilitated by the maintenance of base-pairing interactions between the anticodon stem loops (ASL) of the tRNAs and the mRNA codons during translocation.</p><p>Recent structural studies have complemented previous detailed biochemical and single molecule fluorescence studies and shed unprecedented light on the structural nature of various steps of translation elongation and the role of EF-G/eEF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tourigny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pulk and Cate, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brilot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, structures of EF-G/ribosome complexes with both A- and P-site tRNAs have also been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brilot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramrath et al., 2013</xref>). These structures reveal how bacterial EF-G binds to a rotated state of the ribosome, inducing an extra degree of rotation while domain IV of EF-G contacts the tRNA in a hybrid ap/P configuration. In this hybrid state, the tRNA has its anticodon at a position intermediate between the canonical A and P sites in the small subunit while its aminoacyl end is in the P site of the peptidyl transferase center in the large subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratje et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Even though there are many similarities between bacterial and eukaryotic translocation, some important features are unique to eukaryotes. For example, a conserved histidine residue (H699 in yeast, H719 in mammals) in a loop at the tip of domain IV of eEF2 is post-translationally modified to diphthamide (DPH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffrath et al., 2014</xref>). The diphthamide modification, which requires the activity of seven gene products, is conserved in eukaryotes and archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffrath et al., 2014</xref>), but its precise function is unclear. To date, the key feature of diphthamide is that it renders eEF2 susceptible to mono-ADP ribosylation and inactivation by diphtheria toxin, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> exotoxin A, and cholera toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffrath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Passador and Iglewski, 1994</xref>). Despite uncertainty regarding the cellular function of diphthamide, yeast strains lacking the diphthamide modification enzyme DPH2 display altered levels of frameshifting on the programmed -1 frameshift site from the yeast L-A virus, indicating that diphthamide contributes to fidelity of translation elongation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ortiz et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Type IV IRES–mediated peptide synthesis requires two prior translocation events: first, movement of the IRES to translocate PKI from the A to the P site, and a second translocation that moves PKI from the P to the E site while simultaneously translocating the first aminoacyl tRNA from the A to the P site (without peptidyl transfer). A precise understanding of how eEF2 works in the context of a ribosome programmed with a type IV IRES is thus needed to fully understand how these IRESs function. Because the IRES mimics tRNAs in the ribosome, such an understanding will also shed light on the role of eEF2 in canonical translocation with tRNAs.</p><p>This work addresses two questions. Firstly, it describes the detailed structure of the type IV Cricket Paralysis Virus IRES (CrPV-IRES) bound to the small ribosomal subunit (40S), and how it primes the recruitment of the large subunit in order to assemble a translationally competent 80S. Secondly, the structure of eEF2 with a ribosome-IRES complex in an intermediate state provides insights into eEF2’s role in both IRES and canonical translocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CrPV-IRES interaction with the isolated 40S ribosomal subunit</title><p>The first step in translation of an mRNA with a type IV IRES is the recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit (40S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>).

Interestingly, the CrPV-IRES appears to have restricted the conformational flexibility of the 40S head. This is mainly accomplished by insertion of SL-IV and V of the IRES in the cleft formed between the head and the body of the 40S, as previously seen in the context of the pre-translocation binary complex CrPV-IRES/80S (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>With this conformation of the head, PKI is able to bind well to the decoding center, allowing for a detailed analysis of its contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). While the PKI contacts show marked similarity with canonical decoding, additional features distinguish PKI. Previous mutagenesis studies established the essential role of the correct base pairing of the tRNA/mRNA mimicry domain of type IV IRESs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kanamori and Nakashima, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</xref>). Watson-Crick geometry between these bases of PKI is therefore essential to induce a conformation of the decoding center similar to that in decoding with tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ogle and Ramakrishnan, 2005</xref>). Briefly, the conserved adenines 1753 and 1754 (1492 and 1493 in <italic>E. coli</italic>) project outwards from helix 44 (h44) to interact through A-minor motifs with the nucleotides forming base pairs (BP) 1 and 2 of the codon/anticodon minihelix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Accessory elements from other ribosomal components including G576 (G530 in <italic>E. coli</italic>), C564 (C518 in <italic>E. coli</italic>) and residues from uS12 (P64 and S66, [P48 and S50 in <italic>E. coli</italic>]) assist in monitoring the shape of BP1 and BP2, and less stringently of BP3 (the wobble position, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). We also observed an additional base pair between position 1 of the first translated codon and the ribosomal base C1273 (C1054 in <italic>E. coli</italic>; termed BP4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D and E</xref>). In standard decoding, this ribosomal base interacts with the anticodon nucleotide of BP3, whereas here a rotation of the base about its glycosidic bond allows for a tight stacking interaction with one of the CrPV-IRES bases, redirecting C1273 towards the first base of the first coding codon of the CrPV RNA. All IGR-IRES sequences obtained to date encode a guanine residue at this position with the only exception being the PSIV-IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kieft, 2009</xref>). This conservation suggests an important role of the additional base pair.</p><p>In addition to directing the synthesis of the viral structural protein ORF2, a sub-class of IGR-IRES elements synthetize a second polypeptide called Open Reading Frame x (ORFx), which is encoded in the +1 reading frame relative to ORF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ren et al., 2012</xref>). Although originally discovered and characterized in Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), and Solenopsis invicta virus (SINV-1), ORFx translation was also recently reported for the CrPV-IRES sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang and Jan, 2014</xref>). In order to select an open reading frame, PKI actively assists in presenting the adjacent first codon in a proper conformation in the A site to the first incoming aminoacyl-tRNA. Given the dynamic nature of PKI, its ability to direct initiation of ORF2 or alternatively ORFx could be linked to interactions with ribosomal elements present in the A site. Thus, C1273 may represent an important regulatory element in the ribosomal A site that helps direct frame selection by type IV IRES elements.</p><p>In our previous reconstruction of a binary 80S/CrPV-IRES complex, the variable loop (VRL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) connecting the mRNA-like fragment of PKI with the tRNA-like fragment was poorly ordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>). However, in the context of the 40S subunit, partial density for the VRL can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Several studies have explored the structural and functional requirements of the VRL in type IV IRES-mediated translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruehle et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, both the length and sequence of the VRL seem to be essential for the correct positioning of PKI in a productive conformation in the ribosomal A site, as well as for the translocation steps delivering PKI to the P-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruehle et al., 2015</xref>). We speculate the VRL may have an important role in the initial stages of 40S recruitment by type IV IRESs, perhaps contributing additional anchoring points to the small subunit in the initial steps that could help in proper positioning of PKI. Whether this initial placement of PKI (assisted by the VRL) is related to the early events of frame selection by type IV IRESs will require further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Overall architecture of a complex of CrPV-IRES with the ribosome and elongation factor eEF2</title><p>After recruitment of the large ribosomal subunit (60S), the CrPV-IRES/80S complex oscillates between two states of inter-subunit rotation, emulating a canonical pre-translocation complex after peptidyl transfer and prior to translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2014</xref>). In this state, PKI remains anchored to the A site of the small subunit and the L1.1 segment couples the rotation of the small subunit with the movement of the L1 stalk of the 60S. In order to allow the first aminoacyl tRNA to be delivered to the A site, PKI has to be translocated to the P site, in a step catalyzed by eEF2. To gain insight into this process, we assembled a pre-translocation complex with CrPV-IRES and 80S, which was subsequently incubated with eEF2 complexed with the non-hydrolysable GTP analog 5'-guanylyl-methylene-bis-phosphonate (GDPCP).

A useful nomenclature has been coined in order to reflect the diversity of states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratje et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, an ap/P state specifies a tRNA in transit from a canonical A/A state to a canonical P/P state with its anticodon stem-loop (ASL) between the A and P sites in the small subunit, while the CCA-peptidyl end has reached the P-site on the large subunit.

Subsequently a tRNA that is intermediate in both the small and large subunits was seen by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Because PKI mimics an A-site tRNA, the structure here allows us to observe high-resolution details of eEF2 in the A site of the small subunit before translocation.</p><p>The overall conformation of the CrPV-IRES in the presence of eEF2-GDPCP is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>.

In our structure, H694 interacts with PKI while the diphthamide moiety (DPH) on H699 is closely packed against the sugar of nucleotide 6189 in the CrPV-IRES. The diphthamide appears to sterically prevent the rRNA decoding bases A1753 and A1754 from interacting with BP1 and BP2 of PKI, whose conformations were otherwise not altered upon binding of eEF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). The interaction between bases A1753 and A1754 and PKI, was seen in the binary CrPV-IRES/40S complex described above, and was maintained during recruitment of the 60S and the induction of the rotated state in the binary CrPV-IRES/80S complex before eEF2 binding. However, this interaction must be broken in order for PKI to translocate from the A to the P site of the 40S. In our structure of the eEF2-bound complex, clear density for these decoding bases was seen in a retracted position in helix 44 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref> ). This suggests that H699, by competing for the binding to PKI with these bases, breaks their decoding interaction with BP1 and BP2. Diphthamide, by making additional stabilizing interactions with PKI facilitates this step. The disruption of the decoding interaction of the ribosomal bases by eEF2 provides an explanation for the well known inhibitory effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics on the action of EF-G and translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodnina et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Studer et al., 2003</xref>).

The antibiotics would thus prevent retraction of the bases into helix 44 upon EF-G or eEF2 binding, thereby precluding interactions of the factors required for their function as well as preventing the disruption of the decoding interactions that is a pre-requisite for translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>).</p><p>In order to test whether diphthamide plays a role in CrPV-IRES function, we established an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted translation system using reagents from yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) to monitor IRES-mediated synthesis of the tri-peptide Met-Phe-Lys (MFK). Whereas the CrPV-IRES initiates translation with Ala, a minimal CrPV-IRES RNA, encompassing residues 6027 to 6216, was designed to initiate translation with Met (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) to facilitate detection of peptide products using [<sup>35</sup>S]Met and to enable direct comparison to peptide synthesis directed by the normal translation initiation pathway. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the WT CrPV-IRES readily directed the synthesis of MFK tripeptide (left panel).

Mutation of CC to GG disrupting BP1 and BP2 likewise abolished peptide synthesis in our assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, second panel). As an additional control, a model unstructured mRNA that avoids the requirement for translation factors that promote mRNA recruitment was used to assemble a canonical 80S initiation complex.

Three eEF2 mutant proteins were purified for these assays. First, eEF2 lacking diphthamide was prepared from yeast lacking the <italic>DPH2</italic> gene required for the first step in diphthamide synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffrath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ortiz et al., 2006</xref>). Second, eEF2-P580H was designed to disrupt the first loop at the tip of domain IV (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Third, eEF2-H699N was designed to eliminate the diphthamide modification of this residue and because previous studies indicated a role for this residue in translation elongation fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ortiz et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with the negligible growth defects under normal conditions in yeast strains lacking <italic>DPH2</italic> or expressing eEF2-H699N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ortiz et al., 2006</xref>), the eEF2 mutants functioned like WT eEF2 to promote MFK formation in reactions using 80S initiation complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, lack of diphthamide does not significantly impair eEF2 function in normal translation including the translocation events required for MFK formation. In contrast, unmodified eEF2 and the eEF2-P580H and eEF2-H699N mutants exhibited marked defects in MFK synthesis in assays directed by the CrPV-IRES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Since the translocation events prior to the first peptidyl transfer represent key differences between the IRES and canonical pathways for MFK synthesis, diphthamide appears to be important for the non-canonical translocation of the CrPV-IRES prior to first peptide bond formation. The interaction of diphthamide with G6189 of BP1 in the codon-anticodon mimicking element of PKI and the steric obstruction of the rRNA decoding bases by diphthamide suggest that its primary function during normal translation may be to optimize efficiency and fidelity during translocation. Testing this idea will require detailed kinetic studies in a eukaryotic translation system using eEF2 with and without the diphthamide modification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A high-resolution view of the eukaryotic GTPase center in an active state</title><p>The translational GTPases including eEF2/EF-G, eEF1A/EF-Tu, eIF5B/IF-2, and eRF3/RF-3 assist the ribosome in progressing through the various steps of polypeptide synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sprinzl et al., 2000</xref>). All of these factors bind to the ribosome in an active conformation as a complex with GTP. Their binding to the ribosome is followed by hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and subsequent release of the factors from the ribosome. GTP hydrolysis is induced by conformational changes in the ribosome, which position the catalytic site of the factor close to the sarcin-ricin-loop (SRL) in the large subunit. Recent structures of the ribosome in complex with EF-Tu or EF-G bound to GDPCP during decoding or translocation, respectively, have shed light on the molecular details of GTPase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tourigny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pulk and Cate, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Voorhees et al., 2010</xref>).

The conformation of the histidine is stabilized by a universally conserved nucleotide in the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL). Recent biochemical and molecular dynamics studies support the idea that the catalytic center observed in these structures represents a GTPase-activated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maracci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamczyk and Warshel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Åqvist and Kamerlin, 2015</xref>). However, in structures of both bacterial RF-3 and EF-G with the GTP analog GDPNP, the conserved histidine was observed in a conformation away from both the SRL and the γ phosphate of the GTP molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that not all GTP analogs behave in the same way and that some may resemble the GTP state less than others.</p><p>The GTPase center observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>) agrees with earlier crystallographic results obtained on bacterial systems with GDPCP.

Although the current structure is of a eukaryotic complex determined by cryoEM, the locations of the key magnesium ions and the overall conformation of the three loops implicated in GTPase activation appear to be conserved with those previously observed in crystallographic studies in bacterial systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>).

Their tertiary structure allows crucial elements of the IRES to interact with the small ribosomal subunit via a cluster of specific ribosomal proteins (eS25, S28, uS7 and uS11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>). This cluster is strategically located in the cleft between the head and body of the 40S. By placing the IRES elements SL-IV and SL-V in that cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the IRES is able to restrict the otherwise highly dynamic head of the small ribosomal subunit. The restriction on the mobility of the 40S head upon CrPV-IRES binding involves an entropic cost, which is likely balanced by the binding energy from interactions between the CrPV-IRES and the small subunit. This stabilization of the head is accompanied by the insertion of IRES element PKI into the decoding site of the small subunit. The tRNA/mRNA mimicry of this domain induces conformational changes similar to those in decoding, thereby anchoring PKI to the A site. The VRL element of PKI seems to be involved in this early event, as ordered density for a segment of this highly dynamic loop can be distinguished in our reconstruction. The stabilization of the head in an appropriate conformation for 60S binding provides a rationale for how the IRES promotes recruitment of the 60S subunit to form the 80S ribosome. By contrast, those elements of the CrPV-IRES not directly interacting with the 40S (for example, L1.1 and L1.2) are very flexible, and thus, could only be visualized at low resolution in our 40S reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In contrast, these elements, especially L1.1, become ordered upon recruitment of the large ribosomal subunit due to specific contacts, primarily with the L1-stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The conformation of the 40S head also seems to be restricted by the initiation machinery during delivery of canonical initiator tRNA to the 40S subunit in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erzberger et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, type IV IRESs seem to exploit a feature of ribosomes that is also used in canonical initiation. Other IRESs, such as the type III HCV-IRES, seem to target the same cluster of small subunit ribosomal proteins as the CrPV-IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quade et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that this may be a general mode of action of IRES sequences.</p><p>PKI is an independent domain of the type IV IRESs that mimics a tRNA anticodon stem-loop interacting with a codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costantino et al., 2008</xref>). This domain is not essential for the binding of the IRES to the small subunit, but it is required for priming the ribosome for elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</xref>). Previous structural studies in the context of the full (80S) ribosome have unambiguously established the positioning of this PKI in the decoding center in the A site of the small subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2014</xref>). Following recruitment of the 60S, the resulting IRES/80S complex oscillates between ratcheted and canonical configurations. This ratcheting of the ribosome involves the classic anti-clockwise rotation of the 40S by approximately 5° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, top). In this rotated state, which is similar to a canonical pre-translocation complex, the IRES mimics the hybrid states of tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agirrezabala et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Julian et al., 2008</xref>). During these fluctuations, PKI remains anchored to the decoding center of the A site of the 40S and SL-IV and V remain anchored to the ribosomal protein cluster previously described. GTP hydrolysis by eEF2 catalyzes translocation of PKI to the P site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, right). Subsequent dissociation of eEF2 results in a vacant A site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, bottom right) that can accept the first aminoacyl tRNA. A conformation of the IRES with PKI translocated into the P site has recently been characterized using a release factor bound to a stop codon in the A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>). In the translocated state, PKI occupies the P site, as expected, but critically, the connections of SL-IV and V with the cluster of ribosomal proteins in the small subunit are lost, leaving these IRES elements solvent exposed. In contrast, the other major anchoring point of the IRES to the ribosome, the L1.1 element (which interacts with the L1-stalk of the 60S), remains solidly in place; however, the stalk is displaced even further compared to its position in the rotated state of the binary IRES-80S complex. The post-translocated conformation of the IRES is characterized by PKI in the P site, SL-IV and V detached from the 40S, and the L1 stalk pushed further away. The entire IRES is rotated around its longitudinal axis when compared to the pre-translocated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, bottom-right). Interestingly, in the post-translocated state Muhs <italic>et al</italic> report partial density for the VRL, which is stabilized by interactions with the small subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>). No density for this loop could be identified in our previous reconstruction of the pre-translocated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>) or in the intermediate state of translocation with eEF2-GPCP presented here. However, partial density could be identified in the CrPV-40S complex. Thus, it seems the VRL alternates between ordered/disordered conformations, possibly regulating the affinities of the compact folds of the IRES, like PKI, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruehle et al., 2015</xref>)<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13567.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for initiation of translation by type IV IRESs.</title><p>Starting from the bottom left, type IV IRESs are able to establish a stable binary interaction with the 40S through the IRES elements SL-IV and V.

Top: once the 60S subunit is recruited, the binary CrPV-IRES/80S complex oscillates between canonical and rotated states mimicking the hybrid states of tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2014</xref>).

The ASL-like segment of PKI is in a position and orientation reminiscent of a hybrid ap/P state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The whole ribosome adopts a rotated configuration with an additional ~3º anti-clockwise rotation of the small subunit when compared with the rotated state of the binary IRES-80S complex.

However, unlike the case of canonical translocation, L1 is not stabilized in an inward conformation but instead is displaced outward compared to the binary IRES-80S complex and is very similar to the post-translocated state. Thus, the additional rotation of the 40S subunit, induced by the binding of eEF2 in its active state, forces the IRES to 'push' the L1-stalk to its widest displacement while maintaining the interactions of SL-IV and V with the small subunit. The displaced location of the L1-stalk seems to be compatible with a post-translocated state of the IRES as well as with a fully rotated conformation of the 40S in the presence of CrPV-IRES and eEF2-GPDCP. Whether these wide conformations of the L1-stalk are available for normal translocation with tRNAs or they represent a specific state induced solely by IRES sequences remains an open question to be further investigated. Presumably, after GTP hydrolysis and the accompanying conformational changes (namely swiveling of the 40S head plus back-rotation of the 40S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratje et al., 2010</xref>), PKI reaches the P site. Thus, hydrolysis of GTP by eEF2 enables disruption of the interactions of SL-IV and V with the small subunit allowing PKI to reach the P-site. Following this initial translocation, the ribosome is in a state primed for elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Our structure of the CrPV-IRES/eEF2-GPDCP/80S complex presents the first images of eEF2 docked on the ribosome with an authentic translocation substrate. Previous cryo-EM studies of yeast eEF2/80S complexes have suggested alternate roles for diphthamide. Based on the structure of an eEF2/80S complex with modeled tRNAs in the A and P sites, Spahn <italic>et al.</italic> proposed that diphthamide was positioned near the codon:anticodon duplex of the A-site tRNA, and that it might functionally replace the decoding bases (<italic>E. coli</italic> A1492/A1493) to stabilize the codon-anticodon pairing during translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spahn et al., 2004b</xref>). In a subsequent study employing ADP-ribosylated eEF2, it was proposed that domain movements in eEF2 that accompany GTP hydrolysis cause release of the codon:anticodon duplex from the decoding bases during translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>). More recent structures of eEF2/80S ribosome complexes from humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic> lacked A- and P-site tRNAs and instead contained the yeast Stm1-like serpine 1 mRNA-binding protein 1 (SERBP1) snaking through the mRNA channel and A and P sites of the ribosome. In these latter structures diphthamide adopted two positions: either engaging helix 44 near the decoding bases or engaging SERBP1 in the mRNA channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anger et al., 2013</xref>). Diphthamide is not essential for yeast cell growth. However, the structure suggests that it additionally stabilizes the interaction of the tip of domain IV with the codon-anticodon interaction, which is presumably maintained during translocation from the A to the P site. This interaction of domain IV would compete with the interaction of the ribosomal decoding bases that also interact with the codon:anticodon duplex in the A site, suggesting how it would facilitate breaking the decoding interactions as a prelude to translocation. A reduction in the strength of the interaction of domain IV with the codon-anticodon helix could explain the enhanced -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting observed in yeast or mammalian cells when eEF2 lacks the diphthamide modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ortiz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). We propose that the diphthamide modification enhances the fidelity or efficiency of ribosomal translocation and that the unique translocation steps of CrPV-IRES translation, which are uncoupled from peptide synthesis, renders CrPV-IRES translation hypersensitive to the loss of diphthamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>The conformational dynamics of ribosomes play an essential functional role in normal translation. These include the inter-subunit rotation (also known as ratcheting), the swiveling of the head about the long axis of the small subunit, and the fluctuations of the L1-stalk correlated with tRNA in the E site. It has been proposed that these movements are part of the mechanism to harness the thermal energy of the environment and channel it towards the production of useful work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spirin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frank and Gonzalez, 2010</xref>). Type IV IRES sequences are able to use the intrinsic dynamic nature of the ribosome to assemble a translating 80S on their mRNA while avoiding the highly regulated step of normal initiation. We were able to visualize at high resolution an intermediate state of translocation in the CrPV-IRES/eEF2-GDPCP/80S complex. The binding of eEF2 in its active state stabilizes a distorted conformation of the IRES and an additional 3 degrees of rotation of the small subunit. Subsequently, the energy stored in this state could be used along with GTP hydrolysis to enable disruption of interactions present in the initial binding of the IRES to the small subunit, thereby allowing progression of PKI to the P site. The vacated A site is then able to bind the first aminoacyl-tRNA. In conclusion, this work sheds light on various aspects of type IV IRES and eEF2 structure and function during translocation, and provides further evidence for a universal mechanism for GTP hydrolysis by translational GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Voorhees et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of ribosomes</title><p>Ribosomes were purified from the <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> strain GG799 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Sriram Subramaniam, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another one is Dmitry Lyumkis.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Structural characterization of ribosome recruitment and translocation by a type IV IRES&quot; is a follow-on manuscript to one published from the same research group in 2014 in Cell, titled &quot;Initiation of translation by Cricket Paralysis Virus IRES requires its translocation in the ribosome&quot;. In the first manuscript, Fernandez et al. determined the structure of the yeast 80S ribosome bound to the CrPV-IRES, finding that it exists in a dynamic equilibrium between &quot;canonical&quot; and &quot;rotated&quot; conformations. In this second manuscript, Murray et al. determined the structure of the yeast 40S ribosomal subunit bound to CrPV-IRES and the structure of the full 80S complex bound to eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). The 80S/CrPV-IRES/eEF2 (with the GTP analog GDPCP) represents a step further along the elongation translocation cycle of the ribosome, just prior to the &quot;post-translocated&quot; state. Overall, the authors have revealed two new structures that offer unique insights into the structure and function of the ribosome during the translocation cycle.</p><p>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. It should be possible for you to address these issues without additional experimental work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A major concern is that interpretation of the structures is underdeveloped in light of what is known. What is disappointing is the lack of connecting the structure to mechanistic topics of general interest to the IRES community. But that requires a deeper and more insightful analysis than is present in the manuscript. Consistent with this, there are key references missing (including many recent ones) that must be considered in the analysis. Several examples are given below:</p><p>In the last paragraph of the subsection “CrPV-IRES interaction with the isolated 40S ribosomal subunit”. It was not clear what in this analysis of the interactions between the base-pairs of the codon-anticodon interaction and the ribosome is different than what has been described in other structures, including Koh et al. (2014) PNAS 11:9139-44, and previous work by these same authors in Fernandez et al. (2014) Cell 157:823-31. Perhaps this higher resolution work refines those interactions or makes them more certain. If something is truly novel here, the authors need to point it out. Otherwise, focus on the more novel potential findings that may lead to new ideas.</p><p>One very interesting and novel finding is the base-pair between C1273 and the first nt in the first decoded codon. But, the authors leave it as perhaps contributing to a &quot;productive conformation in the decoding center.&quot; This is not tested experimentally. In fact, the potential of this nt to form a base-pair within the IRES itself has been linked to the ability of some type IV IRESs to initiate in an alternate reading frame, thus this observation may have very exciting implications for IRES regulation (References: Au et al. (2015) PNAS 112:E6446-55; Wang et al. (2014) PloS One 9:e103601; Ren et al. (2012) PNAS 109:E630-9; Ren et al. (2014) Nucleic Acids Res. 42:9366-82.) None of these references, all with direct relationship to this structure, are included. Here and in a few other places, the manuscript (as written) does not reflect the current state of the field.</p><p>A missed opportunity: the interactions between the highly conserved apical loops of SL IV and V are known to make critical interactions with eS5 and eS25, but no high-resolution information is known for these interactions. Resolving this key mystery that would be a major contribution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>/<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> – The text and the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> describe SL IV and V as not changing position between the eEF2 unbound to bound state. But, the movie shows something very different. How does the IRES achieve this non-canonical binding and how do the interactions change as the IRES moves? Other than stating an observation about their global position and not much movement occurring, the authors leave this unexplored. The authors miss an opportunity to examine how the Type IV IRESs and possibly other IRESs use these interactions. This is particularly interesting give the literatures regarding eS25 is pretty much as a central player in translation from many IRESs (Thompson lab, in particular).</p><p>What is the VLR loop in PKI doing in this mid-translocating state and how does it compare to the pre- and post-translocated state? <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> shows some new density appearing at the junction between PKI and PKII upon eEF2 binding. It looks like the authors have modeled it as part of PKI's VLR. It is hard to tell from the movie/any figures. Recent work implicates this loop in elongation factor 2 function – Ruehle et al., (2015) <italic>eLife</italic> –, and it has been explored in manuscripts from the Jan lab. What it is this loop doing and contacting and does it explain this previous work? Are previous predictions about its possible role correct?</p><p>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Overall architecture of a complex of CrPV-IRES with the ribosome and elongation factor eEF2”. The position of the L1 stalk is interesting, but this is left with no explanation of potential significance. What might this say about how the IRES works? It is left as just an observation with no context. L1 is well established as a key player in translocation, so what does this odd position suggest? How does this fit into the idea of allosteric communication between L1 and other parts of the ribosome and bound factors? Are eukaryotes just different and what we have learned from bacteria does not apply?</p><p>Can the authors say anything about conformational changes within the IRES, outside of PK I? Looking at some modeling from Yamamoto et al., 2007, it would seem the larger part of the IRES may need to move or change structure, a bit for PK I to shift to its new location with the elongation factor. Some discussion of the overall movement of the IRES, and mechanistic implications, is needed.</p><p>The position of PKI between the A and P sites was previously suggested or observed in the very first cryo-EM reconstructions of a type IV IRES bound to a ribosome (Spahn Lab). While this was of lower resolution, this previous observation should be acknowledged and discussed. The same is true of the conformational change in the 40S subunit that likely prepares it for 60S subunit binding.</p><p>In regard to the observations relating to the diphthamide modification: this is an interesting result and one that bears deeper discussion. The authors suggest that the diphthamide on allows IRES-specific manipulation of the translation machinery that promotes translocation. But the region of the IRES that diphthamide contacts is the <italic>most</italic> similar to a canonical ribosome substrate in the entire IRES, begging the question of why there would need to be an IRES-specific solution there. Furthermore, there is no discussion regarding what is known about how eEF2 contacts canonical tRNA substrates using this modification. Because ribosomal contacts must release the codon:anticodon minihelix in canonical initiation, and they can do so independently of the diphthamide modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), it suggests the ribosome already has mechanisms in place to do this that the IRES should be able to harness as well. If the authors are correct that the modification permits the first noncanonical translocation, would this suggest that there are other, endogenous messages that specifically need to use the diphthamide in a similar way (given its conservation energetic expense for the cell, 8 enzymes)?</p><p>Other important points:</p><p>The Discussion section seems to largely repeat what was stated in the Results, without adding much insight.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> – This is essentially the only place where the map of the 40S/CrPV-IRES structure is shown (except for the representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for resolution estimation).

The correct criterion for the threshold should be 0.5 (see Rosenthal and Henderson 2003). According to the correct criterion, the map-to-model resolution is ~1/0.24 or ~4.2Å in B and ~1/0.26 or 3.8Å in E.

What is disappointing is the lack of connecting the structure to mechanistic topics of general interest to the IRES community. But that requires a deeper and more insightful analysis than is present in the manuscript. Consistent with this, there are key references missing (including many recent ones) that must be considered in the analysis. Several examples are given below: In the last paragraph of the subsection “CrPV-IRES interaction with the isolated 40S ribosomal subunit”. It was not clear what in this analysis of the interactions between the base-pairs of the codon-anticodon interaction and the ribosome is different than what has been described in other structures, including Koh et al. (2014) PNAS 11:9139-44, and previous work by these same authors in Fernandez et al. (2014) Cell 157:823-31. Perhaps this higher resolution work refines those interactions or makes them more certain. If something is truly novel here, the authors need to point it out. Otherwise, focus on the more novel potential findings that may lead to new ideas.</italic> </p><p>Please see our combined responses to the first two comments immediately after the second comment.</p><p> <italic>One very interesting and novel finding is the base-pair between C1273 and the first nt in the first decoded codon. But, the authors leave it as perhaps contributing to a &quot;productive conformation in the decoding center.&quot; This is not tested experimentally. In fact, the potential of this nt to form a base-pair within the IRES itself has been linked to the ability of some type IV IRESs to initiate in an alternate reading frame, thus this observation may have very exciting implications for IRES regulation (References: Au et al. (2015) PNAS 112:E6446-55; Wang et al. (2014) PloS One 9:e103601; Ren et al. (2012) PNAS 109:E630-9; Ren et al. (2014) Nucleic Acids Res. 42:9366-82.) None of these references, all with direct relationship to this structure, are included. Here and in a few other places, the manuscript (as written) does not reflect the current state of the field.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful to the referees in bringing to our attention the relevant references mentioned above. Indeed, extensive mutagenesis and biochemical analysis involving base number one from the first coding codon helps substantially in clarifying the possible mechanism of frame-selection by these types of IRES sequences. We have now added a paragraph in the Results as well as in the Discussion section describing the possible role for the observed base pair established between C1273 and base one of the first codon of the IRES (termed BP4). Relevant references have been included.</p><p> <italic>A missed opportunity: the interactions between the highly conserved apical loops of SL IV and V are known to make critical interactions with eS5 and eS25, but no high-resolution information is known for these interactions. Resolving this key mystery that would be a major contribution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>/<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> – The text and the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> describe SL IV and V as not changing position between the eEF2 unbound to bound state. But, the movie shows something very different. How does the IRES achieve this non-canonical binding and how do the interactions change as the IRES moves? Other than stating an observation about their global position and not much movement occurring, the authors leave this unexplored. The authors miss an opportunity to examine how the Type IV IRESs and possibly other IRESs use these interactions. This is particularly interesting give the literatures regarding eS25 is pretty much as a central player in translation from many IRESs (Thompson lab, in particular).</italic> The overall resolution of the reconstructions are 3.8Å and 3.6Å. However, because the IRES is highly dynamic, the resolution for its elements shows great local resolution variation. We could confidently trace the RNA backbone as well as fitting the PKI domain solved at high resolution by X-ray crystallography (Costantino et al., NSMB, 2008), but the inherent flexibility of the IRES precluded an interpretation of individual interactions of the RNA bases of the IRES with ribosomal proteins. In order to illustrate the quality of the density, several movies with the experimental density for the SL-IV and SL-V as well as the PKI of the IRES in the 40S-complex are contributed as supplementary material (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>).</p><p><italic>What is the VLR loop in PKI doing in this mid-translocating state and how does it compare to the pre- and post-translocated state? <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> shows some new density appearing at the junction between PKI and PKII upon eEF2 binding. It looks like the authors have modeled it as part of PKI's VLR. It is hard to tell from the movie/any figures. Recent work implicates this loop in elongation factor 2 function – Ruehle et al., (2015) eLife –, and it has been explored in manuscripts from the Jan lab. What it is this loop doing and contacting and does it explain this previous work? Are previous predictions about its possible role correct?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for drawing our attention to the relevant references regarding the VRL. We saw partial density for the VLR in the context of CrPV-IRES/40S reconstruction (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), which, we speculate, could be related to the early recruitment events of the IRES to the 40S. However, in the reconstruction involving the 80S/CrPV/eEF2 complex the absence of density clearly suggests a disordered VRL at this stage. We added a paragraph in the Results section as well as in the Discussion focusing on how the VLR could play a role in the initial binding of the IRES to the 40S and how our results could be integrated in the previous body of knowledge regarding this specific element of the IRES. Relevant references have also been included.</p><p><italic>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Overall architecture of a complex of CrPV-IRES with the ribosome and elongation factor eEF2”. The position of the L1 stalk is interesting, but this is left with no explanation of potential significance. What might this say about how the IRES works? It is left as just an observation with no context. L1 is well established as a key player in translocation, so what does this odd position suggest? How does this fit into the idea of allosteric communication between L1 and other parts of the ribosome and bound factors? Are eukaryotes just different and what we have learned from bacteria does not apply?</italic> A short paragraph has been added in the Discussion section on the putative role of the dynamics of the L1-stalk in type IV IRES-mediated translation. A definitive answer to these questions will require further biochemical and other studies. We hope that this paper will stimulate experimental approaches (like single-molecule FRET) to shed light on the function of this highly mobile element of the ribosome, as has occurred for bacterial translocation.</p><p><italic>Can the authors say anything about conformational changes within the IRES, outside of PK I? Looking at some modeling from Yamamoto et al., 2, it would seem the larger part of the IRES may need to move or change structure, a bit for PK I to shift to its new location with the elongation factor. Some discussion of the overall movement of the IRES, and mechanistic implications, is needed.</italic> We saw no additional major conformational changes in the IRES apart from the displacement of the PKI (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A superposition of the RNA backbone of the rest of CrPV-IRES (i.e. excluding PKI) in the pre-translocated state and in the presence of eEF2/GDPCP shows an r.m.s.d of 1.8Å. Thus, there may be subtle changes in the rest of the IRES; however, if they exist, it is not possible to characterize them definitely at this resolution.</p><p><italic>The position of PKI between the A and P sites was previously suggested or observed in the very first cryo-EM reconstructions of a type IV IRES bound to a ribosome (Spahn Lab). While this was of lower resolution, this previous observation should be acknowledged and discussed. The same is true of the conformational change in the 40S subunit that likely prepares it for 60S subunit binding.</italic> </p><p>The first visualization of the CrPV-IRES in the context of the 40S and the 80S was achieved in Joachim Frank’s lab (Spahn-Cell-2004) and is appropriately cited in our manuscript. A second, higher resolution, reconstruction for a CrPV/80S complex was reported from the Spahn lab in 2006 (Schuler-NSMB-2006, also cited in our manuscript), which we believe is the reference to which the reviewer is referring. In this 2006 reconstruction, the density for the PKI is highly disordered and the authors placed it “around the P and A sites”. It is important to note that this reconstruction represents a pre-translocated, binary 80S/CrPV-IRES state. In contrast to the Schuler et al. 2006 paper, we and others (Fernandez-Cell-2014, Koh-PNAS-2014) have shown that in the pre-translocated complex, PKI is placed in the A site. It is only upon the action of eEF2 (as in this manuscript) that it occupies a well-defined intermediate state between A and P sites. It is thus our opinion that crediting Schuler-NSMB-2006 as the first reference where PKI was suggested or observed in-between the A and P sites would be misleading. The many other contributions from the Spahn lab are recognized throughout our manuscript, especially the recent structure of a post-translocated state that has been very useful for our analysis of the structures.</p><p><italic>In regard to the observations relating to the diphthamide modification: this is an interesting result and one that bears deeper discussion. The authors suggest that the diphthamide on allows IRES-specific manipulation of the translation machinery that promotes translocation. But the region of the IRES that diphthamide contacts is the most similar to a canonical ribosome substrate in the entire IRES, begging the question of why there would need to be an IRES-specific solution there. Furthermore, there is no discussion regarding what is known about how eEF2 contacts canonical tRNA substrates using this modification. Because ribosomal contacts must release the codon:anticodon minihelix in canonical initiation, and they can do so independently of the diphthamide modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), it suggests the ribosome already has mechanisms in place to do this that the IRES should be able to harness as well. If the authors are correct that the modification permits the first noncanonical translocation, would this suggest that there are other, endogenous messages that specifically need to use the diphthamide in a similar way (given its conservation energetic expense for the cell, 8 enzymes)?</italic> We agree that the insights gained from the CrPV-IRES structures has relevance to the function of eEF2 in canonical translation. We propose that diphthamide aids in the similar re-orientation of the decoding bases A1753 and A1754 during canonical translation. While canonical translation can proceed efficiently in the absence of diphthamide, we propose that unique features of PKI and the unusual translocation required for CrPV IRES-mediated translation initiation makes the IRES translation more sensitive than canonical translation to loss of diphthamide. Rather than suggesting, as the reviewers do, that certain cellular mRNAs might use diphthamide in the same way as the CrPV-IRES, we prefer a model in which diphthamide enhances fidelity at all translocation steps and that the unique features of the CrPV-IRES and its translocation confer a heightened requirement for diphthamide. In accord with this line of thinking, we prefer to not speculate that some cellular mRNAs might be translated in a manner similar to the translocation mechanism employed by the CrPV IRES.</p><p>Three previous cryo-EM studies have provided modest insights into how diphthamide contacts canonical tRNA translocation substrates. Christian Spahn and Joachim Frank published a low-resolution structure of eEF2 on the 80S ribosome (EMBO J 23:1008-1019 (2004)). Notably, the structure did not contain tRNAs, and instead tRNAs were modeled in. In the model, diphthamide was positioned near the codon:anticodon duplex, and the authors speculated that diphthamide might functionally replace A1492/A1493 to stabilize the codon-anticodon pairing during translocation (they did not consider the idea that diphtamide might help break the decoding interaction). In a follow-up paper by Derek Taylor (EMBO J 26:2421-2431 (2007)), the structure of ADP-ribosylated eEF2 on the 80S was examined. This second paper focused on the impact of GTP hydrolysis by eEF2 and on eEF2 and ribosome conformations. The interaction of eEF2 and diphthamide with tRNA was not discussed; however, it was proposed that movement of the tip of domain IV of eEF2 during GTP hydrolysis might disrupt the interaction of the decoding center with the mRNA-tRNA duplex. Finally, Beckmann and colleagues reported the structure eEF2 bound to <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human ribosomes. Notably, these complexes contained an E-site tRNA and the protein SERBP1 (similar to Stm1 of yeast) snaking through the mRNA channel and the A and P sites of the 80S. The diphthamide moiety on eEF2 adopted two positions in these structures: 1) engaging helix 44 near the decoding bases, or 2) engaging SERBP1 in the mRNA channel. As these structures lack A- and P-site tRNAs, they do not provide insights into how diphthamide interacts with the translocation substrate. Thus, our structure provides the first image of eEF2 and diphthamide interacting with an authentic substrate on the ribosome.</p><p>We have edited the text in the Discussion to include these ideas.</p><p><italic>Other important points: The Discussion section seems to largely repeat what was stated in the Results, without adding much insight. 1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> – This is essentially the only place where the map of the 40S/CrPV-IRES structure is shown (except for the representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for resolution estimation).

In D, the authors are obviously using space-filled models for the interactions – actual density for these regions would allow the reader to see if these models actually are supported by the data in those regions.</italic> We added a panel with the experimental density for the decoding elements of the 40S in the presence of CrPV-PKI (B, left panel). In order to be consistent with the original high resolution structural paper on decoding (Ogle-Science-2001), we feel it is better to display the base pairs as space-filling models, because they are derived from a stereo-chemically-correct, refined model. However, we changed the figure legend to clearly reflect this and avoid misinterpretation; we also show the experimental density in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> – As with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the size and method of displaying the model for the 80D/CrPV-IRES/eEF2 map and model does not allow the reader or reviewer to judge the quality of fit or completeness of the map. Is A the map or model? B appears to be much lower resolution; is this the map? The authors should clearly indicate what they are showing (and should show the density when possible).</italic> We used space-filling models for the CrPV and eEF2 in panel A as has been done in many papers describing structures of ribosomal complexes by X-ray crystallography at similar resolution, either from our group (Neubauer –Cell-2009, Gao-Science-2009) or from other groups (Zhou-Science-2014, Blaha-Science-2009). At this resolution an overall view with density would be very confusing so we decided to clarify in the figure legend what is shown and additionally we now include a movie with the experimental density for eEF2 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). The density for the L1-stalk is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>.

Also, labels for each panel have been added to make it easier to identify the components of each view.</p><p>To properly explain the positioning of the CrPV-IRES PKI, it was mandatory to isolate PKI from the rest of the model, otherwise the representation was very messy. We feel that using descriptions similar to those used previously to describe tRNAs in several configurations (canonical and hybrid) is a good idea given the structural similarity relating the PKI with a canonical tRNA/mRNA pair. Thus, we have chosen to use this type of representation (top view of the solvent side of the small subunit) in panel D to highlight the occupancy of the ribosomal A and P sites. This mode of representation is frequently used in the ribosome field (e.g. Selmer-Science-2006, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; Blaha-Science-2009, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; Zhou-Science-2014, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> – As in other figures, when making claims about &quot;clear density&quot; (see subsection “Interaction of domain IV of eEF2 with PKI and implications for translocation”, first paragraph) for side-chains, that clear density needs to be shown.

Additionally, we added a short movie with the experimental density for eEF2 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). We explicitly clarify in the figure legend that panels E-F display Van der Waals rendered volumes of the refined model. These images illustrate the incompatibility of the position of the decoding bases 1753 and 1754 in their outward configuration with the position we observe for the tip of domain IV of eEF2. The steric clash between these eEF2 and the decoding bases is illustrated in panel F where the 40S is depicted in a different color to emphasize the clash.

Why is the FSC between map and model taken at a threshold value of ~0.3 (providing a resolution of ~1/0.26 or ~3.8Å in B and ~1/0.28 or ~3.6Å in F). The correct criterion for the threshold should be 0.5 (see Rosenthal and Henderson 2003). According to the correct criterion, the map-to-model resolution is ~1/0.24 or ~4.2Å in B and ~1/0.26 or 3.8Å in E.

In panels B and F three curves are shown: black line is the model-map FSC using the final map and the final refined model; red and blue lines correspond to the cross-validation analysis, as first proposed in Amunts et al., Science (2014). Perhaps the overlapping of the two curves precluded clear observation, but the requested analysis has been performed and is shown. The superposition of the blue and red curves highlights the absence of over-fitting of the refined model as explained in Brown et al., ActaCrystD (2015).
