UPR sensors monitor the ER folding status to adjust ER folding capacity according to need. To understand how the UPR sensor IRE1 maintains ER homeostasis, we identified zero-length crosslinks of RNA to IRE1 with single nucleotide precision <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that IRE1 specifically crosslinks to a subset of ER-targeted mRNAs, SRP RNA, ribosomal and transfer RNAs. Crosslink sites cluster in a discrete region of the ribosome surface spanning from the A-site to the polypeptide exit tunnel. Moreover, IRE1 binds to purified 80S ribosomes with high affinity, indicating association with ER-bound ribosomes.

Perturbations leading to protein folding defects in the ER –collectively known as ER stress– activate an ensemble of transcriptional programs known as the unfolded protein response (UPR)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karagoz and Acosta-Alvear D, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). The UPR maintains the health of the secreted and membrane-embedded proteome through (i) decreasing ER client protein load, (ii) upregulating chaperones and enzymes that assist protein folding, and (iii) promoting the degradation of misfolded proteins. Three ER membrane embedded protein folding sensors control the UPR: ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6), PERK (protein kinase R (PKR)-like kinase) and IRE1 (inositol requiring enzyme 1). IRE1 is the most evolutionarily conserved sensor and is found from yeast to metazoans. Unfolded proteins serve as direct ligands for IRE1’s lumenal sensor domain, promoting its oligomerization and activation in the plane of the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karagöz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Active IRE1 molecules <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylate, allowing the subsequent allosteric activation of its C-terminal endoribonuclease domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karagöz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korennykh et al., 2011</xref>). Active IRE1 responds to ER stress in two ways: (i) it cleaves an unconventional intron from the mRNA encoding the transcription factor XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1), initiating a spliceosome-independent mRNA splicing reaction that culminates in the production of XBP1s (‘s’ for spliced), a potent transcription activator that increases the ER folding and degradation capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Alvear et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reimold et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reimold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>), and (ii) it cleaves ER-targeted mRNAs in a process known as RIDD (regulated IRE1-dependent decay), thus lowering the ER protein-folding load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hollien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>). In both cases, IRE1 substrate RNAs must be properly targeted to the ER membrane to meet the IRE1 enzyme.</p><p>In metazoans, the <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA is brought to the ER membrane as part of the ribosome-nascent chain complex actively translating XBP1u (‘u’ for unspliced) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagitani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yanagitani et al., 2011</xref>). Peptide sequences encoded in the <italic>XBP1u</italic> mRNA are recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent co-translational targeting machinery, which is in charge of sorting of most of the mRNAs encoding ER resident, secretory and transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>). The engagement of the translating XBP1u protein with SRP results in its proper sorting to the ER membrane where it meets IRE1. Despite the progress made in unraveling the ER targeting mechanism of the <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA, our current understanding of recruitment of IRE1 to membrane-bound <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA or RIDD substrate mRNAs is still a mystery. Moreover, the precise determinants controlling IRE1’s exquisite specificity remain limited to our understanding of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA and a small number of canonical RIDD substrates. Since the physiological consequences of IRE1 activation are the product of cleavage of ER-targeted transcripts, there is an inherent need to address the issue of substrate selection. Previous work aimed at identifying IRE1 substrate recognition relied on transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hollien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">So et al., 2012</xref>). These methods are limited as they cannot identify physical associations between IRE1 and its putative substrates, nor they can dissociate direct and indirect effects emanating from IRE1’s nuclease activity.</p><p>To gain insights into these questions, we used complementary system levels and biochemical methods to identify both the RNAs and proteins that physically associate with IRE1 in living cells. Our approaches revealed novel interactions between IRE1 and select ER-bound RNAs, as well as between IRE1 and the co-translational protein targeting and translocation machineries. Taken together, our results link the UPR and the ER protein targeting machineries, establishing that these processes unexpected converge on IRE1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IRE1 associates with select RNAs</title><p>To identify RNAs that directly associate with IRE1 in living cells, we used photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>). PAR-CLIP employs incorporation of photoactivatable ribonucleosides (<italic>e.g.</italic>, 4-thiouridine) into RNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Long-wavelength UV irradiation (365 nm) generates ‘zero-length’ crosslinks between the RNAs and proteins. In this way we identified RNAs crosslinked to IRE1 by deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Towards this goal, we expressed an epitope-tagged (triple-FLAG-hexa-histidine) version of IRE1 ectopically from a tetracycline-inducible promoter in a human embryonic kidney derived cell line (HEK293Trex) and compared conditions with and without additionally imposed ER stress, induced by tunicamycin, a classical ER protein-folding poison that blocks <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation in the ER lumen. To optimize the signal to noise ratio, we fractionated cell lysates to enrich for membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and carried out the immunoprecipitations (IP) after fully denaturing the fraction by heating in SDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

In our experiments, T→C transitions were the most prevalent mutations observed in biological duplicates (14.7 ± 3.6%, and 20.2 ± 4.4% of all mapped mutations in the absence and presence of ER stress, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> blue bars in columns labeled ‘T’), strongly indicating recovery of IRE1-crosslinked RNA tags. We henceforth focused exclusively on analysis of the clusters that contained reads with T→C mutations.</p><p>In our analyses we first mapped the sequence reads derived from crosslinked IRE1-RNA complexes to the human genome to identify clusters over the length of each annotated transcript. We filtered the data based on a set of rules setting an arbitrary cut-off defined by a minimal number of reads bearing T→C transitions that must be contained in each cluster. We then summed the number of reads per cluster that fulfilled these criteria to estimate the relative abundance of IRE1-crosslinked reads per transcript, providing us with a ranked list of IRE1 crosslinked RNAs (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In these analyses, we identified a set of 137 IRE1-associated RNAs in the absence and 336 in the presence of ER stress, indicating that IRE1-RNA association increases with ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>As expected, classification of the mapped reads revealed that IRE1 associated with a select set of mRNAs.

These experiments revealed that IRE1-KR bound ribosomes with high affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 30 ± 11 nM).

Importantly, IRE1-KR did not co-sediment with dissociated 40S or 60S ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that IRE1 preferentially selects intact ribosomes.

Such control could be accomplished through interactions between IRE1’s lumenal sensor domain and nascent polypeptides entering the ER lumen encoded in such mRNAs. To begin gathering support for this notion, we designed a peptide array tiling 18-mer peptides derived from proteins encoded by top hit PAR-CLIP mRNAs. Incubation of this array with recombinantly expressed IRE1 lumenal domain fused to maltose binding protein indicated that IRE1’s sensor domain bound to distinct sequences embedded in ER lumenal regions in those proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>). These data lend support to a mechanism wherein IRE1 surveys the folding status of client proteins entering the ER lumen as they are being synthesized.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We identified RNAs and RNA/protein complexes that interact with IRE1 in living cells using three unbiased and complementary approaches. First, we used PAR-CLIP to catalog RNAs that associate with IRE1. This method provided us with high structural resolution due to the single nucleotide-precision with which PAR-CLIP crosslinking sites are identified. Second, we used PAR-CLIP-MS to identify proteins bridged IRE1 by short RNA fragments, allowing us to identify ribonucleoprotein complexes. Third, we used IP-MS to identify components that associate stably with IRE1 under native conditions. Together, our results portray a detailed picture of the IRE1 interactome in living cells that is far more complex than anticipated. In particular, IRE1 interactome analysis suggests IRE1’s intimate engagement with the protein targeting and translation machineries. This notion is supported by the following lines of evidence: First and most surprisingly, we found that IRE1 associates with structural, non-coding RNAs that include ribosomal RNAs, SRP RNA, and select tRNAs. Second, IRE1 interacts with several components of the co-translational protein targeting and translocation machinery that include the translocon, the translocon-associated component TRAP, SRP proteins, and ribosomal proteins. Importantly, the crosslink sites between IRE1 and the structural RNAs identified here, as well as those between IRE1 and RNA-bridged proteins, converge on a discrete region on the ribosome surface, spanning from the ribosomal A-site to the nascent chain exit tunnel. Third, IRE1 associates with a select population of mRNAs, strongly enriched in ER-bound mRNAs those that encode proteins that traverse or reside in the secretory pathway and IRE1’s ER-lumenal domain engages polypeptide regions encoded by these mRNAs. Finally, the cytosolic domains of IRE1 tightly bind 80S ribosomes <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Our data support a model wherein the UPR and co-translational targeting to the ER are linked. According to this view, ribosome binding to SRP or to the translocon represents two distinct stages during co-translational targeting in which IRE1 may engage with ER-targeted mRNAs as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. First, in a ‘preemptive’ mode, IRE1 contacts SRP in the context of ribosomes that have arrived at the surface of the ER but have not yet engaged with the translocon. Second, in a ‘surveillance’ mode, IRE1 contacts the ribosome after engagement with the translocon is complete and protein translocation has initiated. In this view, the two postulated modes of IRE1 engagement exert different regulatory functions: The preemptive mode would enable IRE1-mediated degradation of newly targeted mRNAs. Such a situation may arise, for example, under conditions of ER stress when IRE1 is widely activated in the ER lumen and thus serves to prevent further increase of the ER protein-folding load. By contrast, the surveillance mode would enable IRE1-mediated degradation of mRNAs encoding protein chains that have difficulty folding in the ER. In this way, IRE1 activation would be local and private, restricted to the immediate vicinity of the translocon that is in the process of injecting a potentially problematic nascent protein into the ER lumen. As such, IRE1 would exercise coincidence detection of features in the nascent chain and the mRNA, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>). This mechanism could provide the means to identify the mRNA on the cytosolic face of the ER when the translocation and the folding rates are not perfectly coupled and may explain why certain mRNAs are preferentially selected for RIDD.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43036.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for co-translational IRE1 engagement.</title><p>The linker tethering IRE1’s transmembrane domain and its kinase/nuclease domains (KR) is drawn to scale as an extended chain.

Moreover, recent work showed that the genetic depletion of translocon components selectively induces the IRE1 branch of the UPR, suggesting specific mechanisms of control linking IRE1 signaling and the co-translational insertion of proteins into the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>Applying PAR-CLIP-based approaches to map the IRE1 interactome posed technical challenges. While powerful, PAR-CLIP relies on enrichment by immunoprecipitation and target protein abundance is a major determinant for the success of the method. IRE1 is not an abundant protein, and, as an enzyme, its engagement with substrate RNAs is transient, and often rapid, for example during <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peschek et al., 2015</xref>). For these reasons, the detection of IRE1-bound RNAs by PAR-CLIP required overexpression of IRE1 from an inducible promoter. Overexpression of IRE1 leads to constitutive, albeit still only partial activation in the absence of ER stress inducers, thus preventing us from capturing IRE1-RNA interactions in its inactive state. We partially overcame these experimental limitations by activating IRE1 further (<italic>e.g.</italic>, beyond the elevated baseline) with chemical ER stress inducers as one of our experimental conditions and applying stringent filters in categorizing RNAs as IRE1-interactors. Such strategy allowed us to pinpoint core-sets of IRE1-interacting RNAs.</p><p>The IRE1-dependent cleavage of the mRNAs we identified in this study was either very low or undetectable in cells and inefficient when reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that they are suboptimal substrates.

The importance of controlling protein synthesis during stress is paralleled by several orthogonal mechanisms. For instance, the kinases that activate the integrated stress response attenuate translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>), and protein synthesis can be halted by cleavage of tRNAs by angiogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ivanov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamasaki et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast to the readily detectable tRNA cleavage by angiogenin, we did not detect cleavage of tRNAs or SRP RNA under the conditions used here, although we cannot exclude that IRE1 cleaves a small fraction of structural RNAs that engage with it. In line with our observations, a recent report shows that IRE1’s sister protein, the pseudokinase-endoribonuclease RNaseL, a central effector of the innate immune system, also associates with translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nogimori et al., 2018</xref>). Together with this observation, our results suggest a common specialized surveillance mechanism in the UPR and in the type I interferon response that controls the half-lives of endogenous and exogenous RNAs. Such regulation may serve to curtail threats to cellular homeostasis, such as excessive protein synthesis during limiting protein folding conditions or translation of viral proteins, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Stoichiometric considerations</title><p>Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that the abundance of translocons in the ER membrane is at least 100-fold more than that of IRE1. Thus, IRE1 can only engage a subset of translocons and/or polysomes at any given time. The specific associations we observed for less than a hundred mRNAs that encode proteins residing in or traversing the secretory pathway may reflect that these mRNAs encode potentially problematic ER clients/residents. For example, one of the most robust PAR-CLIP hits was the mRNA encoding TMEM109, a small multi-pass transmembrane protein that forms very large homo-oligomeric assemblies and may be difficult to assemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Venturi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The concept of co-translational engagement of IRE1 raises numerous questions that may necessitate the re-evaluation of current models. For example, IRE1 oligomers visualized as dynamic foci in UPR-activated cells are widely assumed to be active ‘splicing factories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2010</xref>) (<italic>i.e.</italic>, constitute the sites where <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing takes place). A possibility is that IRE1 foci form a reservoir from which IRE1 molecules are recruited to membrane-engaged ribosome/nascent chain complexes, reconciling foci with the far more diffuse distribution of membrane-bound polysomes on the ER surface. Alternatively, IRE1 foci may represent a different state in the IRE1 signaling chain; for example, foci could embody sites for IRE1 degradation or recycling. Notwithstanding the many open questions that remain, our results strongly converge on the intriguing possibility of synchronous monitoring of the folding status in the ER lumen.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell line, cell culture and drugs</title><p>HEK293Trex cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) harboring an epitope-tagged allele of IRE1 (3× FLAG hexahistidine) integrated at a single genomic locus and driven of a tetracycline inducible promoter were generated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2010</xref>).

The adapter-stripped reads were uploaded to the CLIPZ analysis environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khorshid et al., 2011</xref>) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clipz.unibas.ch">http://www.clipz.unibas.ch</ext-link> for alignment and analysis. Reads shorter than 15 nt long were discarded, and the remaining reads were aligned to the UCSC hg19 version of the human genome. After the first-pass alignment, the annotated reads were retrieved from the CLIPZ servers, and all the reads that were annotated as ‘bacterial’, ‘fungus’, ‘vector’, ‘none’, as well as all the unmapped reads, were removed from the original sequencing data using in-house scripts. The resulting sequence files devoid of blacklisted and unmapped sequences, containing between 3 and 5.7 million reads (~3%, on average, of the original reads), were then re-uploaded to CLIPZ for re-alignment to the reference genome and analysis. The breakdown of RNA classes recovered after mapping, mutational spectrum analyses, and mRNA regional preference analysis were obtained with the validated CLIPZ tools. Next, the mapped read clusters were retrieved from the CLIPZ servers for further metrics and analysis. For all transcripts (mRNAs, ncRNAS, miRNAs and small cytosolic RNAs; excluding tRNAs, rRNAs, and <italic>RN7SL</italic> pseudogenes), the CLIPZ-generated data was used to create lists of top hits, with the respective quantification of the numbers of crosslinked copies in each condition, as follows: First, the numbers of reads for every cluster containing at least three reads, where at least one of the reads possess a T→C mutation, were summed up for every annotated transcript locus, in every experimental condition, in each biological replicate, yielding a ‘<italic>copy number</italic>’ per transcript. This method ensured that only those clusters that contain the stereotypical T→C mutant reads were included for subsequent analyses. Next, the geometric mean of the summed reads that satisfied the condition above was computed for each locus in each experimental condition (<italic>i.e.</italic>, IRE1 forced expression alone or chemically-induced ER stress on top of forced expression), thus generating summary tables in which we tabulated the copy number per transcript in biological duplicates for each experimental condition. After generating these summary tables, only those transcripts for which the copy number was at least five were considered for subsequent analysis. This method ensures that transcripts that have a single cluster with mutant reads, but in which the cluster contains less than five reads are not considered hits. By the same rationale, to be considered hits, transcripts holding mutant-read containing clusters made up of less than five reads, must have multiple clusters mapped onto them, so that the sum of the reads over the body of the transcript <italic>–copy number–</italic> is equal to or exceeds 5. Last, read clusters composed of only T→C mutant reads were also discarded, thus ensuring that mapped reads arising from naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms, or from the spurious introduction of mutations during library preparation, were not considered to have been originated from crosslinked RNAs. After applying all these filters, the remaining transcripts were considered PAR-CLIP hits for all subsequent analyses, and their enrichment was estimated from the number of crosslinked copies <italic>–copy number–</italic> as defined per the rules above. Read cluster files containing reads mapping to tRNAs were cleaned-up and re-clustered using in-house scripts to allow annotation of wild-type and mutant read copies on known human tRNAs in the GtRNAdb database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu.">http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu.</ext-link> Next, all crosslinked tRNAs were grouped by codon-anticodon and the numbers of crosslinked copies, defined as per the rules above, were summed up for each codon-anticodon group.

Orthogonal validation of the crosslink sites on hit transcripts was accomplished by visual inspection of read coverage tracks mapped with a second aligner. For this purpose, the sequencing libraries were re-aligned to the hg19 version of the human genome using the sequence aligner Bowtie2 V2.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>).

We agree that performing IRE1 PAR-CLIP on the nuclear fraction could indeed be an interesting experiment, and in the worst-case scenario, it would be a good negative control. However, since the PAR-CLIP experiments required a substantial amount of starting material, it would be a monumental undertaking to perform these experiments in cell factions that contain only a minor portion of the cell’s IRE1. The small amount of nuclear IRE1 observed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B could represent carry-over from unlysed cells or a small pool of IRE1 resident in the nuclear envelope. The latter possibility remains plausible, because GAPDH can also be found in the nucleus (PMID:20727968). Given that our main discovery is the association of IRE1 with the ER co-translational protein targeting machinery, a detailed analysis of subcellular IRE1 pools would lie outside the scope of our study.
