is mediated by optic atrophy 1 (OPA1). Under physiological conditions, OPA1 undergoes proteolytic processing to form a membrane-anchored long isoform (L-OPA1) and a soluble short isoform (S-OPA1). A combination of L-OPA1 and S-OPA1 is essential for efficient membrane fusion; however, the relevant mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we investigate the cryo-electron microscopic structures of S-OPA1–coated liposomes in nucleotide-free and GTPγS-bound states. S-OPA1 exhibits a general dynamin-like structure and can assemble onto membranes in a helical array with a dimer building block. We reveal that hydrophobic residues in its extended membrane-binding domain are critical for its tubulation activity. The binding of GTPγS triggers a conformational change and results in a rearrangement of the helical lattice and tube expansion similar to that of S-Mgm1. These observations indicate that S-OPA1 adopts a dynamin-like power stroke membrane remodeling mechanism during mitochondrial inner membrane fusion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>conformational change</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial fusion</kwd><kwd>membrane tubulation</kwd><kwd>OPA1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB08030202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Fei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0504700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Fei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GTP binding induces rearrangement of S-OPA1 assembly on membrane and thus triggers membrane remodeling with reduced curvature.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotic cells, series of discrete membranous compartments separate different biochemical reactions, and the membrane fission and fusion mechanisms accomplish communication between and within these compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McNew et al., 2013</xref>). A family of large GTPases, called dynamins, are instrumental in fission and fusion processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Praefcke and McMahon, 2004</xref>). Mitochondria, which are double-membrane organelles, can form remarkable dynamic networks through membrane fusion and fission regulated by dynamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Labbé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van der Bliek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Westermann, 2010</xref>). Among those dynamins, optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) is known to be related to mitochondrial inner membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frezza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">MacVicar and Langer, 2016</xref>).</p><p>OPA1 contains an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), a following transmembrane domain (TM), a coiled-coil domain, a highly conserved GTPase domain, a middle domain, and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED). OPA1 has eight spliced variations in the region between the TM and the coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belenguer and Pellegrini, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olichon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After being imported into the mitochondria, the MTS is proteolytically processed with the remaining parts to form a membrane-anchored long-form OPA1 (L-OPA1). L-OPA1 can be further cleaved into a soluble short-form OPA1 (S-OPA1) through the S1 or S2 site between the TM and the coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishihara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Song et al., 2007</xref>). Both L-OPA1 and S-OPA1 participate in mitochondrial inner membrane fusion. However, the specific role of S-OPA1 during the fusion process remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ban et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Dotto et al., 2017</xref>). The results of efforts to recapitulate the fusion mechanism in vitro by using Forster resonance energy transfer have indicated that L-OPA1 alone on either side of the membrane can promote fusion with an appropriate concentration of cardiolipin on the opposite side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ban et al., 2017</xref>). By contrast, S-OPA1 forms a bridge to the opposite membrane, probably through interactions with both L-OPA1 and cardiolipin, and then assists in L-OPA1–dependent fusion, which involves higher GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ban et al., 2017</xref>). Studies on Mgm1, the yeast homolog of OPA1, have similarly concluded that its long form, L-Mgm1, acts as a fusion-prone protein with inhibited GTPase activity while its short-form, S-Mgm1, drives the fusion process through GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeVay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zick et al., 2009</xref>). Another study of S-OPA1 confirmed its tubulation activity with cardiolipin-containing liposomes by using negative-staining electron microscopy (nsEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ban et al., 2010</xref>). These studies suggested a GTPase-dependent auxiliary function of S-OPA1 during membrane fusion. However, another report also supported the favorable function of S-OPA1 in fission because it was observed co-localizing in mitochondrial constriction sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Purification and characterization of S-OPA1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain organization of OPA1.

S-Mgm1 probably adopts a GTP-dependent power stroke similar to that of dynamin 1 (Dyn1) and deforms the membrane in different ways while binding to negatively and positively curved membranes. In contrast to Dyn1, the binding of nucleotides may cause the expansion of an S-Mgm1-coated liposomal tube because S-Mgm1 has a left-handed assembly geometry. Another crystal structure of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> S-Mgm1 may provide another model of membrane deformation through the trimeric structure of S-Mgm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). These results elucidate how S-Mgm1 oligomerization contributes to mitochondrial inner membrane fusion and cristae biogenesis. To determine whether S-OPA1 employs similar methods and further understand the mechanism of mitochondrial inner membrane fusion, we conducted biochemical studies of S-OPA1 and the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of S-OPA1–coated liposome tubes in a nucleotide-free state and a GTPγS-binding state. Our study provides further molecular insight into mitochondrial inner membrane remodeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>S-OPA1 can induce tubulation of cardiolipin-containing liposomes</title><p>We expressed splice form 1 human S-OPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in bacteria and purified it until homogeneity was achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The GTP hydrolysis activity of S-OPA1 was weak but remarkably enhanced by approximately 70-fold (Kcat) in the presence of liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). The liposomes were prepared with a phospholipid composition of 45% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 22% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 8% phosphatidylinositol and 25% cardiolipin, which approximately reflects the composition of the mitochondrial inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ban et al., 2010</xref>). By examining the mixture of S-OPA1 (apo) with a liposome using both nsEM and cryo-EM, we identified considerable tubulation of the liposomes induced by S-OPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). However, the tubes varied in diameter, suggesting the dynamic behavior of S-OPA1 on the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To improve the homogeneity of S-OPA1–coated tubes, we purified a truncated form of S-OPA1 (Δ196-252, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) by deleting its N-terminal dimerization-inducing coiled-coil region from 196 to 252 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akepati et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast to its full-length wild type (WT), the truncated S-OPA1 behaved as a monomer in gel filtration and chemical cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Its basal GTP hydrolysis activity was slightly lower than that in the WT, but the addition of liposomes could lead to a more than 100-fold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>).

This could be attributed to the structural difference between S-OPA1 and S-Mgm1, which is consistent with the sequence variation at the stalk and the EMB/paddle domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We then investigated how the S-OPA1 dimers assemble on the liposomal tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). By following the left-handed helical symmetry, S-OPA1 dimers interacted with each other through stalk interface-3 and the EMB domain interface P1.

Interface-1 in the S-OPA1 oligomer corresponds to the interface 1 in Dyn1 and S-Mgm1 tetramers, whereas the interface-3 and P1 are unique to S-OPA1. In addition, the S-OPA1 G domains within one single helical rung were facing each other with their dimerization interfaces, which leaves the possibility of a subsequent change of the S-OPA1 array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>However, when considering the helical assembly of S-Mgm1, which uses interface-1 and interface-2 to form a helical rung, we could also model the S-OPA1 dimer assembly in a right-handed manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>), where interface-3 and interface P1 stabilize the interaction between neighboring helical rungs.

Compared with the WT S-OPA1, all five mutants exhibited moderate suppression of membrane binding, suggesting that the residues of membrane binding were at least partially involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, more considerable effects of these mutants were observed regarding their liposome-induced GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>) and membrane tubulation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

These results indicate that the hydrophobic residues in region 794–800 of the EMB domain could be a crucial factor involved in S-OPA1–induced membrane tubulation.

Notably, the EMB/paddle domains of neighboring helical rungs seemed to form dimers between the stalk gaps.</p><p>By investigating the packing array of S-OPA1, we observed that the asymmetric unit of S-OPA1 nucleotide–coated tube in the GTPγS binding state also contained an S-OPA1 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and E</xref>). This dimer had a similar interaction interface (interface-2) to that of the nucleotide-free state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Here, interface-1 obviously mediated the interactions between S-OPA1 dimers within the same helical rung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), whereas interface-3 in the nucleotide-free state was broken and disappeared. Notably, the interactions between different helical rungs in the GTPγS binding state were mediated through a new interface (interface P2) that formed between the EMB domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The assembly pattern of S-OPA1 in the GTPγS binding state was highly similar to that of S-Mgm1 in both apo and the GTPγS binding states, sharing the same position as interface-1 and interface-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Conformational change and helical assembly rearrangement after nucleotide binding</title><p>Subsequently, we further analyzed the conformational changes of S-OPA1 upon nucleotide binding by comparing the models generated from the nucleotide-free and GTPγS binding states. The superposition of two monomers indicated a slight (~4°) G domain/BSE swing after GTPγS binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In the GTPγS binding state, the S-OPA1 monomer tended to adopt a slightly open conformation compared with that adopted in the nucleotide-free state.

However, interface-3 and interface P1 in the nucleotide-free state were broken, and a new inter-rung interface P2 formed between the EMB domains. As a result, for the left-handed model of S-OPA1 dimer assembly, GTPγS binding broke the original helical rungs and formed new rungs through combination of the two nearest pieces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). By contrast, for the right-handed model, the helical rungs remained, but the handedness of the assembly changed from right to left after GTPγS binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

Compared with vesicles and other organelle, mitochondria have even more complicated fission and fusion mechanisms because of their double-membrane structure. An increase in the amount of structural information regarding Mfn1/2 and Drp1/Dnm1 has spurred extensive research on the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial outer membrane fusion and fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fröhlich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mears et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). However, the dearth of structural information for OPA1 has limited further interpretation of the mitochondrial inner membrane fusion mechanism. Compared with the general structure of Mfn1/2, that of OPA1 tends to be more similar to that of the membrane fission protein Dyn1. How a fission dynamin-like protein triggers membrane fusion remains unclear. Unlike other dynamins, OPA1 has multiple isoforms and must be processed from a long membrane–anchored form (L-OPA1) to a short soluble form (S-OPA1) for efficient mitochondrial inner membrane fusion. This suggests that the dynamics of the mitochondrial inner membrane are strictly regulated. Structural studies of <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> S-Mgm1 (CtMgm1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faelber et al., 2019</xref>) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> S-Mgm1 (ScMgm1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yan et al., 2020</xref>), which are homologs of S-OPA1, have provided initial insights into the functional mechanism of S-Mgm1 during mitochondrial inner membrane fusion.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the interactions between S-OPA1 and liposomes that have the phospholipid composition of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Similar to other dynamin proteins, S-OPA1 can bind to membranes and induce membrane tubulation by forming a helical array. We revealed that such tubulation processes are independent of GTP binding and hydrolysis activity; however, S-OPA1 can exhibit considerably enhanced GTPase activity after binding to the membrane. We used the cryo-EM approach to solve the structures of S-OPA1 coated on membranes in both nucleotide-free and GTPγS binding states. Docking of an S-Mgm1 crystal structure into cryo-EM maps revealed that S-OPA1 has a classic dynamin-like structure that contains a G/BSE domain, a stalk domain, and an EMB domain. The EMB domain has a similar size and shape as the paddle domain of CtMgm1 and the LIS domain of ScMgm1.</p><p>Structural analysis revealed four interaction interfaces that contribute to S-OPA1 assembly on the membrane in the nucleotide-free state. Three interfaces (I1, I2, and I3) are involved in stalk packing. The fourth interface (P1) from the EMB domain interaction constitutes another factor influencing the stability of S-OPA1 assembly. In contrast to the tube formed by CtMgm1, which was left-handed with four starts, the tube formed by S-OPA1 in the absence of nucleotides was also left-handed but with six starts. In addition, CtMgm1 only used interface-1 and interface-2 to form the helical filament in both the nucleotide-free and binding states, whereas the helical assembly of S-OPA1 used additional interface-3 and interface P1 in the nucleotide-free state. We further identified a key region (794–800) of the EMB domain and observed that the hydrophobic residues of this region are instrumental to membrane tubulation activity. The observed critical role of the stalk and EMB domains for S-OPA1 assembly and membrane interaction is consistent with the findings of other studies that have highlighted the relationship between diseases and mutations in the stalk and EMB regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The G domain dimerization interface, which is crucial for GTP hydrolysis activity, was not formed in the helical array of S-OPA1 in the nucleotide-free state, suggesting that GTP hydrolysis is a late-stage event that occurs after membrane remodeling.</p><p>We observed substantial changes in S-OPA1 assembly after GTPγS binding, including motion between the G domain and the stalk, global rotation of the stalk region, and rearrangement of the S-OPA1 helical lattice. Here we defined the conformation of S-OPA1 in its nucleotide-free state as closed conformation and that in its GTPγS-bound state as open conformation. In contrast to conventional dynamin proteins that induce more crowded packing and a constricted tube with a smaller diameter and higher curvature (ready for fission) after nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chappie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mears et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sundborger et al., 2014</xref>), the left-handed helical assembly and the conformational change in S-OPA1 from closed to open after GTPγS binding resulted in an expanded tube with an increased diameter and reduced membrane curvature, which is in agreement with the proposed action of CtMgm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faelber et al., 2019</xref>). The helical assemblies of S-OPA1 in the nucleotide-free and the GTPγS binding states were remarkably different. This phenomenon has not been reported in related studies of other dynamin proteins. After GTPγS binding, the dimer building blocks likely adopt a rotation of 25° and a long-range movement, which breaks interface-3 and interface P1 through the formation of a new interface, P2, between the EMB domains. This large movement might be triggered by the energy released from nucleotide binding. However, we could not exclude another possibility, namely that the dissociation and reassembly of S-OPA1 monomers occur after GTPγS binding.</p><p>A mechanochemical mechanism of the protein-induced membrane remodeling adopted by Dyn1 has been hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chappie et al., 2011</xref>). The protein uses the energy generated from binding and hydrolysis of GTP to realize a conformational change. Such a change deforms the membrane and successfully transform the chemical energy into mechanical changes. Because S-OPA1 exhibited a similar G domain conformational change after nucleotide binding, it would probably employ the same mechanism in membrane remodeling. Although the resolution achieved by cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging was not high, our observation suggests that the distance between the S-OPA1 G domains between the two neighboring S-OPA1 dimers was shorter after GTPγS binding; however, this distance was still too great for G domain dimerization to occur. Thus, the determined structure of the GTPγS-bound S-OPA1 is not compatible with GTP hydrolysis induced by G domain dimerization. This might be attributable to a subtle difference between GTPγS and GTP, which constitutes a barrier to future structural reorganization of S-OPA1 helical arrays to induce the dimerization of G domains. Thus, we propose a further motion of the G domain upon GTP binding, which enables the formation of a G domain dimerization interface that is suitable for GTP hydrolysis.</p><p>Previous studies have revealed that S-OPA1 alone cannot trigger the fusion of the mitochondrial inner membrane but rather must collaborate with L-OPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ban et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Dotto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Song et al., 2007</xref>). During mitochondrial inner membrane fusion, L-OPA1 performs a critical role, and the addition of S-OPA1 significantly increases fusion efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ban et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the GTPase activity of S-OPA1 is indispensable for its fusion-related function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ban et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, S-OPA1 presumably assists L-OPA1 with its GTPase activity during mitochondrial inner membrane fusion. Thus, we speculate that S-OPA1 facilitates membrane fusion through oligomerization with L-OPA1, thus supporting GTP hydrolysis and conformational change of L-OPA1. Research on Mgm1 has revealed a similar situation in which the GTPase activity of L-Mgm1 is inhibited because of the restriction of G domain movement by the transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeVay et al., 2009</xref>). S-Mgm1 may then bind to L-Mgm1 to facilitate the formation of G dimers with accelerated GTPase activity.</p><p>Although our structural and functional analyses demonstrated the assembly of S-OPA1 on membranes in nucleotide-free and GTPγS binding states and provided models of how the rearrangement of this assembly affects membrane remodeling, the precise molecular mechanism of S-OPA1–induced membrane fusion and the cooperation between L-OPA1 and S-OPA1 require further study. High-resolution structural information regarding S-OPA1 and L-OPA1 in different GTP hydrolysis states could help to clarify the mechanisms of mitochondrial inner membrane fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Good micrographs were then multiplied by their theoretical contrast transfer function (CTF) for initial correction of CTF. 511 S-OPA1 tubes were boxed using e2helixboxer.py in the package of EMAN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tang et al., 2007</xref>) with a 480 px box width. An initial segment was stack generated from all these tubes with an overlap of 90% and an initial 3D model was generated by back projection method using these segments and assigning random azimuthal angles to them. The initial 3D model was then interpolated into different ones with various diameters, and diameter classification was performed through supervised 2D classification where models were generated by projecting the 3D models with various diameters. Then for each diameter class, the diffraction pattern for each tube was calculated and further classified. A main class of tubes at ~53 nm diameter was sorted corresponding to its diameter and diffraction pattern, and contains 6644 segments. The segment stack of the selected class was then regenerated with the box size of 480 px and the box overlap of ~94%. Initial helical parameters were calculated by indexing the layer lines in the power spectrum of the boxed tubes. An initial helical rise of 27.0 Å and twist of −20.87° were obtained and used for helical reconstruction through a real space helical reconstruction algorithm IHRSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Egelman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Egelman, 2007</xref>). The helical parameters finally converged to 25.87 Å for the helical rise, and −20.86° for the helical twist. Then summed CTF<sup>2</sup> was divided for the final CTF correction of the map reconstructed by IHRSR. SPIDER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shaikh et al., 2008</xref>) was used for negative B-factor sharpening. Resolution of the final map was estimated based on the gold standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC)0.143 criterion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Tomographic reconstruction and sub-volume averaging</title><p>Fiducial marker based tilt series alignment and gold erasure were performed using AuTom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2017</xref>). And the tomographic reconstructions were performed using IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>) with 2 times binning. No CTF correction was performed at this step. For tomographic reconstruction, the radial filter options were set at 0.35 cut off and 0.05 fall off. The sub volumes picked in IMOD were extracted by RELION 1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scheres, 2012</xref>) and CTF model of each particles was generated through RELION script that called CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). Then 3D classification was carried with CTF correction and the particles from selected classes were used for the final refinement. The initial model for 3D classification and refinement is the random averaging of all particles and low-pass filtered to 60 Å. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.143 criterion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sedimentation assay</title><p>Sedimentation assay was carried on as previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ban et al., 2010</xref>). Protein was diluted to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT. Liposomes were prepared as described for the tubulation assay. The liposomes were directly added to the protein solution at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged at 250,000 g in a S140AT rotor (Hitachi) for 20 min at 4°C.

GTP hydrolysis was quantified by monitoring the free phosphate concentration using a malachite green assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leonard et al., 2005</xref>). Reactions were initiated by the addition of GTP to 1 mM final concentration and incubated at 37°C. 20 μl mixtures were quenched with 5 μl of 0.5 M EDTA at regular time points. After the addition of 150 μl malachite green solution, the free phosphate concentration was monitored by the absorbance at 650 nm in a 96-well plate reader (EnSpire 2300).</p><p>Calculation of Km and Kcat is based on Lineweaver-Burk plot with the measurement at 6 different GTP concentration. The final GTP concentration was set to 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.4 mM individually. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μl GTP solution to a 10 μl 0.1 mg/ml protein or protein liposome mixtures in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM MgCl2. After 1 ~ 2 hr incubation, which was set based on the activity of different mutants, at 37°C, the reactions were quenched with 10 μl 0.1 M EDTA. The phosphate was quantified using malachite green assay. 150 μl malachite green solution was added and the absorbance at 650 nm is monitored in a 96-well plate reader (EnSpire 2300). All experiments were repeated at least three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi angle light scattering</title><p>The size of S-OPA1 in solution is determined by static multiangle light scattering (MALS) coupled with gel filtration.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Hitoshi Nakatogawa as the Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Zhang et al. report two cryo-EM structures of truncated human OPA1 helical polymers on tubulated liposomes in both nucleotide-free and GTP-γ-S-bound forms. They also investigated the liposome binding and tubulation ability of Opa1 by biochemical approaches. Major findings in this study are the assembly of Opa1 polymer, and its conformational change upon its GTP-γ-S binding. As properly cited by the authors of this manuscript, recently the crystal and cyro-EM structures of yeast Opa1 homolog Mgm1 were reported. Nonetheless, the reviewers found that the structure characterization presented in this paper, with considerable technical merit, still holds sufficient conceptual advance in a mammalian homolog, and provides important information on our understanding of how OPA1 remodels the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, the reviewers have also raised a number of critical issues which the authors should address to improve the integrity of the current manuscript and strengthen their conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As essential revisions, we request the authors to address the following issues.</p><p>1) Figure 2: handedness, fit of the nucleotide-free map. There is a mismatch of the statement of a &quot;left-handed helical map&quot; with the stalk filament fitted in a right-handed manner (Figure 7C). To avoid confusion, the authors should consistently state the handedness of their maps based on the assembly of the stalk filament.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is doubtful that the right-handed stalk assembly fitted into the nucleotide-free map, is correct, for the following reasons:</p><p>i) None of the interfaces observed in this filament has been described before for any dynamin family member.</p><p>ii) The map is only of low resolution and an unambiguous fitting of the domains is not straightforward.</p><p>iii) The new 'interfaces' have not been confirmed by any mutation.</p><p>iv) The suggested rotation of the OPA1 dimer upon nucleotide-binding would lead to steric clashes with neighboring molecules of the same filament and with molecules from the adjacent filament (Figure 7C).</p><p>Looking at the density map and the fitted models (EMD-9901, helical reconstruction), there appears to be a second option for fitting of the nucleotide-free map. Such an assembly would indeed constitute a left-handed stalk filament. It would also contain the same oligomerisation interfaces as in the GTP-γ-S bound OPA1 oligomer, and these interfaces would be similar to the previously described assembly interfaces 1 and 2 of dynamin (Ford et al., 2011, Faelber et al., 2011), MxA/B (Gao et al., 2011, Alvares, 2017), and Mgm1 (Faelber et al., 2019). Furthermore, such left-handed helical stalk assembly may explain why GTP-γ-S binding leads to expansion of the membrane tube and not constriction, unlike in dynamin (see the recent Mgm1 structure paper for discussion of helix handedness and the effect of the powerstroke). Finally, such assembly would explain the transition between the nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound OPA1 assembly.</p><p>For both the nucleotide-free and the nucleotide-bound maps, the stalk has to be rotated for 180 degree around its longest axis that interface-1 and interface-2 can form in a similar manner compared to dynamin and Mgm1.</p><p>This should be illustrated in a detailed comparison in Supplementary Figure 8. For example, the OPA1 assembly mode contrasts with dynamin, MxA and Drp1, which use three assembly interfaces, but is similar to Mgm1, that requires only two interfaces.</p><p>Taken together, the current fitting of the nucleotide-free map is ambiguous and the resulting stalk assembly is unseen in the dynamin family and thus appears highly speculative. The authors should consider alternative fittings for both maps.</p><p>2) As now the structures of the yeast Opa1 homolog Mgm1 are available, the authors are suggested to use the Mgm1 model to fit the cryo-EM density and make corresponding analysis. Considering the substantial difference between the Mgm1 paddle domain and dynamin PH domain, as well as the special kink of the Mgm1 stalk domain, more accurate models could be obtained by this analysis. In this case, the authors may add also the Mgm1 sequence into the alignment in Supplementary Figure 5A.</p><p>3) As the structural difference between the nucleotide-free and GTP-γ-S bound states of Opa1 polymer is a major finding of this manuscript, the author should perform an ITC analysis to confirm and quantify the association between Opa1 and GTP-γ-S.</p><p>4) Supplementary Figure 5: GMB comparison with PH domain in dynamin. A sequence alignment of dynamin and OPA1 shows a very low amino acid identity in the region of the PH and GMB domain. A reliable alignment is not possible in this region. The authors speculate that amino acids 794-800 form an amphipathic helix which may bind to the membrane. However, the envisaged sequence is less than two turns in length, which would constitute only a small membrane anchoring point. Second, the proposed OPA1 amino acids are aligned to an amino acid stretch in the PH domain of dynamin, which forms two β-strands (compare sequence alignment to the structure of the PH domain, Ferguson et al., 1994, pdb 2dyn). In fact, the aligned β-strand region in the PH domain contains a known membrane binding loop. These observations do not support the conclusion that membrane binding in OPA1 is mediated by an amphipathic helix. The investigation of charged and hydrophobic residues in the GMB domain in order to detect the membrane binding region is sufficient to explain the experiments in Figure 5 without invoking an amphipathic helix.</p><p>5) Figures 1E and 4C: It should be clearly stated which nucleotide was used in which experiment and whether GTP-γ-S-induced structural changes were visible in negative stain EM. Representative negative-stain images should be provided for both conditions. The experiments with G interface mutants in Figure 4C make only sense in the presence of GTP-γ-S, since no structural changes can be expected for these mutants in the absence of nucleotide.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cryo-EM structures reveal interactions of S-OPA1 with membrane and changes upon nucleotide binding&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been assessed by two reviewers who evaluated the original manuscript, and the evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor Hitoshi Nakatogawa and the Senior Editor Olga Boudker.</p><p>The reviewers found that the manuscript has been improved significantly but they raised some remaining issues that need to be addressed before final acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The assembly of the stalks in the nucleotide-free structure is still confusing. The new fittings, depiction of stalk interfaces and the schematic Figure 7E show that both the nucleotide-free and GTP-γ-S bound sOPA1 use interface-1 and 2 to form a filament. These interfaces are also used in Mgm1 and have been shown by mutagenesis to contribute to assembly. In contrast, the newly observed interface-3 is unique to the nucleotide-free form, is opposite of all previously known stalk interfaces, and due to missing mutagenesis, its significance for assembly remains unknown. To avoid confusion, the authors should use interface-1 and 2 to define the OPA1 filament also in the nucleotide-free form, e.g. in Figure 3A and E, Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 7E left. In Figure 7E left, not the blue and green dimers, but the blue striped and blue dimers should form the filament, as in Figure 7E right. In this case, I1 and I2 are present within a filament, and I3 is in between filaments. It would be helpful for the reader if one such turn is shown in a unique color in Figure 2A or Figure 3A (similar as it is now with the 'I3 filament') to indicate whether such filament is right- or left-handed. How do the G domains in this case connect? One might expect that the putative G domain interface is then in between different rungs.</p><p>2) Figure 4C: The new data on the GTP-bound sOPA1 mutants are nicely contributing to the manuscript. However, tube diameters have to be quantified for the mutants in the absence and presence of GTP (for example as in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 or as average diameter) to make a convincing claim. It also appears from Figure 1F that the representative tubes of the Δ196-252 variant are somehow smaller compared to sOPA1. Could the authors provide also some quantification of these?</p><p>3) Nomenclature GMB domain: The fitted paddle is anything but a globular domain (unlike the previously assumed PH domain). Maybe 'Extended Membrane Binding Domain' (EMB) instead?</p><p>4) Figure 1D legend should contain the used GTP concentration. It appears from Figure 4B that the stimulation of wt is about 10-fold, not 70-fold?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50294.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As essential revisions, we request the authors to address the following issues.</p><p>1) Figure 2: handedness, fit of the nucleotide-free map.

Yes, the helical map of S-OPA1 coated tube is left-handed. The model in the previous Figure 7C is misleading. The apparent right-handed stalk region is just due to a visual effect from the compact packing of S-OPA1 on membrane in nucleotide-free state, in which the interaction between neighboring helical rung is a key factor for the stability of assembly.</p><p>As suggested by reviewers, we utilized the recent published crystal structure of S-Mgm1 (PDB code 6QL4) to re-perform structural fitting of both nucleotide-free and GTP-γ-S bound maps. With a better structural fitting, we updated our structural interpretation according to the suggestions from reviewers. In the revision (Figures 3, 6 and 7; Figure 3—figure supplements 1-4; Figure 7—figure supplement 1), the building block of S-OPA1 assembly in both nucleotide-free and GTP-γ-S bound states has been assigned as a new dimer, which shares the similar interface 1 and interface 2 in comparison with S-Mgm1 and Dyn1. However, in the nucleotide-free state, the unique interfaces I3 at the stalk region and P1 at the GMB region are also observed and described. These two unique interfaces disappear after GTP-γ-S binding with a new interface P2 of GMB region appearing, indicating a large assembly change of S-OPA1 after nucleotide binding. In the revision, the assemblies of S-OPA1 on membrane in both nucleotide-free and GTP-γ-S bound states are all left-handed (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). With this new structural interpretation, the model of how the assembly of S-OPA1 responses to GTP-γ-S binding is also revised (see Figure 7E). Besides, the comparison of oligomer assembly between S-OPA1, S-Mgm1 and Dyn1 are also re-performed (Figure 3—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As now the structures of the yeast Opa1 homolog Mgm1 are available, the authors are suggested to use the Mgm1 model to fit the cryo-EM density and make corresponding analysis. Considering the substantial difference between the Mgm1 paddle domain and dynamin PH domain, as well as the special kink of the Mgm1 stalk domain, more accurate models could be obtained by this analysis. In this case, the authors may add also the Mgm1 sequence into the alignment in Supplementary Figure 5A.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for this important suggestion. In the revision, we have utilized the recent published crystal structure of S-Mgm1 (PDB code 6QL4) to re-perform structural fitting of both nucleotide-free and GTP-γ-S bound maps. In addition, the sequence alignment between S-OPA1 and S-Mgm1 was also performed (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As the structural difference between the nucleotide-free and GTP-γ-S bound states of Opa1 polymer is a major finding of this manuscript, the author should perform an ITC analysis to confirm and quantify the association between Opa1 and GTP-γ-S.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for this important suggestion. Yes, we tried to perform ITC analysis to confirm GTP-γ-S binding. However, we found a severe protein precipitation during GTP or GTP-analogs titration, which stopped the possibility of using ITC to quantify the association between SOPA1 and GTP-γ-S.</p><p>As suggested below by reviewers, we then utilized different mutations of S-OPA1 at its GTPase domain to examine whether it is the GTP binding or hydrolysis to induce assembly change and thus tube expansion (Figure 4C). For those mutants that lose GTP hydrolysis activity but keep the ability of GTP binding, we observed the tube expansion effect after adding GTP. This further confirms it is the GTP binding to trigger the assembly change of SOPA1 on membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Supplementary Figure 5: GMB comparison with PH domain in dynamin. A sequence alignment of dynamin and OPA1 shows a very low amino acid identity in the region of the PH and GMB domain. A reliable alignment is not possible in this region. The authors speculate that amino acids 794-800 form an amphipathic helix which may bind to the membrane. However, the envisaged sequence is less than two turns in length, which would constitute only a small membrane anchoring point. Second, the proposed OPA1 amino acids are aligned to an amino acid stretch in the PH domain of dynamin, which forms two β-strands (compare sequence alignment to the structure of the PH domain, Ferguson et al., 1994, pdb 2dyn). In fact, the aligned β-strand region in the PH domain contains a known membrane binding loop. These observations do not support the conclusion that membrane binding in OPA1 is mediated by an amphipathic helix. The investigation of charged and hydrophobic residues in the GMB domain in order to detect the membrane binding region is sufficient to explain the experiments in Figure 5 without invoking an amphipathic helix.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. The amphipathic helix assumption and statement have been removed in the revision and we only discussed the characteristic charged and hydrophobic residues of 794-800 region in the GMB domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figures 1E and 4C: It should be clearly stated which nucleotide was used in which experiment and whether GTP-γ-S-induced structural changes were visible in negative stain EM. Representative negative-stain images should be provided for both conditions. The experiments with G interface mutants in Figure 4C make only sense in the presence of GTP-γ-S, since no structural changes can be expected for these mutants in the absence of nucleotide.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for this nice suggestion. In the original Figures 1E and 4C, we did not add nucleotide in liposome tubulation experiments. As suggested by reviewers, we further utilized negative stain EM to examine the potential structural changes induced after the addition of GTP for various G domain mutants. The new results have been added into Figure 4C. For those mutants that lose GTP hydrolysis activity but keep the ability of GTP binding, we observed the tube expansion effect after adding GTP. This further confirms it is the GTP binding to trigger the assembly change of SOPA1 on membrane.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The assembly of the stalks in the nucleotide-free structure is still confusing. The new fittings, depiction of stalk interfaces and the schematic Figure 7E show that both the nucleotide-free and GTP-γ-S bound sOPA1 use interface-1 and 2 to form a filament. These interfaces are also used in Mgm1 and have been shown by mutagenesis to contribute to assembly. In contrast, the newly observed interface-3 is unique to the nucleotide-free form, is opposite of all previously known stalk interfaces, and due to missing mutagenesis, its significance for assembly remains unknown. To avoid confusion, the authors should use interface-1 and 2 to define the OPA1 filament also in the nucleotide-free form, e.g. in Figure 3A and E, Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 7E left. In Figure 7E left, not the blue and green dimers, but the blue striped and blue dimers should form the filament, as in Figure 7E right. In this case, I1 and I2 are present within a filament, and I3 is in between filaments. It would be helpful for the reader if one such turn is shown in a unique color in Figure 2A or Figure 3A (similar as it is now with the 'I3 filament') to indicate whether such filament is right- or left-handed. How do the G domains in this case connect? One might expect that the putative G domain interface is then in between different rungs.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers so much for this additional important suggestion. We tried to re-define S-OPA1 filament using the common interface-1 and 2 (see revised Figure 7E and Figure 3—figure supplement 2D and E). With this new definition, as the reviewers expected, the G domain dimerization interface in this case is now in between different rungs (see revised Figure 3—figure supplement 5). However, with this new definition, we found the filament becomes right-handed, which generates a new inconsistency with the left-handed assembly at GTP-γ-S bound state. Therefore, we would like to keep our original definition in the main figures but put this alternative one at the supplements.</p><p>Besides, we agree with the reviewers that the newly observed interface-3 is unique and its significance for filament assembly is not validated due to lack of mutagenesis. However, based on the fitted model, we calculated the areas of those interfaces, which yielded 1324 Å2 for interface-1, 124 Å2 for interface-2, and 1599 Å2 for interface-3. The area of interface-3 is large enough to play an important role to stabilize the assembly of S-OPA1. Thus, although the future mutagenesis work is needed, the role of interface-3 should not be neglected. To be noted, the computed area of interface-2 might not be accurate due to the existence of unfitted density there (see Figure 3D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 4C: The new data on the GTP-bound sOPA1 mutants are nicely contributing to the manuscript. However, tube diameters have to be quantified for the mutants in the absence and presence of GTP (for example as in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 or as average diameter) to make a convincing claim. It also appears from Figure 1F that the representative tubes of the Δ196-252 variant are somehow smaller compared to sOPA1. Could the authors provide also some quantification of these?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers very much for this good suggestion. The diameters of sOPA1 mutants coated tubes before and after adding GTP have been quantified with statistics (see Figure 5—figure supplement 2 in the revision), which is in consistency with our previous observation. The relevant text has been revised with this additional information.</p><p>Upon the reviewers’ request, we also added the diameter statistics of Δ196-252 coated tube at the nucleotide-free state (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1A in the revision). As the reviewers observed, the averaged diameter of Δ196-252 coated tube is a bit smaller than the wild type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Nomenclature GMB domain: The fitted paddle is anything but a globular domain (unlike the previously assumed PH domain). Maybe 'Extended Membrane Binding Domain' (EMB) instead?</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected as the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1D legend should contain the used GTP concentration. It appears from Figure 4B that the stimulation of wt is about 10-fold, not 70-fold?</p></disp-quote><p>The legend of Figure 1 has been revised accordingly. For the fold of activity stimulation by adding liposome, the parameter Kcat was used in this study for comparison (see Supplementary file 1 and Supplementary file 1—source data 1). The apparent increase of the activity can be represented by Kcat/Km, which is about 10-fold as mentioned by the reviewers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
