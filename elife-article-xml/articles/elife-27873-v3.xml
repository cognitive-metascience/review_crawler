developing novel therapies for diseases of the blood and immune system. Current methods do not enable precise engineering of complex genotypes that can be easily tracked in a mixed population of cells. We describe a method to multiplex homologous recombination (HR) in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and primary human T cells by combining rAAV6 donor delivery and the CRISPR/Cas9 system delivered as ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). In addition, the use of reporter genes allows FACS-purification and tracking of cells that have had multiple alleles or loci modified by HR. We believe this method will enable broad applications not only to the study of human hematopoietic gene function and networks, but also to perform sophisticated synthetic biology to develop innovative engineered stem cell-based therapeutics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27873.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our DNA contains thousands of sections called genes that encode the information needed to make all the cells in the human body. To understand what the genes do and how they contribute to diseases, it is crucial for researchers to be able to switch individual genes on or off or make precise changes to the ‘letters’ in their code. Since most genes act in complicated networks it would be very useful to be able to edit several genes at the same time, especially when studying cancer and other diseases that are caused by defects in multiple genes.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas9 is a relatively new technique that allows the code of individual genes to be precisely edited. To edit a gene, CRISPR/Cas9 first breaks the DNA at the site of interest and this break is subsequently repaired using new DNA templates that introduce the desired change in the code. In this way, the letters of the code can be changed with the same precision that one edits the letters and words of a document. This technique has been successfully used to edit the code of single genes, but it is much more difficult to use it to edit several genes at the same time.</p><p>To import new DNA repair templates into human and other mammalian cells, researchers have used harmless virus-like particles called rAAV vectors. Researchers load the DNA templates into rAAV vectors, which are able to enter the cells and carry the templates to the DNA of the cells. Bak, Dever, Reinisch et al. combined CRISPR/Cas9 with rAAV template delivery to precisely edit several genes in human cells, including blood stem cells. In this new system, CRISPR/Cas9 directs the insertion of new pieces of DNA carried by rAAV6 vectors into specific genes.</p><p>The system developed by Bak, Dever, Reinisch et al. allows several genes to be precisely edited at the same time. Furthermore, the system includes fluorescent markers that enable successfully edited cells to be identified and tracked. In the future, this technique could be used to study how genes work together to control various characteristics, and how cancer and other diseases develop.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>gene editing</kwd><kwd>hematopoietic stem cells</kwd><kwd>multiplex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Danish Council for Independent Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFF-1333-00106B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bak</surname><given-names>Rasmus O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford Child Health Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dever</surname><given-names>Daniel P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Austrian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Erwin Schroedinger Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reinisch</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001023</institution-id><institution>Amon G.

While these methods have provided great insights into HSPC biology, they come with several confounders, such as random integration of the vector into the host genome, unregulated transgene expression, and incomplete gene knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Woods et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Naldini, 2015</xref>). More recently, programmable nucleases such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR/Cas9 have been utilized to disrupt genes by the introduction of site-specific DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) that are corrected through non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hendel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saydaminova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mandal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schumann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). This error-prone system creates a heterogeneous mixture of cells with various genotypes of SNPs and small insertions or deletions (INDELs); moreover, not all of the genetic changes from INDELs cause functional gene disruption as they may preserve the open reading frame and may not change amino acids essential for protein functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hultquist et al., 2016</xref>). In a prior study, defined gene deletions were created in HSPCs using a dual sgRNA approach, however, more than half of the alleles were not modified leading to residual gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mandal et al., 2014</xref>). Another limitation of this prior study is that successfully modified cells were not distinguishable from unmodified wild type (WT) cells, and therefore could not be tracked or isolated as an enriched population. Although the versatility of the CRISPR/Cas9 system allows for simultaneous manipulation at multiple genetic loci in a single cell, multiplexing of NHEJ-based gene editing has mainly been performed in immortalized human cancer cell lines and mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hultquist et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heckl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Platt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, these interesting multiplexed proof-of-concept studies, only used NHEJ-mediated editing and did not harness the power of homologous recombination (HR) to create more sophisticated alterations to the genome at multiple alleles and/or loci.</p><p>Here, we report an HR-mediated genome engineering method in human HSPCs and T cells that overcomes these limitations and enables the generation and enrichment of HSPC or T cell populations with complete gene knockout or gene replacement at multiple genetic loci. This method has the power to reveal functional gene networks during hematopoiesis and immune system disease pathogenesis and could be combined with the concepts of synthetic biology to create novel stem cell based therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Enriching HSPCs with targeted integration</title><p>We and others have previously shown that HR in human HSPCs can be efficiently induced by site-specific nucleases in combination with homologous donor DNA delivered as single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs), integration-defective lentiviral vectors (ÍDLVs), or by recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV6) vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dever et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeWitt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Ravin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoban et al., 2016</xref>). We previously showed targeted integration in the beta-globin gene (<italic>HBB</italic>) by combining delivery of Cas9 protein pre-complexed with chemically modified sgRNAs (RNP) and delivery of an AAV6 donor. After successful on-target integration of a reporter transgene, FACS-based sorting of transgene reporter<sup>high</sup>-expressing HSPCs was used to purify an HSPC population with &gt;90% targeted integration that displayed long-term repopulation capacity in NSG mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dever et al., 2016</xref>). To extend this method beyond the <italic>HBB</italic> locus for therapeutic genome editing approaches of hemoglobinopathies, we tested six additional loci for their potential to be modified through HR by CRISPR/Cas9 in combination with AAV6-derived donor delivery. These genes are associated with hematopoiesis, hematopoietic malignancies, or safe harbor sites and include: interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain (<italic>IL2RG</italic>), chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (<italic>CCR5</italic>), runt-related transcription factor one isoform c (<italic>RUNX1c</italic>), additional sex combs like 1 (<italic>ASXL1</italic>), stromal antigen 2 (<italic>STAG2</italic>), and adeno-associated virus integration site 1 (<italic>AAVS1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tebas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Genovese et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mazumdar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kotin et al., 1992</xref>). Following electroporation with Cas9 RNP, containing a chemically-modified sgRNA targeting a single site in the selected locus, and transduction with an rAAV6 donor vector carrying homology arms for the targeted site and an expression cassette encoding a fluorescent reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>), we observed at early time points (day 4) a cell population with increased fluorescence intensity detectable by flow cytometry (reporter<sup>high</sup> cells) compared to cells receiving only the rAAV6 donor without electroporation of Cas9 RNP (reporter<sup>low</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). For cells targeted at either <italic>CCR5</italic> or <italic>IL2RG,</italic> reporter<sup>high</sup>, reporter<sup>low</sup>, and reporter<sup>neg</sup> populations were sorted at day four post-electroporation and cultured up to 22 days. Reporter<sup>high</sup> populations remained 99.2 ± 0.7% reporter positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) while sorted reporter<sup>low</sup> and reporter<sup>neg</sup> populations were 29.3 ± 5.4% and 0.6 ± 0.2% reporter positive, respectively. Dividing the reporter<sup>low</sup> cells into three sub fractions based on fluorescence intensity revealed that GFP intensity at day four post-electroporation positively correlated with the propensity for maintaining GFP expression at day 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b–c</xref>). In addition, single reporter<sup>high</sup> cells were plated in methylcellulose to assess integration events at the clonal level. Targeted HSPCs formed a mix of myeloid (CFU-M/GM) and erythroid colonies (BFU-E, CFU-E) indicating that they retained HSPC function. ‘In-Out PCR’ (one donor-specific primer and one locus-specific primer outside of the respective homology arms) on genomic DNA (gDNA) from single cell-derived methylcellulose colonies confirmed that 99%, 92%, and 100% of reporter<sup>high</sup> HSPCs targeted at <italic>CCR5</italic> (338 clones analyzed), <italic>IL2RG</italic> (117 clones analyzed), and <italic>RUNX1</italic> (36 clones analyzed), respectively, had at least a monoallelic targeted integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Analyses of clones with only mono-allelic integration showed gene-specific differences in the modification of the non-integrated alleles ranging from 38% INDELs for <italic>IL2RG</italic> to 89% INDELs for <italic>CCR5%</italic> and 88% INDELs for <italic>RUNX1</italic>, among which the majority was gene-disrupting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that the observed log-fold transgene expression shift following rAAV6 and RNP delivery is due to HR at the intended locus and that reporter expression can be used to enrich gene-targeted HSPCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27873.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FACS-based identification and enrichment of monogenic genome-edited CD34<sup>+</sup> human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) HSPCs were electroporated with <italic>CCR5</italic>-RNP and transduced with <italic>CCR5</italic>-tNGFR rAAV6 HR donor.

Targeting at another combination of three genes (<italic>RUNX1/HBB/ASXL1</italic>) showed 2.9% triple-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c–e</xref>), and collectively, tri-genic targeting experiments yielded an average of 4.5% triple-positive cells, with the highest frequency of 14% (<italic>N</italic> = 5) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). To test if multiplexing HR caused cellular senescence or more cell death than mono or di-genic targeting in HSPCs, we evaluated cell death and apoptosis rates at day three post-targeting and proliferation for up to 10 days post-targeting (corresponding to 7 days post-sorting). We observed similar proliferation rates comparing modified and unmodified cells (data not shown) and only a minor, non-statistically significant decrease in cell viability (p=0.333) when targeting three genes compared to one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

For synthetic biology purposes, the tetra-genic targeting method, for example, can generate an enriched population of cells with eight genetic modifications: the knockout of at least a single allele of four different genes while introducing four different transgenes (in this proof-of-concept we used three fluorescent protein reporter genes and one biologically inert cell surface marker (tNGFR) that has been previously used in human clinical trials to track genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells over the course of decades). Our approach to studying gene function in human HSPCs has several advantages over lentiviral-based approaches because it enables: (1) multigenic targeted integration (at least four genes), (2) enrichment of highly pure edited populations, (3) the ability to trace cells with a specific genotype, (4) enrichment of a population with biallelic targeting of at least two genes, and (5) fluorescent protein-based hematopoietic cell lineage tracing.

Such effects are likely sgRNA and target gene-specific and need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The observed tetra-genic targeting efficiencies at &gt;0.5% are high enough to be experimentally useful, and though some applications may be restricted by HSPC source and starting cell numbers, our targeting methodology may be combined with recent advances in HSPC expansion protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fares et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cutler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Lima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Popat et al., 2015</xref>) or with transplantation into a humanized bone marrow ossicle xenotransplantation model, which supports higher engraftment levels compared to a standard NSG model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reinisch et al., 2016</xref>). By using reporters as transgenes, one can both enrich and track the modified cells, and by using a transgene cassette in which a potentially biologically active transgene is linked through a 2A peptide or IRES to a reporter gene, one can enrich and track cells that could have up to four different new potentially bioactive genes expressed. Additionally, we and others have recently demonstrated the feasibility of knocking in a cDNA immediately after the start codon of the gene, thereby maintaining endogenous regulatory control over gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dever et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hubbard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voit et al., 2014</xref>). This provides a genetic engineering toolbox where different types of alleles (WT, knockout, mutant cDNA forms) are fluorescently tagged and can be enriched or tracked in a population with mixed allele combinations. One potential caveat is the requirement for reporter gene expression and the fact that cells must be cultured for 2–3 days until reporter gene expression is detectable and cells can be sorted. Even though we have not detected any obvious negative impact in this or previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dever et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bak and Porteus, 2017</xref>), future studies may further investigate and optimize ex vivo culturing conditions, as well as promoter and reporter choice for minimal impact on biology and repopulation potential of edited HSPCs.</p><p>Our methodology could be used for the characterization of gene interactions during blood and immune system disease pathogenesis. For example, functional knockouts can be created at one gene (e.g. reporter knock-in into tumor suppressor gene), while introducing disease-causing polymorphisms at another gene (cDNA expression cassette knock-in into proto-oncogene) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref> for schematic). For example, Zhao et al., showed that the loss of p53 cooperates with the <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> mutation to promote acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mouse HSPCs using a retroviral methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). Our system could be used to address whether these findings can be translated to human HSPCs by achieving site specific HR that would simultaneously knock out a tumor suppressor (e.g. <italic>TP53</italic>) and drive mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> under endogenous regulatory conditions, instead of using strong constitutive exogenous viral promoters with little control over proviral copy number and heterogeneity of transgene expression. However, in cDNA knock-in experiments, proper expression should always be validated since elements in the adjacent reporter expression cassette or the lack of UTRs and introns could influence cDNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sweeney et al., 2017</xref>).

Multiplexed gene editing may be used to knock-in different CARs or co-stimulatory ligands into genes that are desirable to knock-out in CAR T cell therapy. We anticipate in the future that multiplexed HR mediated cell engineering will facilitate even more sophisticated uses of synthetic biology-based stem cell therapeutics than the examples we have given.

For enriching of reporter<sup>high</sup> populations, cells were sorted on a FACS Aria II SORP using DAPI, PI (both Thermo Fisher, 1 µg/ml) or LIVE/DEAD Fixable Cell Stain Kit (Life Technologies) to discriminate live and dead cells according to manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Scoring, FACS-analysis, and genotyping of methylcellulose colonies</title><p>Single reporter<sup>high</sup> cells were either single-cell sorted into 96-well plates (Corning) pre-filled with 100 µl of methylcellulose and water in the outer wells or plated at 500 cells per 6 cm dish with methylcellulose (Methocult, StemCell Technologies). After 14 days, colonies were counted and scored as BFU-E, CFU-M, CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM according to the manual for ‘Human Colony-forming Unit (CFU) Assays Using MethoCult’ from StemCell Technologies and prior expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Majeti et al., 2007</xref>). For DNA extraction from 96-well plates, PBS was added to wells with colonies, and the contents were mixed and transferred to a U-bottomed 96-well plate. From 6 cm dishes, colonies were picked and transferred to PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300xg for 5 min followed by a wash with PBS. Finally, cells were resuspended in 25 µl QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA) and transferred to PCR plates, which were incubated at 65°C for 10 min followed by 100°C for 2 min. For <italic>CCR5</italic>, a 3-primer PCR was set up with a forward primer binding in the left homology arm, a forward primer binding in the insert, and a reverse primer binding in CCR5 outside the right homology arm CCR5_inside_LHA: 5’-GCACAGGGTGGAACAAGATGG-3’, CCR5_insert: 5’-AAGGGGGAGGATTGGGAAGAC-3’, CCR5_outside_RHA: 5’-TCAAGAATCAGCAATTCTCTGAGGC-3’. For all other genes, gene-specific integration was detected by ‘In-Out’ PCR using a primer that binds outside the homology arm (HA) and a primer specific for the transgene cassette (insert). <italic>HBB</italic>_outside_LHA: GAAGATATGCTTAGAACCGAGG, <italic>HBB</italic>_insert: ACCGCAGATATCCTGTTTGG <italic>IL2RG</italic>_insert: 5’-GTACCAGCACGCCTTCAAGACC-3’, <italic>IL2RG</italic>_outside_RHA: 5’-CAGATATCCAGAGCCTAGCCTCATC-3’, <italic>RUNX1</italic>_outside_RHA: 5’- GAAGGGCATTGCTCAGAAAA-3’, <italic>RUNX1</italic>_insert: 5’- AAGGGGGAGGATTGGGAAGAC-3’, <italic>ASXL1</italic>_outside_RHA: 5’- AAGGGGGAGGATTGGGAAGAC-3’, <italic>ASXL1</italic>_insert: 5’- CCTCCCAAGCTGGAACTACA-3’. For detecting IL2RG non-integrated (non_int) alleles the following primers were used: IL2RG_non_int_fw: 5’-TCACACAGCACATATTTGCCACACCCTCTG-3′, IL2RG_non_int_rv: 5′-TGCCCACATGATTGTAATGGCCAGTGG-3’. For detecting dual integration of GFP and tdTomato into two <italic>HBB</italic> alleles, a primer in <italic>HBB</italic> outside the right homology arm was used together with either a GFP or tdTomato-specific primer: <italic>HBB</italic>_outside_RHA: 5’-GATCCTGAGACTTCCACACTGATGC-3’, GFP: 5’-GTACCAGCACGCCTTCAAGACC-3’, tdTomato: 5’-CGGCATGGACGAGCTGTACAAG-3’. Clones with di-genic GFP (<italic>HBB</italic>)/mCherry (<italic>CCR5</italic>) and tri-genic GFP (<italic>IL2RG</italic>)/tdTomato (<italic>HBB</italic>)/tNGFR (<italic>CCR5</italic>) integrations were screened for integrations using the same primers as above. All integrated PCR bands were subjected to Sanger sequencing to confirm perfect HR at the intended locus. For flow-cytometric analysis of colonies generated from cells with quadruple-allelic HR, individual colonies were picked and directly resuspended in FACS buffer containing LIVE/DEAD staining solution (LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain, Thermo). After 30 min incubation (4°C, dark) cells were washed in FACS buffer and subjected to analysis. Dead cells were excluded from analysis based on APC-Cy7 positivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Transplantation of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs into NSG mice</title><p>6 to 8 week-old NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice were used (Jackson laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME USA). The experimental protocol was approved by Stanford University’s Administrative Panel on Lab Animal Care (IACUC 25065). Four days after electroporation/transduction, different populations of live (DAPI-negative) targeted cells were sorted. Mock-treated cells were also sorted to control for the effect of the sorting procedure. Directly after sorting, cells were transplanted into one femur of sub-lethally irradiated mice (200 rad, 24 hr before transplant). Mice were randomly assigned to each experimental group and analyzed in a blinded fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Assessment of human engraftment</title><p>12 weeks after transplantation, mice were sacrificed, mouse bone marrow (BM) was harvested from the transplanted femur by flushing. Non-specific antibody binding was blocked (10% vol/vol, TruStain FcX, BioLegend) and cells were stained (30 min, 4°C, dark) with monoclonal anti-human HLA-ABC APC-Cy7 (W6/32, BioLegend), anti-mouse CD45.1 PE-Cy7 (A20, eBioScience, San Diego, CA, USA), CD19 APC (HIB19, BD511 Biosciences), CD33 PE (WM53, BD Biosciences), and anti-mouse mTer119 PE-Cy5 (TER-119, BD Biosciences) antibodies, and Propidium Iodide to detect dead cells. Human engraftment was defined as HLA-ABC<sup>+</sup> cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of HBB-AAVS1 translocations</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from sorted populations using QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution. For ddPCR quantification of translocations, ddPCR droplets were generated on a QX200 Droplet Generator (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, PCR reactions were set up in a 25 µL total volume per reaction with the ddPCR Supermix for Probes (No dUTP) (Bio-Rad). A HEX reference assay detecting copy number input of the <italic>TERT</italic> gene was used to normalize for genomic DNA input (Bio-Rad: saCP1000100). A custom assay designed to detect the translocations between <italic>HBB</italic> and <italic>AAVS1</italic> consisted of: Forward primer: 5’-TCAGGGCAGAGCCATCTATTGC-3’, Reverse primer: 5’-CCAGATAAGGAATCTGCCTAACAGG-3', 5'−6FAM/ZEN/3'-IBFQ-labeled Probe (IDT): 5’-CTTCTGACACAACTGTGTTCACTAGCAACC-3’. The translocation assay was used at a final concentration of 900 nM for each of the primers and a final concentration of 250 nM for the probe. 20 µL of the PCR reaction was used for droplet generation, and 40 µL of the droplets was used in the following PCR conditions: 95° - 10 min, 50 cycles of 94° - 30 s, 57°C – 30 s, and 72° - 2 min, finalize with 98° - 10 min and 4°C until droplet analysis. Droplets were analyzed on a QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad) detecting FAM and HEX positive droplets. Control samples with non-template control (H<sub>2</sub>O) or genomic DNA from mock-electroporated samples were included in the entire process. Translocation frequencies were calculated as the translocation copy number per µL divided by the TERT copy number per µL. For sequencing of translocations, PCR products were generated using Phusion polymerase (Fisher Scientific) with the forward and reverse primers listed above for the translocation ddPCR assay. PCR amplicons were gel-purified and cloned into the pMiniT 2.0 plasmid using the NEB PCR Cloning Kit (NEB) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Ligated plasmid reactions were transformed into XL-1 Blue competent cells, plated on ampicillin-containing agar plates, and single colonies were sequenced by MCLAB (South San Francisco, CA, USA) using rolling circle amplification followed by sequencing using the following primer: 5’-ACCTGCCAACCAAAGCGAGAAC-3’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of cell viability and proliferation</title><p>Modified cells were FACS-sorted into individual wells of a 96-well U bottom plate and expanded in HSPC retention media (see above) at a density of &lt;100,000 cells per mL. To check viability and proliferation after multiplexed HR, cells from a single well were recovered and a known number of absolute counting beads (CountBright beads, Invitrogen) was added. Cells were stained with Ghost Dye Red 780 (Tonbo Biosciences) for 30 min at 4°C in the dark and analyzed on a FACS-Aria II without further manipulation to reduce potential cells loss. Viable cells were determined as GhostDye Red 780 negative and exact cell counts were assessed through concomitant acquisition of 10,000 beads. Cell counts were calculated based on ratio of beads to cells within the suspension.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>ROB was supported through an Individual Postdoctoral grant (DFF–1333-00106B) and a Sapere Aude, Research Talent grant (DFF–1331-00735B) both from the Danish Council for Independent Research, Medical Sciences.

(b) Overview of genotypes for the non-integrated alleles in mono-genic integration experiments. The three tables show the different INDELs that were identified by Sanger Sequencing of the non-edited allele in mono-genic targeting experiments (<italic>CCR5</italic>, <italic>IL2RG</italic>, and <italic>RUNX1</italic>) used to analyze genotype frequencies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b and d</xref>. Alleles are grouped into WT (blue), INDELs that preserve the reading frame (red) and INDELs that disrupt the reading frame (green). Note that INDELs that preserve the reading frame can potentially be disruptive depending on the size and location. For example, the 147 bp deletion in <italic>RUNX1</italic> is considered disruptive because of its large size and because it deletes the splice donor site in the intron between exon 2 and 3. For <italic>IL2RG</italic>, one clone was found to have an allele with integration of 230 bp from the donor (at the end of the RHA and 72 bp into the ITR).

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the authors should include the data for RUNX1, HBB and CCR5 as well.</p><p>3) How did the authors design the sgRNA for introducing biallelic modifications?

After 15 weeks 1.5% of cells showed engraftment. Do the authors have sequential data, how this population changes over time – increases/ decreases?</p><p>5) When multigenic HR was performed, was there evidence of NHEJ besides the HR directed repair? And what was its frequency? Was there evidence of gene fusions/ translocations?</p><p>6) Cell viability 3 days post targeting 3 genes (RNP+AAV) was &lt;70% compared to 100% in AAV only cells. Since the fraction of triple pos. cells is low (e.g. Runx1/HBB/ASXL1 2.9%), was flow analysis repeated at a later time point to ensure the triple-positive cells were still alive?</p><p>7) The authors postulate that multiplex genome editing using their method will enable and facilitate functional studies of gene networks. Nevertheless, simultaneous gene editing of 3 genes showed an efficiency of 2.6% and of 4 genes and efficiency of 1% only. These fractions seem very small. Particularly in the setting of in vivo studies such as a BMT experiment: the authors were able to transplant ~30 000 double positive cells modifying 2 genes simultaneously with a double pos. rate of 10.2.% (di genic approach). If the triple or quadruple positive rate drops to 1%, this would mean to transplant 3 000 cells for a BMT, which seems very low. Please comment on this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a nicely designed and executed study using CRISPR tools to introduce reporter genes in human CD34+ HSPCs allowing sorting and/or tracking of cells with inactivation of specific genes.</p><p>The authors present an elegant approach that would be useful to model disease relevant inactivating mutations in human HSPCs, and potentially also point mutations (the authors discuss how this might be possible by modifying the CRISPR tools they present but do not actually show data on these strategies).</p><p>The data are of high quality, well presented and clearly described. A minor criticism is that the results are presented in a repetitive and a bit monotonous style, but nevertheless clear and with enough detail for others to reproduce.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows low engraftment (in the 0.1-1% range) of the edited cells compared to mock, indicating a potential engraftment impairment (although the mouse numbers are low). Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>2) Related to my comment above, the authors could discuss a bit more the potential limitations of their approach. For example, an important point to discuss is the time it would take from the beginning of culture to cell sorting and how this might impact HSPC function.</p><p>3) Trypan blue and Annexin staining (Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) may not be adequate ways to assess toxicity, as dead cells may be continuously removed from the cultures and not detected with these methods. I think that cell counts depicting the expansion of the edited cells vs. mock or unmodified would be more convincing way to evaluate toxicity of the method.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>: the number of untargeted IL2RG alleles without indels is much higher than that of untargeted alleles of CCR5 or other genes. Is this due to lower gRNA activity (reflected by overall lower targeting efficiency in the IL2RG locus?) Can the authors comment on this?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Bak et al. describes a method to perform multiplex homology-directed genome editing of human HSPCs. Using Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex and rAAV as a donor for the homology-directed repair template, they remarkably achieve up to four (potentially more) HDR genome editing events, with little if any modification to a published protocol. Some weaknesses include lack of rigorous assessment of potential negative effects of multiplexed editing on HSPCs function and the genetic consequences. The work also lacks evidence that the functional consequences of multiplex genome editing can be read out even with the potential negative effects the editing protocol may have. Overall, this work could potentially be a highly valuable technique for the hematology field upon clarifying these issues.</p><p>1) The chimerism achieved after transplantation of dual-edited cells are substantially lower than mock edited cells with no indication as to whether the cells had multi-lineage reconstitution, raising a concern that the multiplexed editing impaired the function of HSPCs. At least the contribution of dual-edited cells to each hematopoietic lineage should be shown. A concern is that this method uses rAAV6 at a high MOI (50,000-100,000 per gene. With tetra-editing, cells are exposed to 200,000 units of AAV). Is this high level of AAV exposure impairing the reconstitution potential of HSPCs (inflammation response or immune reaction?)? Do cells electroporated with Cas9-sgRNA RNP but not exposed to AAV reconstitute better?</p><p>2) The authors should analyze the off-target mutagenesis events. There seems to be a substantial fraction of cells that undergo random integration of rAAV6 reporter, perhaps due to the high MOI of rAAV6 used. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows that 7-8% of cells become reporter<sup>low</sup>, some of which are maintained for long term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) indicating that the template DNA integrated into the HSPC genome. I agree that sorting reporter<sup>high</sup> cells will enrich for cells with HDR editing, but for a technology driven study it will be important to elucidate the nature of these reporter<sup>low</sup> cells. This will be particularly important for some cell like T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) that somehow have lower expression of the reporter genes. It also suggests that a fraction of reporter<sup>high</sup> cells also have substantial non-targeted integration, which may affect their function. Are these cells enriched for randomly integrated cells, or do they have specific integration into specific loci? Are these cells diluting the episome (so that the frequency of reporter<sup>low</sup> cells decreases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or these cells dying due to the mutagenic events of random integration?</p><p>3) There is little effort to demonstrate the precision of the HDR events other than the &quot;in-out PCR&quot;, which only tells that the reporter was integrated into the correct loci but does not tell whether the HDR was precise, or whether off-target cutting occurred, or whether translocation occurred at a level that impedes the usefulness of this protocol. The first point is important given that the authors envision their method could be used for targeted SNP knock-in. Off-targeting editing due to the use of multiple sgRNA is cautioned in the discussion but no data provided to assess whether this is a significant concern or not. The authors should perform sequencing analyses to provide quantitative assessment of precise vs. imprecise HDR editing at the targeted loci, and the extent to which off-target editing/translocation occurs.</p><p>4) Although I understand that this is a method paper describing a toolbox to edit the genomes of HSPCs in a multiplexed manner, it is difficult to fully appreciate the potential of this method without a real example of how this could be used. In another word, there is no proof that it is possible to assess the functional consequences of multiplex editing other than analyzing the expression of reporter genes. Any of the concerns raised above (1-3) can impede the potential of multiplex HSPC editing. Can the authors provide evidence that multiplex editing can be used to examine the combinatorial effects of gene editing?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27873.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although all three reviewers found merit in this work, some specific issues were raised which resonated with all of the reviewers and which need to be addressed.

Increasing biallelic targeting at CCR5 may be achieved using a different sgRNA, increasing Cas9 concentrations and/or increasing the amount of AAV6 used. However, we believe that optimizing bi-allelic integration into the <italic>CCR5</italic> gene, while interesting from the perspective of generating an HIV-resistant immune system, goes beyond the scope of the work here.

Were sgRNA on the both strands &quot;reciprocal&quot;? or were the sgRNA on both strands located at different nucleotide sequences?</p></disp-quote><p>For each targeted gene, only one sgRNA is used. This sgRNA targets the same target sites on the two alleles. We have made textual changes to clarify this. Thus, it is important to target sequences that are not polymorphic in the human population when using a single sgRNA and trying to create bi-allelic modifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For the transplantation studies, 15 weeks after sorting double positive cells and transplanting them into sublethally irradiated mice, mice were sacrificed in engraftment (CDHLA-ABC+/CD45+) was assessed. After 15 weeks 1.5% of cells showed engraftment. Do the authors have sequential data, how this population changes over time – increases/ decreases?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now extended the transplantation experiment and show new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>. These transplants were performed intra-femorally and at end point upon euthanasia, engraftment was assessed in the transplanted femur. To allow robust assessment of engraftment efficiencies, we did not perform serial aspirates from the transplanted femur. The suggestion to examine engraftment over time is an excellent point, and future studies using significantly larger numbers of mice focused on the engraftment kinetics of genome edited cells will be necessary to investigate this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) When multigenic HR was performed, was there evidence of NHEJ besides the HR directed repair? And what was its frequency? Was there evidence of gene fusions/ translocations?</p></disp-quote><p>If the reviewer refers to NHEJ-mediated capture of the AAV donor at on or off target sites, those are events that we have observed. This data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> where we mix-match nucleases and donors. The frequencies are below 10% of the total targeting frequencies (i.e. 1 out of every 10 targeted cells may have a capture). If the reviewer refers to NHEJ on non-targeted alleles, we have included that data for tri-genic targeting in Supplementary file 4. These data show that 85% of the clones with tri-genic integrations were modified on all alleles either by biallelic integration or INDELs on the non-integrated allele that were mostly disruptive. As suggested by the reviewer, we have now included data quantifying translocations when targeting two genes simultaneously. As expected, we do observe translocations, although at low frequencies (around 0.3%) for a monocentric translocation, which has been reported to be the most frequent translocation type (Poirot et al., Cancer Res. 2015). This new data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Cell viability 3 days post targeting 3 genes (RNP+AAV) was &lt;70% compared to 100% in AAV only cells.

Nevertheless, simultaneous gene editing of 3 genes showed an efficiency of 2.6% and of 4 genes and efficiency of 1% only. These fractions seem very small. Particularly in the setting of in vivo studies such as a BMT experiment: the authors were able to transplant ~30 000 double positive cells modifying 2 genes simultaneously with a double pos. rate of 10.2.% (di genic approach). If the triple or quadruple positive rate drops to 1%, this would mean to transplant 3 000 cells for a BMT, which seems very low. Please comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an excellent consideration. We have now included a revised transplantation experiment using higher numbers of cells with di-genic targeted integration (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and 3G</xref>). This data includes a mouse with human chimerism of 19.4%. However, we do agree with the reviewer on this important point and have made textual changes to mention ways to overcome this challenge, such as starting with higher cell doses, expansion of modified cells, or transplantation into human bone ossicles, which require very few transplanted cells (Reinisch et al., Nature Med. 2016 Jul;22(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">7</xref>):812-21.). While we believe that we have offered a multiplexing platform to build around, future studies will be needed to address these issues. In addition, while 1% can seem like a small percentage, human leukemias develop from a single cell and yet end up taking over the hematopoietic system. In collaborative work published with the Cleary lab, for example, leukemias developed after transplantation into NSG mice with very low genome editing frequencies (perhaps as low as 0.1%) (Buechele et al., Blood 2015). In those studies, only a single editing event was created (but in a powerful oncogene (MLL)), and the current approach allows the generation of multiple editing events in genes that might have weaker transformative effects than the MLL-AF9 fusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The data are of high quality, well presented and clearly described.

We are sorry that we have erred on being monotonous in our presentation, but we felt it was more appropriate to attempt to give a balanced view rather than to overstate our data. In fact, we are tremendously excited about the data and both of our labs have fully embraced the discoveries and approach for studies of leukemogenesis and for developing novel cell based therapeutics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows low engraftment (in the 0.1-1% range) of the edited cells compared to mock, indicating a potential engraftment impairment (although the mouse numbers are low). Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously described that HSCs are more refractory to HR compared to short-lived hematopoietic progenitors (Dever and Bak et al., Nature 2016). Therefore, higher numbers of modified cells must be transplanted to achieve engraftment frequencies similar to that of unmodified cells. Since we are targeting multiple genes rather than just one, it is not surprising that within a population of cells purified based on HR-mediated marker expression the number of true HSCs is relatively low and that long-term engraftment consequently will be low. To show that higher engraftment is possible by using more cells, we have now updated the transplantation results with data from a new experiment transplanting higher cell numbers (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). For one mouse transplanted with enriched di-genically targeted cells we observed 19.4% multilineage chimerism showing that the limiting factor is HSC cell number within the targeted population. While we believe that we have provided enough evidence that multiplexed targeting occurs in HSPCs with long-term and multilineage potential, further studies are necessary to address the caveats of achieving high targeting rates in the most immature HSC compartment with subsequent high engraftment of multiplexed-HSPCs. We have also made text revisions with suggestions on how to overcome low engraftment (higher cell dose, pre-transplant in vitro expansion, and the use of a human bone ossicle transplantation model).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to my comment above, the authors could discuss a bit more the potential limitations of their approach.

Using Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex and rAAV as a donor for the homology-directed repair template, they remarkably achieve up to four (potentially more) HDR genome editing events, with little if any modification to a published protocol. Some weaknesses include lack of rigorous assessment of potential negative effects of multiplexed editing on HSPCs function and the genetic consequences. The work also lacks evidence that the functional consequences of multiplex genome editing can be read out even with the potential negative effects the editing protocol may have. Overall, this work could potentially be a highly valuable technique for the hematology field upon clarifying these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate the reviewer acknowledging that it is remarkable to achieve HR at 4 genes simultaneously and that this work could be a highly valuable technique for the hematology field. We have addressed the reviewer’s concerns below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The chimerism achieved after transplantation of dual-edited cells are substantially lower than mock edited cells with no indication as to whether the cells had multi-lineage reconstitution, raising a concern that the multiplexed editing impaired the function of HSPCs. At least the contribution of dual-edited cells to each hematopoietic lineage should be shown. A concern is that this method uses rAAV6 at a high MOI (50,000-100,000 per gene. With tetra-editing, cells are exposed to 200,000 units of AAV). Is this high level of AAV exposure impairing the reconstitution potential of HSPCs (inflammation response or immune reaction?)? Do cells electroporated with Cas9-sgRNA RNP but not exposed to AAV reconstitute better?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns and agree that maintaining HSPC function is of highest importance for this methodology to be useful. We note that in the revised manuscript we have now updated the engraftment data with a new experiment transplanting more cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, we can now report a mouse transplanted with di-genically targeted cells that displays 19.4% chimerism and multilineage reconstitution (B cells and myeloid cells). However, we agree that the engraftment capacity of HSPCs edited at multiple loci might be a concern. Lower engraftment of edited and enriched cells compared to unedited cells is something we have observed before (Dever &amp; Bak et al., Nature 2016). This phenomenon is caused by lower targeting rates in HSCs with long-term repopulation capacity (LT-HSCs). Therefore, an edited population contains less LT-HSCs than a non-edited, and it is therefore expected to observe less engraftment with edited populations. With that said, we are currently investigating expansion protocols, injection of a higher numbers of cells, and transplantation into a human bone ossicle xenograft model, but believe those studies are beyond the scope of this manuscript. We do not believe high levels of AAV exposure is influencing HSPC function, as we see equivalent number of progenitor-derived colonies compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should analyze the off-target mutagenesis events. There seems to be a substantial fraction of cells that undergo random integration of rAAV6 reporter, perhaps due to the high MOI of rAAV6 used. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows that 7-8% of cells become reporter<sup>low</sup>, some of which are maintained for long term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) indicating that the template DNA integrated into the HSPC genome. I agree that sorting reporter<sup>high</sup> cells will enrich for cells with HDR editing, but for a technology driven study it will be important to elucidate the nature of these reporter<sup>low</sup> cells. This will be particularly important for some cell like T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) that somehow have lower expression of the reporter genes. It also suggests that a fraction of reporter<sup>high</sup> cells also have substantial non-targeted integration, which may affect their function. Are these cells enriched for randomly integrated cells, or do they have specific integration into specific loci? Are these cells diluting the episome (so that the frequency of reporter<sup>low</sup> cells decreases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or these cells dying due to the mutagenic events of random integration?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an excellent point. The reporter<sup>low</sup> cells contain mostly cells that are not targeted, but also some cells that are targeted (based on consistent reporter expression over time as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We have now included data that presents a more in-depth analysis of the reporter<sup>low</sup> fraction (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This data shows that most of the reporter<sup>low</sup> cells are diluting the episome and becoming negative over time, but some remain positive and even become reporter<sup>high</sup> because they are in fact targeted. The intensity of the reporter strongly correlates with the propensity to shift to reporter<sup>high</sup> expression either due to delayed HR or delayed expression. The T cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> have low expression because in this particular experiment a weaker promoter (EF1α promoter which is weaker than SFFV) drives the genes encoding fluorescent proteins. We know from our previous studies (Dever &amp; Bak et al., Nature 2016) that the reporter<sup>high</sup> monogenic targeted HSPCs can engraft long-term in secondary transplants, so it is unlikely that most of the reporter<sup>high</sup> cells have impaired function and more likely that they have specific integration into the on-target loci (as based on our genotyping data in colonies after 14 days in culture).</p><p>While we believe that off-target effects should always be considered when evaluating the results of a genome editing experiment, since we studied 8 different genes in this work to establish a proof of concept, we do not believe that a comprehensive analysis of potential off-target INDELs is within the scope of this manuscript. We did, however, add data on translocation frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) to give readers a sense of the relative frequency of such events (rare, accounting for &lt;0.3%). Finally, we are not aware of any study using genome editing in which an off-target INDEL has confounded a biologic finding (in striking contrast to the RNAi methodology) and remain encouraged for the use of this approach. Nonetheless, we agree that unplanned genomic changes (from the Cas9/gRNA, from the AAV, and from simply culturing cells ex vivo) should always be carefully considered when interpreting the phenotypic effect of a genome editing experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is little effort to demonstrate the precision of the HDR events other than the &quot;in-out PCR&quot;, which only tells that the reporter was integrated into the correct loci but does not tell whether the HDR was precise, or whether off-target cutting occurred, or whether translocation occurred at a level that impedes the usefulness of this protocol. The first point is important given that the authors envision their method could be used for targeted SNP knock-in. Off-targeting editing due to the use of multiple sgRNA is cautioned in the discussion but no data provided to assess whether this is a significant concern or not. The authors should perform sequencing analyses to provide quantitative assessment of precise vs. imprecise HDR editing at the targeted loci, and the extent to which off-target editing/translocation occurs.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns. We and others have previously confirmed that the majority of HR events are perfect/seamless (for example Sather et al., STM, 2015; Dever &amp; Bak et al., Nature, 2016; Bak and Porteus, Cell Reports, 2017). We believe that a full off-target integration analysis is beyond the scope of this study, but as suggested by the reviewer, we have now included data quantifying translocations when targeting two genes simultaneously in HSPCs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As expected we do observe translocations, although at low frequencies (around 0.3%) for a monocentric translocation, which has been reported to be the most frequent translocation type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Although I understand that this is a method paper describing a toolbox to edit the genomes of HSPCs in a multiplexed manner, it is difficult to fully appreciate the potential of this method without a real example of how this could be used. In another word, there is no proof that it is possible to assess the functional consequences of multiplex editing other than analyzing the expression of reporter genes. Any of the concerns raised above (1-3) can impede the potential of multiplex HSPC editing. Can the authors provide evidence that multiplex editing can be used to examine the combinatorial effects of gene editing?</p></disp-quote><p>We developed this method to be able to study genes involved in hematopoiesis that eliminates the need for random integration of lentiviral vectors to reduce gene expression in HSPCs. To exemplify the applicability of studying HSPC biology using targeted integration of a reporter gene combined with the enrichment methodology, we have now included new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) showing that knockout of the cohesion member gene <italic>STAG2</italic> leads to a drastic loss of erythroid colony formation. This highlights that sorting HR-targeted HSPCs can be used to study gene function.</p></body></sub-article></article>
