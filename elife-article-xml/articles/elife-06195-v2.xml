The action of Bk on the sensory system is well documented but its effects on motoneurons, the final pathway of the motor system, are unknown. By a combination of patch-clamp recordings and two-photon calcium imaging, we found that Bk strongly sensitizes spinal motoneurons. Sensitization was characterized by an increased ability to generate self-sustained spiking in response to excitatory inputs. Our pharmacological study described a dual ionic mechanism to sensitize motoneurons, including inhibition of a barium-sensitive resting K<sup>+</sup> conductance and activation of a nonselective cationic conductance primarily mediated by Na<sup>+</sup>. Examination of the upstream signaling pathways provided evidence for postsynaptic activation of B<sub>2</sub> receptors, G protein activation of phospholipase C, InsP3 synthesis, and calmodulin activation. This study questions the influence of motoneurons in the assessment of hyperalgesia since the withdrawal motor reflex is commonly used as a surrogate pain model.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06195.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06195.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06195.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When we accidentally place our hand on a hot stove, we normally experience a painful sensation that starts with the sensory nerves under our skin. These nerves respond by transmitting electrical impulses to our brain, where the painful sensation is then processed. At the same time, these impulses are also transmitted to the motor nerves that control the muscles in our hand to trigger an immediate reflex to withdraw the hand from the hot stove. Pain therefore has a useful role as it can reduce how bad an injury is.</p><p>People with a condition called hyperalgesia have an increased sensitivity to pain. This condition can result from a chemical called bradykinin ‘sensitizing’ the sensory nerves, causing them to transmit more electrical impulses in response to pain than normal. This makes the injury feel much more painful, and can make the pain last for longer than is beneficial.</p><p>It was less clear whether bradykinin also affects motor nerves and so triggers a withdrawal reflex. By recording the electrical activity of motor nerve cells taken from the spinal cords of newborn rats, Bouhadfane et al. now show that these motor nerves become more active when exposed to bradykinin.</p><p>Nerve cells generate electrical signals when ions—such as potassium, sodium, and calcium ions—move through channels in the membranes of the cell. Therefore, to investigate how bradykinin influences the electrical activity of motor nerves, Bouhadfane et al. exposed the cells to drugs that inhibit particular ion channels. This revealed that bradykinin sensitizes the motor nerves by blocking a type of potassium ion channel and activating another ion channel that mainly transports sodium ions. Furthermore, Bouhadfane et al. were able to identify the signaling pathways that allow bradykinin to affect the motor nerve cells.</p><p>The study implies that the neuronal circuitry for pain does not rely exclusively on sensory nerve cells but should also integrate motor nerve cells. A future challenge remains in developing a protocol to resolve the contribution of motor nerve cells to hyperalgesia assessed by reflex withdrawal.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06195.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06195.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>motoneuron</kwd><kwd>hyperalgesia</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>spinal cord</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaszás</surname><given-names>Attila</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vinay</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The pain mediator bradykinin was found to sensitize spinal motoneurons by a direct postsynaptic action, questioning the role of motoneurons in the assessment of hyperalgesia since the withdrawal motor reflex is commonly used as a surrogate pain model.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nanopeptide bradykinin (Bk) is an important mediator of pain and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dray and Perkins, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calixto et al., 2000</xref>).

Earlier and indirect evidence suggested that Bk may transynaptically activate motoneurons through activation of transmitter release from primary nociceptive afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dunn and Rang, 1990</xref>). However, kinin, cleaved to Bk by kallikrein in inflammatory responses, is extensively distributed throughout the motor areas of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Raidoo and Bhoola, 1998</xref>) and in particular in the ventral horn of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lopes and Couture, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, Bk receptors have been detected in the membrane of spinal motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lopes et al., 1995</xref>) suggesting that pain-related behaviors such as the withdrawal reflex may also arise from a direct Bk-evoked sensitization of motoneurons. The purpose of our study was to determine whether direct activation of Bk receptors sensitizes lumbar motoneurons of neonatal rats and, if so, to characterize the ionic mechanisms involved.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bk potentiates the gain of sensory inputs into the motor system</title><p>From an in vitro hemicord preparation, the direct application of Bk (4–8 µM) above the ventral horn column (L3–L5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) evoked sustained ventral root activity without inducing antidromic discharge from the dorsal roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). This motor output was not exclusively caused by local reverberating circuits, because it persisted in the presence of the glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate at a concentration that blocked the monosynaptic reflex (1.5 mM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>right</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We tested whether a change in the motoneuronal processing of sensory inputs by Bk might contribute to an increase in the motor output. To avoid sustained ventral root discharge, subthreshold concentrations of Bk (0.5–1 µM) were used. With these low concentrations of Bk, the motoneuron spiking probability in response to supramaximal dorsal root stimulation was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Specifically, Bk had no effect on the transient short latency reflexes (number of events: 144 ± 16 for control vs 143 ± 14 during Bk; p = 0.68, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7) but recruited a long-lasting reflex (number of events: 537 ± 104 for control vs 2493 ± 1207 during Bk; p = 0.015, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7) such that the distribution of peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) shifted from unimodal to bimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>).

From a resting potential adjusted to −70 mV with bias current, an incrementing series of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing pulses was delivered before and after bath application of Bk (4–8 µM). A few minutes (2–3 min) after the application of Bk, the major effect was an increase in motoneuron excitability, as reflected by a lower rheobase (528 ± 118 pA for control vs 299 ± 156 pA during Bk; p = 0.028, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). As a consequence, Bk evoked a leftward shift of the <italic>f</italic>-<italic>I</italic> curve to lower current values and a slight increase in the slope of the <italic>f</italic>-<italic>I</italic> curve (0.05 ± 0.004 Hz/pA for control vs 0.06 ± 0.006 Hz/pA during Bk; p = 0.027, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, current steps that elicited only a single spike prior to Bk typically induced repetitive spiking during Bk application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The higher motoneuron excitability was associated with an apparent increase in input resistance (55.6 ± 5.4 MΩ for control vs 62.9 ± 7.2 MΩ during Bk; p = 0.004, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) as seen by the increased slope of the voltage responses to hyperpolarizing pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). Bk lowered the threshold for action potential generation (−50.0 ± 2.1 mV for the control vs −52.8 ± 2.5 mV during Bk; p = 0.009, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) which, although not wider (0.51 ± 0.02 ms for control vs 0.51 ± 0.02 ms during Bk; p = 0.77, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), was smaller in amplitude (67.0 ± 2.3 mV for control vs 63.6 ± 2.2 mV during Bk; p = 0.049, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Hyperpolarizing current steps evoked a marked depolarizing sag (inward rectification) which is often associated with activation of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current I<sub>h</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); the amplitude of the sag was not affected by Bk (12 ± 2.6% for control vs 12.3 ± 2.5% during Bk; p = 0.95, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). However, the medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP) was enhanced both in amplitude and duration (amplitude: −9.1 ± 0.9 mV for the control vs −11.2 ± 1.5 mV for Bk, p = 0.02; duration: 41.1 ± 2.5 ms for control vs 48.6 ± 3.4 ms for Bk, p = 0.014; Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In a recent publication, we demonstrated that at temperatures above 30°C, neonatal rat lumbar motoneurons show marked bistability, characterized by their ability to generate a slow afterdepolarization (sADP) that outlasted a brief high amplitude depolarizing pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouhadfane et al., 2013</xref>).

Among them, 154 (77%) displayed a reversible membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) while the remaining 46 had no responses. The onset of the depolarization was slow, taking close to 1 min to peak, and subsided slowly over 3–5 min during washout. During the peak of the depolarizing response, spikelets, indicative of electrical coupling to other neurons, were sometimes seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <italic>inset</italic>). The amplitude of the depolarization was not changed after blockade of glutamatergic input with kynurenate (1.5 mM) or by CNQX (10 µM) and AP-5 (20 µM) (92.9 ± 17.8% of the control; p = 0.62, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 4 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). These effects were thus not exclusively caused by a feed-forward network of excitatory synaptic input to motoneurons, but rather probably involved a direct postsynaptic action. Supporting this idea, the Bk-induced depolarization persisted in the presence of 0.5–1 μM TTX (12.9 ± 0.6 mV; n = 154; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The effects of Bk were fully reversible without tachyphylaxis; when Bk was repetitively applied at intervals of 20 min, the amplitude of the second response was not significantly reduced from the first response (95.6 ± 13.9% of the first response; p = 0.22, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Previous indirect evidence suggested that Bk's actions on lumbar motoneurons were secondary to the activation of NK1 receptors by substance P released from primary afferent C-fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dunn and Rang, 1990</xref>).

To investigate the current in relative isolation, TTX (0.5 µM) was added in the aCSF. Under these conditions, Bk reversibly generated an inward current whose time course was similar to that seen in current-clamp recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Part of the Bk response seems thus independent of voltage-gated channels. The inward current amplitude was steeply dependent on Bk concentration, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 680 nM and maximal amplitude (322 ± 26 pA, n = 14) at 4–8 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The peak current density was 1.5 ± 0.15 pA/pF (n = 14). In the following experiments, the Bk-sensitive current was investigated by means of slow voltage ramp to minimize inactivating voltage-gated currents. To ensure a maximum response and to avoid potential fluctuation of the effective peptide concentration, Bk was applied at 8 µM. A significant Bk-induced decrease in the slope conductance was observed in <italic>I/V</italic> curves (18.7 ± 2.4 pA/mV before Bk vs 15.6 ± 2.2 pA/mV during Bk; p = 0.016, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), an effect often interpreted as a consequence of the inhibition of a K<sup>+</sup> conductance. Consistent with this interpretation, the linear <italic>I/V</italic> relationship of the Bk-sensitive-current (obtained by subtracting the control from the Bk currents: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>orange line with open circles</italic>) reversed at an extrapolated value close to the predicted equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (E<sub>k</sub>: −100 mV). The combination of traditional voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers [TEA (10 mM), 4-aminopyridine (2 mM), the HCN-channel blocker ZD7288 (20 µM)] and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker apamin (100 nM), did not change either the Bk-induced decrease in slope conductance (33.2 ± 3.2 pA/mV before Bk vs 21.1 ± 2.3 pA/mV during Bk; p = 0.02, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 15 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D1</xref>) or the peak depolarization magnitude measured in current clamp from −70 mV (94.5 ± 15.8% of the control; p = 0.54, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D2</xref>). The contribution of K<sup>+</sup> ions was further examined by raising the extracellular K<sup>+</sup> ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) to 9 mM, a manipulation that almost eliminates the driving force for K<sup>+</sup> at resting membrane potential by setting E<sub>k</sub> at ∼ −70 mV according the Nernst equation. Under high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, Bk still induced a depolarization from −70 mV without a measurable change in input resistance (45.3 ± 13.9 MΩ before Bk vs 46.5 ± 13.2 MΩ during Bk; p = 0.81, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7 cells). However, the depolarization was significantly smaller than that seen in normal aCSF (64.2 ± 17.7% of the control value measured in normal aCSF; p = 0.047, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These data suggest that a second ionic component contributes to the Bk depolarization in addition to a reduction in K<sup>+</sup> conductances. The residual Bk-induced depolarization observed in high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> appears to be sodium-mediated because it disappeared after reducing [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> from 152 to 26 mM with equimolar choline-chloride (4.1 ± 2.8% of the control value measured in high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>; p = 0.016, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In sum, our data indicate that there are at least two ionic components in the response to Bk: a K<sup>+</sup> component that produces an input resistance increase and likely involves a reduction of a resting K<sup>+</sup> conductance, and a Na<sup>+</sup> component that produces depolarization without measurable change in input resistance.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06195.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Bradykinin inhibits a leak K<sup>+</sup> current and activates a Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent nonselective cationic current.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative inward current induced by bradykinin (Bk, 8 µM) in lumbar motoneuron.

This apparent I<sub>CaN</sub> was also thermosensitive because lowering the temperature from 34 to 24°C induced a significant decrease in the Bk-induced depolarization at −70 mV in high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (26.2 ± 9.8% of control values; p = 0.03, Wilcoxon paired test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

We therefore examined whether an increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) was required for the Bk-induced depolarization. To demonstrate a Bk-induced rise of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in motoneurons, we first loaded the ventral horn with the calcium indicator Oregon Green-BAPTA 1 AM (OGB1-AM) along with the glial cell marker Sulforhodamine-101 (SR-101) using the extracellular bolus loading technique (see ‘Materials and methods’). Since the astroglial cells were labeled by both dyes, they appeared as yellow cells, while neurons were labeled by green OGB1-AM only. This allowed the clear separation of neurons from astroglial cells. After a brief equilibration period, we imaged calcium changes from somata of lumbar motoneurons using a three-dimensional random-access two-photon microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Bk induced a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (13.4 ± 0.7% ΔF/F) in 65% of motoneuron somata (n = 177 out of 272 cells; n = 5 slices), with very slow decay times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>); there was no change in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the remaining motoneurons. In the next step, we explored the relationship between spatio-temporal changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in motoneuron somata and dendrites along with the Bk-induced membrane depolarization. Here, the patch pipette was filled with the cell-impermeable calcium indicator OGB1 (120 µM) and a morphometric dye, Alexa 594 (20 µM) to allow simultaneous two-photon imaging and anatomical tracing of the cellular processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). After Bk application, the proximal dendrites up to 50 µm away from the soma showed a clear rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (49.8 ± 8.7% ΔF/F; n = 5 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>; <italic>red trace</italic>), which was followed with a delay by the somatic response (44.5e ± 8.9% ΔF/F; n = 5 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>; <italic>blue trace</italic>). All of the above results were obtained with blocked voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels (0.5 µM TTX and 10 mM TEA, respectively), showing the Bk-induced response alone, without spiking activity of the motoneurons. To obtain a physiologically relevant comparison to the Bk-induced responses, we imaged [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes induced by action potentials evoked by depolarizing pulses in the absence of TTX and TEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Our results show that a single action potential induced a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rise significantly higher in the proximal dendrites than in the soma (Ca<sub>soma</sub> = 6.1 ± 1.5% ΔF/F; Ca<sub>dendrite</sub> = 16.9 ± 3.6% ΔF/F; n = 5 cells; p = 0.02, Student's paired <italic>t</italic>-test).

Further supporting this, Bk receptors have been mapped to the membranes of motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lopes et al., 1995</xref>), Bk induces direct elevation of free calcium in motoneurons, and the depolarization in motoneurons is greatly reduced by calcium chelators infused into the motoneurons themselves.

In addition to quinidine sensitivity, we show that the response to Bk is reduced by a low concentration of Ba<sup>2+</sup> but not by acidosis.

Since blockade of membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels does not affect Bk-induced depolarizations, and I<sub>CaN</sub> is mainly mediated by Na<sup>+</sup>, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase must arise from the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores. Most directly, we showed that the introduction of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer BAPTA into the cytoplasm greatly reduced the Bk response, and blockade of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor CaM fully abolished Bk responses. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, these data suggest that the two ionic components are mediated by B<sub>2</sub> receptors acting via the single PLC/InsP3/calcium signaling pathway.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06195.013</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Overview of the signal transduction cascade for excitatory actions of Bk on lumbar motoneurons.</title><p>InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate; PLC, Phospholipase C; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06195.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06195.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06195-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional consequences</title><p>Bk not only depolarizes spinal motoneurons but also sensitizes them, so they are more activated by small inputs than under control conditions. The leftward shift in the <italic>f</italic>–<italic>I</italic> relation can be explained as an increase in responsiveness due to an increase in input resistance. The depolarizing effect of the Na<sup>+</sup> current would also be enhanced by the simultaneous increase in input resistance due to reduction of a resting K<sup>+</sup> conductance. This synergistic mechanism might promote the burst-evoked sADP, which helps to generate self-sustained spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouhadfane et al., 2013</xref>). Following traumatic injury, increases in the concentration of kinins in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xu et al., 1991</xref>) might thus predispose motoneurons to express self-sustained plateau potentials, thereby contributing to muscle spasms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nickolls et al., 2004</xref>). In keeping with this hypothesis, chronic spinal rats show the emergence of long-lasting reflexes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murray et al., 2010</xref>), similar to those we recorded in response to Bk in vitro (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The spinal cord also represents a relevant site of action for kinins to produce hypernociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steranka et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Perkins et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferreira et al., 2002</xref>). The flexor withdrawal motor reflex has commonly been used as a surrogate pain model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrot, 2012</xref>); however, the contribution of motoneuron hyperexcitability has never been questioned. A role for Bk in hyperalgesic assessment methods at the level of motoneurons remains to be substantiated. It would be expected that excitation of sensory interneurons by Bk works in concert with direct sensitization of motoneurons to augment the withdrawal flexor reflex. It is also important to emphasize that the neonatal response to nociception differs from that found in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fitzgerald, 2005</xref>). It seems therefore rational that Bk actions might undergo marked postnatal changes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Experiments were performed on neonatal (0–7 days old) Wistar rats of either sex.

The hemispinal cord with the medial side up was transferred to the recording chamber and perfused with oxygenated normal Krebs solution composed of the following (in mM): 120 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 D-glucose, pH 7.4, ∼32°C pH 7.4. <italic>For the slice preparation</italic>, the lumbar spinal cord was isolated in oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) ice-cold (&lt;4°C) low-sodium medium, composed of the following (in mM): 232 sucrose, 3 KCl, 1.25 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 4 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 D-glucose, pH 7.4. The lumbar spinal cord was then introduced into a 4% agar solution, quickly cooled, mounted in a vibrating microtome (VT1000S; Leica, Germany) and sliced (350 µm) through the L3-5 lumbar segments. Slices were immediately transferred into the holding chamber filled with oxygenated aCSF solution (composed of [in mM]: 120 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 D-glucose, pH 7.4, ∼30°C). Following a 1-hr resting period, individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber that was continuously perfused (∼4 ml/min) with the same medium heated to ∼34°C. All solutions were oxygenated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Recordings and stimulation</title><p>Electrophysiological data were acquired through a Digidata 1440a interface using the Clampex 10 software (Molecular Devices). <italic>For the spinal hemicord preparation</italic>, motor outputs were recorded using extracellular stainless steel electrodes placed in contact with lumbar ventral roots (L3–L5) and insulated with Vaseline. The ventral root recordings were amplified (×2000), high-pass filtered at 70 Hz, low-pass filtered at 3 kHz, and sampled at 10 kHz. Monopolar stainless steel electrodes were also placed in contact with the dorsal roots and insulated with Vaseline to deliver a brief supramaximal stimulation (0.2 ms duration). Dorsal root stimulation was repeated five times with an interstimulus interval of 60 s for each trial. <italic>For the slice preparation</italic>, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from motoneurons located in the lateral ventral horn using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in current- or voltage-clamp mode. Motoneurons were visually identified with video microscopy (E600FN; Nikon Eclipse, Japan) coupled to infrared differential interference contrast, as the largest cells located in layer IX. The image was enhanced with a KP-200/201 infrared-sensitive CCD camera (Hitachi, Japan) and displayed on a video monitor. Only one motoneuron was recorded from each slice. Patch electrodes (2–3 MΩ) were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5 mm OD, 1.12 mm ID; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) on a Sutter P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments Company, Novato, CA) and filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): 140 K<sup>+</sup>-gluconate, 5 NaCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 2 ATP, 0.4 GTP, pH 7.3 (280–290 mOsm). In some recordings, BAPTA (10 mM), GDPßS (2 mM), or xestospongin (2.5 mM) were added in the pipette solution to chelate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, to inhibit G-proteins or to block InsP3 receptors, respectively. Recordings were digitized on-line and filtered at 10 kHz (Digidata 1322A, Molecular Devices). Access resistance was monitored periodically throughout the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Two photon imaging</title><p>For calcium-indicator loading of cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stosiek et al., 2003</xref>), we used multicell bolus loading with Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 acetoxymethyl ester (1 mM OGB1-AM; Life Technologies, France), which resulted in the staining of virtually all cells near the ejection site, including neurons and astrocytes. Astrocytes were identified through additional staining with the astrocytic marker Sulforhodamine-101 (300 µM SR-101), which permitted a clear separation of the astroglial (yellow) and neuronal (green) networks. According to the criteria stated above, motoneuron somata were manually selected in a three-dimensional space after acquiring a reference z-stack of the volume on a custom-built three dimensional fast acousto-optical trajectory scanning microscope (Femtonics Ltd, Budapest, Hungary) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Katona et al., 2012</xref>) with a femtosecond pulsed laser tuned to 830 nm (Mai Tai HP, Spectra Physics, Mountain View, California). For each motoneuron selected, acquisition points were placed in the soma in the cytoplasmic area avoiding the nucleus. The selected neurons were imaged at 33 kHz/point. Imaging was controlled using the MES software package (Femtonics Ltd) based on Matlab (Mathworks). Fluorescence was measured as the average pixel value over selected somatic and proximal dendritic regions. Calcium changes were calculated as the relative change in fluorescence [ΔF/F = (F − F<sub>0</sub>)/(F<sub>0</sub> − F<sub>b</sub>)], where F<sub>0</sub> is baseline fluorescence and F<sub>b</sub> is background fluorescence measured from a region lacking labeled cells away from the recorded area.</p><p>In some experiments, whole-cell recording and simultaneous calcium imaging were performed on motoneurons identified using 900-nm oblique illumination. In these experiments, the recording electrodes (2–5 MΩ) contained 120 µM OGB-1 and 20 µM Alexa-594 (Life Technologies) dissolved in the same intracellular solution as stated above. To ensure equilibration between the pipette solution and cytosol, the acquisition was started at least 15 min after establishment of the whole-cell configuration. For each subcellular region of interest (soma and dendrites) five to ten acquisition points were manually defined, outside the region of the nucleus, and averaged during analysis. For simultaneous calcium imaging and whole cell recordings, detection of calcium transients was triggered by the onset of spikes or the onset of the Bk response measured in the electrophysiological recording. All imaging sessions were conducted at 34°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Electrophysiological data were analyzed off-line with Clampfit 10 software (Molecular Devices) or the MES sofware package (Femtonics Ltd). Only cells exhibiting a stable holding membrane potential, access resistance (no more than 20% variation) and an action potential amplitude larger than 45 mV were considered. All reported membrane potentials were corrected for liquid junction potentials. Passive membranes properties of cells were measured by determining from the holding potential the largest voltage deflections induced by small current pulses that avoided activation of voltage-sensitive currents. The input resistance and input conductance were measured by the slope of the linear portion of the I/V relationship. There was evidence of inward rectification (‘sag’) during strong hyperpolarization. The size of the sag was measured from the voltage response of the cell to the hyperpolarizing current pulse adjusted to elicit peak voltage deflections to −120 mV, and was defined as 100 × (1 − Vss/Vpeak), where Vpeak was the peak voltage deflection from the holding potential (−70 mV) and Vss was the steady-state voltage deflection from the holding potential. Firing properties were investigated with 1-s-long depolarizing current pulses of varying amplitudes. Firing frequency was calculated as the average action potential frequency over the entire duration of the pulse. The rheobase was defined as the minimum current intensity necessary to induce an action potential. To investigate the action potentials and afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs), single spikes were evoked by brief intracellular pulses from a holding potential of −60 mV. Peak spike amplitude was measured from the threshold potential, and spike duration was defined as the width of the action potential at 50% of the peak. The peak amplitude and duration (to half of the peak height) of AHPs were measured from the holding potential. To investigate the sADP, a train of spikes was evoked by a 2-s current pulse at holding potential of −60 mV. The peak amplitude of the sADP was measured from the holding potential. The peak amplitude of the depolarization induced by bath application of Bk was measured from the holding potential. When the Bk-induced depolarization reached a steady-state level, the membrane potential was manually moved back to its original holding level for direct comparison of membrane properties before and during the application of the nanopeptide. A standard sigmoidal curve was fit to the relation between log of agonist dose and the Bk-induced depolarization. The dose that produced 50% of the maximal effect (EC<sub>50</sub>) was measured from the curve. To characterize the ionic mechanism(s) underlying the Bk-evoked depolarization, the membrane potential was initially held in voltage clamp at −70 mV, which approximates the resting membrane potential of motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tazerart et al., 2007</xref>), and then ramped to 0 mV over 3 s. To show the reversal potential, the <italic>I–V</italic> relationship of the current was constructed by subtracting the <italic>I–V</italic> relationship obtained before Bk application (control) from that performed in the presence of the nanopeptide. The current generated was fitted by a linear regression which was used to extrapolate the reversal potential at which the currents intersect.</p><p>Motor outputs recorded on the ventral roots in response to a brief dorsal root stimulation were quantified by cumulative counts of spikes generated in PSTHs (bins width: 20 ms) over a time window of 4000 ms post-stimulation. PSTHs were constructed from 5 consecutive rectified responses. As defined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murray et al., 2010</xref>), we computed the transient short latency and long-lasting reflexes over a window of 10–40 ms and 500–4000 ms post stimulus, respectively. Counts were corrected for spontaneous activity by subtracting the number of spontaneous events arising prior to the stimulus.</p><p>Calcium fluorescence changes were analyzed using the MES software package (Femtonics Ltd) based on Matlab (Mathworks).</p><p>Data are presented as means ± SEM.

In whole-cell current-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings, TTX (0.5–1 µM) was used to eliminate the effect of presynaptic input, except when firing properties of motoneurons were studied. Low Na<sup>+</sup> extracellular solution was prepared by replacing NaCl with equivalent concentration of choline chloride. High-K<sup>+</sup> aCSF was prepared by adding 1 M KCl. The effect of extracellular pH on membrane current was examined by lowering pH with 1.0 N HCl solution. Drugs were purchased from the following sources: apamin (100 nM), 4-aminopyridine (2 mM), BAPTA (10 mM), barium (100–300 µM), cadmium chloride (100 µM), CTX (2 µg.ml<sup>−1</sup>), chelerythrine (10 µM), CNQX (10 µM), GDPßS (2 mM), [Hyp3]-Bk (2 µM), kynurenate (1.5 mM), pertussis toxin (PTX: 2 µg.ml<sup>−1</sup>), PKA 6–22 (10 µM), PKC 19–36 (10 µM), R 715 TFA (5 µM), tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA, 10 mM) from Sigma–Aldrich; AP-5 (20 µM), bradykinin (Bk, 0.01–16 µM), H89 (10 µM), Hoe 140 (2 µM), KN-93 (2 µM), Lys-[Des-Arg<sup>9</sup>]-Bk (2 µM), quinidine (200–400 µM), ruthenium red (RR, 10 µM), spantide (2–5 µM), tetrodotoxin citrate (TTX, 20 nM–1 µM), U73122 (10 µM), W-7 (100 µM), ZD7288 (20 µM) from Tocris (Bristol, UK). In most experiments, drugs were delivered via superfusion using a syringe pump. In some experiments, cells were loaded with BAPTA, GDPßS, or xestospongin C by passive diffusion from the patch pipette. In some experiments performed using the in vitro hemicord preparation, a pipette with a wide drip tip containing Bk was placed ∼25–50 µM upstream of the ventral horn. Leakage of the solution from the pipette was monitored by including neutral red in the intrapipette solution. This configuration restricts the application of drug to the ventral horn (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and avoids mechanical artifacts.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the French Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors present a thorough pharmacological and electrophysiological analysis of the direct effects of Bradykinin on motoneurons from rat neonatal spinal cord. The data set presented is extensive and the experiments are carefully done. The writing is clear and the figures well designed. Most of the conclusions depend on pharmacological analysis and although the specificity of the drugs is in several cases not high the preponderance of the evidence and the multiple drugs used produce a substantive story. The major conclusion is that Bk acts directly on motor neurons to increase their excitability by activating B2 receptors. The evidence is further interpreted that Bk acts via the single PLC/InsP3/calcium signaling pathway to inhibit leak K<sup>+</sup> current (likely TWIK channels) and activate ICaN (likely thermo-TRP channels). These results have important implications for enhanced withdrawal reflexes seen in injury-induced hypernociception.</p><p>There are several concerns that must be addressed in revision before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) At several points, the authors speculate that the actions of Bk on motoneurons could influence hyperalgesic assessment methods. While this is not unreasonable, the experiments were all from neonatal rats and it is also possible that hyperalgesic responses and Bk effects on motoneurons might change with age. In addition, all experiments were conducted with the highest concentration of Bk (rather than the EC50). Are these Bk concentrations relevant to in vivo levels? Moreover, there is no evidence presented that stimulation of nociceptive afferents induces bradykinin-dependent sensitization of motoneurons. These limitations should be confronted as the impact of the work on hyperalgesic assessment is described.</p><p>2) The authors conclude, from the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, that Bk is acting directly on motoneurons. However, it is difficult (if not impossible) to exclude all other possible indirect mechanisms in whole slices. For instance, are Bk receptors expressed on glia? Are glia unresponsive to Bk applications? Given this, the authors should only state that the Bk effect is “likely” via a direct mechanism.</p><p>3) This work provides evidence that Bk can act directly on motor output, rather than indirectly via Substance P release. However, the effect of spantide on the Bk response was not shown and there is no positive control for this negative result. It would also be useful to see the effect of spantide in the hemisection experiments.</p><p>4) There is no clear demonstration that the effects of leak K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> are two separate effects. Unless this is clearly shown, this conclusion should be toned down.</p><p>5) There is a general concern that many of the conclusions are based on the use of compounds that are not entirely specific and act on other conductances. For example, the data implicating thermo-TRP channels are not entirely conclusive (e.g., based on effects of ruthenium red and lowered temperatures, both very non-specific), so that interpretation comes across as too definitive. Moreover the pharmacological implication of TWIK channels is also not iron clad. Perhaps the interpretation should simply be a Bk modulation of leak.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) The use of motor circuits in the Abstract, Introduction and Discussion is not appropriate. This study focuses on motoneurons and does not examine the effect of bradykinin on motor circuits.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) I really want to see the ramp currents and the ramp difference currents over the full voltage range employed.

While this is not unreasonable, the experiments were all from neonatal rats and it is also possible that hyperalgesic responses and Bk effects on motoneurons might change with age. In addition, all experiments were conducted with the highest concentration of Bk (rather than the EC50). Are these Bk concentrations relevant to in vivo levels? Moreover, there is no evidence presented that stimulation of nociceptive afferents induces bradykinin-dependent sensitization of motoneurons. These limitations should be confronted as the impact of the work on hyperalgesic assessment is described</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the neonatal response is not necessarily a weak form of that found in the adult; rather than a targeted flexion of the paw, the hyperalgesic response in neonatal rats consists of unspecified body movements (Teng and Abott, 1998; Pain, 1998 Jun;76(3):337-47). There is evidence that the postnatal maturation of hyperalgesia arises from fine-tuning of the pain circuitry with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fitzgerald, 2005</xref>; Nat Rev Neurosci. 2005 Jul;6(7):507-20.). It seems therefore possible that Bk actions might undergo marked postnatal changes. This potential developmental complication is now mentioned in the last part of the Discussion. The referee is correct that there is no direct evidence demonstrating that the Bk-dependent sensitization of motoneurons influences the withdrawal reflex. We now clearly stipulate that the influence for Bk in hyperalgesic assessment methods at the level of motoneurons remains to be substantiated.</p><p>In the framework of our investigation, saturating concentrations were used to activate all the Bk receptors on the motoneurons. Whether the Bk concentrations used have any physiological role is at present unclear; it is likely that, like other peptides, Bk normally acts at lower concentrations.</p><p><italic>2) The authors conclude, from the experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, that Bk is acting directly on motoneurons. However, it is difficult (if not impossible) to exclude all other possible indirect mechanisms in whole slices. For instance, are Bk receptors expressed on glia? Are glia unresponsive to Bk applications? Given this, the authors should only state that the Bk effect is “likely” via a direct mechanism</italic>.</p><p>Given the presence of B2 receptors on motoneurons, and all of the effects of Bk are blocked by B2 antagonists, it is very unlikely that there are no direct effects whatsoever of Bk on these neurons. However, it cannot be completely ruled out that bath-applied Bk activates glial cells, resulting in the release of an unknown chemical substance which acts on motoneurons to elicit additional indirect effects. Microglial cells express functional Bk receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Noda et al. 2003</xref>;Life Sci. 2003 Feb 21;72(14):1573-81; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ifuku et al., 2007</xref>; J Neurosci. 2007 Nov 28;27(48):13065-73) and Bk can act as a neuron-glia signaling molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heblich et al., 2001</xref>; J Physiol. 2001 Oct 1;536(Pt 1):111-21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parpura et al., 1994</xref>; Nature, 1994 Jun 30;369(6483):744-7). The potential cross-link between neuron and glial cells is now clearly described in the Discussion and the references are added (see subsection headed “Functional evidence of a role for K2P and TRP channels”). Furthermore, as requested by the reviewer we soften throughout the manuscript our conclusions on a direct postsynaptic effect of Bk.</p><p><italic>3) This work provides evidence that Bk can act directly on motor output, rather than indirectly via Substance P release. However, the effect of spantide on the Bk response was not shown and there is no positive control for this negative result. It would also be useful to see the effect of spantide in the hemisection experiments</italic>.</p><p>The inability of spantide to block the Bk effect is now illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>. As a positive control, we refer to Yanagisawa and Otsuka’s study in Br. J. Pharmacol (1990) where they demonstrate in neonatal rat lumbar motoneurons that spantide, used at the same concentration that we used, significantly depressed the response to substance P but not those to glutamate, noradrenaline and GABA; this is now referenced (see subsection entitled “Bradykinin depolarizes lumbar motoneurons through a likely direct postsynaptic activation”). As requested by the reviewer, we performed additional experiments with spantide in the hemispinal cord preparation. Similar to Bk responses recorded intracellularly from motoneurons, the motor output induced by Bk and recorded extracellularly from ventral roots is not affected by spantide. These new data are now added in the manuscript (see the aforementioned subsection) and illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) There is no clear demonstration that the effects of leak K</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>and Na</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>are two separate effects. Unless this is clearly shown, this conclusion should be toned down</italic>.</p><p>There may be a misunderstanding on this point. The effects on the leak K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> currents are blocked by different pharmacological agents. However, we believe that the two ionic mechanisms are synergistic: the depolarizing effect of the Na<sup>+</sup> current will be enhanced by the simultaneous reduction of a resting K<sup>+</sup> conductance. This synergistic effect is now clearly explained in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>5) There is a general concern that many of the conclusions are based on the use of compounds that are not entirely specific and act on other conductances. For example, the data implicating thermo-TRP channels are not entirely conclusive (e.g., based on effects of ruthenium red and lowered temperatures, both very non-specific), so that interpretation comes across as too definitive. Moreover the pharmacological implication of TWIK channels is also not iron clad. Perhaps the interpretation should simply be a Bk modulation of leak</italic>.</p><p>We agree that, due to the nonspecificity of the available pharmacological agents, it is difficult to determine which type of channels are activated by Bk. To meet the reviewers’ request: 1) We have completely rewritten the Results section by focusing on the nature of conductances without referring to putative channels involved. 2) The discussion about the putative channels involved has been amended to avoid any too definitive conclusion.</p><p><italic>Minor comments</italic></p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The use of motor circuits in the Abstract, Introduction and Discussion is not appropriate. This study focuses on motoneurons and does not examine the effect of bradykinin on motor circuits</italic>.</p><p>As requested, “motor circuits” has been changed to “motoneurons”.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) I really want to see the ramp currents and the ramp difference currents over the full voltage range employed.

Is the I</italic><sub><italic>CaN</italic></sub> <italic>really voltage insensitive? I would also like some discussion of how the two currents affected by Bk give rise to the overall decrease in Rin</italic>.</p><p>We have now added the ramp currents with the I/V curves in all relevant figures.</p><p>The I<sub>CaN</sub> investigated in our study is itself voltage insensitive, at least in the voltage range investigated. Whether the current shows an indirect voltage sensitivity depends on whether it is normally activated by calcium entry from voltage-activated calcium channels a, as we previously studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouhadfane et al., 2013</xref>). However, this mechanism is not involved in the present study as cadmium block of voltage-activated calcium channels did not affect the Bk-induced depolarization. Our work suggests that voltage-independent release of calcium from internal stores is responsible for activation of I<sub>CaN</sub> in response to Bk.</p><p>The overall increase in input resistance we observe during Bk application reflects the sum of the two currents activated, a conductance decrease to K<sup>+</sup> and a conductance increase to Na<sup>+</sup>. We were initially surprised to fail to measure the conductance increase to the isolated Na<sup>+</sup>-mediated current. This may reflect a predominantly dendritic location of I<sub>CaN</sub>, where their influence on soma resistance would be difficult to measure. Consistent with this interpretation, our calcium imaging experiments suggest that Bk causes significantly greater rises of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the dendrites than the soma. In addition, the B<sub>2</sub> receptors have been found primarily in the peripheral processes of motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lopes et al., 1995</xref>; Neuroscience. 1995 Oct;68(3):867-81). These points are now discussed (see Discussion section).</p><p><italic>2) I would have liked to see how each of the drugs used in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>affected the two different current components</italic>.</p><p>Such investigation would be interesting to replicate after isolating the two ionic components. However, both currents were mimicked by B2 (and not B1) agonists, and blocked by a B2 antagonist. In addition, most of the drugs used, particularly GDPßS, U73122 and W-7, almost abolish the total response to Bk suggesting that both ionic components are affected. It is likely that B<sub>2</sub> receptors activate a single intracellular pathway (PLC/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/InsP3/calmodulin) which, in turn, simultaneously modulates the two components.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) It is unclear what the relevance is of comparing calcium responses in the dendrites versus soma? Are intracellular calcium stores primarily located in the soma, not the dendrites (where the more robust calcium response was observed)?</italic></p><p>Intracellular calcium stores are not only found in the soma. The structural and molecular apparatus for Intracellular calcium stores is known to be present in dendrites (Sharp et al. 1993; J Neurosci. 1993 Jul;13(7):3051-63 ; Spacek and Harris, 1997; J Neurosci. 1997 Jan 1;17(1):190-203.). In addition, the contributions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores to dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients following synaptic activation has been previously observed (Alford et al., 1993, J. Physiol. (Lond), 469 (1993), pp. 693–716; Emptage et al., 1999, Neuron. 1999 Jan;22(1):115-24). Comparing calcium responses in the dendrites and the soma gave us important insights. First, the greater increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in dendrites compared to the soma suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated channels will be more affected in dendrites and thus may act to modify the integration of synaptic inputs of motoneurons. Second, the propagating wave of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> initiated at the dendrites before the soma is consistent with the location of B<sub>2</sub> receptors in the peripheral processes of motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lopes et al., 1995</xref>; Neuroscience. 1995 Oct;68(3):867-81), and suggests that the Bk response arises initially in the dendrites.
