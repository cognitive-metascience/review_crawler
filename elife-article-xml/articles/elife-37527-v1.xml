The study of post-mortem brains of nonhuman primates (NHPs) has been limited and often does not recapitulate important species-specific developmental hallmarks. We utilize induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to investigate the development of cortical pyramidal neurons following migration and maturation of cells grafted in the developing mouse cortex. Our results show differential migration patterns in human neural progenitor cells compared to those of chimpanzees and bonobos both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting heterochronic changes in human neurons. The strategy proposed here lays the groundwork for further comparative analyses between humans and NHPs and opens new avenues for understanding the differences in the neural underpinnings of cognition and neurological disease susceptibility between species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurodevelopment</kwd><kwd>neuronal function</kwd><kwd>chimpanzee</kwd><kwd>non human primate</kwd><kwd>neuroprogenitor migration</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Project Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marchetto</surname><given-names>Maria C</given-names></name><name><surname>Muotri</surname><given-names>Alysson R</given-names></name><name><surname>Padmanabhan</surname><given-names>Krishnan</given-names></name><name><surname>Gage</surname><given-names>Fred H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muotri</surname><given-names>Alysson R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pathway to independence award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Padmanabhan</surname><given-names>Krishnan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009670</institution-id><institution>National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Padmanabhan</surname><given-names>Krishnan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007028</institution-id><institution>Leona M. and Harry B.

The increase in the cranial capacity in fossil hominins has been tied to behavioral changes, including the appearance of the first stone tools and their subsequent elaboration, increases in population size, and the spread of hominins into ecologically challenging habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambrose, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stout, 2011</xref>). Equally important were the subtle changes in brain organization at the microscopic level. While these changes cannot be inferred directly from the fossil specimens, comparative analyses of cortical organization between extant primate species suggest that the human brain indeed differs from the brain of other hominid species in several important microstructural aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Semendeferi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Semendeferi et al., 2011</xref>). One of these is the dendritic morphology of cortical pyramidal neurons, which differs between humans and the common chimpanzee (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2013a</xref>). Since cortical pyramidal neurons represent the most common type of neuron in the cortex and form basic units of cortical microcircuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeFelipe and Fariñas, 1992</xref>), comparative analyses directed specifically at pyramidal neurons can yield insights into the organization of the microcircuitry that is typical of each species.</p><p>Differences observed in the adult phenotype between humans and chimpanzees likely reflect differences in timing and/or rate of cortical development. Developmental differences between species represent an important component in evolutionary studies, as small changes in the timing of development translate into morphological differences in adulthood, often with important functional implications. In the case of human brain evolution, sequential hypermorphosis, a type of heterochrony characterized by prolongation of all stages of brain development compared to the ancestral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McNamara, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vrba, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKinney, 2002</xref>), has been proposed as an evolutionary mechanism underlying cerebral expansion in humans. Humans and apes share a pattern of prolonged postnatal growth in brain size that sets them apart from Old World monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leigh, 2004</xref>). Similarly, the maturation of pyramidal neurons appears to be protracted in hominids compared to macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cupp and Uemura, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petanjek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sedmak et al., 2018</xref>) and in humans compared to chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Teffer et al., 2013</xref>), possibly accounting for longer and more branched dendrites with higher numbers of dendritic spines in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchi et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petanjek et al., 2008</xref>). Because there is little evidence that the simple addition or subtraction of genes is sufficient to explain the observed differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill and Walsh, 2005</xref>), changes in the regulation (levels and patterns of expression) of genes shared between humans and chimpanzees have been proposed to play an important role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">King and Wilson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Enard et al., 2002</xref>). In particular, the expression of genes relevant to developmental events such as migration and dendritic maturation in pyramidal neurons can provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms shaping the differences in the organization of neuronal networks observed in humans and other primates.</p><p>Although studies using post-mortem brains from human and NHPs have provided important insights into developmental differences across species, the availability of specimens often limits the extent of the hypotheses that can be addressed. Recent advances in somatic reprogramming technology make comparative studies possible even in the absence of post-mortem specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marchetto et al., 2013</xref>). The work presented here specifically addresses neural progenitor cell (NPC) migration and the development and functional maturation of cortical neurons in humans and chimpanzees. While changes in neural migration and cortical layering may pathologically affect early dendritic organization and microcircuitry formation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pramparo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reiner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muraki and Tanigaki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennand et al., 2015</xref>), previous research has not examined migration and early development of pyramidal neurons from an evolutionary perspective. We therefore hypothesized that the neurodevelopmental differences between humans and chimpanzees would become visible during distinct processes of NPC migration and during the initial establishment of the organization of dendritic trees and functional neuronal maturation in the neocortex. To test this hypothesis, we utilized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to model NPC migration in <italic>Homo</italic> and <italic>Pan spp.</italic> (chimpanzee and bonobo) and in the early development of cortical neurons.</p><p>We found differential migration patterns in human NPCs compared to those of chimpanzee and bonobo based on RNA expression profile analysis and live-cell imaging. Next, we observed morphological and functional developmental differences between human and chimpanzee neurons, suggesting differences in the timing of neuronal maturation between the two species. We report here in vitro and in vivo comparative analyses of the neural development of two closely related primate species. The strategy applied in this work can be utilized for further studies addressing human brain evolution and the mechanisms underlying the cellular and molecular aspects that are unique to the human brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis of the expression profiles of human, chimpanzee and bonobo NPCs shows differentially regulated genes related to cell migration</title><p>Fibroblasts from chimpanzees (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>), bonobos (<italic>Pan paniscus</italic>) and humans (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) were reprogrammed to their pluripotent state as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennand et al., 2015</xref>) and then differentiated into NPCs. Briefly, we initiated neural differentiation by plating neuralized embryoid bodies (EBs) for a week until neural rosettes became apparent in the dish. Dissociated rosettes formed a homogeneous population of NPCs that continued to proliferate in the presence of the mitogen FGF2 and were positive for the pan-neural progenitor marker Nestin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and cortical neural progenitor markers Pax6 and Foxg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). To determine whether there was a difference in cortical layer identity between species at the population level, we performed single cell RNA sequencing on NPCs derived from a human, bonobo, or chimpanzee sample. The results revealed that each species had similar proportions of cortical markers, indicating that within the cortical-fated cells there was no enrichment for any given layer between the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>, see Materials and methods for details).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37527.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human (<italic>Homo</italic>), chimpanzee and bonobo (<italic>Pan</italic>) iPSCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme showing the main steps and timeline involved in the generation of NPCs from iPSCs.

Although cells from all species showed periods of slow migration (between 0 μm /min and 1 μm /min), only chimpanzee and bonobo NPCs had periods of rapid migration (1.25 μm /min to 2.5 μm /min). As a result, the distribution of speed for chimpanzee and bonobo NPCs had a heavy tail corresponding to these periods of rapid migration. To compare the speed profiles across the three species, we first calculated the cumulative distance covered by each cell and the mean cumulative distance covered for each species and calculated the migration speed per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). The distribution of migration speed of cells from the three species differed, with human NPCs moving significantly more slowly than either chimpanzee or bonobo NPCs (mean migration speed: human = 0.46 ± 0.19 μm /min, chimpanzee = 0.70 ± 0.31 μm /min, bonobo = 0.72 ± 0.35 μm /min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

We measured the distance that NPCs migrated radially from a plated neurosphere. We compared outgrowth from human-, chimpanzee- and bonobo-derived spheres generated by culturing NPCs in non-adherent conditions for 48 hr and then plating them on coated plates, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delaloy et al., 2010</xref>).

We did not observe significant differences between species, even though the migration distances covered by human NPCs were significantly shorter than the distances covered by NHP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K–M</xref>). In conclusion, individual NHP NPCs reached higher instantaneous speeds, had higher migration speeds and migrated further than human NPCs. Taken together, differences in migration speed and neurosphere outgrowth demonstrated that human NPCs migrated more slowly in vitro than chimpanzee and bonobo NPCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Differential migration properties in human compared to chimpanzee NPCs in vivo</title><p>We then asked if the difference seen in the migration speeds was influenced by the in vitro culture conditions or represented a <italic>bona fide</italic> difference in underlying developmental programs that have changed during evolution.

Chimpanzee and human NPCs expressed different fluorescent markers (GFP and TdTomato) and were mixed together at a 1:1 ratio prior to transplantation.

Once again, chimpanzee NPCs showed an increase in area coverage and distance traveled from injection site. In summary, our data show that chimpanzee and bonobo NPCs migrated faster and covered longer distances than human NPCs, independent of culture conditions.

The cells stopped dividing and neural processes became apparent in the dish.

We reveal that the species-specific differences in migration remain preserved after NPC grafting into the mouse cortex, suggesting a strong cell-autonomous effect. Further molecular and mechanistic analyses should address the question of which specific genes – or pathways – underlie the observed differences in migration between the two species. The observation of differential gene expression, carries implications that extend beyond evolutionary studies, since differential expression of genes related to cell migration and aberrant in vitro cell migration has been reported in NPCs derived from patients with neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennand et al., 2015</xref>). Our results support the notion that NPC migration is a tightly regulated process in primates, and changes in features related to this process are correlated with alterations in fetal cortical neurogenesis and, potentially, pathogenesis. Recently, Otani et al. showed that the level of individual cortical progenitor cell clonal output in primates is also regulated cell autonomously, opening the possibility for comparative in vitro studies using human and NHP NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Otani et al., 2016</xref>). This approach will be essential to help define the neurodevelopmental pathways that shaped human uniqueness and whose disruption is likely to contribute to neural developmental disorders.</p><p>One important consideration when modeling neurodevelopment in a dish with iPSC-derived cells is to have relevant milestones recapitulated in a defined cellular type. For the CNS, not only is the neuronal subtype relevant, but extrinsic factors also play a crucial role in the neuronal maturation. To overcome this limitation and to take advantage of a neutral in vivo setting, we engrafted iPSC-derived NPCs into mouse brains, using the rodent cortex as a scaffold for neuronal development. By analyzing the change in the morphology of transplanted neurons over time, it was possible to investigate neurodevelopmental aspects of two distinct primate species exposed to the same in vivo environment (mouse cortex). Our focus was specifically on the morphology of pyramidal neurons. Although pyramidal neurons represent a morphological class of neurons with different functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chagnac-Amitai et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connors and Gutnick, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mainen and Sejnowski, 1996</xref>), we have adhered to the morphological definition of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeFelipe and Fariñas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nieuwenhuys, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spruston, 2008</xref>), which, combined with the quantification of neuronal morphology as utilized in post-mortem studies, enabled a direct comparison of our findings with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petanjek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mrzljak et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mrzljak et al., 1992</xref>). Our findings suggest that transplanted human and chimpanzee progenitors can differentiate into neurons, with the morphology typical of pyramidal cells, and can display patterns of development similar to those documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mrzljak et al., 1988</xref>). At the same time, iPSC-derived neurons from the two species can also display differences in the timing of certain developmental events, suggesting the role of cell-autonomous developmental programs typical of each species.</p><p>The differences in neuronal development between <italic>Homo</italic> and <italic>Pan</italic> are often examined in the context of changes in timing or rate (i.e., heterochronic changes) of specific developmental events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vrba, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKinney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leigh, 2004</xref>). The present study supports this approach by identifying three distinct processes – NPC migration, dendritic development, and functional maturation of neurons – that also display differences in timing of their development in humans compared to the <italic>Pan</italic> species analyzed. Previous reports comparing human, chimpanzee and macaque post-mortem brain expression profiles reported that the most prominent human-specific expression changes during development affected genes associated with synaptic functions, representing an extreme shift in the timing of synaptic development in the human prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Somel et al., 2009</xref>). A more specific focus on one developmental parameter, coupled with gene expression studies, could reveal a more consistent pattern, especially if applied to a larger number of species. In addition to their evolutionary importance for specifying species-specific features, early developmental events are important for understanding the neuroanatomical changes observed in neurodevelopmental disorders, since pathologies in dendritic organization tend to appear during the initial establishment of dendrites in Down syndrome, Rett syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, and Fragile X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marin-Padilla, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belichenko et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hutsler and Zhang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irwin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Thus, in the present study we have observed several patterns that are largely in accordance with heterochrony, a mechanism previously suggested to underlie changes in human brain size and organization during its evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vrba, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKinney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leigh, 2004</xref>). Focusing specifically on the morphology of dendrites, post-mortem studies have suggested that the dendrites of human pyramidal neurons in adulthood are longer and more branched and have a higher number of dendritic spines compared to the same class of neurons in the chimpanzee neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchi et al., 2013b</xref>). The analysis of dendritic development of pyramidal neurons in the two species using iPSC-derived neurons suggested that the observed difference in adulthood might be a consequence of differences in the early development between humans and chimpanzees. As our results suggest, dendrites on human neurons are initially shorter and less branched and have fewer dendritic spines compared to the dendrites of chimpanzee iPSC-derived neurons. At one point in development -- ranging from six weeks for MSL and eight weeks for TDL and DSN -- dendrites on human iPSC-derived neurons enter a rapid growth and surpass the chimpanzee iPSC-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L–N</xref>), suggesting the possibility of late initiation of dendritic growth in humans.</p><p>The morphological findings are supported by the analysis of neuronal function. The human neurons in culture also displayed functional developmental delay compared to chimpanzee and bonobo neurons, with human neurons showing increased firing rates and neuronal bursts at later time points. Interestingly, we observed a similar time window (between four and five weeks) wherein human neuronal developmental parameters surpass NHPs in both in vivo and in vitro analyses (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L and N</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Our results suggest the presence of cell-autonomous characteristics of neuronal maturation in humans that are different from those of chimpanzees and bonobos and support the idea that developmental delay in humans results in increased neuronal complexity (increased dendritic length, spine density) and neuronal function (increased firing rates and network bursts) at later time points during maturation.</p><p>As soft tissue remains scarce in human developmental and evolutionary neuroanatomy studies, the novel strategy we present here - combining the use of iPSC technology with in vitro analysis of cell migration and in vivo grafting - offers a paradigm aimed at elucidating the genetic underpinnings of the observed changes and the evolutionary timing of human emergence and suggests further implications for the evolution of cortical microcircuitry across different primate clades.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell line statement</title><p>Fibroblasts from three human subjects (WT126, WT33, Adrc40), two chimpanzees (PR00818 and PR01209), two bonobos (PR01086 and AG05253), were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies (La Jolla, CA) and differentiated into neural progenitor cell as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marchetto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marchetto et al., 2010</xref>).

To confirm that the filling-in process after scratch assay was due to NPCs migrating toward the scratch rather than simply a random walk process we calculated two features for each NPC: 1) cumulative distance travelled (CDT) and 2) distance difference (DD) metric. NPCs with a CDT shorter than a quarter of the viewing area were not included in the calculations to prevent bias from non-migrating cells. The DD metric measures the net displacement (path independent) either toward (0 to positive infinity, µm) or away (0 to negative infinity, µm) from the scratch. All the migration paths were plotted with respect to the center of the scratch, denoted with a gray line.

To observe the temporal sequence of neuronal development, the mice were sacrificed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 19 weeks post-transplantation and the morphology of the transplanted cells differentiated into pyramidal neurons was quantified at each of the time points (see scheme on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We chose to focus specifically on pyramidal neurons since they are easy to identify based on their morphology, they represent the most common type of neuron in the cortex, and differences in dendritic organization have previously been reported between the two species under study, namely humans and the common chimpanzee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2013a</xref>). The time period under study spans the time points at which, based on post-mortem studies in humans, pyramidal neurons in the cortex commence their post-natal development and accomplish most of their growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marin-Padilla, 1970</xref>). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Salk Institute for Biological Studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>At 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 19 weeks PST, animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brain samples were dissected and post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 18 hr and equilibrated in 30% sucrose at 4°C. Coronal sections of 40 µm thickness were prepared for samples from one-, two- and four-week PST brains. As the dendrites became too large to be contained within 40 µm sections, samples from 6-, 8- and 19 week PST brains were prepared at 80 µm using a sliding microtome. Tissue was mounted onto glass microscope sides with glycerol mounting medium with DAPI. The sections were immunostained with the antibodies GFP (1:400, Molecular probes) and TdTomato (1:400, LifeSpan Biosciences, Inc) to increase the signal of human and chimpanzee transplanted neurons. CTIP2 antibody (1:200, Abcam) and SATB2 (1:200, Abcam) were used to characterize cortical layer identity of the transplanted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantification of neuronal morphology</title><p>The analysis of neuronal morphology was conducted on transplanted cells located in the cortex and within the callosal white matter. Only the neurons that were relatively isolated from other neurons or neuronal clusters and had a fluorescent signal strong enough to allow for accurate tracings were included in the analysis. In addition, the analyzed neurons had to display distinct pyramidal-shaped somata co-stained with DAPI, at least one dendrite emerging from the soma, and dendritic trees that were free from obvious signs of cutting- or other processing-related damages. Dendritic morphology was quantified along x, y, and z coordinates using 'Live Image' option on Neurolucida v.10 software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) interfaced with Nikon Eclipse E600 using a Plan Fluor 40x/1.30 oil lens. In accordance with other studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petanjek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacobs et al., 2001</xref>) and chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchi et al., 2013b</xref>), we conducted dendritic tree analysis with the following variables: soma size (SOMA), the surface area of the cell body; total dendritic length (TDL), the summed length of all dendrites/neuron; tree number (TREE), the total number of dendritic trees/neuron; dendritic segment count (DSC), the number of dendritic segments per neuron; dendritic spine number (DSN), the total number of dendritic spines/neuron; and dendritic spine density (DSD), the average number of spines/1 µm of dendritic length. Dendritic segments were assigned numbers following a centrifugal ordering scheme. The segments closest to the soma were termed first order segments; those after the first branching point were second order segments, with segment order increasing after each branching point. Neuronal morphology was quantified from a total of 141 neurons, encompassing 75 chimpanzee and 66 human cells, that is between 6 and 18 cells per species for each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Confocal imaging</title><p>Fixed, unstained brain sections were imaged using confocal microscopy. Images were acquired with the 63x or 100x objectives on a Zeiss LSM 710 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. Confocal microscopy images were taken from representative images of neurons after morphometric analysis was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Multielectrode array analysis (MEA)</title><p>Using the 96-well MEA plate from Axion Biosystems, we plated cells derived from four humans, two chimpanzees and two bonobos (two clones from each line) and we repeated the experiment three times. Each well was seeded with 15,000 NPCs that were induced into neuronal differentiation as described previously and summarized on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Each well was coated with poly-ornithine and laminin prior to cell seeding. Cells were fed three times a week and measurements were taken before media changes. Recordings were performed in a Maestro MEA system and AxIS software (Axion Biosystems) using a bandwidth with a filter for 10 Hz to 2.5 kHz cutoff frequencies. Spike detection was performed using an adaptive threshold set to 5.5 times the standard deviation of the estimated noise on each electrode. Each plate rested for 10 min for acclimatization in the Maestro instrument and then was recorded for an additional 10 min to calculate spike and burst rates. Multi-electrode data analysis was performed using the Axion Biosystems Neural Metrics Tool, and an active electrode was considered once five spikes occurred over the period of 1 min (five spikes/min). Bursts were identified in the data recorded from each individual electrode using an adaptive Poisson surprise algorithm. Network bursts were identified for each well, using a non-adaptive algorithm requiring a minimum of 10 spikes with a maximum inter-spike interval of 100 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was conducted using PRISM software (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA). Morphometric and neuronal functional variables between the species were examined with unpaired t-tests for each time point. Where appropriate, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U and Student’s t-test post-hoc analysis was performed with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, and the p-values presented are those of the corrected values. Linear regression analysis was performed for respective variables (morphometric measurements) correlated with weeks (time) post transplantation. Statistical significance was determined with Pearson’s correlation test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source for bulk and single cell RNA-seq data sets are available with GEO accession code GSE124706.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants MH095741, MH088485, DP2-OD006495-01, R01MH094753, R01MH103134, R01MH100175, K99MH101634, and U19MH107367; the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) TR2-01814 and TR4-06747; a NARSAD Independent Investigator award, The G Harold and Leila Y Mathers Foundation, The Leona M. and Harry B Helmsley Charitable Trust, and JPB Foundation.

Fibroblasts from chimpanzee and bonobo were obtained from Coriell Institute and their use was approved by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, under permit number MA206206. Protocols describing the use of human iPSCs were previously approved by the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the Salk Institute Institutional Review Board. Authentication: Cell identity was confirmed by G-banding karyptyping and routine immunofloerescence assays. Primary antibodies used in this study to characterize the cell lines were: human Nestin (1:250, Chemicon cat# ABD69) and SOX2 (1:200, Santa Cruz cat# sc-17320), for neuroprogenitor cells, and Map2 (1:500, Abcam, cat# ab5392); GFP (1:500, Invitrogen, cat# A6455); and CTIP2 (1:200, Abcam, cat# ab18465), for neurons. Mycoplasma Contamination: All the lines have been tested negative for Mycoplasma contamination. We test all lines on a monthly basis using a mycoplasma detection kit that uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and can detect over 95% of commonly occurring mycoplasma species contaminating cell lines.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Species-specific maturation profiles of human, chimpanzee and bonobo neural cells&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript reporting on a comparative analysis of developmental milestones between human, chimpanzee and bonobo cortical-like neurons. The authors use iPSCs-drived neural progenitors cells (produced in vitro) to investigate aspects of neuronal migration and differentiations among these three species. They investigate these developmental processes both in vitro and upon transplantation of iPSC-NPCs in the developing mouse cerebral cortex, followed by analysis in vivo. The work illustrates a valid and novel approach for understanding aspects of human brain development that could not otherwise be studied. In this regard, the study will be informative to the field for understanding the evolution of the human brain, and, possibly its disease.</p><p>The central conclusion of the study is that chimpanzee and bonobo neurons display similar properties as it relates to neuronal migration and maturation (dendritic tree complexity, synapse numbers and timing of synaptogenesis) and differ from human NPCs (and neurons) in these developmental parameters.</p><p>Required revisions:</p><p>Below are main points of revision that reflect suggestions that were made and agreed upon by all three reviewers.</p><p>1) There are many protocols for generating dorsalized (cortical-like) progenitors. It is generally accepted that none produce homogenous populations of NPCs of only one type. It would be important to have some further characterization, ideally at the single cell level (i.e. by scRNA-seq), of the starting NPC population (sampled at the stage soon before transplantation) to clarify any differences in the composition of the transplanted pool of cells. Related to this, some iPS lines have intrinsic fate biases, and different densities of the cultures can lead to alternative fates, so a cortical fate must be validated and quantified. The Nestin and Tuj1 analysis simply confirms the presence of neural stem cells and neurons in culture.</p><p>2) Looking at the differentially expressed (DE) genes, numerous hits relate to hindbrain identity, suggesting significant biases during in vitro differentiation. As a result, the authors may be identifying forebrain versus non-forebrain cells. In line with this, Figure 1C-E show differentially expressed genes between human and pan. However, browsing the table of DE genes suggests a potentially problematic purity difference. 14 HOX genes are among the most significant DE genes and all show the same direction change (apparently up in pan according to the supplementary file). These genes are not expressed in the mammalian cortex, suggesting that the pan lines have a differentiation bias towards hindbrain or spinal cord fates. Without access to the full expression table, it is difficult to comment on how pervasive this issue is across all individuals versus a subset. However, this result raises a flag about the purity of the cells that needs to be addressed in order to understand whether the observed enriched gene categories relate to species differences or differences in cell purity.</p><p>3) The authors should make clear how many individuals were used for each experiment, and when statistical analyses are performed on technical replicates. This must be articulated explicitly, ideally with a table of individuals and lines that went into each experiment.</p><p>4) For the migration assay in vivo, it would be useful to have low magnification images of multiple sections to get a sense for the general distribution of cells within the section, relative to the site of injection and across animals.</p><p>5) The migration assays in Figure 2 and the microelectrode array assays do not have a control for the purity of cells entering the assay. Cells from different regions may have different migratory properties and functional maturation rates that could influence the observed phenotypes. Post-staining representative sections showing that comparable populations were analyzed would help alleviate these concerns.</p><p>6) In their transplantation experiments, the authors don't provide enough insights into the types of cells that are compared. The only evidence shown is immunohistochemistry for CTIP2, but that marker only identifies a subset of cortical neurons, and may be more broadly expressed beyond cerebral cortex. Further characterization of these cells post transplantation would solve this problem.</p><p>7) For the analysis of dendritic morphology, 3D reconstructions of dendritic arbors traced in their entirety in a volume of tissue would be very important. Adding images from multiple neurons would give the reader a better sense for the differences observed and their magnitude.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37527.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) There are many protocols for generating dorsalized (cortical-like) progenitors.

Specifically, we performed immunostaining to detect cortical protein expression on 4 human, 2 chimpanzee and 2 bonobo samples (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C). We calculated spatial enrichment of genes in <italic>Homo</italic> or <italic>Pan</italic> NPCs using <italic>brainImageR</italic> tool (Linker et al., 2018) and showed that genes upregulated in human NPCs exhibited similar regional enrichment to genes upregulated in <italic>Pan</italic> NPCs, indicating that the differences observed in bulk RNA sequencing are not influencing broad fate specification between NPCs from <italic>Homo</italic> versus <italic>Pan</italic> (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). We also performed single cell RNA sequencing on 1 human, 1 chimpanzee and 1 bonobo NPC line. The results from the new experiments revealed that each species had similar proportions of cortical markers, indicating that within the cortical-fated cells there was no particular preference for a given layer between the species.</p><p>We are providing the single cell RNA sequence data analysis as Author response images1 and 2. We would like to seek advice from the <italic>eLife</italic> editors and reviewers as to whether those images should be moved to the manuscript as additional supplementary figures.</p><p>Next, we will describe in detail the new experiments performed during the revision period to address validation and quantification of cortical fate:</p><p>1) We performed immunostaining on neural progenitor cells from humans and nonhuman primates (chimpanzees and bonobos) with 2 cortical progenitor markers suggested by the reviewers (FOXG1 and PAX6), followed by cell quantification. We detected similar percentages of PAX6- and FOXG1-positive cells in all species (updated new Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>2) We also assessed the bulk RNA-sequencing data from NPCs for developing brain regional signatures. Using <italic>brainImageR</italic> tool (Linker et al., 2018), we calculated the enrichment of each differentially expressed gene (described on Supplementary file 1) within tissues of the developing brain. Genes upregulated in human NPCs exhibited similar regional enrichment to genes upregulated in <italic>Pan</italic> (chimpanzee and bonobo) NPCs, indicating that the differences observed in bulk RNA sequencing were not influencing broad fate specification between NPCs from <italic>Homo</italic> versus <italic>Pan</italic> (new Figure 1—figure supplement figure 1).</p><p>3) To assess differences in cell purity, single-cell sequencing was performed using 10X platform on NPCs derived from a human, bonobo, or chimpanzee sample. We used progenitor cells from human and NHPs that were frozen at the same passage as the ones used for the transplantation experiments.</p><p>To determine whether there was a difference in the cortical layer identity between species, we referred to Molyneaux et al., 2007 for markers for each cortical layer: FOXO1, ECPN, LIX1, SYT9, S100A10, OMA1, LDB2, CRIM1, PCP4, RAC3, CITP2 and DIAP3 were used as markers for cortical layer Vb; LXN, FOXP2, DARPP32, and IGH6 for layer VI, <italic>RORB</italic>, CYP39A1, LHX2, UNC5D, GPR6, MEF2C, DTX4, CUX1, CUX2, KITL, and SVETL for layer II/III; and EN2, PAX2, EN1, ISL1, and LHX3 were included for hindbrain markers.

Our first goal was to assess whether HOX expression was indicative of differing hindbrain-specifying NPCs between the species. To answer this question, we first identified all NPCs expressing SOX2, ensuring their NPC identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>; left column-dashed circle). Within the SOX2-expressing cells we next identified expression of one of the top differentially expressed HOX genes, HOXA7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>; middle column-dashed circle). Importantly, the majority of SOX2-expressing NPCs in both the bonobo and chimpanzee samples expressed HOXA7 whereas not a single human NPC expressed HOXA7. This finding indicated that HOXA7 expression was not marking heterogeneity within the NPC population but, as noted in bulk RNA-sequencing, was specific to the <italic>Pan</italic> species.</p><p>We next asked whether HOXA7 expression was indicative of NPCs being differentially primed toward the hindbrain or spinal cord fates across species. Using PAX6 and EN2 as markers of cortical and hindbrain NPCs, respectively, we noted that HOXA7 cells preferentially also expressed PAX6 (bonobo = 6.0%, chimpanzee = 8.2%) in comparison to EN2 (bonobo = 0%, chimpanzee = 0.7%). Importantly, the existence of NPCs that were double positive for HOXA7 and PAX6 in bonobos and chimpanzees and the striking absence of HOXA7 expression in any human NPCs further supported that HOXA7 expression was an intrinsic characteristic of <italic>Pan</italic> NPCs, independent of regional identity.</p><p>To determine whether this finding that human and <italic>Pan</italic> NPCs were similarly specified to cortical and hindbrain fates, independent of HOX expression, we determined the proportion of NPCs expressing well-known cortical and hindbrain markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). SOX2 and NESTIN expression were used to identify NPCs; PAX6, NEUROD6 and TBR1 to identify cortical NPCs; and EN1, EN2, ISL1, and LHX3 to identify hindbrain NPCs. We identified similar proportions of all NPCs, cortical NPCs, and hindbrain NPCs in all species. This analysis further indicated that there was no detectable species-dependent bias in regional patterning.</p><p>Lastly, as mentioned in comment #1, we sought to determine whether there was a difference in the cortical layer identity between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We referred to Molyneaux et al., 2007 for markers for each layer. FOXO1, ECPN, LIX1, SYT9, S100A10, OMA1, LDB2, CRIM1, PCP4, RAC3, and DIAP3 were used as markers for cortical layer Vb; LXN, FOXP2, DARPP32, and IGH6 for layer VI, RORB, CYP39A1, LHX2, UNC5D, GPR6, MEF2C, DTX4, CUX1, CUX2, KITL, and SVETL for layer II/III; and EN2, PAX2, EN1, ISL1, and LHX3 were included for hindbrain markers. Again, each species showed similar proportions of layer markers, indicating that within the cortex there was also no particular preference for a given layer between the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>Together these results indicated that there was no substantial difference in broad fate specification between NPCs from human versus <italic>Pan spp</italic>.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37527.021</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Single cell analysis on human and <italic>Pan</italic> NPCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) T-SNE of NPCs from human (top; green), bonobo (middle; orange), and chimpanzee (bottom; red).

There were no significant differences in the percentage of cells expressing cortical markers between human and NHP NPCs prior to migration assays or MEA.</p><p>To evaluate if differential migratory properties were influenced by the presence of cells from other brain regions due to loss of cell purity during migration, we post-stained human and NHP cells after a neurosphere migration experiment, as suggested by the reviewer. We observed that the percentages of cells expressing cortical progenitor markers (ex. PAX6) and neuroblast migration markers (ex. doublecortin, DCX) were not significantly different between species, even though the migration distances covered by human NPCs were significantly shorter than the distances covered by NHP cells (updated Figure 2—figure supplement 1K, L and M).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In their transplantation experiments, the authors don't provide enough insights into the types of cells that are compared.

We have performed immunostaining markers of other upper cortical layers such as Satb2 (Layers II and III) and Cux1 (cortical layers II-IV) and have not seen any co-localization from either human or NHP cells. We have now updated Figure 4—figure supplement 1 (D) to include images showing lack of co-localization with SATB2 cortical marker.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For the analysis of dendritic morphology, 3D reconstructions of dendritic arbors traced in their entirety in a volume of tissue would be very important. Adding images from multiple neurons would give the reader a better sense for the differences observed and their magnitude.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point. As specified in the manuscript, we traced neurons in 3D using Neurolucidasoftware(MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT), as standard in neuroanatomical research. We added traced images from multiple neurons to the revised version of the manuscript (Figure 4—figure supplement 2J).</p></body></sub-article></article>
