Action potential firing of serotonin dorsal raphe neurons is driven via α1-adrenergic receptors (α1-A<sub>R</sub>) activation. Despite this crucial role, the ion channels responsible for α1-A<sub>R</sub>-mediated depolarization are unknown. Here, we show in mouse brain slices that α1-A<sub>R</sub>-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission is mediated by the ionotropic glutamate receptor homolog cation channel, delta glutamate receptor 1 (GluD1). GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels are constitutively active under basal conditions carrying tonic inward current and synaptic activation of α1-A<sub>R</sub>s augments tonic GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channel current. Further, loss of dorsal raphe GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels produces an anxiogenic phenotype. Thus, GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels are responsible for α1-A<sub>R</sub>-dependent induction of persistent pacemaker-type firing of dorsal raphe neurons and regulate dorsal raphe-related behavior. Given the widespread distribution of these channels, ion channel function of GluD1<sub>R</sub> as a regulator of neuronal excitability is proposed to be widespread in the nervous system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Serotonin is a chemical that allows cells to communicate in the nervous system of many animals. It is also particularly important in the treatment of mental health disorders: a large number of antidepressants work by preventing nerve cells from clearing away serotonin, therefore increasing the overall level of the molecule in the brain. Yet, exactly how serotonin is released remains unclear.</p><p>When a serotonin-producing cell is activated, a series of biochemical processes lead to the creation of an electric current that, ultimately, is required for the cell to release serotonin. This mechanism starts when the α1-adrenergic receptor, a protein at the surface of the cell, detects noradrenaline molecules. However, on its own, the α1-adrenergic receptor is unable to create an electric current: this requires ion channels, another type of protein which can let charged particles in and out of the cell. Here, Gantz et al. set out to determine the identity of the ion channel that allows noradrenaline signals to generate electrical activity in cells which can release serotonin.</p><p>Electrical and chemical manipulation of mouse brain slices revealed that an ion channel called delta-glutamate 1 was active in serotonin-producing cells exposed to noradrenaline. In fact, applying toxins that specifically blocked the activity of this channel also prevented the cells from responding electrically to noradrenaline.</p><p>Further experiments used mice whose serotonin-producing cells were genetically modified to turn off delta-glutamate 1. In turn, these animals showed anxiety-like behaviors, which could be consistent with a drop in serotonin levels. This is in line with previous human studies showing that patients with depression and other mental health conditions have mutations in the gene for delta-glutamate 1.</p><p>Taken together, these results give an insight into the electrical activity of serotonin-producing cells. Further work is now required to examine how changes in the gene that codes for delta-glutamate 1 ultimately affect the release of serotonin. This could potentially help to understand if certain individuals may not be able to properly produce this chemical. As many antidepressants work by retaining serotonin that is already present in the brain, this knowledge could ultimately help patients who do not currently respond to treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>delta glutamate receptor</kwd><kwd>serotonin</kwd><kwd>noradrenaline</kwd><kwd>alpha1-adrenergic receptor</kwd><kwd>leak current</kwd><kwd>G protein-coupled receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH Center on Compulsive Behaviors</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center on Compulsive Behaviors Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gantz</surname><given-names>Stephanie C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIADA000612</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gantz</surname><given-names>Stephanie C</given-names></name><name><surname>Moussawi</surname><given-names>Khaled</given-names></name><name><surname>Hake</surname><given-names>Holly S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In mouse brain slices, native delta glutamate receptors carry ionic current and underlie the α1-adrenergic receptor-mediated depolarization of dorsal raphe neurons that drives action potential firing in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent reports estimate that 1 in 5 adults worldwide are affected by a mental health disorder, with anxiety and depression being the most common affecting more than 260 million people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">GBD 2017 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2018</xref>). Most current pharmacotherapies to treat these disorders target serotonin receptors or serotonin clearance. The dorsal raphe nucleus is the largest serotonergic nucleus in the brain and the predominant source of central serotonin (5-HT). In vivo, tonic noradrenergic input to the dorsal raphe that activates Gα<sub>q/11</sub> protein-coupled α1-adrenergic receptors (α1-A<sub>R</sub>s) is required for 5-HT neurons to fire action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baraban and Aghajanian, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baraban et al., 1978</xref>) and release 5-HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clement et al., 1992</xref>). In dorsal raphe brain slices, synaptic activation of α1-A<sub>R</sub>s produces a slow membrane depolarization lasting tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshimura et al., 1985</xref>). Despite having a crucial role in regulating 5-HT neuron excitability, the ion channels responsible for the depolarization remain unknown.</p><p>Throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, activation of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> protein-coupled receptors (G<sub>q</sub>PCRs), namely metabotropic glutamate mGlu<sub>R</sub>s, muscarinic acetylcholine M1 (mACh<sub>R</sub>s), or α1-A<sub>R</sub>s produces slow, noisy inward currents. Multiple mechanisms have been reported to underlie the inward current including: inhibition of K<sup>+</sup> current (including leak, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated, and Kv7/M-current) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benson et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halliwell and Adams, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Madison et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shen and North, 1992</xref>), modulation of TTX-sensitive persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamada-Hanff and Bean, 2013</xref>), and activation of transient potential receptor canonical (TRPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2003</xref>), Na<sup>+</sup>-leak (NALCN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2009</xref>), or delta glutamate receptor-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ady et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benamer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The delta glutamate receptors, GluD1<sub>R</sub> and GluD2<sub>R</sub>, are mysterious members of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family in that they are not gated by glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lomeli et al., 1993</xref>).

Here, we used a combination of in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology and pharmacology with a CRISPR/Cas9 viral genetic strategy to determine that activation of α1-A<sub>R</sub>s in the dorsal raphe depolarizes neurons via GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channel conductance. We utilize the α1-A<sub>R</sub>-GluD1<sub>R</sub>-EPSC to explore conduction and biophysical properties of GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels, to ultimately glean a greater understanding of GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channel gating. Lastly, we demonstrate that functional deletion of GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels in the dorsal raphe produces an anxiogenic behavioral phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synaptic activation of α1-adrenergic receptors produces an EPSC</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings were made from dorsal raphe neurons in acute brain slices from wild-type mice at 35° C in the presence of NMDA<sub>R</sub>, AMPA<sub>R</sub>, Kainate<sub>R</sub>, GABA-A<sub>R</sub>, and 5-HT1A<sub>R</sub> antagonists. With cell-attached recordings, a train of 5 electrical stimuli (60 Hz), delivered to the brain slice via a monopolar stimulating electrode, produced firing in previously quiescent neurons, which was blocked by application of the α1-A<sub>R</sub> antagonist, prazosin (100 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The excitation produced 20±5 action potentials that lasted 9.0±3.0 s, with a latency of 650.6±0.1 ms from onset of stimulation to the first action potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-E</xref>). In whole-cell recording using a potassium-based internal solution, the same train of electrical stimuli produced prolonged action potential firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In voltage-clamp mode (V<sub>hold</sub> -65 mV), the same stimulation produced a slow and long-lasting (27.4±2.3 s, n=10) excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) that was eliminated by the application of prazosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Prazosin had no effect on basal whole-cell current (-3.8±3.4 pA, p=0.232, n=10, data not shown) indicating a lack of persistent inward current due to noradrenaline tone. On average, the duration of the α1-A<sub>R</sub>-EPSC was orders of magnitude longer than fast AMPA<sub>R</sub> channel-mediated EPSCs (~10<sup>3.5</sup>×) and ~18× longer than ‘slow’ 5-HT1A receptor-G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK)-dependent IPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gantz et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). To test whether α1-A<sub>R</sub>-EPSCs were dependent on G protein-signaling, recordings were made with an internal solution containing GDPβS-Li<sub>3</sub> (1.8 mM) in place of GTP. Disruption of G protein signaling with intracellular dialysis of GDPβS-Li<sub>3</sub> eliminated the α1-A<sub>R</sub>-EPSC within 5-20 mins post-break-in (p=0.004, n=9), whereas dialysis with LiCl alone had no effect on the amplitude of the α1-A<sub>R</sub>-EPSC (p=0.625, n=4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These findings demonstrate a cell-autonomous requirement of G protein signaling in the generation of the α1-A<sub>R</sub>-EPSC. Application of tetrodotoxin (1 μM) reversibly abolished the α1-A<sub>R</sub>-EPSC, demonstrating a dependence on presynaptic action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Disruption of the vesicular monoamine transporter with reserpine (1 μM) or removal of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> also eliminated the α1-A<sub>R</sub>-EPSC, indicating noradrenaline release is vesicular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Electrical stimulation evokes long-lasting action potential firing produced by an α1-adrenergic receptor-dependent EPSC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative traces of cell-attached recording where stimulation of the brain slice (5 stims at 60 Hz) produced action potential firing that was abolished by application of the α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin (100 nM).

Given the rich diversity of dorsal raphe neuron subtypes and subdivisions within the 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ren et al., 2018</xref>), future work will be needed to parse the behavioral role of GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels with subnuclei/subpopulation specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Metabotropic-ionotropic receptor crosstalk modulates ion channel function of GluD1<sub>R</sub></title><p>GluD<sub>R</sub> have been characterized as scaffold proteins or synaptic organizers, regulating LTD, endocytosis and trafficking of AMPA<sub>R</sub>, formation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and spine density, independent of ion conduction through the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fossati et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmid and Hollmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tao et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, NMDA<sub>R</sub> are known to signal through non-ionotropic or ‘metabotropic’ mechanisms where ion conduction is not required, to regulate LTD, AMPA<sub>R</sub> endocytosis, and spine morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dore et al., 2016</xref>). The ability of GluD<sub>R</sub>-channels to carry ionic current does not conflict with its known role as a synaptic organizer, but rather expands the similarities between NMDA<sub>R</sub> and GluD<sub>R</sub>.</p><p>The largest obstacle in advancing the understanding of the ionotropic nature of GluD<sub>R</sub> is the lack of known agonist and inability to gate the intact channel. The majority of studies have been performed on constitutively open mutant or chimeric channels. In domain-swapped chimeric channels, agonist binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of AMPA<sub>R</sub> or Kainate<sub>R</sub> opens the GluD<sub>R</sub>-channel pore and generates a substantial current, but the LBD of GluD<sub>R</sub> on the pore region of AMPA<sub>R</sub> or Kainate<sub>R</sub>-channels fails to generate current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmid et al., 2009</xref>). Two prior studies have demonstrated that in heterologous systems and brain slices, activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu<sub>R</sub>) produces an inward current carried by GluD1<sub>R</sub>- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benamer et al., 2018</xref>) or GluD2<sub>R</sub>-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ady et al., 2014</xref>), concluding that mGlu<sub>R</sub> activation triggers gating of GluD<sub>R</sub> channels. The congruous explanation of our results is that, in dorsal raphe neurons, GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels are functional and open under basal conditions, carrying subthreshold, tonic Na<sup>+</sup> current. Activation of α1-A<sub>R</sub>s, by exogenous agonist or synaptic release of noradrenaline modulates gating of GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels and excites dorsal raphe neurons by increasing tonic GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channel inward current.</p><p>In general, the kinetics of iGlu<sub>R</sub> synaptic currents are controlled by the lifetime of the receptor-agonist complex and the rate of desensitization and deactivation. The presence of ambient levels of glutamate and glycine along with slow desensitization activate NMDA<sub>R</sub> to produce a tonic inward current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sah et al., 1989</xref>). Our results demonstrate that GluD1<sub>R</sub> are functional ion channels, but whether they function as ligand-gated receptor-channels that open in response to a chemical signal, is not yet determined. What remains to be understood are the conditions that permit GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channel opening and why their activation has been largely elusive in heterologous expression systems. Reminiscent of times before the discovery of glycine as a necessary co-agonist at NMDA<sub>R</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson and Ascher, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kleckner and Dingledine, 1988</xref>), it may be that an endogenous agonist needed for gating is present in brain slices. Alternatively, it is possible GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels are gated by an intracellular factor or require expression of accessory or interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomita, 2010</xref>). Tonic activation of α1-A<sub>R</sub>s cannot explain the tonic inward current as α1-A<sub>R</sub> antagonism did not change basal whole-cell current.</p><p>The mechanism by which α1-A<sub>R</sub>s increase GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channel current also remains to be described and may be distinct from the tonic activation. It is well-established that G<sub>q</sub>PCRs, especially mGlu<sub>R</sub> and mACh<sub>R,</sub> bidirectionally change NMDA<sub>R</sub> and AMPA<sub>R</sub> ionic currents, producing the two major forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), in part through a variety of distinct postsynaptic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hunt and Castillo, 2012</xref>). To our knowledge, the duration of the α1-A<sub>R</sub>-EPSC (~27 s) is exceptional for any known synaptic current and more closely resembles the duration of short-term synaptic plasticity; for instance, endocannabinoid-mediated short-term depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lu and Mackie, 2016</xref>). Canonically, G<sub>q</sub>PCRs activate phospholipase C which hydrolyzes the integral membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol. PIP2 stabilizes Kv7 channels such that PIP2 hydrolysis following mACh<sub>R</sub> activation accounts for inhibition of M-current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suh and Hille, 2002</xref>). In contrast, PIP2 inhibits TRPV4 channels, such that G<sub>q</sub>PCR-dependent PIP2 depletion allows for TRPV4 channels to open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harraz et al., 2018</xref>). By the same signaling cascade, G<sub>q</sub>PCRs stimulate the production of the endocannabinoid, 2-AG, that can act directly on ion channels in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gantz and Bean, 2017</xref>). Thus, one possibility is that α1-A<sub>R</sub>s modulate GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels through membrane lipid signaling, involving PIP2, diacylglycerol, or 2-AG, as it can take tens-of-seconds to minutes for ion channels to recover from modulation by membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gantz and Bean, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suh and Hille, 2002</xref>). Alternatively, there may be direct modulation of GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels by G protein subunits or activation of protein kinase signaling cascades. The inclusion of the calcium-chelator BAPTA in the internal recording solution makes it unlikely that α1-A<sub>R</sub>s modulate GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels via IP<sub>3</sub> and calcium release from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoesch et al., 2004</xref>). Largely, it remains to be seen whether these intracellular signaling cascades, many of which are known to affect NMDA<sub>R</sub>- and AMPA<sub>R</sub>-channels, modify GluD<sub>R</sub>-channels.</p><p>In heterologous systems and constitutively open mutant GluD<sub>R</sub>-channels, the current reverses polarity around 0 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zuo et al., 1997</xref>), akin to AMPA<sub>R</sub>- and NMDAR-channels, while our results show E<sub>rev</sub> of ~ −30 mV. While slow voltage-ramps were employed to minimize space-clamp error, we cannot rule out that some of the difference may be attributed to space-clamp error in brain slices, especially since the magnitude of subtracted current is small relative to total membrane current at depolarized potentials. However, there are many reports of inward currents produced by activation of many different G<sub>q</sub>PCRs with reversal potentials between −40 and −23 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awad et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamada-Hanff and Bean, 2013</xref>) under different recording conditions; a commonality that is unlikely to be accounted for by space-clamp error alone. Tail current analysis revealed voltage-dependence of I<sub>NA</sub>, such that depolarization reduced conductance. These data may reflect block of GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels by endogenous intracellular polyamines, as established for calcium-permeable AMPA<sub>R</sub>- and Kainate<sub>R</sub>-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowie and Mayer, 1995</xref>). Another important consideration is that our measurements may be subject to voltage-dependence of the signaling pathway between α1-A<sub>R</sub>s and GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels. Taken together, measurements here should be considered an estimate of GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channels, and more precisely as the current-voltage relationship of the α1-A<sub>R</sub>s-GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channel signaling complex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Summary</title><p>In summary, the α1-A<sub>R</sub>-mediated depolarization of dorsal raphe neurons that drives action potential firing in vivo is carried by the mixed cation channel, GluD1<sub>R</sub>. Thus in addition to their role as a scaffold protein, GluD1<sub>R</sub> are functional ion channels that critically regulate neuronal excitability. Many of the biophysical properties of the GluD1<sub>R</sub>-channel are like other members of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family. Given the widespread distribution of these receptors throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hepp et al., 2015</xref>), ion channel function of GluD1<sub>R</sub> may be prevalent and relevant to neuronal excitability and circuit function in different parts of the throughout the nervous system. This study lays the foundation to investigate the ion channel function of GluD1<sub>R</sub> in excitatory G<sub>q</sub>PCR-dependent synaptic transmission and regulation of neuronal excitability, expanding upon the wealth of knowledge of pharmacology and regulatory elements established for NMDA<sub>R</sub> and AMPA<sub>R</sub> signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

VersaMax Analyzer software was used to determine the total distance traveled, time spent moving, and velocity of movement in the last 30 min of the session. The boxes were cleaned with 70% ethanol and allowed to dry between trials. The elevated-plus maze was used to assay anxiety-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walf and Frye, 2007</xref>). The apparatus (Med associates, Inc) was placed 30 cm above the floor and consisted of two plastic light gray open arms (30 × 5 cm) and two black enclosed arms (30 × 5 cm) extending from a central platform (5 × 5 × 5 cm) at 90 degrees. Following habituation to the brightly lit room, mice were placed individually in the center of the maze, facing an open arm. Video tracking EthoVision XT software (Noldus Information Technology) was used to track mouse location, total distance traveled, velocity of movement, body elongation, and entries and time spent into the open and enclosed arms for each 5 min trial. Duration of head-dips, grooming, and enclosed-arm rearing were scored manually from videos played a 0.5x speed. Rearing in the enclosed arm was often associated with pressing one or both forepaws to the wall. Stretched-attend postures was defined by body elongation (70% threshold) and movement velocity &lt;1 cm/s. No mice fell or jumped from the maze and open-arm rearing was not observed. The maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol after every trial and allowed to dry before the next trial. Mice were excluded from analysis if there was limited or no expression in the dorsal raphe, or if expression spread rostrally to the ventral tegmental area or caudally to locus coeruleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy</title><p>Following behavioral assays, mice were euthanized with Euthasol and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Brains were fixed overnight at 4 C and then sliced coronally in 50 μm sections. Alternatively, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by decapitation. Brains were removed and slices were prepared as for brain slice electrophysiology (220 μm), then fixed in room temperature 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 hr. Slices were mounted with Fluoromount-G with DAPI (Invitrogen) aqueous mounting medium. Confocal images were collected on an Olympus microscope (4x, 0.16 NA) and processed using Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis and visualization</title><p>Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.7. Data are presented as representative traces, or in scatter plots where each point is an individual cell, and bar graphs with means ± SEM. In traces with electrical stimulation, stimulation artifacts have been blanked for clarity. Unless otherwise noted, <italic>n</italic> = number of distinct cells or mice as biological replicates. No sample was tested in the same experiment more than once (technical replication). E<sub>rev</sub>s were determined by linear regression for each cell. Recordings in which current did not cross 0 pA were omitted from analysis. To minimize space-clamp errors, analysis of current during voltage ramps was limited to −10 mV where the currents were typically less than 500 pA. Ramp currents were averaged in 2 mV bins (20 ms). Data sets with n &gt; 30 were tested for normality with a Shapiro-Wilk test. When possible (within-group comparisons), significant differences were determined for two group comparisons by paired t-tests, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, and in more than two group comparisons by nonparametric repeated-measures ANOVA (Friedman test). Significant mean differences in between-group comparisons were determined for two group comparisons by Mann Whitney tests, and in more than two group comparisons by Kruskal-Wallis tests. ANOVAs were followed, when p&lt;0.05 by Dunn’s multiple comparisons post hoc test. Linear trends were analyzed using a mixed model ANOVA. A difference of p&lt;0.05 was considered significant. For behavioral assays, Grubbs test was used to identify outliers. Basal locomotion and time spent in stretched-attend posture from one <italic>Grid1</italic> mouse each were found to be outliers and were excluded from group comparisons. Exact values are reported unless p&lt;0.0001 or&gt;0.999. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program at the National Institute on Drug Abuse 1ZIADA000612 (SCG, HSH, KM) and the Center on Compulsive Behaviors, National Institutes of Health via NIH Director’s Challenge Award to SCG.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Olivier J Manzoni as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bertil Hille (Reviewer #2); Kevin J Bender (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study provides an elegant and convincing pharmacological and biophysical demonstration that the orphan δ glutamate receptor is responsible for α-Adrenergic receptor-mediated depolarization of dorsal raphe neurons. Astute genetic tools are used to show how a nanoscale alteration (cell type specific deletion of GluD in in the dorsal raphe) leads to macroscale disturbances (anxiogenic behaviors).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Improve the form of the manuscript (no experiments required; analysis and rewriting required):</p><p>1A) Abstract</p><p>The Abstract summarizes the principal point of the paper with &quot;We show that a1-AR-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission is mediated by δ glutamate receptors (GluD1<sub>R</sub>).&quot; To paraphrase, this sounds like &quot;The response mediated by receptor X is mediated by receptor Y,&quot; This sentence and possibly others like it do not do justice to the paper and should be improved. Clarify that the main and important discovery is that the a1-AR-mediated postsynaptic depolarization of raphe neurons results from the G-protein coupled modulation of a non-selective cation channel. This channel happens to be named δ glutamate receptor (GluD1<sub>R</sub>), but that may be a distracting misnomer. It may not be glutamate responsive, and is, so far, an orphan ionotropic receptor homolog that may not act as a receptor at all. It is an ion channel at least.</p><p>1B) Materials and methods:</p><p>– You say, &quot;With cell-attached recordings, a train of 5 electrical stimuli (60 Hz) produced firing in previously quiescent neurons.&quot;</p><p>Because this stimulation was key in demonstrating physiological effects it is important to clearly explain where or how the cell is stimulated (was a stimulus applied extracellularly to some other part of the slice?).</p><p>– The part about the preparation is written without references or detail as if everyone would know what was done already. Indeed, the whole Materials and methods section makes little reference to the literature except for a reference to noise analysis and one to how to generate AAV virus tools.</p><p>– Concentrations for the antagonists should be mentioned.</p><p>1C) Figures:</p><p>– Adding color in the figures would help readers.</p><p>– Some of the supplementary figures could easily be incorporated into the main figures, as they are important controls.

Clarify that the main and important discovery is that the a1-AR-mediated postsynaptic depolarization of raphe neurons results from the G-protein coupled modulation of a non-selective cation channel. This channel happens to be named δ glutamate receptor (GluD1<sub>R</sub>), but that may be a distracting misnomer. It may not be glutamate responsive, and is, so far, an orphan ionotropic receptor homolog that may not act as a receptor at all. It is an ion channel at least.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. As suggested, we have changed the Abstract to emphasize modulation of a non-selective cation channel. Through-out the text, we now refer to the ion channel as the “δ glutamate receptor-channel” or “GluD1<sub>R</sub> channel”, and “ionotropic function” has been changed to “ion channel function”. Lastly, we have stated in the Discussion that our study shows that GluD1<sub>R</sub> acts as an ion channel, but not necessarily a ligand-gated ionotropic receptor, in so far as the identify of a chemical messenger or ligand responsible for activation, if it exists, remains unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1B) Materials and methods:</p><p>– You say, &quot;With cell-attached recordings, a train of 5 electrical stimuli (60 Hz) produced firing in previously quiescent neurons.&quot;</p><p>Because this stimulation was key in demonstrating physiological effects it is important to clearly explain where or how the cell is stimulated (was a stimulus applied extracellularly to some other part of the slice?).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, all stimuli were applied via a monopolar electrode placed in the brain slice within 200 microns to the recorded neurons.

In the Discussion however the authors draw back from being sure that it is one channel and that there is space clamp.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively revised this Discussion paragraph. By our calculations using a reversal potential of -30 mV, and the shift in reversal potentials observed with changing extracellular potassium, we estimate the channel may be 2 to 3 times as permeable to potassium as sodium, now included in the Results.</p><p>Regarding the issue of space-clamp error, we feel it is important to acknowledge that recordings in brain slices can particularly susceptible to some space-clamp error, without careful consideration. In our study, all efforts were made to reduce space-clamp errors, including the use of slow voltage ramps (1 mV/10 mS) where data were binned every 20 ms. Voltage ramps were made from -120 to -10 mV where the size of the total membrane current was less than 500 pA. Further, we also used voltage steps (10 mV increments, 150 ms duration) to generate current-voltage plots of the current induced by exogenous noradrenaline, and obtained identical E<sub>rev</sub>s (data not shown in the manuscript). Thus, we do not believe that space-clamp error accounts for the difference in reports of reversal potential of constitutively open mutant GluD<sub>R</sub> channels (0 mV) and our data (~ -30 mV). These points are clarified in the revised text.</p><p>Regarding the issue of the one channel, the results following functional deletion of GluD1<sub>R</sub> indicate that the α1-A<sub>R</sub>-dependent <italic>inward</italic> current is carried completely by GluD1<sub>R</sub> channels. We have removed reference to inhibition of A-type potassium current by α1-A<sub>R</sub> activation (Aghajanian, 1985). While an important finding, the data from our study do not support involvement of A-type channels in the α1-A<sub>R</sub>-EPSC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The signal from the adrenergic receptor to the depolarizing channel is not yet specified.

In brief, it remains to be determined whether other GqPCRs augment GluD1<sub>R</sub> channel current. Brown et al., 2002 (cited in the manuscript) find that the α1-A<sub>R</sub>-dependent inward current occludes an inward current produced by activation of Gq-coupled histamine and orexin receptors. This suggests that these receptors may also be modulating GluD1<sub>R</sub> channels, but it has not yet been tested.</p><p>In regard to expression systems, Benamer et al., 2018, were able to measure mGluR-GluD1<sub>R</sub> current in HEK cells suggesting we may be able to reproduce our α1-A<sub>R</sub> phenomena in expression systems. Instead of expression systems, we will be working towards recordings from acutely dissociated dorsal raphe neurons to see if the tonic current requires brain slice work. This model will allow for better voltage control and high-throughput screening of drugs and then extend our findings to expression systems.</p><p>In regard to the mechanism, the inclusion of intracellular BAPTA in the recording solution makes it unlikely that α1-A<sub>R</sub>s are modulating GluD1<sub>R</sub> channels via IP<sub>3</sub>-Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Involvement of PIP2 hydrolysis to DAG, and the subsequent signaling cascade is a very viable possibility. The duration of the α1-A<sub>R</sub>s (on average 27s, but can persist up to 90s) is similar to time course of recovery (tens-of-seconds to minutes) of M-current inhibition following PIP2 hydrolysis and inhibition of A-type potassium current by 2-AG (citations in manuscript). Alternatively, there may be direct modulation by G protein subunits, activation of protein kinase signaling cascades (e.g. Arrestin-MEK-ERK, or PKC), or a combination of effectors, akin to GIRK channel gating by Gβγ subunits and PIP2. We feel to present the results comprehensively, they are best fleshed out in a full follow-up study. But these possibilities are now discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What explains the incomplete blockade by glycine+strychnine, D-Serine and Kynurenate? Additional a1-AR mediated but not GluD<sub>R</sub>-mediated mechanisms (although the elimination of a1-AR-EPSC by targeting of GluD1 receptors via CRISPR/Cas9 argues against this idea)? Non saturating doses of antagonists?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question. In other publications, there is never complete elimination of GluD<sub>R</sub> channel current at concentrations up to 10 mM. D-serine or glycine reduce GluD<sub>R</sub> channel current, with reports of near complete reduction of the <italic>Lurcher</italic> GluD2<sub>R</sub> mutant (~25% of the current remains, e.g. Naur et al., 2007) and wild type GluD2<sub>R</sub> (~35% of current remains, Ady et al., 2013) but partial reduction of mutant GluD1<sub>R</sub> (~50-60% of the current remains, Yadav et al., 2011) and wild type GluD1<sub>R</sub> (60% of the current remains, Benamer et al., 2018). The reductions we observe are consistent with these GluD1<sub>R</sub> reports.</p><p>What explains incomplete blockade at a structural level is not completely understood. Hansen et al., 2009 (now referenced in the revised manuscript) examined the structural basis for reduction of constitutively open <italic>Lurcher</italic> GluD2<sub>R</sub> channel current. Their conclusion is that binding of D-serine puts Lurcher GluD2<sub>R</sub> in a closed but desensitized state. No similar study has been performed yet for GluD1<sub>R</sub>. In the revised manuscript, we have added new data examining membrane noise during the EPSC in control conditions and after reduction by D-serine or glycine. We report that there was no change in unitary channel current (Figure 4B and D) with D-serine nor glycine. The simplest explanation is that there is a change in the number of open channels, but further work will be needed to determine the structural basis for reduction. To make this clearer, we have revised the manuscript. Instead of stating these amino acids “inhibit” GluD<sub>R</sub> channel current, we write that they “partially reduce” GluD<sub>R</sub> channel current and reference these studies.</p><p>Our manuscript is the first to report reductions in GluD1<sub>R</sub> channel-current by kynurenic acid. We discovered this serendipitously after initially using kynurenic acid to inhibit NMDA<sub>R</sub> channel synaptic currents. This may be unique to GluD1<sub>R</sub> channel current over GluD2<sub>R</sub>, as Kristensen et al. (2016, Mol Pharm) reported that Lurcher GluD2<sub>R</sub> channel current is not sensitive to kynurenic acid but is reduced by the kynurenic acid analog, 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-CKA). We feel it is best for reproducibility to report the effect of kynurenic acid since it is used commonly to inhibit NMDA<sub>R</sub> synaptic responses. Then as a follow-up study, we will screen other known compounds and generate concentration-response curves as in Kristensen et al., 2016.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clarify and expand the current data set (additional experiments may be required):</p><p>2A) Figure 1:</p><p>It would be great to see the contribution of GluD1<sub>R</sub> compared to traditional ionotropic signaling in Figure 1A.

In this experiment, NMDA<sub>R</sub> channels were blocked by MK-801, but contribution from NMDA<sub>R</sub> channels at holding potential of -65 mV is expected to be minimal due to magnesium block. Otherwise, the experimental design is as suggested by the reviewers. We stimulated in the absence of AMPA/GABA-A/5-HT1A antagonists, then chased with a cocktail of antagonists to reveal only the GluD1<sub>R</sub> channel-mediated current. We hope the addition of this figure helps illustrate the duration of the GluD1<sub>R</sub> channel-mediated synaptic current.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2B) Figure 7:</p><p>If animals are available, the authors may consider 1/ testing the (acute) effects of SSRIs on the reported anxiogenic phenotype and/or 2/ evaluating how the lack of functional GluD1 receptors in the dorsal raphe impact social interaction and social memory (both likely to reflect the elevated anxiety reported here).
