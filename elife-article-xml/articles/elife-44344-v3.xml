Both the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of the early mouse embryo have seemingly co-opted TEs as enhancers, but there is little evidence that they play significant roles in gene regulation. Here we tested a set of long terminal repeat TE families for roles as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. Epigenomic and transcriptomic data suggested that a large number of TEs helped to establish tissue-specific gene expression programmes. Genetic editing of individual TEs confirmed a subset of these regulatory relationships. However, a wider survey via CRISPR interference of RLTR13D6 elements in embryonic stem cells revealed that only a minority play significant roles in gene regulation. Our results suggest that a subset of TEs are important for gene regulation in early mouse development, and highlight the importance of functional experiments when evaluating gene regulatory roles of TEs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Much of what is known about genetics has come from studying only a tiny fraction of the genome’s sequence, the part that primarily codes for proteins. But the genome has many other features outside these regions, some of which play an important biological role. Transposable elements – repetitive sequences that are present in many species – make up around half of the mouse genome. They are ‘selfish’ elements, in that the spread of them within the genome does not necessarily benefit the host organism. But sometimes transposable elements can be ‘domesticated’, and used to the host’s advantage. For example, transposable elements can generate new genes. In other cases, their non-coding sequences can regulate the activity of other nearby genes or even those elsewhere in the genome.</p><p>It remains unclear to what extent transposable elements have shaped genome regulation throughout evolution. One idea is that the spread of transposable elements can help to establish large regulatory networks – whereby many genes are collectively regulated to produce a specific output. But it has not been fully explored how effective transposable elements are at regulating gene expression. Now, Todd et al. investigate whether particular transposable elements, that are suspected to boost the activity of other genes, are essential for normal gene expression in early mouse development.</p><p>Todd et al. genetically edited stem cells from the inner and outer layer of the early mouse embryo to find transposable elements that promote gene expression. Whilst some transposable elements were found to be important for gene regulation, not all of the candidates tested were needed to maintain expression levels. To widen the search, several transposable elements were turned off simultaneously by compacting specific stretches of DNA so that they could no longer be activated. When 34 transposable elements were inactivated at once, it emerged that only three transposable elements had a significant impact on gene expression. These findings suggest that whether or not a given transposable element regulates gene expression cannot be predicted solely from profiling the structure and sequence of the genome. This highlights why it is important to interrogate the effect transposable elements have ona gene's role within a cell.</p><p>Transposable elements are largely disregarded in genomics due to technical difficulties in analysing these repetitive stretches of DNA. But characteristic variations within a population may in part be driven by differences in these parts of the genome, which may also be implicated in diseases such as cancer. Identifying which transposable elements are important for driving gene expression, and linking their actions to specific traits could aid the discovery of important genetic variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transposable elements</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>trophoblast stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship 101225/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Branco</surname><given-names>Miguel R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Medical College of Saint Bartholomew's Hospital Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Donald Hunter Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>Christopher D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/R505997/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Darren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and epigenetic editing experiments establish causal links between transposon-derived enhancers and gene regulation in mouse embryonic and extraembryonic lineages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our knowledge of the tissue-specific regulatory landscape of genomes has vastly increased over the last 10 years, thanks in part to large efforts from consortia such as ENCODE and NIH Roadmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kundaje et al., 2015</xref>). But whilst such mapping efforts have been instrumental in categorising the non-coding genome into different types of biochemical activity, our understanding of the associated functional roles remains limited. One of the grand challenges of the post-ENCODE era has been to ascribe regulatory function to the biochemically active non-coding portion of genomes.</p><p>This question is particularly pertinent to transposable elements (TEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elliott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doolittle and Brunet, 2017</xref>), which often display marks of regulatory activity in a species-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacques et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carninci, 2014</xref>). On one hand, successful TEs are expected to display such active profiles, which serve the selfish interests of TEs but may act neutrally with respect to host fitness. On the other, TEs can be co-opted (or exapted) by the host to serve gene regulatory roles, such as alternative promoters or enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuong et al., 2017</xref>). The distinction between these two scenarios relies on approaches that query the causal links between TEs, gene expression and phenotype.</p><p>Primarily based on epigenomic data, evidence to date suggests that particular TE families have contributed to the evolution of tissue-specific gene regulatory networks in contexts such as early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kunarso et al., 2010</xref>), placentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuong et al., 2013</xref>), pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lynch et al., 2011</xref>) and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuong et al., 2016</xref>), amongst others. Transcription factor (TF) binding motifs hosted within the regulatory portion of TEs enable their expression in specific tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sundaram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sundaram et al., 2017</xref>), presumably in a manner that enables vertical inheritance of new TE insertions via the germline. In this respect, mammalian preimplantation development is a seemingly well exploited context for TE expansion, driving genetic conflicts with the host, as well as creating opportunities for TE exaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rodriguez-Terrones and Torres-Padilla, 2018</xref>). In the mouse, TE-derived regulatory activity has been implicated at multiple stages of preimplantation development. Namely, MERVL elements become highly activated upon zygotic genome activation and are thought to play a role in the establishment of the 2-cell stage expression programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>). Transition from the 2-cell stage and development progression to the blastocyst stage appear to depend on LINE-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jachowicz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Percharde et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, work from embryonic and trophoblast stem cells (ESCs and TSCs, respectively), suggests a divergence in TE regulatory activity that is concomitant with the separation of the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages at the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kunarso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuong et al., 2013</xref>). In ESCs, TE families such as RLTR13D6 bind key ESC TFs (e.g., OCT4, NANOG), whereas a distinct subset (e.g., RLTR13D5) bind factors essential for the maintenance of the TSC state (CDX2, ELF5, EOMES). These elements are enriched for histone marks that are characteristic of distal enhancers and lie near genes that are expressed in the lineages where they are active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kunarso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuong et al., 2013</xref>). TE enhancer activity depends on the cooperative action of multiple TFs, whose binding motifs appear to have been already present in the corresponding ancestral TE insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sundaram et al., 2017</xref>). However, it remains unclear to what extent such lineage-specific TEs are important for maintaining gene expression programmes during preimplantation development.</p><p>Here we have tested the gene regulatory function of specific TE families in ESCs and TSCs using genetic and epigenetic editing approaches, and compared them with predictions from extensive analyses of epigenomic and transcriptomic data. We identify a number of TEs that are important to drive expression of lineage-specific genes. However, our data suggest that these constitute a minority of all the putative TE-derived enhancers identified through bioinformatic analyses, highlighting the importance of functional tests when assessing the contribution of TEs to gene regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TE-derived enhancers in ESCs and TSCs are highly tissue-specific</title><p>To identify TEs with putative regulatory potential in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of the blastocyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we focused on a set of TE families that were previously shown to be highly enriched for binding of key TFs in ESCs (RLTR9, RLTR13D6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kunarso et al., 2010</xref>) or TSCs (RLTR13B, RLTR13D5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuong et al., 2013</xref>). These long terminal repeat (LTR) families entered the Muridae lineage within the last ~12.5 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thybert et al., 2018</xref>), with copy numbers for each subfamily ranging from 35 (RLTR9A4) to 1302 (RLTR9E), according to the Repeatmasker annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The majority of these elements are found as solo LTRs, as judged by the genomic distance, length and arrangement of consecutive LTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Nonetheless, we identified some putative proviral elements, mainly associated with RLTR9 subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These include MMERVK9C elements (bearing RLTR9C LTRs) and MMERVK9E elements (RLTR9E LTRs).

To stringently rule out gene promoters we excluded TEs enriched for H3K4me3 and/or lying within 500 bp of known mRNA transcriptional start sites. These putative ‘TE+ enhancers’ also displayed H3K4me1 marking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and were bound by multiple proteins normally associated with enhancer activity, such as p300 and the Mediator and cohesin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This stringent selection led to the identification of 634 TE+ enhancers in ESCs and 358 in TSCs, which represent respectively 9.6% and 13% of all the TE copies in the families considered. To estimate how many TE+ enhancers are potentially missed due to reduced read mappability, we simulated sequencing reads that produced ChIP-seq peaks at every TE of interest. After remapping, peak detection failed for 597 RLTR13D6/RLTR9 elements and 915 RLTR13D5/RLTR13B elements, raising the possibility that an additional substantial fraction of TEs from these families could harbour enhancer marks.</p><p>As expected, RLTR13D6/RLTR9 elements only displayed enhancer-like profiles in ESCs and not in TSCs, whereas the reverse was true for RLTR13D5/RLTR13B elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To confirm that TE+ enhancers display a similar lineage asymmetry in vivo and assess the timing of enhancer activation, we analysed two ATAC-seq datasets from pre- and post-implantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). We found that 49% and 56% of the identified TE+ enhancers (in TSCs and ESCs, respectively) display open chromatin in vivo at some point in early development, with a subset being already active in preimplantation embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Both ESC and TSC TE+ enhancers show some asymmetry with respect to their chromatin status in the respective post-implantation lineages (epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm), but the tissue specificity is more pronounced for TSC TE+ enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Following from the above observations and previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacques et al., 2013</xref>), we asked more widely whether TE+ enhancers displayed tissue-specific open chromatin. For comparison, we also generated a list of ‘TE- enhancers’ with the same characteristics as TE+ enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>) but that did not overlap any repetitive elements within the Repeatmasker annotation (yielding 1988 elements in ESCs and 319 in TSCs). Strikingly, whilst a substantial proportion of ESC TE- enhancers displayed open chromatin in multiple tissues, TE+ enhancer activity was far more restricted to ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similar results were obtained for TSC enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), in line with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuong et al., 2013</xref>). These results suggest that TE+ enhancers are particularly optimised for activity within their respective early embryonic tissues, possibly through the synergistic action of multiple TF binding events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sundaram et al., 2017</xref>). Co-option of TE+ enhancers may therefore particularly benefit genes that require highly tissue-specific expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TE enhancer activity cannot be faithfully predicted from TF binding motifs</title><p>Despite their sequence similarity, only a relatively small fraction of TEs from any given family bear enhancer-like profiles. It was previously suggested that TE enhancer activity in the ESC and TSC contexts is determined by the presence of key TF binding motifs, which have otherwise been mutated in inactive TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sundaram et al., 2017</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether such motifs are fully determinant of TE enhancer activity. We therefore performed TF motif analyses of TE+ enhancer sequences. For comparison, we identified TEs from the same families with high read mappability but that did not display enhancer marks, henceforth termed ‘non-enhancer TEs’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). TE+ enhancers are on average longer than non-enhancer TEs, as expected if deletions remove key TF binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Nevertheless, there are many non-enhancer TEs that are full-length LTRs, prompting the question of what are the sequence determinants of enhancer activity. Focusing on long LTR elements (&gt;60% of maximum length for each family), we found enrichment of several motifs at TE+ enhancers (versus non-enhancer TEs). However, no single motif was predictive of enhancer-like profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For example, whilst SOX2 binding motifs were present in nearly all (81–91%) RLTR13D6 and RLTR9E TE+ enhancers, a high proportion (48–58%) of non-enhancer TEs also contained this motif. Notably, motifs for other TFs (ESRRB, KLF4) that have been shown to cooperate with SOX2 for RLTR9E enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sundaram et al., 2017</xref>) were present in similar abundance at both enhancer and non-enhancer TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The co-occurrence of multiple TF motifs in the same element was also insufficient to fully predict enhancer-like profiles. For example, elements containing OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG motifs accounted for 65% of TE+ enhancers and 21% of non-enhancer TEs in the RLTR13D6 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and few RLTR13D5 elements contained all three EOMES, ELF5 and CDX2 motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TF motifs do not predict TE enhancer potential.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Abundance of TF motifs at TE+ enhancers and non-enhancer TEs from RLTR9E (<bold>A</bold>) and RLTR13D6 (<bold>B</bold>) families.

Using data from a high-throughput reporter assay in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murtha et al., 2014</xref>), we found that SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG binding motifs were present in only 12–30% of TEs with plasmid-based enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggests that simple sequence features, such as the motifs considered here, are poor predictors of TE enhancer activity, which is in line with recent findings in human ESC enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barakat et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Notably, 64% of RLTR13D6/RLTR9 copies with enhancer activity in the reporter assay did not display an enhancer-like chromatin profile. We therefore asked whether TF binding and chromatin opening at non-enhancer TEs was repressed by chromatin features. As we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de la Rica et al., 2016</xref>), non-enhancer TEs display higher levels of DNA methylation than TE+ enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, removal of DNA methylation did not lead to increased enhancer activity at non-enhancer TEs, as judged from ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data from ESCs lacking DNA methylation (triple knockout of <italic>Dnmt1/3a/3b</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Domcke et al., 2015</xref>).

Therefore, whilst chromatin profiling and reporter assays are useful probabilistic indicators of potential enhancer activity, the regulatory action of TEs has to ultimately be tested through molecular manipulations in their genomic environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>TE-derived enhancers interact with lineage-specific genes</title><p>To establish correlations between TE+ enhancer activity and gene expression, studies to date have largely relied on the linear proximity between TEs and genes. This disregards 3D genome conformation, which enables long-range interactions and is not restricted to one-to-one relationships between TEs and genes. We therefore coupled TE+ enhancers to genes they putatively regulate based on promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) data that we recently generated in ESCs and TSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schoenfelder et al., 2018</xref>). Only 34–44% of TE+ enhancers interacted with at least one gene promoter, which was nonetheless higher than the proportion of non-enhancer TEs with gene promoter interactions (21–28%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, a high proportion of TE- enhancers (65–70%) interacted with gene promoters. The contrast between TE+ and TE- enhancers could be explained by the fact that the latter are preferentially positioned within gene-rich, active regions (known as the ‘A’ spatial compartment), whereas TE+ enhancers tend to be located within gene-poor, inactive regions (‘B’ compartment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Accordingly, TE+ enhancers and TE- enhancers interact with largely non-overlapping groups of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To analyse correlations between enhancers and gene expression, we only considered genes that interact exclusively with TE+ or TE- enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For both ESCs and TSCs, we found that TE+ enhancers interacted with genes that displayed higher expression levels when compared to the genome-wide average or to genes interacting with non-enhancer TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Given the tight tissue specificity of TE+ enhancer profiles that we described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), we asked whether genes interacting with TE+ enhancers displayed lineage-specific expression. We first compared their expression in ESCs and TSCs and found a bias towards the cell type where the interacting TEs display enhancer profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the expression of genes interacting with TE- enhancers was on average similar between the two cell lineages. To test for tissue specificity more generally, we analysed gene expression levels across a wide array of tissues using data from the ENCODE project. Strikingly, genes interacting with TE+ enhancers were, on average, almost exclusively expressed in ESCs or TSCs, whereas those interacting with TE- enhancers displayed high expression across a broad range of tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A similar pattern was observed when analysing gene expression at early stages of ESC or TSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data are in line with the chromatin accessibility data and suggest that TE+ enhancers may be used to support lineage-specific expression of a subset of genes in early development.

After genetically excising TE+ enhancers using pairs of sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) in multiple clones, we measured the effects on the expression of target genes.

We designed two sets of 4 sgRNAs each, with distinct strategies in mind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>): a) set 1 maximised the number of RLTR13D6 elements predicted to be targeted by at least one sgRNA (n = 420 elements with no mismatches, out of 805); b) set 2 maximised the number of sgRNAs targeted to each RLTR13D6 element, resulting in a smaller number of copies being targeted (n = 129). The only substantial predicted off-target effects were with TEs of related RLTR13 subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which we took into account for downstream analyses. We then established ESC lines stably expressing a dCas9-KRAB fusion protein, followed by lentiviral transduction of either sgRNA set or an empty vector control. After selection of cells expressing both dCas9-KRAB and sgRNAs, we performed H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses 5–8 days post-infection. Although we failed to get adequate signal from a Cas9 ChIP-seq, analysis of published data from a CRISPRi experiment on human LTR5Hs elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>) showed that the number of sgRNAs predicted to bind each element strongly correlates with Cas9 ChIP-seq signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As 97% of Cas9 binding events at LTR5Hs elements could be predicted in silico, we used sgRNA binding predictions as a surrogate measure for Cas9 binding.</p><p>Analysis of the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data revealed a reduction in H3K27ac signal at RLTR13D6 elements that were predicted to be targeted by each of the sgRNA sets, whereas H3K27ac levels at RLTR9 elements were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Notably, elements targeted by multiple sgRNAs displayed a larger reduction in H3K27ac than those targeted by a single sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), in line with recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>). For sgRNA set 1, CRISPRi resulted in a &gt; 2 fold loss of H3K27ac signal at 30 (56%) RLTR13D6-targeted elements that overlapped a H3K27ac peak. A similar number was obtained for sgRNA set 2 (n = 25, 46%), with 34 elements being affected in total across the two sets (out of 76 H3K27ac-marked elements). We then asked how these changes affected gene expression. Strikingly, only three genes were significantly differentially expressed upon CRISPRi across both sets of sgRNAs: <italic>Tdrd12</italic>, <italic>Spp1</italic> and <italic>Hook3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). All three cases were associated with a RLTR13D6 element targeted by one or both of the sgRNA sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>). Most likely these elements act as distal enhancers given that they lay &gt;6 kb away from the respective transcriptional start sites, whereas heterochromatin spreading as a result of CRISPRi tends to be limited to the open chromatin regions targeted by the sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thakore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Tdrd12</italic> stood out as the most downregulated gene after CRISPRi with either sgRNA set, which together with results from genetic editing experiments above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) provide ample evidence that <italic>Tdrd12</italic> expression in ESCs critically depends on an intronic RLTR13D6 element. Silencing of this element did not cause any structural alterations of the <italic>Tdrd12</italic> transcript, supporting its role as an enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The effect of CRISPRi on <italic>Hook3</italic> expression was far more subtle, despite a pronounced loss of H3K27ac at the associated RLTR13D6 element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Notably, <italic>Spp1</italic> downregulation occurred in a manner that seemed largely independent of changes in H3K27ac levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting that enhancer inactivation occurred through deposition of repressive marks and/or via impairment of TF binding by dCas9-KRAB. For the remainder of the targeted TEs, although as a group the associated genes displayed a significant downregulation upon CRISPRi, these changes were limited to at most 1.4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This included genes interacting with TE+ enhancers displaying a similar or greater H3K27ac loss to that observed at <italic>Tdrd12-</italic> or <italic>Spp1-</italic>associated RLTR13D6 elements. To validate the relatively small effect of some TE+ enhancers on gene expression, we performed additional genetic editing experiments. We chose two RLTR13D6 elements that displayed &gt;2-fold change in H3K27ac levels upon CRISPRi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A,D</xref>), but with little or no effect on neighbouring gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B,E</xref>). Upon CRISPR-mediated deletion of the respective TEs, gene expression levels largely agreed with CRISPRi results, with only the lowly expressed <italic>Tsacc</italic> gene being downregulated, although the effect was more pronounced in the genetic excision experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C,F</xref>).

Yet most of these studies have relied largely on the idea that biochemical activity at the chromatin level is indicative of function, a concept famously associated with the findings of the ENCODE project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) that triggered a still ongoing debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ponting, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doolittle and Brunet, 2017</xref>). The use of genetic and epigenetic editing tools as presented here, and also used by other labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jachowicz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>), initiate a much needed move to evaluating causal roles for TEs in gene regulation.</p><p>Our work has revealed that a set of TEs with regulatory potential in ESCs act mostly neutrally with respect to their effects on gene expression, which contrasts with earlier suggestions from analyses of chromatin profiling experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kunarso et al., 2010</xref>). In the absence of a substantial contribution of ESC TE+ enhancers to gene regulation, the striking correlations emerging from profiling efforts most likely reflect the fact that TE insertions are best tolerated in regions where their tissue-specific enhancer action matches the expression profiles of nearby genes. Whilst the enhancer activity of these TEs could be inconsequential for gene expression, this genomic ‘safe niche’ would be permissive for fixation by genetic drift. Additionally, we cannot exclude the possibility that some TE+ enhancers act redundantly with TE- enhancers, despite our attempt to isolate the effects of each of these enhancer groups. Such TEs could still be important to ensure regulatory robustness and, indeed, enhancer redundancy is a seemingly common feature of enhancer-gene networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>). Extensive genetic work will be necessary to evaluate what proportion of TE+ enhancers act in a redundant fashion with other regulatory elements.</p><p>In a contrasting example to our findings, epigenetic editing work by the Wysocka lab has revealed that a large proportion of LTR5Hs elements play significant roles in the regulation of nearly 300 genes in a human embryonal carcinoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, in the latter study virtually all H3K27ac-marked LTR5Hs elements were inactivated by CRISPRi (257 copies, according to our own analysis), probably due to the use of twelve sgRNAs simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>). It is therefore possible that more efficient targeting of all H3K27ac-marked RLTR13D6 elements (76 copies) in mouse ESCs would uncover additional regulatory elements. However, the effects seen here from silencing 34 (44%) of these copies suggest that regulatory RLTR13D6 elements would likely remain a minority. Another explanation to the differences between LTR5Hs and RLTR13D6 action is that the regulatory effects of TEs are variable between families and cellular contexts. Indeed, other TEs considered here and whose effects we did not test by CRISPRi (RLTR9, RLTR13D5, RLTR13B), may play important roles in ESC and TSC gene regulation. These considerations further emphasise the need to perform functional experiments on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Despite the neutral action of most TEs analysed here, we have uncovered a number of elements that act as key enhancers of gene expression in ESCs (<italic>Tdrd12</italic>, <italic>Smarcad1</italic>, <italic>Spp1</italic> and <italic>Hook3</italic>) and TSCs (<italic>Map3k8</italic> and <italic>Scarf2</italic>). But do these TE insertions impact on cellular and organismal phenotypes, ultimately affecting host fitness? TDRD12 is a protein essential for secondary piRNA production in mice and is essential for male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pandey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pandey et al., 2018</xref>). It is therefore possible that the RLTR13D6 element we identified is also active during male germ line development, which would ironically implicate it in genome defence against the mobility of younger, piRNA-targeted TEs. <italic>Smarcad1</italic> knockout mice are subviable, displaying growth defects and low fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schoor et al., 1999</xref>). It remains to be seen whether the activity of the RLTR9E element we identified plays any role in these phenotypes, possibly by affecting early embryonic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2009</xref>). Other genes that we found to be regulated by TEs are not essential for development: both <italic>Map3k8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dumitru et al., 2000</xref>) or <italic>Spp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rittling et al., 1998</xref>) knockout mice are viable and appear to develop normally. In these cases it is likely that the action of the associated TEs is inconsequential to the organism, although there could be more subtle embryonic phenotypes or these TEs could play additional roles outside of the early developmental context. Notably, most exemplars of phenotypically relevant TE-derived regulatory elements have been uncovered by analysing naturally occurring phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lisch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuong et al., 2017</xref>). The reverse approach of searching for phenotypes linked with putative <italic>cis</italic>-acting TEs has the potential to reveal a wide array of adaptive TE insertions, although this is nonetheless challenging and examples to date are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuong et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>At a time when epigenomic data are providing abundant indications that TEs play functional regulatory roles, our findings place these observations into perspective and provide a reminder that a large proportion of mammalian genomic sequences are neutrally evolving. Yet evolutionary tinkering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacob, 1977</xref>) may still benefit from a large amount of ‘junk DNA’ that occasionally can be put to good use. As was fittingly put by Goodier and Kazazian, ‘evolution has been adept of turning some ‘junk’ into treasure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodier and Kazazian, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>E14 ESCs (ATCC CRL-1821) were grown in feeder-free conditions in DMEM GlutaMAX medium (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 15% FBS, non-essential amino acids, 50 μM 2-mercaproethanol and 1,000 U/ml ESGRO LIF (Millipore).

consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Deborah Bourc'his as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Alvaro Rada-Iglesias (Reviewer #2); Dixie Mager (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Transposable elements (TEs) are more and more postulated to act as regulatory sequences that could drive the expression of gene networks during development, acting as alternative promoters or enhancers. Genome-wide mapping studies have indeed documented that TEs have often been co-opted as binding sites for transcription factors and can be enriched for chromatin features of enhancers -such as H3K27ac and H3K4me1- in tissue- or stage-specific contexts. However, these proposed regulatory functions are largely based on correlative observations. Using CRISPRi and multiple sgRNA (CARGO) delivery, a recent publication was the first to provide potential functional significance, demonstrating that LTR5HS elements could act as enhancers of a few hundred genes in the human genome. Regarding the variety of transposable elements in terms of evolutionary history, sequences, numbers and multiplication success, more studies are clearly needed to analyze the potential of retrotransposons as developmental regulators of gene expression.</p><p>Here the authors focused on ERVK elements that were previously shown to display enhancer features in mouse ESCs (RLTR9 and RLTR13D6) and TSCs (RLTR13B and RLTR13D5). Using available genome-wide datasets (TF occupancy, histone marks, promoter capture), they first defined a set of 684 ESC-specific and 358 TSC-specific enhancer-like LTR elements, along with the gene promoters they may interact with. Using both genetic deletion of a few elements and genome-wide CRISPRi approaches, they observed very limited influence of these LTR elements on enhancing gene expression, and concluded that insertion sites of these elements were probably selected for their expression patterns similar to -and therefore not detrimental to- nearby genes. The conclusions have clear interests, for both the transposon and the enhancer fields, the study is overall well conducted and the manuscript well written. However, according to the three reviewers, it is necessary to better define why this category of LTR elements does not have widespread enhancer properties, despite showing enhancer features: technical reasons (CRISPRi efficiency)? Biological reasons (enhancer redundancy)? Or indeed, lack of functionality?</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be helpful to provide a more information about the LTR families chosen for analysis. Why were they chosen? What proviral families are they related to (if any), what are their approximate copy numbers, etc. Admittedly, nothing is known for most such LTR families but anything the authors can provide would make these entities seem less obscure. On the same matter, it is unclear from the beginning whether the authors focused on solo LTRs or full-length elements or both. Please specify. Notably, are there differences between TE+ enhancers and TE non-enhancers regarding element size? Or between TE+ enhancers that are neutral upon CRISPRi and the few that are impactful?</p><p>2) When using targeted genetic deletions, the authors found that a fair fraction of LTR elements had effects on gene expression. Thus, the dominant lack of effects when using CRISPRi might be due to partially abrogated enhancer function. Accordingly, the level of H3K27ac downregulation upon CRISPRi appears weak in some instances. Is a 2-fold reduction in H3K27ac enough to lose enhancer properties? The authors should select a couple of transposable elements that according to the CRISPRi had no effects on gene expression and test whether this is also true upon genetic deletion. When those elements that were already studied by both genetic deletion and CRISPRi, the effects on gene expression should be systematically compared between the two approaches.</p><p>3) The lack of effects on gene expression is not an exclusive property of transposable elements but of enhancers in general when analyzed individually (this is something that the authors should comment on). As the authors state in their Discussion, one possible explanation is the prevalent enhancer redundancy that characterizes the regulation of many genes. The authors should look for any distinguishing genomic features surrounding the few LTRs that indeed did act as enhancers (ATAC-seq, p300, and promoter HiC data (and others). One might predict that LTR copies with significant impact on gene expression might be found in locations with no other host genome enhancers in the vicinity to serve the same function. In other words, perhaps TEs that have truly become important for gene expression have done so once the natural enhancer(s) for the gene have degraded.</p><p>The authors should then functionally test whether this could explain the lack of relevance at least for one locus. Briefly, they could select one gene whose expression is predicted to be controlled by at least two enhancers with one of them being an LTR element here studied. Then the authors could delete each of those enhancers either individually or together and evaluate gene expression changes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44344.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be helpful to provide a more information about the LTR families chosen for analysis.

We have clarified this at the start of the Results section: “…we focused on a set of TE families that were previously shown to be highly enriched for binding of key TFs in ESCs (RLTR9, RLTR13D6) (Kunarso et al., 2010) or TSCs (RLTR13B, RLTR13D5) (Chuong et al., 2013)”. As the reviewers correctly point out, not much is known about these LTR families. Within the Repbase database, only two families (RLTR9C and RLTR9E) are directly coupled to internal portions (MMERVK9C-int and MMERVK9E-int). Additional insights on proviral families would require extensive genomic and phylogenetic characterization, which falls beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Using Repeatmasker annotations, we now provide copy numbers for each subfamily considered in this study, as well as an indication of their age based on abundance in different Muridae species (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B). We have also analysed the genomic arrangement of LTR pairs to look for suggestive evidence of proviral insertions. Our analysis shows that the vast majority of elements are solo LTRs, whilst only a minority harbours full-length LTRs in the same orientation within 10kb of each other (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Both forms (solo LTRs and proviral) were considered in our study. This discussion was added to the text (subsection “TE-derived enhancers in ESCs and TSCs are highly tissue-specific”, first paragraph).</p><p>Regarding element length, we have added the following: “TE+ enhancers are on average longer than non-enhancer TEs, as expected if deletions remove key TF binding sites (Figure 2A, B; Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Nevertheless, there are many non-enhancer TEs that are full-length LTRs, prompting the question of what are the sequence determinants of enhancer activity”. It is important to note that for motif analyses we only considered long LTRs (&gt;60% of maximum length for each family), to try and pinpoint base-level differences that drive enhancer activity. Unfortunately, the comparison between neutral and CRISPRi-modulated TEs cannot be performed due to lack of statistical power.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) When using targeted genetic deletions, the authors found that a fair fraction of LTR elements had effects on gene expression.

When those elements that were already studied by both genetic deletion and CRISPRi, the effects on gene expression should be systematically compared between the two approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion, which we have taken by deleting an additional two TE+ enhancers. As described now: “We chose two RLTR13D6 elements that displayed &gt;2-fold change in H3K27ac levels upon CRISPRi (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A, D), but with little or no effect on neighbouring gene expression (Figure 5—figure supplement 3B, E). […] Therefore, whilst CRISPR of individual TEs constitutes a more sensitive approach, our CRISPRi data correlates with genetic excision data and is robust with respect to large effects on gene expression”. We have been careful to word our discussion around the roles of TEs as major and critical regulators of gene expression, and are not excluding their potential implication as minor/redundant modulators.</p><p>Please also note that the CRISPRi experiment targeted only RLTR13D6 elements, only one of which (<italic>Tdrd12</italic>-associated) had been genetically excised in the original manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The lack of effects on gene expression is not an exclusive property of transposable elements but of enhancers in general when analyzed individually (this is something that the authors should comment on).

We now acknowledge this (Discussion, second paragraph), referring to recent work in mouse limb enhancers (PMID: 29420474). Note, however, that the vast majority of TE+ enhancers do not interact with the same genes as TE- enhancers (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C), suggesting a reduced potential for enhancer redundancy involving TEs.</p><p>Regarding the search for (epi)genomic features that can predict the regulatory activity of TE+ enhancers, there are simply too few of these elements in our study to make any observations from such effort meaningful. We therefore would prefer to refrain from making any generalisations in this respect.</p><p>We also argue that the demonstration of TE+ enhancer redundancy in one example says little about how extensive this phenomenon might be, and that “extensive genetic work will be necessary to evaluate what proportion of TE+ enhancers act in a redundant fashion with other regulatory elements”. We nonetheless attempted to test this possibility at the <italic>Akap12</italic> gene, where a non-TE region with a strong enhancer signature lies downstream of the TE+ enhancer we previously deleted (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Unfortunately, we only obtained clones with deletions of the TE- enhancer in cells with a wild-type TE+ enhancer, and did not isolate any double KO clones. Deletion of the TE- enhancer had no effect on <italic>Akap12</italic> expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), but we could not ascertain whether it acts redundantly with the TE+ enhancer.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44344-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
