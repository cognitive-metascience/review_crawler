It shows patterns of rapid gene evolution and provides a hotspot for the origination of genetic novelties such as de novo genes, duplications and mutations. To investigate the expression patterns of genetic novelties across cell types, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis. We found that new genes were expressed in various cell types, the patterns of which may be influenced by their mode of origination. In particular, lineage-specific de novo genes are commonly expressed in early spermatocytes, while young duplicated genes are often bimodally expressed. Analysis of germline substitutions suggests that spermatogenesis is a highly reparative process, with the mutational load of germ cells decreasing as spermatogenesis progresses. By elucidating the distribution of genetic novelties across spermatogenesis, this study provides a deeper understanding of how the testis maintains its core reproductive function while being a hotbed of evolutionary innovation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>de novo gene</kwd><kwd>mutational load</kwd><kwd>single-cell sequencing</kwd><kwd>expression dynamics</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013961</institution-id><institution>Robertson Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011331</institution-id><institution>Monique Weill-Caulier Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Monique Weill-Caulier Career Scientist Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

In humans, flies, and mice, spermatogenesis consists of several key steps: (1) differentiation of germline stem cells into spermatogonia, (2) mitotic divisions of spermatogonia, which become spermatocytes, (3) meiotic divisions to generate primary spermatids, and (4) sperm maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuller, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White-Cooper, 2010</xref>). Across animal species, the testis is unique from a transcriptomics perspective because it expresses more genes than any other tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parisi et al., 2004</xref>). Genotypes and phenotypes associated with sex and reproduction diverge rapidly and may have important functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lande, 1981</xref>). Despite evolutionary genetic hypotheses trying to explain the complexity of the testis transcriptome, it remains unclear why this tissue expresses a broader array of genes than any other tissue, including the brain, which is more phenotypically and structurally complex and contains more cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parisi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soumillon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parisi et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Not only it is a highly transcriptionally active tissue, the testis is also a hotspot for newly originated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Long et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neme and Tautz, 2016</xref>). One hypothesis is that testis catalyzes the birth and retention of novel genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaessmann, 2010</xref>). This hypothesis suggests that novel genes are likely to be born in testis due to a permissive chromatin state. Novel functional genes with beneficial products are selectively preserved and eventually evolve more refined regulatory programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaessmann, 2010</xref>). In the past decade, many studies have found that young genes, including de novo originated genes (genes born from ancestrally noncoding DNA), tend to be biased towards the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Levine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Long et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tautz and Domazet-Lošo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). De novo genes may arise in two main ways: (1) an unexpressed DNA sequence gains expression, and the resulting transcript can acquire a function, coding potential or (2) a potential Open Reading Frame (ORF) gains expression and translation, and undergoes functional refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLysaght and Hurst, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schlötterer, 2015</xref>). Natural selection may not only preserve testis-bias and function of novel genes, but also shape expression and function in somatic tissues for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Elucidating the biology of new-gene evolution therefore requires a comprehensive picture of spatio-temporal dynamics of testis gene regulation.</p><p>Spermatogenesis is a highly conserved process in many animal taxa and is well-understood from an anatomical and histological perspective, but its molecular foundations are still poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birkhead et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demarco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Russell et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White-Cooper, 2010</xref>). New analytical methods in genomics allow the quantification of expression biases of gene groups involved in various cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lukassen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stévant et al., 2018</xref>). From the prevalence of their transcripts, one can make inferences about the developmental timing of translation, DNA repair, nuclear export, and other processes. Moreover, these methods also make possible the identification of germline variants and the individual cells in which they occur.</p><p>Such methods include the recent advent of single-cell sequencing, a technology that may shed light on unknown aspects of germline mutation. For instance, it is known that the human mutation rate per base per generation ranges from 10E-7 to 10E-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moorjani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scally and Durbin, 2012</xref>), but this germline mutation rate is the result of an equilibrium between errors/lesions and repair. Substitutions that arise within an individual’s germline but do not reach mature gametes will not be passed to the next generation, meaning that population genetics approaches can only observe a subset of germline variants. Is the population-level mutation rate influenced by the mutation-repair equilibrium of spermatogenesis?</p><p>A roadblock to the answer of this question is the fact that any substitutions that prevent gamete maturation or fertilization will be lost from the population, meaning that the population-level mutation rate may vastly underestimate the germline variants propagating within individuals. Since male <italic>Drosophila</italic> do not undergo meiotic recombination, germ cell variants that occur in earlier developmental stages may not be repaired through recombination related mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hunter, 2015</xref>). It is also known that different cell types in the testis accumulate DNA lesions at different rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2014</xref>), but it is unclear if the net mutational load varies during spermatogenesis. Single-cell RNA-seq can be used to infer mutational events within a whole tissue, even if such lesions would be repaired before gamete maturation. Unlike single-cell genome sequencing, this approach can infer the cell types associated with each variant, allowing estimation of the mutational load of cells as they progress through spermatogenesis. Due to its versatility, reproducibility, and wealth of useful data, single-cell RNA-seq is a powerful tool for the study of germline mutation.</p><p>We leveraged single-cell RNA-seq and unsupervised clustering to identify all the major cell classes of the sperm lineage, validated by previously studied marker genes. We identified populations of somatic cells, including cyst stem cells, hub cells, and terminal epithelial cells. We found that the overall gene expression is very active in early spermatogenesis and decreases throughout spermatogenesis. Lineage-specific de novo genes (genes derived from ancestrally noncoding DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>]) showed expression in various cell types and are commonly expressed in spermatocytes. We also identified putative germline de novo substitutions from our population of cells and found that they decrease in relative abundance during spermatogenesis. We also found that the proportion of mutated cells decreases throughout spermatogenesis, a finding with possible implications for the study of male germline DNA repair. In an opposite pattern, DNA damage response genes are upregulated in early spermatogenesis, indicating a role for these genes in early spermatogenesis.</p><p>These patterns of mutation and de novo gene expression augment and enrich our current understanding of the male-specific evolutionary novelty. It was previously known that young de novo genes tend to be testis biased, and we have further traced the main source of this bias to spermatocytes. We uncover a compelling time course of mutational load throughout spermatogenesis, putting forward the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis as a model for the study of spermatogenic mutational surveillance. Mutation and de novo gene evolution are critical components of the adaptive process, and our results demonstrate these processes in action during spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unsupervised clustering elucidates the distribution of de novo genes across cell types</title><p>We prepared a single-cell suspension from freshly dissected testes of 48-hours-old <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> adult males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, also see Materials and methods). The cell suspension was then made into a library and sequenced. We recovered 426,563,073 reads from a total of 5000 cells. On average, we mapped 85,312 reads per cell and detected the expression of an average of 4185 genes per cell. The dataset correlates well with bulk testis RNA-seq and a separate testis single-cell RNA-seq library, with a Pearson’s R of 0.97, indicating high reproducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using t-Stochastic-Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) in Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van Der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satija et al., 2015</xref>) we reduced the dimensionality of the gene/cell expression matrix to two primary axes and grouped cells by their similarity across their thousands of unique gene expression profiles. Grouping similar cells into clusters, we observed marker genes enriched in particular clusters, allowing us to infer the identity of the cells within each cluster (see Materials and methods).</p><p>Based on the clustering results, we inferred the presence of germline stem cells, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids (germ cells) as well as cyst stem cells, terminal epithelial cells, and hub cells (somatic cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We confirmed that the top 50 most highly enriched genes in cell clusters from each cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were consistent with previous knowledge of marker genes. For instance, <italic>cup</italic> genes were biased toward late spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barreau et al., 2008</xref>), and <italic>Hsp23</italic> and <italic>MtnA</italic> were highly expressed in the epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faisal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michaud et al., 1997</xref>). Cell clusters from each developmental stage in the t-SNE map are near each other, suggesting that cell progression through spermatogenesis is a continuous process. The expression of marker genes confirmed the assignment of cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Germline Stem Cells (GSCs) and early spermatogonia clustered together due to 1) high transcriptional similarity, 2) the relatively low numbers of GSCs within the tissue, and 3) the sparse expression of GSC-specific marker genes. Different types of somatic cells clustered close to each other in the t-SNE graph, suggesting distinct transcriptional patterns compared to germ cells.

Early spermatocytes showed an enrichment for ubiquitin-independent proteasomal catabolism; late spermatocytes were enriched for genes involved in spermatid motility and differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

The number of genes expressed in early and late spermatids is lower than at any other point during the sperm lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that post-meiotic transcription exists, but occurs at a lower level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schultz et al., 2003</xref>). Consistently with this result, the cellular RNA content, measured by the number of Unique Molecular Indices (UMI) recovered per cell, is low in spermatids and high in spermatogonia and early spermatocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Early and late spermatocytes, however, express similar proportions of fixed de novo genes and testis-specific genes. Moreover, spermatocytes also show the highest relative abundance of segregating de novo genes compared to other cell types.

Each variant is also supported by multiple germ cell reads with different UMIs.</p><p>To approximate per-base mutation load of each cell type, we accounted for two factors. Firstly, we are more likely to call a mutation event in more abundant cell types. Secondly, we are only able to detect mutation events in transcribed regions, so cells with a larger breadth of transcribed regions will likely yield more events. To control for these variables, we calculated the approximate per-base mutation load of each cell type by dividing the number of detected substitutions by the number of cells and the number of bases covered by 10 or more reads in that cell type, finding a decrease in the relative abundance of substitutions during the progression of spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, while we detected 30% (22/73) of inferred germline substitutions in early spermatids, we detected no germline variants in late spermatids. This means that either 1) most lesions are corrected by this stage, or 2) cells with lesions were removed by programmed cell death, or 3) that we captured insufficient quantities of mature spermatid mRNA to detect remaining variants. Although we found that early and late spermatids have similar RNA content, the low abundance of late spermatids makes either explanation possible. Since we observed a steady downward trend of mutation abundance during the progression of spermatogenesis, it is reasonable to infer that late spermatids have a mutational burden equal to or less than that of early spermatids. We counted the number of cells of each type carrying mutations throughout spermatogenesis. We observed that the relative proportion of cells carrying mutations drops consistently throughout spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that mutational load decreases during spermatogenesis. A chi-square test of the trend in proportions shows that the relative numbers of mutated cells follow a linear trend (p value = 2.20E-16). This result is highly statistically significant and lends credence to our other observations of dwindling mutational load during spermatogenic progression. This trend could be the result of active lesion repair, or the death of cells carrying unrepaired lesions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>DNA repair genes and ribosomal protein genes show an early expression bias</title><p>We asked whether two key programs, DNA repair, and translation, show signatures of expression bias during spermatogenesis.

Compared to testis-specific genes or all other genes, they are upregulated in GSCs/early spermatogonia and late spermatogonia, and downregulated in early spermatocytes, late spermatocytes, early spermatids, and late spermatids. Our results indicate that translation is required at the very beginning of spermatogenesis, possibly to build cellular machinery during a period of rapid growth and division. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that ribosomes play an important role in regulating stem cell fate and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagy et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turner, 2008</xref>). The observed abundance of those ribosome protein genes is consistent with ribosome loading playing an important role in stem cell differentiation and germ cell differentiation. Translation is important for later spermatogenesis as well, and our results indicate that the ribosomal machinery may be built early and stored for use in later developmental stages.</p><p>We hypothesized that since replication and transcription are very active in early spermatogenesis, DNA repair-gene expression may be biased towards early spermatogenesis. We quantified the expression pattern of 211 DNA repair genes in the testis (DNA repair genes were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Svetec et al., 2016</xref>).

We have developed a simple but robust method to quantify gene expression bias in a cell-type specific manner in single-cell data. It revealed the presence of expression biases in DNA repair genes, segregating de novo genes, and other gene groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al. (2014)</xref> characterized de novo genes as lowly expressed from bulk RNA-seq data, but our data demonstrate that de novo genes show various expression patterns among all cell types and are commonly expressed in spermatocytes. Our other observation that segregating de novo genes exceed the expected post-meiotic expression of testis-specific genes is also intriguing. One possibility is that some de novo transcripts may escape RNA degeneration and have a long lifespan after meiosis. Over time, if the products of de novo transcripts are selected and modified by natural selection, the regulatory sequences and resulting expression pattern will be refined. Since fixed de novo genes show similar scaled expression patterns to older testis-specific genes, it is possible that certain expression patterns common to older testis-specific genes increase the likelihood of a segregating gene reaching fixation, or that many of the de novo genes function similarly to testis-specific genes.</p><p>Our finding that young duplicated genes have different expression patterns than de novo genes merits further study. Young duplicated genes are more likely to be bimodally expressed than de novo genes of a similar age. While it appears that de novo genes are often highly expressed during meiosis, many duplicated genes display a bimodal expression pattern. While de novo genes may have relatively simple minimal promoters, young duplicated genes may maintain much of the regulatory sequence of their parent copy. However, since only 2 out of 14 <italic>melanogaster</italic>-specific child duplicates have the same general expression pattern as their parent genes, it seems that their regulatory sequences are often modified to produce alternative expression patterns. This observation suggests that some young duplicated genes have relaxed selective pressure to perform the ancestral function, allowing for neofunctionalization.</p><p>We also developed a method to extract mutational information from single-cell RNA-seq data, which can provide information about germline or de novo DNA lesions present in a sample without the need for DNA sequencing. While our method cannot identify variants in untranscribed regions, introns, or sense strands, our method approximates the relative mutational load of different cell types in a sample. Variation in RNA content between cell types may decrease our power to detect substitutions in less transcriptionally-active cells such as late spermatids, although our calculated mutational load in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> accounts for this. Despite the lack of data for late spermatids, our results suggest that many errors are at least partially repaired before the completion of spermatid maturation. Alternatively, cell death could have removed mutated cells before spermatid maturation if a lesion could not be repaired. Our data cannot distinguish between the death of mutated cells and successful repair of lesions.</p><p>The variants we have found are either DNA lesions that have escaped repair, or the lesions that have been selected through competition among cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loewe and Hill, 2010</xref>). It is likely that some of these substitutions would result in inviable offspring and would never be observed in an adult population. Our result suggests that mutational load varies between different cell divisions, consistent with previous work that suggests a variable lesion rate between cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). Mutational load is the net product of damage and repair, and further characterization of how lesions occur and accumulate in the germline is needed to better understand the evolutionary ramifications of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moorjani et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It appears that the cell types with the highest mutational load are germline stem cells/early spermatogonia, the earliest germ cells. This indicates that by the time germline stem cells enter spermatogenesis, they carry a relatively high mutational burden. This could be due to the fact that germline stem cells cycle many times, dividing asymmetrically to produce spermatogonia and a replenished germline stem cell. This cycle, repeated enough times, could cause a buildup of variants in germline stem cells as they continue to produce spermatogonia. Such a scenario would necessitate a mechanism to remove high level of lesions from maturing gametes. This mechanism must be an equilibrium removing enough lesions to prevent the accumulation of harmful phenotypes. However, the population-level mutation rate never reaches zero, otherwise adaptive evolution will cease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lynch, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Since we observed that the transcription of 211 DNA repair genes drops during meiotic stages, we suspect that DNA repair gene products are translated early and continue to repair lesions throughout spermatogenesis. After meiosis, however, the gametes become haploid, and there is no longer a template strand to facilitate homology-directed repair. This should constrain the types of DNA damage repair available in late spermatogenesis. It is also important to note that male <italic>Drosophila</italic> do not undergo meiotic recombination, meaning that the DNA repair events that occur during spermatogenesis are likely due to replicative or transcriptional forces, not recombination. Transcription-coupled repair during spermatogenesis is apparent in mouse and humans, as variants on the template strand and the coding strand of testis-expressed genes are asymmetrical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xia et al., 2018</xref>). Our finding that the number of variants decreases throughout spermatogenesis is consistent with the results of Xia et al., who posit a generalized genomic surveillance function of spermatogenesis. Future work should use single-cell genome sequencing on FACS-purified subpopulations of testis cells to identify germline variants and calculate their relative abundance. Additionally, our work necessitates comparison of the relative mutational burden of older flies to younger flies. If DNA lesions accumulate in cycling germline stem cells over time, spermatogenic mutational surveillance may less efficiently compensate for more lesions in sperm from older individuals. Our result indicates that cell-type specific mutational load can be estimated from single-cell RNA-seq data with reasonable accuracy. Overall, we provide novel insights into the dynamics of mutation, repair, and de novo gene expression profiles in the male germline.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> male)</td><td>RAL517</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mackay et al., 2012</xref></td><td>BDSC:25197</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>10X chromium <break/>3' kit V2</td><td>10X genomics</td><td>10X genomics product number CG00052</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Gibco Collagenase, type I</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>Thermo Fisher catalog number 17018029</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Trypsin LE</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>Thermo Fisher catalog number 12605036</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Cellranger</td><td>10X genomics</td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Hisat2</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25751142">25751142</ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Stringtie</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690850">25690850</ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Seurat</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satija et al., 2015</xref></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>bcftools</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28205675">28205675</ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>samJDK</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx734"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lindenbaum and Redon, 2018</xref></ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Monocle</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation and sequencing of testis single-cell RNA-seq libraries</title><p>We used 2- to 3- day-old DGRP-RAL517 flies in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mackay et al., 2012</xref>).

The samples were incubated in lysis buffer for 30 min at room temperature with gentle vortex mixing every 10 min.

For imaging, 15 μl of the cell suspension were transferred to a slide and imaged in a Zeiss upright light microscope. This method yielded high numbers of single cells with an average of 93–96% viability.

Using whole-tissue RNA-seq data from multiple strains of <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis, we used Stringtie merged to create a merged transcriptome GTF containing unannotated transcripts and used BLAST to compare the novel transcripts against converted coordinates for the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al.

For genes with a match between the converted 2014 coordinates and the new merged transcriptome, we added the coordinates from the merged GTF to the FlyBase dmel_r6.15 reference GTF. Since a single-exon de novo genes could be on either strand, we created a plus and minus strand version of every verified de novo gene. Our custom annotation file thus contains all the standard FlyBase dmel_r6.15 genes, plus a set of assembled transcripts known to correspond to de novo genes.</p><p>Our study only seeks to analyze previously characterized de novo genes, and will inherit the limitations of identification of de novo genes using bulk RNA-seq data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al.

Despite this possibility we still observe many de novo genes with maximum expression in rare cell types such as germ line stem cells and spermatogonia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Quantification of reproducibility</title><p>If single-cell suspension results to relatively unbiased ratios of cell types compared to in vivo cell types, one would expect a relatively high correlation of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data. To verify this, we aligned the single-cell RNA-seq reads and bulk RNA-seq reads of RAL517 separately to the reference genome using Hisat2, calculated gene TPMs with Stringtie, and then used DEseq2 to regularized-log transform the TPM values from both datasets. After that, we plot the correlation of normalized gene expression and calculated the Pearson’s R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We used the custom reference to run Cellranger count, which demultiplexed the single cell reads into a usable format for Seurat. Going forward, we kept all genes expressed in at least 3 cells and all cells with at least 200 genes expressed. We ran Seurat ScaleData and NormalizeData with default parameters. According to the Seurat documentation, ‘Feature counts for each cell are divided by the total counts for that cell and multiplied by the scale.factor (default = 10,000). This is then natural-log transformed using log1p.’ We then ran Seurat’s default t-SNE function and found clusters based on the first nine principal components (resolution = 2). Of the parameters we tried, most produced a similar t-SNE clustering pattern, but nine principal components generated the best separation between different cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Identification of cell types in single-cell RNA-seq data</title><p>We used marker genes to infer the predominant cell type within each cluster in Seurat. <italic>Aubergine</italic> (<italic>aub</italic>) is a marker of germline stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rojas-Ríos et al., 2017</xref>), and Bag of Marbles (<italic>bam</italic>) is a marker of spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawase et al., 2004</xref>).

The literature is clear that transcription of <italic>fzo</italic> and <italic>twe</italic> peaks in spermatocytes, but it is less clear which marker denotes early and late spermatocytes, respectively. To resolve this ambiguity, we used monocle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>) to align our cells on a developmental trajectory called pseudotime (rho = 68, delta = 5, ordered using the top 1000 differentially expressed genes).

Therefore, when constructing a lineage tree for all cells in our tissue, we would expect to see a separate branch containing somatic cells erroneously branching from somewhere along the inferred lineage of more common germ cells. In the somatic cell branch from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <italic>MtnA</italic> is enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), leading us to infer that this state is mainly somatic cells. As such, we ignored this branch for our analysis of gene expression during germ cell development in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. One should not interpret this result as evidence that somatic cells in the testis arose from germ cell progenitors, rather, this is a consequence of Monocle’s algorithm that forces a minimum spanning tree for all cells in a sample, regardless of their real cell-type of origin. Since the original common progenitor for the germ lineage and somatic testis cells is not present in adult tissues, Monocle placed the somatic cells to their closest germ cell neighbors, in this case late germ cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, there is a gap between the group of somatic cells and the tightly clustered lineage of germ cells, indicating that the cells are indeed from a different lineage.</p><p>To construct the trajectory, we used the following parameters:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&gt;reduceDimension(max_components = 2, num_dim = 3, norm_method = 'log', reduction_method = 'tSNE')</p></list-item><list-item><p>&gt;clusterCells(my_cds, rho_threshold = 55, delta_threshold = 10, frequency_thresh = 0.1)</p></list-item></list><p>To order the cells, we used the top 1000 genes with the highest q value of being differentially expressed between clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Calculation of cell-type bias of gene groups</title><p>Testing whether gene expression is biased across cell types requires overcoming two challenges. Firstly, different cell types have varying levels of RNA and global transcription, so it is important to account for the behavior of other genes in a cell type when calculating expression bias of a group of genes. Additionally, the calculated expression values for different groups of genes will vary by orders of magnitude. Expression values must be scaled across the dataset on a per-gene basis, with 0 representing a gene’s mean expression across the tissue, and positive or negative values corresponding to the Z-score of a calculated expression value. To address the confounding effect of global variation in gene expression, we compared groups of genes against all other genes within a cell type, and asked if some groups of genes behave as outliers in a given cell type. For de novo genes, we compared the scaled, average expression of putative de novo genes to every other gene within a cell type using a signed Wilcoxon test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilcoxon, 1945</xref>).</p><p>For groups of genes (e.g. de novo genes, DNA repair genes), we asked whether their scaled expression distribution in a cell type was statistically different from that of other genes. For every gene, we calculated its average scaled expression within each cell type, and then performed a Wilcoxon signed test to determine if the mean scaled expression of genes in the cell type was statistically higher or lower than all other genes in the same cell type. For each gene group and cell type, we adjusted the resulting p-values with Hochberg’s correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haynes, 2013</xref>).

(2) In every cell where a mutation was identified, the reference allele was either completely absent (possible homozygote) or present with as many or fewer reads as the alternate allele (possible heterozygote).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mutational and transcriptional dynamics across <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatogenesis at the single-cell level&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Helen White-Cooper (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very interesting study that reports single cell mRNA sequencing on male <italic>Drosophila</italic> gonads to look at the spermatogenesis developmental program. The authors also examine the expression timing of young genes that evolved de novo or that duplicated recently. The reviewers were enthusiastic about the work but they raised major concerns that would need to be addressed. All of these concerns except one require only partial re-analysis et re-interpretation of the results. One of them concerns the integrity of the material subjected to single-cell sequencing. Although we understand that it is not possible to repeat the entire protocol, we agreed on the fact that a critical assessment of the staging and assignment to categories was required. We would also like to see a repeat of the cell preparation so that the reader can have more confidence in what they are seeing for different cell types.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For non-drosophilist readers, it is very important that the authors explain early on that male <italic>Drosophila</italic> do not typically undergo meiotic recombination. This has important implications for the interpretation of some of the results (especially the section on mutational load).</p><p>2) The single cell sequencing experiments were conducted on a pool of testes from 50 flies. We can appreciate that single cells are being profiled and this is some kind of within experiment replication, but this does not provide us with information on how reproducible the entire experiment is. The authors may have access to more data or independent data that would allow to demonstrate the reproducibility of the analyses. If it is the case, it would be useful to provide an analysis of such data. In addition, it is unclear to me how single-cell RNA-seq data is normalized (or not) and what the variance level is among cells. This seems like an important point that needs to be considered (whether the authors think this is a problem or not). If spermatocytes have overall higher transcriptional activity than other cell types (which could be the case considering more genes and mRNA molecular are detected, Figure 2A,B), this could in turn increase power to detect de novo genes, especially if these tend to be expressed at low levels (and affect some conclusions drawn, e.g. de novo genes to be expressed in higher proportion at the early spermatocyte stage, Figure 2C).</p><p>3) The identification of de novo mutations needs to be supported or discussed. Two reviewers were convinced but another one raised these points. It is surprising that many mutations are identified. Also, the analysis needs to be refined. The tissues examined are from a pool of flies. Are mutations from different individuals? 73 substitutions means about 1.5 substitution per fly since 50 flies are studied. Are mutations identified at one stage carried on to the next stage in the data? The per-base mutation rate would need to take into account the number of cell divisions, no? Are all stages going through cell division?</p><p>4) Could the authors make a prediction as to what active lesion repair vs death of cells carrying unrepaired lesions would look like in their data? I think the latter is more likely than the former given the observations (and that this is a very important and exciting result that could stand out more), because I predict that lesions would be difficult to transcribe (and perhaps lead to various nt misincorporation?), but I could be wrong. If correct, this result has important implications with respect to selective pressure within the testis.</p><p>5) The critical point of this paper in terms of determining whether the conclusions are supported by the data is the generation and interpretation of the single cell sequencing data, and one expert reviewer remains to be convinced by all of it. She would be much more reassured that the cells are healthy and intact if pictures were shown of them after the isolation, preferably after sorting. Is the sorting system capable of dealing with cells that are 1mm long? The RNA content of spermatids is reported to be low in this data set. It could be, but it could also be that these cells are not intact in the sample, and only a fragment of the cell has made it into the sequencing. Clearly recovery of late spermatids has been inefficient in this sequencing as there are only 84 such cells from the 5000 cells sequenced. About half of the germline cells in the testis are post-meiotic, so a much higher number of spermatids is to be expected. Similarly, what happens to the cyst cells after they have been dissociated? Their normal morphology is very flat (and concave, wrapped around the germline). The results suggest that these cells express many genes, but again &quot;cells&quot; in this class could also include fragments of other cell types – the relatively high expression of <italic>fzo, twe, soti, Dpy-30L2</italic> and <italic>p-cup</italic>, all genes that are reported to be germline specific in this class is therefore of concern.</p><p>6) The integrity of the starting cell population probably does not majorly impact the most abundant cell types spermatogonia and early vs late spermatocytes, however I am not sure the transitions between these cell types are accurately annotated. – &quot;We found that <italic>twe</italic> expression peaked later in spermatogenesis (546) than <italic>fzo</italic>, and concluded that clusters expressing <italic>twe</italic> but not <italic>fzo</italic> were late spermatids.&quot; No, both these transcripts are present in early-mid and late primary spermatocytes, indeed <italic>fzo</italic> is not translated until the cells are secondary spermatocytes. <italic>twe</italic> translation is somewhat earlier. These two genes have very similar expression patterns according to RNA in situ. The data for <italic>twe</italic> and <italic>fzo</italic> in particular in Figure 3 do not show a strong distinction. Most of the cells in the dataset have reasonable levels of both genes suggesting that most cells are really primary spermatocytes. It would be better to use a gene that is transcribed earlier in spermatocytes, and declines as spermatocytes mature, to distinguish these cell types – eg <italic>aly</italic> or rye (Taf12L, PC2 contributor from Figure 1—figure supplement 1), or the ribosomal proteins.</p><p>7) We do not dispute the pseudotime trajectory that is calculated, it is the boundaries between classes that we are not sure of. In Figure 3 the transition between state 1 and state 2 seems to be at the very end of differentiation, forced on the timeline by the artefactual branch of somatic cells. There are surely more real biological states in this series, and the actual boundaries could be more accurately mapped. E.g., the rapid decline in the number of transcripts present per cell at about 60% of pseudotime likely reflects the transition from spermatocytes through meiosis to early spermatid elongation – a phase at which many transcripts are degraded.</p><p>8) The class named as mature spermatids are probably not fully mature.</p><p>9) Figure 4 would be much easier to interpret if it also included z-score tracks on the pseudotime plot for the markers used in assigning cell type for reference (i.e., <italic>bam, vasa</italic> etc).</p><p>10) Figure 4—figure supplement 1 is not possible to interpret as shown. The order of genes appears to be different for the parental vs child sets. What this figure needs to show is each pair of genes and their expression in pseudotime, aligned with each other, not clustered within their own class.</p><p>11) Abstract. &quot;the distribution of new genes across cell types&quot; is a misleading phrasing. All cell types have all genes. We are not sure exactly what is meant here. Introduction &quot; The testis is a highly heterogeneous tissue&quot;, is it really more heterogenous than other tissues (gut, brain, etc?).</p><p>12) Results paragraph five and the following: please explain on what basis these de novo genes were identified. Were they identified from transcript in the male gonads? If yes, they are not a random set of de novo genes and may be biased depending on how the mRNA data was collected in the original study. It would be more useful to identify de novo genes from the data itself and look at their age, population frequency, stage at which they are seen, etc. If the original paper just looked at bulk testis expression, the most abundant cell types in the extract will be overrepresented, biasing the discovery of de novo genes in the stages with more coverage. Since the main result of the paper relates to de novo genes, this part of the analysis needs to be strengthened.</p><p>13) Results paragraph six. The authors show that de novo genes are initially expressed in some specific cell types and they conclude that spermatocyte expression is an important step for de novo origination. Important is vague term and the reader does not understand what is being shown and supported.</p><p>14) Figure 2C: The authors write: &quot;For every cell type except spermatocytes, segregating de novo genes are the least commonly expressed&quot;. It seems that segregating de novo genes are always the least expressed, including in the spermatocytes. Also, this analysis shows that in early spermatocytes, fixed de novo genes are more expressed that all other genes. This is an example of bias that I was mentioning in my second point. If this stage is more represented in the study that identified de novo genes, it is not surprising that the de novo genes studied here are more expressed there because they needed to be highly expressed to be discovered in the first place.</p><p>15) The comparison with gene duplicates needs more work. The authors need to make sure the duplicates are matched with the de novo genes in terms of their age and maybe also size since detectability by RNAseq could be biased towards longer transcripts. Finally, the mechanisms of duplication needs to be taken into account (RNA based gene duplication versus tandem duplication versus other mechanisms). Very young duplicates are also probably difficult to differentiate at the RNA level.</p><p>16) The high proportion of fixed de novo genes expressed in spermatocytes is not unexpected, and fits with the theory that spermatocyte chromatin is permissive for transcription. Most of these genes are testis-specifically expressed, and most testis-specifically expressed genes are expressed in spermatocytes. The &quot;all genes&quot; class includes genes that are expressed earlier in the germline and in somatic cells. If testis-specifically expressed old genes were analysed they would likely have the same pattern as the de novo genes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47138.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For non-drosophilist readers, it is very important that the authors explain early on that male Drosophila do not typically undergo meiotic recombination.

First, we checked the expression correlation between a bulk RAL517 RNA-seq data (Zhao et al., 2014) and the “bulked” RAL517 single-cell RNA-seq data (treating single-cell RNA seq data as bulk data), these data correlate with a Pearson’s R of 0.97, indicating that the single-cell sequencing data has accurately captured the testis transcriptome in a reproducible fashion. This suggest that although there may be bias for single-cell sorting, this bias is very small and may largely be biased against late spermatid and mature sperm. In addition, we correlated TPM’s from our sample with a separate library from a different <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strain from our lab, also with a Pearson’s R of 0.97. As such, our data are robust with respect to biological and technical variation. This also suggest that although there might be some degree of batch effects for single-cell RNA-seq data, this is unlikely impact RNA expression pattern globally. This result was added to Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it is unclear to me how single-cell RNA-seq data is normalized (or not) and what the variance level is among cells. This seems like an important point that needs to be considered (whether the authors think this is a problem or not).</p></disp-quote><p>To normalize our data, we used Seurat’s normalizeData function with default parameters. Regarding normalization, the program used log-normalization. Specifically, according to Seurat’s documentation, “Feature counts for each cell are divided by the total counts for that cell and multiplied by the scale.factor (default=10,000). This is then natural-log transformed using log1p.” This log-normalization and a subsequent scaling step ensure that higher transcriptional activity of a given cell type does not bias our ability to infer relative gene expression across cell types. We expanded the Materials and method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If spermatocytes have overall higher transcriptional activity than other cell types (which could be the case considering more genes and mRNA molecular are detected, Figure 2A,B), this could in turn increase power to detect de novo genes, especially if these tend to be expressed at low levels (and affect some conclusions drawn, e.g. de novo genes to be expressed in higher proportion at the early spermatocyte stage, Figure 2C).</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that our study only seeks to analyze previously characterized de novo genes, and will inherit the limitations of Zhao et al., 2014, the source paper for these segregating and fixed de novo genes. Zhao et al., 2014 detected de novo genes from bulk testis RNA-seq of multiple <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains, meaning that de novo genes that are enriched in a rare cell type may not be counted as de novo genes if their expression in the whole tissue does not reach a certain threshold. Despite this possibility we still observe many de novo genes with maximum expression in rare cell types such as germ line stem cells and spermatogonia. This shows that we are able to detect de novo genes from less abundant/transcriptionally active cells. In future studies, when the cost of single-cell sequencing comes down, we hope to use it to identify de novo genes that may be more cell-type specific than the genes currently known. These points are addressed in subsection “Preparation of custom annotation file for de novo gene analysis”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The identification of de novo mutations needs to be supported or discussed. Two reviewers were convinced but another one raised these points. It is surprising that many mutations are identified. Also, the analysis needs to be refined. The tissues examined are from a pool of flies. Are mutations from different individuals? 73 substitutions means about 1.5 substitution per fly since 50 flies are studied. Are mutations identified at one stage carried on to the next stage in the data? The per-base mutation rate would need to take into account the number of cell divisions, no? Are all stages going through cell division?</p></disp-quote><p>Putative de novo mutations are each likely unique to an individual. If a mutation were found in multiple individuals, it would likely be an inherited somatic variant and we would catch such variant alleles in somatic cells. For each of the mutations, we identified reads from somatic cells with the WT allele at that position, and the mutated allele is only present in germ cells. Each variant is also supported by multiple germ cell reads with different UMIs.</p><p>Since the data is a snapshot of every cell in the testis at the same time, we would expect de novo variants to be present in a single cell type since cells from a common progenitor differentiate simultaneously (except one daughter cell from GSC division). In reality, we observe some variants present in adjacent cell types, reflective of the fact that transitions between these cell types are a continuous, not binary phenomenon.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that “73 substitutions mean about 1.5 substitution per fly since 50 flies are studied”. However, because 73 substitutions are unlikely to reflect the total mutations in all 50 flies given that we only sequenced a small subset of the cells from the 50 flies, we think it would not be the most meaningful way to report the data. Additionally, some of the 77 positional variants are linked, leaving 44 total mutational events, not 73 (this is already accounted for in our previous analysis). We are hesitant to include the number of cell divisions in our calculated mutational load because based on the current resolution it is impossible to know during which cell division a variant arose, and some of our assigned cell types encompass multiple cell division cycles. We do agree with the reviewer that it is an interesting and important question to pursue in the future when the technique is advanced enough to provide such resolution. We have updated the manuscript to emphasize these points in subsection “Mutational load decreases throughout spermatogenesis” paragraph two.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Could the authors make a prediction as to what active lesion repair vs death of cells carrying unrepaired lesions would look like in their data? I think the latter is more likely than the former given the observations (and that this is a very important and exciting result that could stand out more), because I predict that lesions would be difficult to transcribe (and perhaps lead to various nt misincorporation?), but I could be wrong. If correct, this result has important implications with respect to selective pressure within the testis.</p></disp-quote><p>It is a very exciting and important question to consider, and we also hypothesize that the second model is likely. However, although we tried to identify differentially expressed cell-death related genes in the mutated cells, we were not able to distinguish these two models based on current knowledge. One of the major challenges is that there are not enough marker genes (especially cell-death related genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis) to be used to provide a statistical power. We are not aware of other ways to distinguish between active lesion repair and death of cells carrying unrepaired lesions, since either will result in removal of mutated cells. In the future, we or other colleagues in the field might be able to do a lineage-tracing experiment to show that cells transcribing a certain transgenic marker acquire and lose mutations during spermatogenesis. To make this point clearer, we expanded it in the Discussion subsection “Gene age and mode of origination affects gene expression bias across cell types”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The critical point of this paper in terms of determining whether the conclusions are supported by the data is the generation and interpretation of the single cell sequencing data, and one expert reviewer remains to be convinced by all of it. She would be much more reassured that the cells are healthy and intact if pictures were shown of them after the isolation, preferably after sorting.</p></disp-quote><p>High-quality data is the most important first step for this work. We appreciate the caution and the detailed point from the reviewer. In the original submission, we reported that the single cells with an average of 93-96% viability after sorting, this is a very high number of live cells for single-cell suspension. The other WT strain suspension yielded a similar viability of ~95%. To address her concern, we have included pictures of the single-cell suspension of the sequenced strains created with our protocol showing that cells are intact and form a range of sizes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). A very important point about the figures is that cells in vitro do not have the same observed size as in vivo, because cells are rarely perfectly round in vivo. Without physical forces from nearby cells, the vast majority of the cells in vitro are round cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the sorting system capable of dealing with cells that are 1mm long? The RNA content of spermatids is reported to be low in this data set. It could be, but it could also be that these cells are not intact in the sample, and only a fragment of the cell has made it into the sequencing. Clearly recovery of late spermatids has been inefficient in this sequencing as there are only 84 such cells from the 5000 cells sequenced. About half of the germline cells in the testis are post-meiotic, so a much higher number of spermatids is to be expected. Similarly, what happens to the cyst cells after they have been dissociated? Their normal morphology is very flat (and concave, wrapped around the germline). The results suggest that these cells express many genes, but again &quot;cells&quot; in this class could also include fragments of other cell types – the relatively high expression of fzo, twe, soti, Dpy-30L2 and pcup, all genes that are reported to be germline specific in this class is therefore of concern.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the above paragraph, we see variation in cell size – though the cell size differences are not as dramatic as in vivo – but not shape, and see no clusters of adhered cells or intact cysts. We did not observe evidence of fragmented cells or cell debris. It seems clear that the cytoplasmic bridges between conjoined germ cells have been broken and these have been separated from cyst cells. The trypsin, collagenase and filtration steps appear to have coerced these cell types present in our sample into a spherical shape, and none appeared larger than 30 uM, the maximum size allowed by the chromium controller. We saw spermatid-like cells with identifiable tails, and in our sequencing data we see clear evidence of their presence- the cluster-specific enrichment of <italic>p-cup</italic> and other late-spermatid genes. Their long shape means that spermatids must go through the Chromium controller channel in a precise orientation to be captured, resulting in a lower capture efficiency than other cells. However, although <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatids have long tails, they are not necessarily linear in solution, and the tail sometimes wraps around the cell body in a ball shape outside the testis. Although it is likely that the capture of these late-stage cells is inefficient, the captured cells show reasonable expression profiles of spermatid-specific genes. We agree with the reviewer that the testis contains many more spermatids than we have captured. In combination with response (2) that the single-cell sequencing result is highly consistent with bulk RNA-seq data, these results suggest that while some degree of bias is likely, the impact of this bias is relatively small.</p><p>Related to the shape of cyst cells, because the cells are not attached to each other, they assume a round or near round shape within the cell suspension. Regarding the expression of <italic>fzo, twe, soti, DPY-30L2</italic> and <italic>p-cup</italic> in cyst cells, we agree that expression of these genes is unexpected, which was largely due to the data presentation of Figure 1D. The clusters marked as cyst cells show specific enrichment of zfh1, indicating that this cluster definitely contains cyst cells. The original scaled color may be misleading, and we adjusted the scaled expression color pattern in Figure 1D to better show cluster-specific enrichment of key marker genes, and found that cyst cells show that <italic>fzo</italic> and <italic>twe</italic> were somewhat expressed in this cluster, but not <italic>Dpy-30L2</italic> or <italic>p-cup</italic> compared to other non-spermatid clusters, consistent with Figure 1C. This indicates that this cluster could contain cyst cells as well as some transcriptionally similar or physically adhered spermatocytes.</p><p>Our assigned spermatocyte clusters show no enrichment of <italic>Fas3</italic>, indicating that we have been conservative in our assignment of germ cells at the expense of some false negatives. While our assigned germ cell clusters appear to be relatively free of somatic cells, the somatic cell clusters may contain some misidentified germ cells. Our difficulties identifying true cyst cells indicate that for single-cell analysis of the cyst cell lineage, a future study might need to perform a FACS-purification step to remove germ cells or doublets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The integrity of the starting cell population probably does not majorly impact the most abundant cell types spermatogonia and early vs late spermatocytes, however I am not sure the transitions between these cell types are accurately annotated. – &quot;We found that twe expression peaked later in spermatogenesis (546) than fzo, and concluded that clusters expressing twe but not fzo were late spermatids.&quot; No, both these transcripts are present in early-mid and late primary spermatocytes, indeed fzo is not translated until the cells are secondary spermatocytes. twe translation is somewhat earlier. These two genes have very similar expression patterns according to RNA in situ. The data for twe and fzo in particular in Figure 3 do not show a strong distinction. Most of the cells in the dataset have reasonable levels of both genes suggesting that most cells are really primary spermatocytes. It would be better to use a gene that is transcribed earlier in spermatocytes, and declines as spermatocytes mature, to distinguish these cell types – eg aly or rye (Taf12L, PC2 contributor from Figure 1—figure supplement 1), or the ribosomal proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We apologize for a typo- “clusters expressing <italic>twe</italic> but not <italic>fzo</italic> were late spermatids” should have read “late spermatocytes.” We have since corrected it, and given that our observations about the peak expression patterns of <italic>fzo</italic> and <italic>twe</italic> have not been previously reported, we have sought to strengthen our early/late spermatocyte assignments with another gene, <italic>aly</italic>, which is known to decline throughout spermatogenesis. We have added <italic>aly</italic> to Figure 1D. As predicted by the reviewer, it is less commonly expressed in our assigned late spermatocytes than in early spermatocytes, strengthening our confidence in our cell-type predictions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) We do not dispute the pseudotime trajectory that is calculated, it is the boundaries between classes that we are not sure of. In Figure 3 the transition between state 1 and state 2 seems to be at the very end of differentiation, forced on the timeline by the artefactual branch of somatic cells. There are surely more real biological states in this series, and the actual boundaries could be more accurately mapped. E.g., the rapid decline in the number of transcripts present per cell at about 60% of pseudotime likely reflects the transition from spermatocytes through meiosis to early spermatid elongation – a phase at which many transcripts are degraded.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with this comment and suggestion that state 2 is not a real biological state. However, assigning discrete biological states along a pseudotime trajectory is tricky since the cell states exist not in discrete blocks, but in a continuum of gene expression. The most real, discrete biological state in our pseudotime trajectory is the difference between somatic cells and germ cells, so we have recolored Figure 3A to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The class named as mature spermatids are probably not fully mature.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised this term, and these cells are now called “late spermatids”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 4 would be much easier to interpret if it also included z-score tracks on the pseudotime plot for the markers used in assigning cell type for reference (i.e., bam, vasa etc).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion and we have added a marker track to Figure 4 as a visual aid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 4—figure supplement 1 is not possible to interpret as shown. The order of genes appears to be different for the parental vs child sets. What this figure needs to show is each pair of genes and their expression in pseudotime, aligned with each other, not clustered within their own class.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 4—figure supplement 1 now includes all <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>-specific duplicate genes detected in our library, aligned with their parental copies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Abstract. &quot;the distribution of new genes across cell types&quot; is a misleading phrasing. All cell types have all genes. We are not sure exactly what is meant here. Introduction &quot; The testis is a highly heterogeneous tissue&quot;, is it really more heterogenous than other tissues (gut, brain, etc?).</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the sentences to “To investigate the expression patterns of genetic novelties across different testis cell types, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis. We found that new genes were expressed in various cell types, the patterns of which may be influenced by their mode of origination” and “The testis is a highly transcriptionally active tissue”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Results paragraph five and the following: please explain on what basis these de novo genes were identified. Were they identified from transcript in the male gonads? If yes, they are not a random set of de novo genes and may be biased depending on how the mRNA data was collected in the original study. It would be more useful to identify de novo genes from the data itself and look at their age, population frequency, stage at which they are seen, etc. If the original paper just looked at bulk testis expression, the most abundant cell types in the extract will be overrepresented, biasing the discovery of de novo genes in the stages with more coverage. Since the main result of the paper relates to de novo genes, this part of the analysis needs to be strengthened.</p></disp-quote><p>In Zhao et al., 2014, segregating and fixed de novo genes were identified based on transcription in the testis of several strains of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. They were characterized as segregating or fixed based on their frequency across different strains. Since our single cell preparation correlates extremely well with whole-tissue RNA sequencing (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), it is reasonable to examine previously identified de novo genes from whole tissue. Identifying segregating de novo genes from a single-cell preparation would be ideal, but is not possible now because it requires libraries from multiple <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains and libraries from outgroup species with ultra-deep sequencing that is beyond the scope of this study. Until the costs of single-cell sequencing come down, using previously identified de novo genes from bulk testis RNA-seq data is the best available option. We do completely agree with the reviewers that genes that are expressed in the less abundant cell types are difficult to identify and study, which is a challenge using the RNA-seq method. We discussed this point in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Results paragraph six. The authors show that de novo genes are initially expressed in some specific cell types and they conclude that spermatocyte expression is an important step for de novo origination. Important is vague term and the reader does not understand what is being shown and supported.</p></disp-quote><p>We toned down the statement. Given our new finding that early spermatocytes express a greater fraction of fixed de novo genes than testis-specific genes or all other genes, this section now reads: “The high proportion of de novo genes expressed in spermatocytes suggests that such genes may play functional roles in these cells and development stage.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure 2C: The authors write: &quot;For every cell type except spermatocytes, segregating de novo genes are the least commonly expressed&quot;. It seems that segregating de novo genes are always the least expressed, including in the spermatocytes. Also, this analysis shows that in early spermatocytes, fixed de novo genes are more expressed that all other genes. This is an example of bias that I was mentioning in my second point. If this stage is more represented in the study that identified de novo genes, it is not surprising that the de novo genes studied here are more expressed there because they needed to be highly expressed to be discovered in the first place.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the misunderstanding. Figure 2C shows that a lower proportion of segregating de novo genes are detected in a given cell type or cluster, but this does not indicate that they were lowly expressed in a given cell type. We added a sentence reading “It is important to note that this measure looks at the number of genes of each type detected, not the expression level of each, and does not distinguish between high and low expression”. Related to the last point that we may have more power to detect gene expression and expression bias for enriched cell types, we overall agree with the reviewer’s point, which was discussed and addressed in response 12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The comparison with gene duplicates needs more work. The authors need to make sure the duplicates are matched with the de novo genes in terms of their age and maybe also size since detectability by RNAseq could be biased towards longer transcripts. Finally, the mechanisms of duplication needs to be taken into account (RNA based gene duplication versus tandem duplication versus other mechanisms). Very young duplicates are also probably difficult to differentiate at the RNA level.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point and we have revised Figure 4—figure supplement 1, and accompanying text in the revised version. We agree that it is important to compare young duplicate genes with de novo genes of the same age, and have accordingly corrected Figure 4 to show only <italic>melanogaster</italic>-specific de novo and duplicate genes. We can only detect the expression of 14 of these duplicate genes, however, and 12 of them are tandem duplicate genes, and 2 are retroposed genes. This means that while we can make a fair comparison of expression patterns between <italic>melanogaster</italic>-specific duplicate genes and de novo genes, just using <italic>melanogaster</italic>-specific genes we cannot make inferences on the relationship between duplication mechanism and testis expression pattern.</p><p>If child duplicate genes are indistinguishable from their parental copies at the sequence level, the two copies would show the same general expression pattern across spermatogenesis. We only observed this for a small number of parental/child gene duplicates, giving us confidence that this is not a significant source of bias in our data (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The high proportion of fixed de novo genes expressed in spermatocytes is not unexpected, and fits with the theory that spermatocyte chromatin is permissive for transcription. Most of these genes are testis-specifically expressed, and most testis-specifically expressed genes are expressed in spermatocytes. The &quot;all genes&quot; class includes genes that are expressed earlier in the germline and in somatic cells. If testis-specifically expressed old genes were analysed they would likely have the same pattern as the de novo genes.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a keen observation, and we have therefore revised the analysis to account for such bias by adding testis-specific genes to our scaled expression comparisons in Figures 2, 4, and 5. We defined testis-specific genes as any gene that, in FlyAtlas2 data, had FPKM &gt;2 in testis and &lt;1 in every other tissue (except whole male). In Figure 4A we can now see that in most cell types de novo genes tend to show scaled expression between all other genes and testis-specific genes. In late spermatogonia and early spermatocytes, fixed de novo genes are expressed similarly to testis-specific genes, while segregating de novo genes are rarer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
