Unlike extensively investigated postsynaptic differentiation, less is known about mechanisms of presynaptic assembly. Genetic evidence of Wnt in mammalian NMJ development was missing due to the existence of multiple Wnts and their receptors. We show when Wnt secretion is abolished from motoneurons by mutating the Wnt ligand secretion mediator (Wls) gene, mutant mice showed muscle weakness and neurotransmission impairment. NMJs were unstable with reduced synaptic junctional folds and fragmented AChR clusters. Nerve terminals were swollen; synaptic vesicles were fewer and mislocated. The presynaptic deficits occurred earlier than postsynaptic deficits. Intriguingly, these phenotypes were not observed when deleting Wls in muscles or Schwann cells. We identified Wnt7A and Wnt7B as major Wnts for nerve terminal development in rescue experiments. These observations demonstrate a necessary role of motoneuron Wnts in NMJ development, in particular presynaptic differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuromuscular junction</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>presynapse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0104903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Chengyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004731</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LR17H090001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Chengyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31671040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Chengyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31701036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Kejing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE15654 and DE26936</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsu</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG045781</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wen-Cheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS082007, NS090083, AG051510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mei</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel role of motoneuron Wnts in regulating presynaptic development at the neuromuscular junction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a peripheral synapse between motoneurons and skeletal muscle fibers that is critical to control muscle contractions. Dysfunction of this synapse has been implicated in various neurological disorders including congenital myasthenia syndrome (CMS), myasthenia gravis (MG), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanes and Lichtman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). During NMJ formation, acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) become concentrated at the postjunctional membrane whereas axon terminals differentiate to form active zones that align precisely to AChR clusters on junctional folds. NMJ development requires intimate interaction between motor nerve terminals and muscle fibers. For example, motoneurons produce agrin that binds its receptor LRP4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4) in muscle fibers and activates the muscle specific kinase MuSK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bezakova and Ruegg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeChiara et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McMahan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).The agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling is necessary for NMJ formation, in particular postsynaptic AChR clustering. In contrast to postsynaptic differentiation, much less is known about mechanisms of presynaptic assembly of the NMJ.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that Wnt ligands may regulate synapse development in mammals. Regarding NMJ development, Wnts can induce AChR clusters by themselves and can promote agrin-induced AChR clustering in cultured C2C12 myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barik et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). These effects seem to require the extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of MuSK, which is homologous to that in the Wnt receptor Frizzled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hubbard and Gnanasambandan, 2013</xref>). Deleting the CRD was shown to impair in vivo NMJ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Messéant et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Strochlic et al., 2012</xref>) although this notion was challenged by another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Remédio et al., 2016</xref>). Intracellularly, MuSK interacts with disheveled (Dvl1), the key scaffold protein in the Wnt signal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 2002</xref>). In Zebrafish, Wnt binding to the CRD of MuSK and MuSK interaction with Dvl are necessary for guiding axons to the middle region of muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jing et al., 2009</xref>). Mutant mice lacking or overexpressing β-catenin, a key mediator of the Wnt canonical pathway, in muscle fibers display both pre- and postsynaptic deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2012a</xref>). In terms of synapses in the brain, Dvl1 expresses higher in axons than dendrites, especially in growth cones of cultured hippocampus neurons, suggesting a role of Wnt pathway in presynaptic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Cerebella granule cells secret Wnt7A to induce axon and growth cone remodeling, including Synapsin 1 puncta clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2000</xref>). Inducing the expression of Dickkopf1, a secreted Wnt antagonist, decreases the number of cortico-striatal synapses in adult mice. The remaining excitatory terminals contain fewer synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galli et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are 19 different Wnts in rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barik et al., 2014b</xref>), many of which have redundant functions, making it difficult to reveal convincingly the function of Wnt ligands in vivo. In this study, we investigated the role of Wnt ligands in NMJ formation by taking the advantage of Wnt ligand secretion mediator (Wls). Wls is a seven-transmembrane protein that is necessary for sorting and transporting Wnts from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hausmann et al., 2007</xref>). In Drosophila Wls mutants, Wingless (the homolog of vertebrate Wnt1) is retained intracellularly and cannot be secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bänziger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartscherer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodman et al., 2006</xref>). Wls null mouse embryos exhibit defects in establishment of the body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2009</xref>). We generated mutant mice that lacked Wls specifically in motorneurons, skeletal muscles, or Schwann cells and characterized NMJ development by using a combination of morphological and functional approaches. We have also identified the Wnt ligands whose secretion requires Wls and determined whether the NMJ deficits of HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice could be ameliorated by supplying candidate Wnts. Our results support a model where motoneurons secret Wnts such as Wnt7A and Wnt7B for nerve terminal differentiation, suggesting dysregulation of Wnt signaling as a pathological mechanism of neuromuscular disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unique Wnt expression patterns in motoneurons, Schwann cells and muscles</title><p>The NMJ is a tripartite synapse consisting of muscle fibers, Schwann cells, and motoneuron terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darabid et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2010</xref>).

We crossed Wls<sup>f/f</sup> mice with HSA::Cre and Wnt1::Cre mice, respectively. Resulting HSA-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice and Wnt1-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice were produced at expected ratios following the Mendel rule with comparable body size to control (HSA::Cre or Wls<sup>f/f</sup>) mice. Western blot showed that, most, if not all of Wls proteins were lost in skeletal muscle homogenates in HSA-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To characterize NMJs, muscles were stained whole-mount with antibodies against neurofilament (anti-NF) and synaptophysin (anti-Syn) to label axons and nerve terminal synaptic vesicles, and rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (R-BTX) to visualize postsynaptic AChR clusters. HSA-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice appeared to be normal at birth without apparent deficits in AChR clusters (number and location), motor nerve terminals (arborization) and innervation of AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). These results were in agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Remédio et al., 2016</xref>) and indicate that muscle Wls is dispensable for NMJ formation.</p><p>Western blotting of sciatic nerve homogenates revealed a reduction of Wls protein in Wnt1-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The residual level of Wls protein was likely to be from nerve axons.

Unlike axonal shedding which was observed in a small number of NMJs, axonal swellings in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice were observed in 53.5 ± 3.2% of nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Some swellings were co-stained with dispersed AChR signal, suggesting a problem of mutant axons in inducing AChR clusters. In addition to axonal swellings, nerve terminals in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice became detached from AChR arrays, causing misalignment between nerve terminals and AChR clusters (blue arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consequently, the area of AChR arrays that were covered by nerve terminals was reduced in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) (73.6 ± 7.1% in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> vs 100 ± 3.7% in control, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>To further characterize axonal swellings, we utilized Rosa-tdTomato reporter mice where tdTomato expression is controlled by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette.

In diaphragms of control mice, tdTomato-labeled axons were transparent in secondary and tertiary branches, and each terminal ended with a pretzel-like enlargement. However, in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice, in addition to these transparent axon branches and terminals, many branches appeared to contain aggregates. Axon terminals in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice appeared as individual swellings without characteristic pretzel-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Quantitatively, 53% of axon terminals lost the pretzel-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), in agreement with the result from immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Together, these morphological results demonstrate that motoneuron-specific Wls mutant mice were able to form NMJs, but displayed axonal deficits at adult, indicating an age-dependent requirement of Wls in NMJ maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Reduced synaptic vesicles, junctional folds and increased synaptic cleft width</title><p>To further characterize NMJ defects, we performed EM analysis.

These unique structures ensure the neurotransmitter ACh, released from axonal terminals, to be efficiently captured by AChRs on the crest of junctional folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanes and Lichtman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2010</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, mEPP amplitudes were reduced in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice, compared with controls (1.20 ± 0.08 mV in control vs 0.76 ± 0.06 mV in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup>; p&lt;0.01), indicative of reduced AChR density. mEPP frequencies were also decreased by ~40% in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> diaphragms, compared with control (0.78 ± 0.03 Hz in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> vs 1.20 ± 0.08 Hz in control, p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>). This result demonstrates deficits in spontaneous ACh release from motor nerve terminals, consistent with morphological presynaptic defects in mice lacking Wls in motoneurons. We observed similar electrophysiological defects at P15 HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Such deficits may result as a consequence of deteriorated presynaptic terminals. This hypothesis would predict that mutant mice at earlier age display only presynaptic, but not postsynaptic deficits. To test this hypothesis, mEPPs were measured in diaphragm at neonatal pups (P1) when the NMJ morphology appeared normal. mEPP frequency in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> NMJs was reduced by 42% (0.042 ± 0.003 Hz in control vs 0.022 ± 0.002 Hz in mutant, p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and I</xref>), indicative of presynaptic deficits.

These functional results demonstrate that presynaptic deficits occurred in advance of postsynaptic deficits, agreeing the notion that EM and electrophysiological analysis are more sensitive in revealing NMJ deficits than light microscope analysis.</p><p>To further test this model, we studied effects of carbochol (CCh), an ACh agonist, on neurotransmission in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice. CCh (10 µM) increased both mEPP frequency and amplitude at P1 and P30 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–5I</xref>), in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katz and Miledi, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miyamoto and Volle, 1974</xref>).

Nevertheless, mEPP frequency and amplitude in the presence of CCh were lower in mutant, compared with control at age of P30.

To test this hypothesis, we determined whether Wnt5A, Wnt7A, Wnt7B, and Wnt9B recombinant proteins were able to diminish NMJ deficits in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice. TA muscles of mutant pups were injected with respective Wnts or vehicle (as control) 10 times, once every three days for a period of 30 days. Remarkably, muscles injected with Wnt7A and Wnt7B displayed fewer axon swellings, compared with muscles injected with vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). This effect appeared to be specific because muscles injected Wnt5A or Wnt9B displayed similar number of axon swellings (NMJs with swellings: 22.7 ± 3.0% in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup>; 17.9 ± 3.9% in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> + Wnt5A; 10.1 ± 2.7% in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> + Wnt7A; 12.2 ± 1.5 in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> + Wnt7B; 19.4 ± 2.4% in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> + Wnt9B).

Here we found that blocking Wnt secretion from motoneurons causes NMJ degeneration evidenced by muscle weakness, impaired neurotransmission, distorted NMJ structure, motor axonal terminal swelling, and synaptic vesicle reduction. Rescue experiments identified Wnt7A and Wnt7B as key Wnts secreted from motoneurons for NMJ development. Our results provide a novel role of Wnt ligand secretion from motoneurons in NMJ development and maintenance.</p><p>NMJ deficits were observed in mice lacking Wls in motoneurons. The 19 Wnts have different expression patterns in motoneurons, Schwann cells, and muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Dominant Wnts in motoneurons are Wnt7A, Wnt3, Wnt7B, and Wnt4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), of which Wnt7A and Wnt7B are sensitive to Wls regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, these two Wnts are able to diminish NMJ deficits in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A parsimonious explanation of these results is that motoneurons release Wnt7A and Wnt7B to regulate NMJ development. Knockout Wls in Schwann cells or muscles alone or together with motoneurons seemed to have little effect on NMJ morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). In agreement, no apparent NMJ deficits were detected when Wls was knocked out in muscles by Pax3::Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Remédio et al., 2016</xref>). These results could suggest that motoneuron Wnts cannot be compensated by Wnts from skeletal muscle fibers or Schwann cells. A more detailed analysis of NMJs in the triple knockout mice will help to dissect whether motoneuron Wnts compensate Wnts from Schwann cells or muscles during NMJ formation.</p><p>How does motoneuron Wnts regulate NMJ development? In vitro, Wnt7A was shown to inhibit agrin-induced AChR clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barik et al., 2014b</xref>). However, we did not observe a change in AChR cluster size or intensity after Wnt7A injection (data not shown). Rather, Wnt7A reduced the number of axonal swellings and functionally rescued neurotransmission impairment in the HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup>, suggesting that Wnt7A mainly acts on nerve terminals in the mutant. This notion is supported following two lines of evidence. First, the unique presynaptic phenotypes of HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice - swollen axon terminals and enlarged varicosities were not observed in MuSK or Rapsyn mutant mice where AChR clusters were abolished and nerve terminals arborize extensively (without swellings, however) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeChiara et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gautam et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Second, they were not observed in muscle-specific β-catenin knockout or transgenic mice overexpressing β-catenin in muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2012a</xref>). Wnt7A has been reported to initiate both canonical and non-canonical pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heasley and Winn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Posokhova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">von Maltzahn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Winn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). However, motoneuron-specific deletion of β-catenin does not impair NMJ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2015a</xref>), excluding a role of canonical pathway in motoneurons. Interestingly, Wnt non-canonical JNK pathway has been reported to regulate axonal transport of vesicles in C. elegans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrd et al., 2001</xref>). Many Frizzled were detectable in the ventral horns of the spinal cord, Schwann cells, and muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Future experiments are warranted to determine whether Wnt non-canonical pathways and which wnt receptor(s) regulate NMJ development in mammals.</p><p>Presynaptic defects in HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice occur prior to postsynaptic defects evidenced by the reduction of mEPP frequency, but not amplitude, in P1 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The cause to postsynaptic deficits could be complex. Because Wnts can directly regulate postsynaptic AChR assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barik et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), lack of Wnts from motoneurons may thus impair postsynaptic assembly. When N-box of the AChR ε-subunit promoter is mutated, this leads to AChR deficiency and severely impaired transmission at the NMJ, but postsynaptic membrane appears normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nichols et al., 1999</xref>). On the other hand, neurotransmission blockade by botulinum toxin disrupts NMJ morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rogozhin et al., 2008</xref>). Problems with presynaptic assembly may impair synaptic basal lamina. In fact, in mutant mice synaptic basal lamina was disorganized without a high-density midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This could be a mechanism of loss of postsynaptic structures.</p><p>SV2 staining is progressively restricted from axon to the nerve terminal during NMJ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lupa and Hall, 1989</xref>). This is thought to indicate active vesicle transportation during neural development. In agreement, SV2 signal was low and sparse in wild type mice at two months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, SV2 and Synapsin 1 another marker of synaptic vesicle, were increased in axons of adult mutant mice by staining and Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>), which is similar to the phenotype when autophagy is dysregulated in axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lüningschrör et al., 2017</xref>). This could be a reason to reduced synaptic vesicles at mutant NMJs. At the same, increased vesicle proteins in axons may be indicative of axon regeneration in the absence of Wls. In addition to increased SV2 levels, SV2-positive aggregates were detected in Wls mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, the nature of these aggregates is unknown. They may be inclusion bodies containing SV2 proteins for degradation. Nevertheless, such axon terminals swellings and varicosities are observed in NMJs recovering from Botulinum toxin poisoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rogozhin et al., 2008</xref>) and resemble those of nerve degeneration during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lüningschrör et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Valdez et al., 2010</xref>). Together, these observations are indicative of reinnervation in response to functional denervation. It would be interesting to determine whether Wnts from motoneurons regulate synapse regeneration and their loss of function precipitates the NMJ senescence.</p><p>It is worthy pointing out that the above conclusion is based on an assumption that Wls is a cargo receptor for all 19 Wnts’ secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gross et al., 2012</xref>). Apparently, this might not be the case because individual Wnt has different sensitivities to Wls deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In agreement, Zebrafish Wls mutants are surprisingly normal in early development, in contrast to Wnt5B and Wnt11 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuan et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that some Wnts may be regulated in a Wls-independent manner. For example, Wls-antisense morpholino was shown to severely impair membrane localization of Wnt5B, but not Wnt11 in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2015a</xref>). WntD in Drosophila does not require lipidation by Porcupine and thus may be secreted independent of Wls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ching et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richards et al., 2014</xref>). Wnt3A seems not responsive to Wls overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galli et al., 2016</xref>). It is also possible that there is another not-yet-reported Wls-like homology gene in the rodents. It would be interesting to determine whether NMJ development is regulated by Wls-insensitive and/or Wls-independent Wnts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Wls<sup>f/f</sup> mice, in which the exon 3 of <italic>Wls</italic> gene was flanked by loxp sites, were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2011</xref>).

Data were collected with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, digitized (10 kHz low-pass filtered) with Digidata 1322A, and analyzed in Clampfit 9.2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blot</title><p>Western blot was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2008</xref>), with primary antibodies: anti-Wls (rabbit, 1:500, home-made) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), Synapsin 1 (rabbit, 1:1000, CST, 5297), anti-GAPDH (mouse, 1:5000, Proteintech, Cat# 60004), and anti-α-tubulin (mouse, 1:3000, Santa Cruz, Cat# 23948). After washing, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (1:5000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 31430 and 31460). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Autoradiographic films were scanned with an Epson 1680 scanner, and captured images were analyzed with Image J.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Motoneuron sorting</title><p>Spinal cords were freshly isolated from HB9:Cre;tdTomato mice (P0) with cold Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> free PBS. Tissues were minced to small pieces with scissors and digested by 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA at 37°C for 15–30 min. Trypsin activity was stopped by adding the same amount of 10% FBS/DMEM. Cells were dissociated from each other by repeated pipetting. After filtering through 40 µm mesh (BD, Becton,Dickinson and Company), cells were spun down by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 3 min at 4°C and suspended in the sorting buffer (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> free PBS with 1 mM EDTA; 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 1% FBS).

It is driven by reciprocal interactions of pre- and postsynaptic cells. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are poorly understood, even at the best investigated synapse, the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The crucial factor from the motor neuron driving postsynaptic muscle differentiation is neural agrin acting through its receptor/effector LRP4 and RTK MuSK. In addition to driving postsynaptic muscle membranes in response to MuSK activation muscle fibers are thought to act back on motor neurites to drive nerve terminal differentiation through mechanisms that may involve Wnt signalling.</p><p>In recent years, evidence, some of it conflicting, for an involvement of Wnts, in various ways, in modulating rodent NMJ formation has been accumulating. Investigating their involvement in NMJ formation has been complicated by the fact, that some 18 Wnts have been identified in mammals. In the present paper, authors demonstrate by genetic approaches that Wnts secreted from motor neurons is involved in presynaptic terminal differentiation and function. Specifically, genetic deletion of Wnt ligand secretion mediator, Wls, in motor neurons, but not in Schwann cells or in muscle fibers, impair functional differentiation and maintenance of rodent NMJs. As Wls is required for sorting and transport to the cell surface and, thus, for secretion of various Wnts, these data indicate that Wnts secreted from motor neurons are involved in NMJ maintenance. Specifically, evidence is presented that the Wnt required for NMJ maintenance is Wnt 7A. Reinnervation experiments further show that Wls mutant motor axons show a deficit in their capacity to reinnervate old endplate sites upon severing the nerve. This paper is thus an important contribution towards full understanding of NMJ formation and implicates dysregulation of Wnt signalling as a potential mechanism of certain neuromuscular disorders.</p><p>Although overall, the data support the conclusion, I feel that some of the mechanisms proposed appear overinterpreted. Attention should be given to phrasing that accurately reflects what the figures actually show. The points below can probably be dealt with readily.</p><p>Figure 1D: Authors conclude from grip strength reduction in Wls mutants that muscle function is impaired. For a meaningful comparison of muscle function grip strengths should be compared not only between adults of same age, but also between animals of same weight! Part of the grip strength reduction in mutants could arise from lower muscle mass associated with lower body weight of the latter.</p><p>Results section: NMJ formation appears………: It is stated that NMJs are characterized in mouse embryos.

Varicosities similar to those seen primarily in Wls mutants are also observed in NMJs recovering from Botulinus toxin poisoning. Thus, they may be indicative of reinnervation in response to functional denervation, as is suggested by neuromuscular transmission failure in the mutants (Figure 5). This should be mentioned in the Discussion section.</p><p>It is striking that at two months, SV2 staining in w.t. muscle is still strong, as in Figure 3A. Lupa and Hall, (1989) have described that unlike during fetal development, SV2 is no longer visible in motor axons of adult animals (&gt;2 weeks postnatal). Have the authors made out a difference between SV2 stainings in w.t. vs Wls mutant axons, as is suggested by the Western blot in Figure 6D? This could be important for the interpretation of varicosity formation potentially reflecting axon regeneration in Wls mutants. Discuss!</p><p>In Figure legend 3, the age of the animals should be given.</p><p>Reduced synaptic vesicles……..: It is not clear, how from EM sections such as those in Figure 4A centre, with their inhomogenous distribution of synaptic vesicles in the nerve terminals, synaptic vesicle densities can be derived quantitatively (as claimed in Figure 4B). Describe!. Were there also mutant terminals with normal vesicle densities, as would be expected from high SV2 aggregates opposed to high density AChR clusters (see Figure 6B)? Furthermore, is the lack of a basal lamina in the synaptic cleft (as shown in Figure 4A bottom), commonly observed in the mutants? It could be related to loss of postsynaptic structures.</p><p>Subsection “Impaired neuromuscular transmission”: it is stated that &quot;postsynaptic deficits were likely caused by reduced neuromuscular transmission&quot;. This interpretation is unlikely to be correct. For example, in AChR deficiency myasthenic syndrome (through a mutation in the AChRe promoter (specifically its N-box) with severely impaired transmission, postsynaptic membrane appears normal.</p><p>Clustered synaptic vesicles: based on differences in SV2 stainings, in their localized distribution in nerve terminals and accumulations in varicosities, and the higher SV2 immunoreactivity in sciatic nerves (Figure 6B, C, D) between w.t. and Wls mutant mice, it is suggested that synaptic vesicle transport may be impaired in Wls ablated axons, which would explain the lower vesicle density in the mutant nerve terminals. Although SV2 is considered a vesicle-specific protein, I find it risky to conclude from local aggregations in SV2 staining intensity the local aggregation of synaptic vesicles. For confirmation, EM analysis of vesicle densities in axonal varicosities would be required. Furthermore, in Figure 6B, some of the strong presynaptic SV2 accumulations in Wls mutants are opposed to strong AChR clusters, which is not consistent with the EM data in Figure 4.

The key approach is genetic deletion of the Wnt ligand secretion mediator (Wls) gene in motor neurons, muscles or Schwann cells. The analysis and the results in the current version of manuscript have not convincingly supported the conclusion.</p><p>1) Even though no detectable NMJ defects were found in the HSA::Cre and Wnt1::Cre Wls mutants, it would be crucial to show Wls is indeed completely absent in muscles and Schwann cells and there is no possibility that other Wls-like molecules can compensate for the loss. In particular, muscle fibers contain multiple nuclei and the reporter system (td-Tomato) cannot prove a complete deletion of Wls in all nuclei because the reporter molecule will diffuse and label the entire muscle fiber. It is a lingering concern for the HAS::Cre line when used in studying the NMJ at early developmental stages.</p><p>2) As Wnts are presumably secreted and bind their cognate receptors to function, a central question is what Wnts are expressed and secreted from muscles and Schwann cells. For example, does either cell type express Wnt 7A?</p><p>3) The HB9::Cre Wls mutants display grip strength deficits. But the analysis of the NMJ has only been done in the diaphragm muscle. It would be important to analyze other muscles that are directly relevant to grip strength phenotype.</p><p>4) If exogenous ACh agonists are applied, is the endplate potential normal?</p><p>5) The defect in synaptic vesicle aggregation is interesting. The authors tried to show increased SV2 protein levels in the sciatic nerve to support the finding, but the Figure 6C is not convincing. Since the sciatic nerve is mixed with many non-motor axons, it would have been more convincing to use pure motor nerves, e.g. phrenic nerve.</p><p>6) The nerve transplantation experiment is interesting, but it is less relevant to the conclusion. They can be completely removed.</p><p>7) The partial rescue of NMJ defects via injecting individual Wnt proteins is interesting but the results do not directly support the conclusion on cell autonomous Wnt signaling. It is a little bit hard to interpret the results without knowing what relevant Wnt receptors are expressed in cells involved in NMJ formation or maintenance. For example, even Wnt7A expression/secretion from motor neurons is reduced, it cannot rule out that motor neuron-derived Wnt7A activates muscle (or Schwann cell) pathways to elicit retrograde signals to promote presynaptic development unless the receptor(s) for Wnt7A (or other relevant Wnt molecules) is selectively deleted from motor neurons, not other cell types.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Here, Shen et al. report a very interesting study on a novel role for Wnt in presynaptic assembly in the neuromuscular junction. The authors used the main Wnt secretion mediator Wls to specifically abolish Wnt secretion in each of the three NMJ compartments (skeletal muscle, motor neurons and Schwann cells). They showed that only Wls deletion in motor neurons leads to age-dependent NMJ deficits and neurotransmission impairment in a cell-autonomous manner. Using a combination of morphological analysis, electron microscopy and electrophysiology, they characterized the NMJ deficits and nicely demonstrate that motoneuronal specific deletion of Wls results in progressive NMJ degeneration, muscle weakness, impaired neurotransmission, motor axonal swelling and synaptic vesicle reduction. They also showed that motoneuronal Wls is required for NMJ regeneration. From there, they screened for the Wnt ligands that are expressed in motoneurons and identified those whose secretion is regulated by Wls in heterologous HEK cells. Wnt5A and 7A were the most sensitive to Wls mutation. Injection of recombinant Wnt7A, but not Wnt5A in TA muscle can partially rescue the morphological presynaptic deficits of HB9-Wl-/-. Overall this is a very interesting study, the analysis of data was carefully performed and most of the main conclusions are supported by the provided results. However, although the finding that Wnt7A may play a role in presynaptic assembly is novel, the current study does not provide sufficient evidence to support this conclusion and it remains unclear how Wnts secretion from motoneurons contributes to presynaptic functions resulting in age-dependent NMJ dysfunction when altered.</p><p>The authors state that Wls deletion in motoneurons, but not skeletal muscle or Schwann cells shows NMJ defects. Given that several Wnts identified by the authors in motoneurons are known to regulate postsynaptic differentiation, some of them being low or not sensitive to Wls, there is a possibility that Wnts secreted by the motoneurons may have compensated the muscle and/or Schwann cells NMJ phenotypes. A more detailed analysis of the NMJ phenotypes during NMJ formation, including combined HSA and/or HB9 and/or Wnt1-Wls-/- should be performed to support their conclusions. I realized that it is a demanding task, but this is not unfeasible.</p><p>The authors identified several Wnts molecules expressed in motoneurons and showed that apart from Wnt7A and Wnt5A, several other (Wnt7B and Wnt9B) were sensitive to Wls. It is not clear why these Wnts were not tested in the rescue experiment. Also, how Wnt overexpression in the muscle can rescue the presynaptic NMJ deficits? Neurotransmission analysis could be performed following Wnt7A injection.</p><p>The authors previously reported that Wnt7A modulates agrin-induced AChR clustering in muscle cell (Barik et al., 2014) suggesting that Wnt7A regulates postsynaptic differentiation. This should be included and commented in the manuscript.</p><p>Developmental, post-natal stages and muscle types used should be mentioned in the figure legends.</p><p>In several figures the title is misleading.

Explain!</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comments. First, we have performed additional EM analysis; however, we have encountered a technical difficulty. NMJ occupies 0.01-0.1% of muscle fiber surface. Presynaptic vesicles/membrane are identified by their proximity to characteristic postsynaptic junctional folds. In Wls mutant mice, NMJs were disorganized and junctional folds were reduced. In addition, as shown in Figure 6B, the area of SV2+ aggregates was about 5 µm and less than 2% of a NMJ. We tried but were unable to convincingly identify vesicle clusters in axons by EM. Second, the nature of SV2+ aggregates is unknown. They may be inclusion bodies containing SV2 proteins for degradation. Third, we wish to point out that SV2 staining was low in wild type axons in adult mice, but it was increased in axons of mutant mice (Figure 6B). To test this hypothesis, we performed additional Western blot analysis of Synapsin 1, another marker of synaptic vesicles. As shown in revised Figure 6C, Synapsin 1 level was increased in Wls mutant axons, compared with control axons. This is in agreement with increased levels of SV2 in axons (Figure 6C). Together, the results suggest possible accumulation of vesicle-specific proteins in mutant axons. Although it is difficult to attribute these proteins to aggregated vesicles (because technical difficulty described above), their increased levels in axons may lead to a reduction at presynaptic terminals.</p><p>Regarding “strong presynaptic SV2 accumulations in Wls mutants”, we would like to point out that SV2 signaling is discontinuous and spotty, faint or missing in many areas where AChR was present.

As shown in revised suppl Figure 1B and 1F, levels of Wls were reduced in muscles of HSA-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice and sciatic nerves of Wnt1-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice, respectively, compared with control mice. The reduction in mutant muscles and sciatic nerves was not 100% because these tissues contain cells where Cre was not expressed (such as blood vessels, nerve terminals, and Schwann cells in suppl Figure 1B and axons in suppl Figure 1F). Although there was no observable defects of NMJ formation in Wnt1-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we found that Wnt1-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice died soon after birth with severe craniofacial skeleton defects, in accord with the notion that Wnt signaling in neural crests is critical for craniofacial skeleton development (Fu et al., 2011).</p><p>It is a good question whether Wls was completely knocked out by HSA::Cre. Cre in HSA::Cre mice is expressed in myotomal somites as early as E9.5, a time prior to NMJ formation (around E13.5). This line has been widely used by various laboratories to study NMJ development (Li et al., 2008; Escher et al., 2005; Jaworski et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2012; Seaberg et al. 2015). In newly provided data, Wls in HAS-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> muscles was reduced to ~5% of that of control mice (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). As described above, the residual Wls protein could be from other cell types in muscle tissues such as blood vessel cells and even axon terminals. In agreement with these considerations, a recent study found no apparent NMJ deficits when Wls was knocked out by Pax3::Cre (Remedio et al. 2016).</p><p>Whether there is a Wls-like molecule is an outstanding question. However, no such a molecule has been identified so far. Wls knockout is embryonic lethal (Fu et al. 2009). Its conditional knockout has been shown to cause deficits in various tissues including gut (Valenta et al., 2016), spinal cord (Onishi et al. 2018), and craniofacial and brain development (Fu et al., 2011). This paper focuses on whether and which Wnts from motoneurons contribute to NMJ development. We would hope that the reviewer would agree whether there is Wls-like molecules could be addressed in a future study. This point has been discussed in the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As Wnts are presumably secreted and bind their cognate receptors to function, a central question is what Wnts are expressed and secreted from muscles and Schwann cells.

But the analysis of the NMJ has only been done in the diaphragm muscle. It would be important to analyze other muscles that are directly relevant to grip strength phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for not being clear. In addition to diaphragm, NMJ analysis has been done in gastrocnemius (revised Figure 3A-3E, Figure 5A-5C, Figure 6A and 6B, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and tibialis anterior (Figure 7C-7E). These muscles are now clearly indicated in respective figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If exogenous ACh agonists are applied, is the endplate potential normal?</p></disp-quote><p>Good question. In newly performed experiments, we treated diaphragms with CCh (10 µM), an ACh agonist, for 2 min and observed its effects on mEPPs. Consistent with previous reports (Katz et al., 1972; Miyamoto et al. 1974), CCh could enhance mEPP frequency and amplitude in control diaphragms (revised Figure 5D-5I). Interestingly, CCh also elevated mEPP frequency and amplitude in Wls mutant diaphragms to similar or higher levels of controls in the absence of CCh (Figure 5D-5I). Nevertheless, mEPP frequency and amplitude in the presence of CCh were lower in mutant, compared with control at age of P30. At P1, mEPP amplitudes in the absence of CCh were similar between HB9-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> and control muscles (Figure 5H). These results indicate that transmission impairment in mutant mice could be attenuated by ACh agonist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The defect in synaptic vesicle aggregation is interesting. The authors tried to show increased SV2 protein levels in the sciatic nerve to support the finding, but the Figure 6C is not convincing. Since the sciatic nerve is mixed with many non-motor axons, it would have been more convincing to use pure motor nerves, e.g. phrenic nerve.</p></disp-quote><p>Good suggestion. We now performed additional Western blot with phrenic nerves for SV2 and included another vesicle marker Synapsin 1. As shown in revised Figure 6C, both SV2 and Synapsin 1 were increased in phrenic nerves of mutant mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The nerve transplantation experiment is interesting, but it is less relevant to the conclusion.

It is a little bit hard to interpret the results without knowing what relevant Wnt receptors are expressed in cells involved in NMJ formation or maintenance. For example, even Wnt7A expression/secretion from motor neurons is reduced, it cannot rule out that motor neuron-derived Wnt7A activates muscle (or Schwann cell) pathways to elicit retrograde signals to promote presynaptic development unless the receptor(s) for Wnt7A (or other relevant Wnt molecules) is selectively deleted from motor neurons, not other cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>How motoneuron Wnts regulate NMJ formation is a great question. They could act via activating Wnt receptors on motoneurons, on muscles and on Schwann cells. To address this question, we performed additional experiments to determine the expression patterns of Wnt receptors including 10 Frizzled proteins. As shown in revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1, many were detectable in the ventral horns of the spinal cord, Schwann cells, and muscle cells. Figuring out which Frizzled (plus Wnt co-receptors LPR5/LPR6) is involved in what cells could be a daunting task.</p><p>This paper provides first genetic evidence that Wnts from motoneurons are critical for NMJ development. Effects could be mediated by Wnt receptors on motoneurons, Schwann cells and/or muscle fibers, as the reviewer pointed out.

The authors used the main Wnt secretion mediator Wls to specifically abolish Wnt secretion in each of the three NMJ compartments (skeletal muscle, motor neurons and Schwann cells). They showed that only Wls deletion in motor neurons leads to age-dependent NMJ deficits and neurotransmission impairment in a cell-autonomous manner. Using a combination of morphological analysis, electron microscopy and electrophysiology, they characterized the NMJ deficits and nicely demonstrate that motoneuronal specific deletion of Wls results in progressive NMJ degeneration, muscle weakness, impaired neurotransmission, motor axonal swelling and synaptic vesicle reduction. They also showed that motoneuronal Wls is required for NMJ regeneration. From there, they screened for the Wnt ligands that are expressed in motoneurons and identified those whose secretion is regulated by Wls in heterologous HEK cells. Wnt5A and 7A were the most sensitive to Wls mutation. Injection of recombinant Wnt7A, but not Wnt5A in TA muscle can partially rescue the morphological presynaptic deficits of HB9-Wl-/-. Overall this is a very interesting study, the analysis of data was carefully performed and most of the main conclusions are supported by the provided results. However, although the finding that Wnt7A may play a role in presynaptic assembly is novel, the current study does not provide sufficient evidence to support this conclusion and it remains unclear how Wnts secretion from motoneurons contributes to presynaptic functions resulting in age-dependent NMJ dysfunction when altered.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the remarks that “Shen et al., report a very interesting study on a novel role for Wnt in presynaptic assembly in the neuromuscular junction” and that “Overall this is a very interesting study, the analysis of data was carefully performed and most of the main conclusions are supported by the provided results” and his or her constructive critiques and suggestions that have significantly improved the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that Wls deletion in motoneurons, but not skeletal muscle or Schwann cells shows NMJ defects. Given that several Wnts identified by the authors in motoneurons are known to regulate postsynaptic differentiation, some of them being low or not sensitive to Wls, there is a possibility that Wnts secreted by the motoneurons may have compensated the muscle and/or Schwann cells NMJ phenotypes. A more detailed analysis of the NMJ phenotypes during NMJ formation, including combined HSA and/or HB9 and/or Wnt1-Wls-/- should be performed to support their conclusions. I realized that it is a demanding task, but this is not unfeasible.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer wanted us to determine whether motoneuron Wnts could compensate Wls deletion in muscles or Schwann cells. To test whether motoneuron Wnts could compensate Wls deletion in muscles, we generated mice where Wls was knocked out in both motoneurons and muscles (HB9/HSA-Wls<sup>-/-</sup>). As shown in revised Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and 3B, NMJ morphology in these mice was similar to that of HSA-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that motoneuron Wnts had little compensating effects on Wls deletion in muscles.</p><p>Along the same line, to determine whether motoneuron Wnts compensate Wls deletion in Schwann cells, we characterized HB9/Wnt1-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice where Wls was deleted in both motoneurons and Schwann cells.

However, because Wnt1-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice die at birth, it has been very difficult to generate sufficient numbers of HB9/HSA/Wnt1-Wls<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><p>In newly performed experiments, we checked expression of 19 Wnts in motoneurons, Schwann cells, and muscle cells. Noticeably, Wnt7A appeared to be the most abundant, followed by Wnt3, Wnt4, and Wnt7B in motoneurons. Expression of other Wnts appeared to be low in motoneurons. Dominant Wnts in Schwann cells appeared to be Wnt5A and Wnt9A whereas Wnt4, Wnt6 and Wnt9A were most abundant in muscle cells (revised Figure 1). By knocking out Wls in motoneurons, we provide first genetic evidence that Wnts from motoneurons are critical for NMJ. In revision, we avoided implications that Wnts from muscles or Schwann cells are not important. The revision has discussed these points in revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors identified several Wnts molecules expressed in motoneurons and showed that apart from Wnt7A and Wnt5A, several other (Wnt7B and Wnt9B) were sensitive to Wls. It is not clear why these Wnts were not tested in the rescue experiment. Also, how Wnt overexpression in the muscle can rescue the presynaptic NMJ deficits? Neurotransmission analysis could be performed following Wnt7A injection. The authors previously reported that Wnt7A modulates agrin-induced AChR clustering in muscle cell (Barik et al., 2014) suggesting that Wnt7A regulates postsynaptic differentiation.
