Using 10BiT mice that carry a Foxp3-eGFP reporter and stably express CD90.1 following IL-10 production, we characterized the spatiotemporal dynamics of Tr1 cells in a house dust mite model of allergic airway inflammation. CD90.1+Foxp3-IL-10+ Tr1 cells arise from memory cells and rejoin the tissue-resident memory T-cell pool after cessation of IL-10 production. Persistent antigenic stimulation is necessary to sustain IL-10 production and <italic>Irf1</italic> and <italic>Batf</italic> expression distinguishes CD90.1+Foxp3-IL-10+ Tr1 cells from CD90.1+Foxp3-IL-10- ‘former’ Tr1. Depletion of Tr1-like cells after primary sensitization exacerbates allergic airway inflammation. However, neither transfer nor depletion of former Tr1 cells influences either Tr1 numbers or the inflammatory response during subsequent allergen memory re-challenge weeks later. Together these data suggest that naturally-arising Tr1 cells do not necessarily give rise to more Tr1 upon allergen re-challenge or contribute to tolerogenic memory. This phenotypic instability may limit efforts to re-establish tolerance by expanding Tr1 in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IL-10</kwd><kwd>TR1</kwd><kwd>allergy</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>house dust mite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK096087-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bollyky</surname><given-names>Paul L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL113294-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bollyky</surname><given-names>Paul L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 AI101984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bollyky</surname><given-names>Paul L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early postdoctoral mobility grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yadava</surname><given-names>Koshika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Child Health Research Institute Stanford</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1 TR001085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yadava</surname><given-names>Koshika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000010</institution-id><institution>Ford Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medina</surname><given-names>Carlos Obed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005492</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Molecular and Cellular Immunobiology Training Grant 5 T32 AI07920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medina</surname><given-names>Carlos Obed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005492</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Diversifying Academia, Recruiting Excellence</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medina</surname><given-names>Carlos Obed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Natural Tr1-like cells do not form a functionally stable memory response to allergens, and this instability may limit efforts to re-establish tolerance by expanding Tr1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Allergic asthma is a common childhood illness and can be triggered by exposure to aeroallergens such as house dust mite (HDM). Hallmark features of the disease include aberrant T helper 2 (Th2) type responses, airway hyperreactivity, eosinophilic inflammation, increased IgE and mucus hypersecretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finkelman et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The balance between pro-inflammatory CD4+ Th2 cells and regulatory T cells, including CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD4+Foxp3-, interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing Type one regulatory T cells (Tr1) cells, is a significant determinant in the development of allergic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robinson, 2009</xref>). Allergen-specific immunotherapy may re-establish tolerance in part by expanding these regulatory T cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akdis and Akdis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meiler et al., 2008</xref>). There is therefore great interest in developing stable, antigen specific regulatory T cells for treatment of asthma and allergies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassirpour and Zoratti, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) is critical for immune tolerance to airway allergens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hawrylowicz, 2005</xref>). The suppressive capabilities of Tr1 cells are primarily attributed to IL-10 while Foxp3+ T cells exert regulatory function in several ways, including via IL-10 production, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lloyd and Hawrylowicz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kearley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kearley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pellerin et al., 2014</xref>). IL-10 can limit both Th2 differentiation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coomes et al., 2017</xref>) and endogenous T cell-derived IL-10 limits the development of pathogenic Th2 responses during allergen sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tournoy et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, the development of Tr1-like cells is critical to the success of allergen-specific immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akdis and Akdis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meiler et al., 2008</xref>). There is therefore great interest in the factors involved in Tr1 development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levings et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gagliani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2011</xref>) and considerable progress has been made toward engineering Tr1-like cells in vitro for potential therapeutic applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregori and Roncarolo, 2018</xref>).</p><p>However, much about naturally-arising Tr1 cells and endogenous IL-10 production in allergic airway disease remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">White and Wraith, 2016</xref>). In particular, the contribution of antigen-specific Tr1 cells to tolerogenic memory is unclear. Given the persistence of allergen-specific immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hondowicz et al., 2016</xref>) this information may prove vital for the development of successful Tr1-directed immunotherapies.</p><p>Here, we characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of endogenous IL-10-producing T cells in a mouse model of HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation. For this purpose, we have used a mouse strain carrying a stable IL-10 reporter, the 10BiT mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maynard et al., 2007</xref>). This strain carries multiple copies of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene containing a CD90.1 construct under the control of the IL-10 promoter such that cells that previously made IL-10 express CD90.1 which persists for some time after cessation of IL-10 production. This strain was previously crossed against the Foxp3-eGFP mouse strain to facilitate discrimination between Foxp3- Tr1 from Foxp3+ Treg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maynard et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Using these animals, we have analyzed the population frequencies and cytokine production profiles of Tr1-like cells in multiple tissues at various stages of allergic airway inflammation including sensitization, challenge, resolution, and memory. To determine the functional contribution of Tr1-like memory T-cell populations we perform loss and gain of function studies by deleting these cells or adoptively transferring them before re-challenge with the allergen. Together, these studies elucidate the cellular source of IL-10 in allergic inflammation, their functional stability, and their contribution to tolerogenic memory in the lung.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IL-10-producing T cells accumulate at site of allergen sensitization</title><p>To interrogate the patterns of endogenous IL-10 production in allergic airway inflammation we used a house dust mite (HDM) induced murine model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

However, endogenous Tr1-like cells do not contribute to tolerogenic memory in this model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have investigated the phenotypic stability and contributions to tolerogenic memory of endogenous Tr1-like cells in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation-induced asthma. We report that natural Tr1-like cells only transiently express IL-10 after activation. Moreover, while cells that actively produce IL-10 are important for immune tolerance to airway allergens, neither depletion nor transfer of Tr1-like cells altered airway inflammation upon subsequent allergen challenge. Together these data suggest that naturally-arising Tr1-like cells may promote tolerance but do not contribute to a functionally stable tolerogenic memory population in this model.</p><p>Persistent antigenic signals were required for maintenance of IL-10 production and expression of <italic>Irf1</italic> and <italic>Batf,</italic> transcription factors previously linked to Tr1 status. It may be that repeated stimulation, a feature of many immunotherapy regimens, maintains active IL-10 production in airway Tr1-like cells by supporting expression of these canonical Tr1 transcription factors. In the gut, a prominent site of IL-10 production, antigen stimulation by commensal bacteria may provide a similar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gagliani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gagliani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In light of these data, we propose that IL-10 production is a temporary phenotype that a fraction of memory T cells adopt upon activation in the setting of certain previously defined differentiation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gregori et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Flavell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coomes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockmann et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, IL-10 production in response to allergen exposure may be stochastic and not necessarily predicated upon past production of IL-10. This model is perhaps consistent with past reports of phenotypic plasticity in induced Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joetham et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hwang et al., 2018</xref>), and between T-helper subsets in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu and Paul, 2010</xref>). Notably, the data presented here involving naturally arising Tr1-like cells stands in contrast to more phenotypically stable Tr1-like cells that have been engineered or differentiated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregori and Roncarolo, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Natural Tr1-like cells arise from the memory T-cell subset of mice previously sensitized to HDM. During the acute response, there is a significant increase in the frequency of CD90.1+Foxp3-, Tr1-like cells in the lungs and airways, the site of allergen challenge. After cessation of IL-10 production, these cells persisted over time in the lungs of challenged animals as tissue-resident memory cells. This is consistent with evidence that an immune reaction to an antigen can contribute to subsequent regulatory memory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brincks et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosenblum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sanchez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez Rodriguez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gratz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Tr1-like cells in this model arose specifically in the lung, the site of allergen challenge and not in distal compartments such as the spleen. This is analogous to the report from Hondowicz et al. that tissue-resident Th2 cells drive allergic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hondowicz et al., 2016</xref>). These data are also consistent with previous reports of tissue-specific roles for Tr1-like cells (though there are indications of geographic plasticity as well; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). However, currently the most commonly used routes for allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) are subcutaneous and oral. The data presented here suggest that intranasal routes may be more effective at inducing Tr1-like cells in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takabayashi et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Tr1-like cells and not Foxp3+ Treg were the major source of IL-10 in the lung in this model. Consistent with this, there was a greater increase in the frequency of Tr1-like cells versus Foxp3+ Tregs in the lung during the peak of inflammation. Unlike Tr1 cells, the majority of CD90.1-Foxp3+ Tregs in the inflamed lung were circulating, non-resident cells and their frequency did not increase upon memory allergen rechallenge.</p><p>Finally, Tr1-like cells and not Treg (irrespective of CD90.1+ expression) were also the predominant Derp1:I-A<sup>b</sup> tetramer-positive IL-10+ cell population in the lungs after secondary rechallenge. One could speculate that Foxp3+ regulatory memory Tregs may regulate inflammatory responses directed against self- rather than non-self-antigens, such as the HDM allergen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosenblum et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosenblum et al., 2011</xref>). However, they may be specific for other HDM epitopes not assessed in our study. CD90.1+Foxp3+ cells are fewer in number and their frequency doesn’t change significantly upon allergen sensitization. However, like the Tr1-like cells, they are also parenchymal and highly activated expressing CD44, Lag3, PD-1 and KLRG1.Furthermore they are also depleted when we use the CD90.1 antibody. Thus, while Tr1-like cells are the primary source of IL-10 in our model, we cannot rule out their secondary contribution to supressing inflammation in our acute model.</p><p>Tr1-like cells in our model expressed most of the cell surface markers previously associated with Tr1 cells including CD44, Lag3, PD-1, and KLRG1. However, these markers did not distinguish between Tr1-like cells and CD90.1+Foxp3+ Treg. Other studies have likewise reported that while these Tr1 markers identify a highly suppressive subset, they are not consistently expressed by all IL-10-producing Tr1-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gagliani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">White and Wraith, 2016</xref>). This variation in their phenotypic markers is also consistent with the model that in vivo, natural Tr1-like cells may not be functionally stable in the absence of a persistent antigenic stimulus.</p><p>These findings may inform efforts to develop Tr1-based tolerogenic therapies. The phenotypic instability reported here may limit efforts to re-establish tolerance by promoting Tr1-based tolerogenic memory in the absence of repeated antigen stimulation. It may prove advantageous to engineer Tr1-like cells in vitro for adoptive transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregori and Roncarolo, 2018</xref>). Insight into the tissue-specific factors required for maintenance of Tr1 function in vivo will help better target both endogenous and engineered Tr1-like cells to induce long-term tolerance in patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The 10Bit strain contains a transgenic insertion consisting of the coding sequence of <italic>Thy1<sup>a</sup> (Thy1.1, CD90.1</italic>) followed by SV40 poly A sequence, inserted into a mouse Il10 gene contained in a BAC. The FOXP3EGFP strain co-express EGFP and the regulatory T cell-specific transcription factor <italic>Foxp3</italic> under the control of the endogenous promoter. CD44 knockout (<italic>Cd44<sup>tm1Hbg</sup></italic>/J) animals were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. All mice were bred and maintained in house in a conventional facility according to institutional guidelines. All animal experiments and use procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Stanford University School of Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Allergic airway inflammation model</title><p>Mice used for allergic airway sensitization ranged from 8 to 16 weeks of age. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Henry-Schein, Dublin, OH) and challenged intranasally with 20 μg of house dust mite (HDM) extract (Greer Laboratories Inc, Lenoir, NC) in 50 μL sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on experimental days 1, 3, and five for sensitization and days 8, 10, and 12 for challenge. Endotoxin content of different lots varied but Derp1 content was the same. Only data from experiments using the same HDM lot were pooled. Single cell isolates from both the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and tissues were collected for staining and flow cytometry analysis of immune cell populations. For memory experiments, BAL fluid and tissues were collected 24 hr after animals were given an allergen rechallenge on day 67.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Isolation of cells from tissues</title><p>Tissues were processed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gebe et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were performed with 1 mL flushes of the lung with sterile PBS containing 0.2% BSA. BAL fluid was treated with ACK RBC lysis buffer (5 min, 37 degrees C) before cell counting and flow cytometry.</p><p>Following removal of BAL fluid, lungs were perfused with 5 mL sterile PBS injected into the right ventricle. Lungs were removed, placed in RPMI media and cut with scissors to approximately 1 mm pieces before the addition of collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to 150 U/mL and DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to 25 U/mL for digestion. Lung tissue was digested for 37 degrees C for 45 min on a shaker. A single cell suspension was obtained by pressing digested tissue through a 70 μm cell strainer using the plunger of a 3 mL syringe followed by a wash with PBS containing serum and EDTA. Where applicable, spleen and lymph nodes were isolated and separated into a single cell suspension using a 70 μm cell strainer similarly. All tissues were treated with ACK RBC lysis following single cell suspension (5 min, 37 degrees C) for cell counting and flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Histology</title><p>Histology was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yadava et al., 2016</xref>). Lungs were inflated with 700–800 µl of 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded into paraffin. 5 μM thick sections were stained with haematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and eosin (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA). Stained slides were imaged by light microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Flow cytometry and antibodies</title><p>Cell subsets were distinguished by surface staining for CD4 (clone RM4-4), CD3 (clone 17A2), CD90.1 (Thy1.1) (clone OX-7) and Foxp3 eGFP. Surface expression of canonical Tr1 markers was assessed by surface staining for CD44 (clone IM7), Lag3 (clone C9B7W), CD49b (clone DX5), CD25 (clone PC61), KLRG1 (clone 2F1), and PD1 (clone RMP1-30). All antibodies were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA).</p><p>To analyse cytokine production, cells from lung digests were stimulated with 20 ng/mL PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 1 μg/mL Ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 3 μg/mL Brefeldin A (eBioscience-ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) for 4 hr at 37 degrees C. Cells were surface stained and then were fixed with 2% PFA. Cells were then stained intracellularly with IL-10 (clone JES5-16E3), IFNg (clone XMG1.2), IL-17 (clone TC11-18H10.1), IL-13 (clone eBio13A), IL-4 (clone 11B11), T-bet (clone eBio4B10), and Gata-3 (clone TWAJ) in permeabilization buffer (eBioscience-ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Derp1:I-A<sup>b</sup> tetramer conjugated to PE was a kind gift from James Moon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hondowicz et al., 2016</xref>). Cells were stained with 20 nM tetramer for 1 hr at room temperature prior to surface staining. Stained cells were acquired on BD FACS LSRII instruments in the Stanford Shared FACS Facility and analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Intravascular labeling of cells</title><p>For staining of non-tissue-resident circulating cells in the lung, CD45 AF700 clone 30-F11 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) was injected retro-orbitally 2 min before mice were euthanized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Blocking lymphocyte migration using FTY720</title><p>To block lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes, HDM-sensitized animals were given daily IP injections of FTY720 (Sigma-Aldrich Cat: SML0700-5MG) at 5 mg/kg, estimating 25 g per mouse, or DMSO (sham control) in saline from day 64 to day 68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brinkmann et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Depletion of IL-10-producing cells</title><p>Depletion of IL-10-producing cells was performed by intraperitoneal injection of 200 ug of anti-Thy1.1 antibody or matched isotype control (BioXCell, West Lebanon, NH).

Naïve CD4 T cells were isolated using the EasySep Mouse Naïve CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL, Cambridge, MA) following manufacturer’s instructions. Tr1 cells were differentiated in vitro as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chihara et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, naïve CD4 T cells were cultured in Tr1 clone medium with murine IL-27 (25 ng/mL) on plates coated with anti-CD3 (2 ug/mL) and anti-CD28 (2 ug/mL) for 3 days. Cells were then re-activated on fresh anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated plates in media without IL-27 for 4.5 hr to promote IL-10 secretion. IL-10 secreting cells were labeled using the Mouse IL-10 Secretion Assay Detection Kit (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions and surface stained for CD3, CD4, CD90.1, and viability for sorting.</p><p>Cells were sorted on the BD FACS Aria II instruments in the Stanford Shared FACS Facility and processed using the TaqMan Gene Expression Cells-to-Ct kit (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA), following manufacturer’s instructions, to generate cDNA for analysis. Gene expression was quantified using PrimeTime qPCR Probe Assays from IDT (Coralville, IA) for Irf1 (Mm.PT.58.33516776), Batf (Mm.PT.58.33231426), and beta-Actin (Mm.PT.39a.22214843.g) and SensiFAST Probe Hi-ROX Kit (Bioline, Memphis, TN) for 40 cycles. Gene expression was calculated as a delta Ct value with beta-Actin as a reference gene and displayed as fold-change in expression normalized to the CD90.1-IL-10- sort group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Adoptive transfer studies</title><p>10BiT/Foxp3eGFP mice were sensitized with either HDM (n = 20) or ovalbumin (n = 5) following the standard memory protocol and rechallenged at day 67 post initial challenge with their respective antigen. Lungs were digested and pooled, and CD4+ T cells were isolated using the EasySep Mouse CD4+ T cell isolation kit (STEMCELL, Cambridge, MA). CD4+ T cells from ovalbumin-sensitized mice served as an antigen-inexperienced control (Group A). CD4+ T cells from HDM-sensitized mice were then separated using the EasySep Mouse CD90.1 Positive Selection Kit into CD90.1-enriched (Tr1, Group B) and CD90.1-depleted (effector, Group C) donor populations. These cells were transferred into naïve C57Bl/6 mice intratracheally. Group A mice received 1.53E6 antigen-inexperience CD4 T cells per mouse, Group B mice received 1.36E4 Tr1 enriched CD4 T cells, and Group C mice received 2.51E5 Tr1-depleted CD4 T cells. All groups were challenged with HDM 48 hr after transfer and BAL and lungs were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>All graph generation and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Benoit Salomon (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Yadava et al., studied the role of Tr1-like cells (defined by the Foxp3- CD90.1/IL-10+ phenotype using 10BiT BAC transgenic mice to identify cells that produced or had produced IL-10) in a mouse model of lung allergy to the house dust mite allergen. They found that, at the peak of the disease (day 16), Tr1-like cells are the main IL-10 producer cells (Figure 1F,G and Figure 2B). However, the other main findings (role of antigen persistence to maintain IL-10 expression by Tr1-like cells (Figure 4), role of Tr1-like cells assessed in depleting experiment (Figure 8), role of Tr1-like cells assessed in transfer experiment (Figure 9) are over-interpreted for the reasons explained below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most critical experiments of this manuscript have been done only once with 3-5 mice per group (Figure 4, Figure 8 and Figure 9, and probably (not indicated) also Figure 2 and Figure 5) and all the other experiments have been only two times. Whereas two times is borderline but acceptable when results are striking, which is the case here for some experiments, performing an experiment only one time is unacceptable. That is why experiments showing the existence of &quot;former&quot; Tr1-like cells or showing that Tr1-like cells are critical at the peak of the disease but no more during memory are over-interpreted.</p><p>2) Another major point challenges the conclusions of the existence of &quot;former&quot; Tr1-like cells (Figure 4). The &quot;former&quot; Tr1 like cells, which are CD90.1+ that no more produce IL-10, represent {plus minus}75% at day 16 (peak of the disease) and 5-10% at day 30. The authors concluded from this finding that Tr1-like cells lost their capacity to produce IL-10 because of lack of Ag-stimulation. Another interpretation of the data is preferential survival or proliferation of IL-10- CD90.1+ cells over IL-10+ CD90.1+ cells. in vitro experiment depicted in Figure 5 does not help to solve this issue because it is a totally different system and we only have proportions and not absolute numbers that may help to distinguish between these two mechanisms (IL-10 loss vs preferential survival or proliferation).</p><p>3) Another major point challenges the conclusions that Tr1-like cells are dispensable to maintain immune tolerance, shown in the depleting experiment (Figure 8). Indeed, it is very likely that the &quot;former&quot; Tr1-like cells loose CD90.1 expression after silencing of the IL-10 promoter over time. Thus, depleting CD90.1+ cells would not deplete these &quot;former&quot; Tr1-like cells. To address this major concern, critical data are missing. What is the half-life of CD90.1 (both mRNA and protein) when the gene is no more transcripted.

The positive control is missing here. The authors should show that transferring Tr1-like cells purified from day 16 (peak of the disease) are able to control the disease. Without this positive control, we do not know if the cell transfer experiment is working. Also, it would be better to have a normal model of lung allergy by injecting the allergen 6 times (and not 4 times that give a weak disease).</p><p>5) The term &quot;resident&quot; for CD45- cells in the blood partitioning experiment is non-appropriate. The term &quot;parenchymal&quot; is more accurate since we do not if they are resident, before the experiment injecting FTY720. Also, we do not know how efficient, was the injection of FTY720. Critical control data, for instance looking at T cell numbers in the blood, are lacking. Data of Figure 7D to support FTY720 efficacy are too weak.</p><p>6) The data on Irf1 and Batf are very weak.

In the present study, Yadava et al. addressed this important question using a HDM model of allergic lung inflammation. They took advantage of IL-10-Thy1.1 BAC Tg x Foxp3-eGFP reporter mice to identify IL-10-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets in primary and secondary (recall) responses to HDM and to examine whether Tr1 cells play any role in the primary and secondary responses. The main results are; (1) during the primary response, Thy1.1+Foxp3-CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells accumulate within the lung tissue but decrease in numbers and stop producing IL-10 after the peak of inflammation; (2) in the recall response, antigen-specific &quot;memory&quot; Thy1.1+Foxp3-CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can be detected within the lung tissues even in FTY720-treated mice; (3) while depletion of Thy1.1+ cells exacerbated inflammation in the primary response, their depletion failed to affect inflammation in the recall response; (4) adoptive transfer of &quot;memory&quot; Thy1.1+Foxp3-CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to naïve mice resulted in loss of Thy1.1 expression upon re-challenge and failed to affect inflammation. Based on these results, the authors conclude that Tr1 cells are not functionally stable and do not contribute to &quot;tolerogenic memory&quot; in this experimental setting.</p><p>In my view, there is one fundamental flaw that seriously questions the validity of the conclusions of this study. Thus, the authors' definition of Tr1 cells as being Thy1.1+Foxp3-CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is inappropriate. Because IL-10 can be produced by different CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, particularly Th2 cells, it is absolutely required to include other Tr1 cell markers including expression of CD49b and LAG3 as well and to exclude Th2 cells by using an IL-4 reporter to more rigorously define Tr1 cells. This is particularly important because the authors used a model of Th2 inflammation. It is also absolutely necessary to demonstrate that their &quot;Tr1&quot; or &quot;Tr1-like&quot; cells show suppressive activities. The exacerbated primary response to HDM after depletion of Thy1.1+ cells could be accounted for solely by depletion of Thy1.1+Foxp3+ Treg cells. No data demonstrate that Tr1 cells are actually generated in meaningful numbers in this experimental system. If so, the use of this experimental system is certainly inappropriate to address the main question of this study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9: The authors should characterize the dynamics of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets and of inflammatory responses during the recall response.

However, total number of cells is also important to assess the contribution of IL-10 production. The total number of each cell population which produces IL-10 should be shown. The amount of IL-10 expression from each cell should also be addressed. In Figure 1, signal intensity of Thy1.1 (IL10) of Treg is higher than that of Tr1-like cells whereas the percentage is lower. As the original paper of the IL-10 reporter mice indicated that MFI of Thy1.1 can be used to estimate the IL-10 producing potential, they should summarize the MFI of Thy1.1 as the capacity of IL-10 expression, in addition to the percentage, of each cell population in order to support possible contribution of Tr1-like cells to the amount of lung IL-10.</p><p>2) They appear to have carried out the in vivo labeling experiment without immunization in Figure 2 because IL-10+ cells are not so high (Figure 2C).

Is it possible to maintain primary T cells in vitro without stimulation for 5 days? They should show the percentage of living cells after culture.

One concern is their interpretation of the results in the depletion experiments in Figure 9 and Figure10, which are related to whether IL-10-producing T cells indeed bear in vivo suppressive activity in the allergy model. This issue was raised by one of the reviewers, but the authors' response is not sufficiently convincing. In Figure 9A, B, there is still a possibility that depletion of Thy-1.1+Foxp3+ cells by anti-Thy-1.1 antibody is responsible for the exacerbation of the allergic response because these Foxp3+ cells are KLRG1+ (i.e., highly activated) even if the cell number is small as shown in Figure 4. Suppressive activity shown with in vitro induced Tr1 cells is not a proper support for their claim. However, the issue does not oppose their main claim that Tr-1-like cells do not possess suppressive activity on recall responses.

The &quot;former&quot; Tr1 like cells, which are CD90.1+ that no more produce IL-10, represent {plus minus}75% at day 16 (peak of the disease) and 5-10% at day 30.

In this reporter strain, CD90.1 is expressed only after IL-10 production. The presence of CD90.1 on Foxp3- Tcells in the absence of active IL-10 production can therefore only mean that these cells previously produced this cytokine but they do not currently – that is to say that they are former Tr1.</p><p>Regarding the possibility that these former TR1 cells are over represented in our model due to ongoing proliferation, it is difficult to see how this could be the case in the absence of cognate antigen for a month and given the overall marked decline in the airway inflammatory cells during this time (Figure 5B). If the reviewer is instead suggesting that these CD90.1+ cells represent de novo proliferative responses of naïve cells to different (perhaps self?) antigens, this seems highly unlikely given that a large fraction of former Tr1 are memory T cells (Figure 5I). Nonetheless, to directly interrogate whether these former Tr1 show evidence of extensive proliferation, we examined Ki67 expression and found that the large majority (&gt;90%) were Ki67 negative (Figure 8—figure supplement 2). These data do not support extensive proliferation in former Tr1.</p><p>Regarding the possibility that Tr1 cells survive poorly in post-inflammatory tissues, we agree that this is possible. However, we do not see how it would challenge the conclusion that IL-10CD90.1+ T-cells are former Tr1. Moreover, this would fit well with our model because antigenic signals govern both T cell survival (Freitas and Rocha, 1999) as well as IL-10 production (Roncarolo et al., 2006). Nonetheless, to test this directly we examined the survival of purified IL10+CD90.1+ tr1 cells and find that ongoing antigenic signals are critical for Tr1 survival.

In particular, it was reported that CD90.1 mRNA and IL-10 mRNA follow parallel dynamics after stimulation (Maseda et al., 2012) and that cell surface CD90.1 expression can persist for months (Maseda et al., 2012; Maynard et al., 2007). In our own experiments, we find that on Day 68 of our rechallenge protocol 3.7% of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells in mice originally treated with HDM are CD90.1+ (Figure 7E).

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Tr1 cells in this system are suppressive (Figure 10—figure supplement 1). As Th2 cells would not be expected to be suppressive, this further establishes that we are dealing with Tr1. Given the absence of any other Th2 markers, the suppressive capabilities of our Tr1, and the lack of any IL4 co-staining with our Tr1 in this system, we do not see the benefit of generating a triple reporter mouse with the capacity to track IL-4 as well as IL-10 and Foxp3.</p><p>Regarding the CD49b and LAG3 markers, in our model we find that CD49 is not associated with IL-10 expression while LAG3 is upregulated on all IL-10 producing cells including Foxp3+ Treg (Figure 4).

We appreciate that this result contradicts data from some other models, notably the IL-10-GFP reporter strain. However, the reviewer may be aware that there is an active debate regarding the defining characteristics of Tr1 cells. In particular, CD49b and LAG3 have been identified as specific Tr1 markers in some studies and not in others (Huang et al., 2018; Burton et al., 2014).

The amount of IL-10 expression from each cell should also be addressed. In Figure 1, signal intensity of Thy1.1 (IL10) of Treg is higher than that of Tr1-like cells whereas the percentage is lower. As the original paper of the IL-10 reporter mice indicated that MFI of Thy1.1 can be used to estimate the IL-10 producing potential, they should summarize the MFI of Thy1.1 as the capacity of IL-10 expression, in addition to the percentage, of each cell population in order to support possible contribution of Tr1-like cells to the amount of lung IL-10.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have added assessments of absolute cell numbers and Thy1.1 MFI assessments to Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They appear to have carried out the in vivo labeling experiment without immunization in Figure 2 because IL-10+ cells are not so high (Figure 2C). As the origin of Tr1 cells during inflammation is more important, they have to address the issue under immunization.</p></disp-quote><p>The image in question was indeed for a mouse that received PBS (a control mouse) and was provided to illustrate our gating strategy. To prevent any confusion, we have replaced this image with one from an immunized mouse (Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 5, they compare IL-10 production with or without in vitro TCR stimulation. Is it possible to maintain primary T cells in vitro without stimulation for 5 days? They should show the percentage of living cells after culture. If unstimulated cells are not normal, it's difficult to conclude that IL-10 production is dependent on TCR stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in Figure 5 (in current manuscript it is Figure 6) are gated on live cells only. Nonetheless, the reviewer is correct that in the absence of TCR stimulation both the viable cell numbers as well as IL-10 levels are low. To accompany these data, we have added the viability data as Figure 6—figure supplement 1. We have also added statements to the text clarifying the inter-relatedness of these points. With regards to the second comment, the inability of CD90.1+ cells to produce IL-10 in vitro in the absence of antigenic stimulation has also been previously published in the original 10BiT paper (Maynard et al., 2007).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In figure 4G, they examine cytokine production from Thy1.1+ cells. Because IL-4 is a major Th2 cytokine, they should assess the production of IL-4.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we have included a Figure 7—figure supplement 2 which shows that the CD90.1+ cells are negative for IL-4, IL-13 and Gata3 via intracellular staining. We also show that memory Tr1 cells do not produce IL-4 in Figure 7I and therefore do not become Th2-like over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 7, they use FTY720 for inhibiting the egress of lymphocyte. As they only show the ratio of naïve/effector fraction in Figure 5F, it is difficult to understand the dynamics of CD4<sup>+</sup> subsets. They should summarize the total number of each T cell subset with or without FTY720 treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>The total numbers of T cell subsets with or without FTY720 treatment has been added as Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Thy1.1 depletion experiments (Figure 8), not only Tr1 but also other IL-10 producing cell (e.g.; DCs, B cells and macrophages) population would be deleted. They should address the effects on other IL-10 producing cells, at least show the percentage and the number of other cell populations after anti-Thy1.1 treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>This information has been added as a Figure 9—figure supplement 2. However, when detecting intracellular IL-10, it is the CD4 T cells which are the greatest IL-10 producers and are most affected by the treatment with the depletion antibody.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have properly responded to the reviewers' comments. One concern is their interpretation of the results in the depletion experiments in Figure 9 and Figure 10, which are related to whether IL-10-producing T cells indeed bear in vivo suppressive activity in the allergy model. This issue was raised by one of the reviewers, but the authors' response is not sufficiently convincing. In Figure 9A, B, there is still a possibility that depletion of Thy-1.1+Foxp3+ cells by anti-Thy-1.1 antibody is responsible for the exacerbation of the allergic response because these Foxp3+ cells are KLRG1+ (i.e., highly activated) even if the cell number is small as shown in Figure 4. Suppressive activity shown with in vitro induced Tr1 cells is not a proper support for their claim. However, the issue does not oppose their main claim that Tr-1-like cells do not possess suppressive activity on recall responses. Modification of their interpretation may be sufficient for final acceptance.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the editors and reviewers that our study does not exclude a functional role for CD90.1+Foxp3+ cells in suppressing inflammation. We have now made changes to the text which draw attention to this caveat in our results and in the discussion. Our changes convey our data more accurately. We have also updated the main manuscript file with these changes. The focus and main conclusion of our study remains on Tr1-like cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
