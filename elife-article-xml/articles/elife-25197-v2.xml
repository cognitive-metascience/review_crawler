pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25197.001</object-id><p>Dynamin is a large GTPase that forms a helical collar at the neck of endocytic pits, and catalyzes membrane fission (Schmid and Frolov, 2011; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012). Dynamin fission reaction is strictly dependent on GTP hydrolysis, but how fission is mediated is still debated (Antonny et al., 2016): GTP energy could be spent in membrane constriction required for fission, or in disassembly of the dynamin polymer to trigger fission. To follow dynamin GTP hydrolysis at endocytic pits, we generated a conformation-specific nanobody called dynab, that binds preferentially to the GTP hydrolytic state of dynamin-1. Dynab allowed us to follow the GTPase activity of dynamin-1 in real-time. We show that in fibroblasts, dynamin GTP hydrolysis occurs as stochastic bursts, which are randomly distributed relatively to the peak of dynamin assembly. Thus, dynamin disassembly is not coupled to GTPase activity, supporting that the GTP energy is primarily spent in constriction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dynamin</kwd><kwd>conformational-specific nanobody</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>enzyme</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA-0061-08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Aurélien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 31003A_130520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Aurélien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting Grant 311536 (2011 call)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Aurélien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie ITN grant #264399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Aurélien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-12-BSV2-0003-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>Franck</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>Franck</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20120323723</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>Franck</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Uncoupling of dynamin polymerization and GTPase activity can be induced with dynamin, which allows in vivo visualization of its activity at endocytic pits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are three mammalian variants of dynamin that share 80% sequence identity. They differ in their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmid and Frolov, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012</xref>): dynamin-1 is specific to neurons, dynamin-2 is ubiquitously expressed, dynamin-3 is located in the brain, lungs and testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vaid et al., 2007</xref>). Dynamins are constituted of 5 domains: the GTPase (G) domain, the stalk – a rigid coiled-coil, which mediates assembly into helical polymers through 3 structurally conserved interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faelber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ford et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reubold et al., 2015</xref>), the Bundle Signaling Element (BSE), which connects the GTPase domain to the stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chappie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chappie et al., 2011</xref>), a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, which binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salim et al., 1996</xref>) and the proline-rich domain (PRD), which binds partners such as Bin Amphiphysin Rvs (BAR)-domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raimondi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Dynamin can assemble into a helical coil around membrane necks and tubes. The constriction of the coil is required for fission and the most constricted state of dynamin is observed in presence of GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonny et al., 2016</xref>). However, the use of GTP energy is still debated: either it is used in helix constriction through twisting, or in disassembly of the constricted polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonny et al., 2016</xref>). When GTP is added to pre-assembled dynamin tubes in vitro, rapid torsion and constriction are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roux et al., 2006</xref>). When GTP is added along with dynamin to membranes in vitro, highly constricted helices are observed, suggesting that GTP-bound dynamin assembles directly into a highly constricted state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sundborger et al., 2014</xref>). However, the K44A used in this study has residual GTPase activity, and thus the highly constricted state could result from limited GTP hydrolysis. Furthermore, a partial depolymerization is observed when GTP is added to dynamin tubules, which could play a role in fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bashkirov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pucadyil and Schmid, 2008</xref>). This depolymerization may come from the fact that the PH domain of dynamin in the most-constricted state is titled, probably breaking the bond between dynamin and the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sundborger et al., 2014</xref>). It is thus difficult to infer from in vitro data how GTP hydrolysis, constriction and disassembly are coupled.</p><p>Structural studies have neither solved whether fission occurs by active constriction or active depolymerization of the dynamin helix. In the presence of GTP or GTP-analogs, GTPase domains form dimers (called G-G), explaining the higher propensity of dynamin to self-assemble with GTP. However, the strongest GTPase domain dimerization occurs using GDP·AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>‾</sup>, that mimics the transition state of hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chappie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chappie et al., 2009</xref>). In this state, dynamin can form helices independently of the membrane. Moreover, the BSE position relative to the GTPase domain rotates by 90°, showing that GTP hydrolysis induces a conformational change compatible with constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chappie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chappie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sundborger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chappie et al., 2009</xref>). But as the structure of this transition state does not fit into the cryo-EM structure of the most constricted state of the dynamin helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sundborger et al., 2014</xref>), it is possible that the GDP·AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>‾</sup>-bound state of dynamin induces stresses within the helix that lead to its disassembly.</p><p>The dynamics of the fission reaction has been studied extensively in cells; it requires 5–10 s and is highly stochastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Merrifield et al., 2005</xref>), consistent with in vitro fission rates in optimal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morlot et al., 2012</xref>). The minimal number of dynamin monomers for fission reaction is between 26 and 28, suggesting that at least one complete helical turn of dynamin is required for fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cocucci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grassart et al., 2014</xref>). However, when GTP is hydrolyzed relative to fission in vivo is not known as in cells measuring or following the activity of a specific enzyme remains a challenge. Thus, how dynamin’s GTP hydrolysis is coupled to constriction or to disassembly in vivo has not been addressed yet.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to follow the GTPase activity of dynamin in vivo, we ought to isolate a conformation-specific nanobody that preferentially binds one of the specific nucleotidic states of dynamin. To isolate a conformation specific nanobody against GTP-loaded dynamin-2, we screened a phage-display library of synthetic nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moutel et al., 2016</xref>) against recombinant human dynamin-2 loaded with GMPPCP. Further characterization of 192 selected clones, allowed us to exclude false positives (see Materials and methods, Supplementary methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and isolate 33% of positive clones. Based on their affinities in dot-blot assays (see Supplementary methods), we chose five dynamin-binding nanobodies and tested them in pull-down assays against various nucleotidic states of dynamin. Pull-downs were performed with dynamin assembled onto SUPported bilayers with Excess membrane Reservoir (SUPER) templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pucadyil and Schmid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neumann et al., 2013</xref>) adapted for pull-down assays: magnetic silica beads were coated with lipid membranes, from which dynamin-coated membrane tubules can be formed, as dynamin binding is lost when membranes are dissolved with saponin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Beads are further pulled down with a magnet. All five nanobodies bound dynamin-2 efficiently regardless of its nucleotide load. As GTP analogs substantially increased the amount of dynamin pulled down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), consistent with their ability to promote dynamin oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carr and Hinshaw, 1997</xref>), GMPPCP-loaded dynamin-2 was used as a reference to ensure that the amount of dynamin pulled down was the same in every nucleotide condition.</p><p>We then tested our nanobodies against dynamin-1. We found one nanobody, that we named dynab, that preferentially binds to GDP·AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>‾</sup> loaded dynamin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Overall, dynab has a lower affinity for dynamin-1 than for dynamin-2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Dynab does not bind dynamin one through its PRD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Since the GDP·AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>‾</sup> -bound state of dynamin mimics the GTP hydrolysis transition state, dynab could potentially track the GTPase activity of dynamin by binding dynamin only during GTP hydrolysis. To test this in vitro, we first pulled-down dynab with fission defective mutants K44A and K142A. K44A has a reduced affinity for nucleotides, and thus a lower overall GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Damke et al., 1994</xref>), while K142A has almost normal GTPase activity, while its helix cannot constrict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marks et al., 2001</xref>). The results were similar to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>), which may indicate that even if the mutants have deficient GTPase activity, they can be locked into the same transition state when loaded with GDP·AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>‾</sup>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25197.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of dynab, conformation-specific nanobody.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of dynamin-coated magnetic SUPER templates used as bait for pulling down of dynab.

In contrast, neither GMPPCP nor GDP additions led to binding of dynab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We concluded that dynab binds to dynamin-1 tubules hydrolyzing GTP and is thus able to detect the GTPase activity of dynamin. Importantly, we further verified dynamin-1 and 2 GTPase activities were unchanged in presence of dynab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Quan and Robinson, 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Our results indicate that dynab has a stronger affinity for GDP·AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>‾</sup> loaded dynamin-1 than for other states of dynamin-1 and thus detect the transient hydrolytic state of dynamin-1.</p><p>We then wondered if dynab may be used as an intrabody to track GTPase activity of dynamin-1 during endocytosis in living fibroblastic cells. Dynamin and dynab were expressed as fluorescently-tagged proteins in fibroblastic cells imaged by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy which allow for visualization of single clathrin pits formation. To generate fibroblastic cells expressing solely dynamin-1 or dynamin-2, we used a triple conditional knockout cell line for the three dynamin genes (TKO cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2013</xref>). After removing the three dynamin genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), we co-expressed dynamin-1-mCherry or dynamin-2-mCherry and dynab-EGFP. In those cells, dynab co-localized with both 74 ± 4% of dynamin-1 and 88 ± 12% dynamin-2 punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25197.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Expression in vivo of dynamin-1/2 and dynab.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average images of time-lapse movies of dynamin triple knockout cells (TKO) expressing dyn1/2-mCherry and dynab-EGFP.

In HeLa cells, dynab colocalized with 76 ± 11% of clathrin-EGFP punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), showing that in these cells, dynab mostly follows the activity of dynamin oligomerized at clathrin-coated pits CCPs.</p><p>We then analyzed the dynamics of dynab/dynamin co-localization while being recruited at CCPs.

Dynab intensity mirrored the dynamin-2 intensity profile (panel 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We observed three categories of patterns: (i) concomitant dynamin-dynab peaks - events where dynab fluorescence intensity grew along with dynamin-1 intensity and peaked simultaneously (panel 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); (ii) late dynab peaks - events where dynab peaked after dynamin-1 (panel 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); and (iii) early dynab peaks - events where dynab peaked before dynamin-1 (panel 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

To test this, we blocked the fission activity of dynamin by incubating TKO and HeLa cells in a hypertonic media for 1’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morlot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heuser and Anderson, 1989</xref>). In both TKO and HeLa cells, dynamin-1 was blocked at clathrin-coated pits with no co-staining for dynab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggesting that dynab could not detect non-active, but assembled dynamin-1 in both TKO and HeLa cells. On the contrary, in cells expressing dynamin-2 and dynab, the hypertonic shock resulted in a complete co-localization of dynab and dynamin-2, which agrees with a non-conformation dependent interaction of dynab with dynamin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We further tested the ability of dynab to bind fission defective dynamin-1 K44A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Damke et al., 1994</xref>) and K142A mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marks et al., 2001</xref>). We co-transfected HeLa cells with dynamin-1 K44A or dynamin-1 K142A tagged with mCherry along with dynab. Dynab did not co-localize with dynamin-1 K44A while it co-localized with dynamin-1 K142A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results confirmed that dynab detects the GTPase active forms of dynamin-1, as K44A is GTPase defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Damke et al., 1994</xref>) while K142A is constriction defective but GTPase active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marks et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>From these controls, we concluded that dynab could detect dynamin-1 GTPase activity in fibroblastic cells. From the different binding profiles of dynab to dynamin-1 described above, we concluded that dynamin’s GTPase activity in vivo is discontinuous and stochastic: it occurs in burst that are randomly distributed in time, instead of being continuous and proportional to the amount of dynamin present at the pit. We then analyzed statistically the relevance of these observations to better understand how dynamin GTP hydrolysis and polymerization are coupled.</p><p>To analyze the coupling of dynamin and dynab fluorescence profiles over time, we analyzed the time-lapse images obtained with TIRF in HeLa and TKO cells co-transfected with dynamin1- or dynamin-2 -mCherry and with dynab-EGFP. As a control, we used profiles obtained in cells transfected with both dynamin-1-EGFP and dynamin-1-mCherry as we expected them to be simultaneously recruited and disassembled from coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cocucci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grassart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Merrifield et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>), called DYNctrl in the following. A software was developed to post-process all intensity profiles (see Materials and methods). Each of the profiles of either dynab or dynamin was fitted with 4 Gaussians.

In TKO and HeLa, dynab average duration was 70–80% of dynamin-1’s average duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This shows that dynamin-1 is not permanently active when oligomerized at the neck of endocytic pits. As expected, dynab and dynamin-2 durations are equal in HeLa cells, while in TKO cells, a small but significant difference between dynamin-2 and dynab durations was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which may indicate a slight conformation-preference of dynab for dynamin-2 in those cells.</p><p>We then analyzed how the peak of dynamin-1 GTPase activity (dynab’s peak time) correlated with the dynamin-1 peak in time. We compared the distribution of time differences <italic>Δt</italic> between dynab and dynamin-1 peaks to the ones of dynab and dynamin-2 and DYNctrl. In both TKO and HeLa cells transfected with dynamin-1, we observed that the dynab-dynamin-1 <italic>Δt</italic> distribution is more spread than dynab-dynamin-2 or DYNctrl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The comparison of <italic>Δt</italic> distributions in TKO highlight that about 47% of the dynab peaks occur before dynamin-1’s peak (negative values of <italic>Δt</italic>), while for dynamin-2, less than 35% of the dynab peaks occurred before. For DYNctrl, the distribution of <italic>Δt</italic> is very narrow, and only 25% of the <italic>Δt</italic> are negative. For HeLa cells, 46% of events have a negative <italic>Δt</italic> for dyn1-dynab, 44% for dynamin-2-dynab and 33% for DYNctrl.</p><p>Since the duration of dynamin presence at CCPs is very variable, we calculated the time difference <italic>Δt</italic> between peaks of dynamin and the peaks dynab, and normalized it by the duration of the dynamin peak: we obtained <italic>Δt</italic> expressed in percentage of dynamin duration and binned the values in 5% clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In TKO and HeLa cells, the distribution of <italic>Δt</italic> for dynamin-2-dynab resembles the distribution of DYNctrl, where no time difference is expected. In contrast, the <italic>Δt</italic> distribution between dynab and dynamin-1 revealed a more spread distribution, suggesting that the kinetics of dynamin-1 recruitment and release is not fully coupled with its hydrolysis cycle. Uncoupling is clearer considering basic statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>): in TKO cells, if <italic>Δt</italic> values less than ±10% are taken as simultaneous events, the majority of dynab peaks happened before or after the dynamin peak (29% peaks before and 24% of peaks after), while 47% of the events are simultaneous. Note that these 47% are not the same population than the 47% of negative <italic>Δt</italic> values described above. For dynab-dynamin-2 and the DYNctrl, the majority of peaks (&gt;60%) are simultaneous. In HeLa, the same statistics also show a complete uncoupling of dynab and dynamin-1 peak, with 33% of dynab peaks occurring before and 32% after dynamin-1 peak, while only 35% are simultaneous. For dynab-dynamin-2 and DYNctrl, the majority (&gt;50%) of events are simultaneous.</p><p>Dynab also displays a double peak behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In TKO cells, 8% of dynamin-1 peaks are coupled with two dynab peaks, while it represented only 5.3% and 1.6% of dynamin-2 and DYNctrl respectively. In HeLa cells, 5.8% of dynamin-1 events are coupled to double dynab peaks, 2.8% of dynamin-2 events and 2.5% of DYNctrl events. In most cases, the first peak occurs before the dynamin-1 peak, the second after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This supports the possibility that in double-peak events, the first burst of GTPase activity may happen too early, and that dynamin is not polymerized enough to perform its function (less than one turn), and that the second peak is the efficient activity peak that causes fission.</p><p>Considering the fact that TKO and HeLa cells gave very similar results, we concluded that overexpression of dynamin-1 in standard cell lines allows for the use of dynab without the necessity of removing endogenous dynamins. Our results indicate that the GTPase activity of dynamin occurs in bursts during polymerization of dynamin at the neck of endocytic pits, and that these bursts are not temporally correlated with the peak of dynamin presence at the pits.</p><p>We next tested if the intensity of the GTPase activity was correlated to the amount of dynamin polymerized around the neck. We found a strong correlation between the amount of dynamin-1 and dynab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) present at endocytic pits. Although temporally uncoupled, it seemed that the GTPase activity is proportional to the amount of dynamin present at the pit. This supports a concerted hydrolysis of GTP by all dynamins at the neck of endocytic pits, rather than a fixed number of turns of the dynamin helix being active while other turns being inactive. In the control experiments (DYNctrl) where dynamin-1-EGFP and dynamin-1-mCherry are co-expressed, low correlation was found, whereas a strong correlation is found with dynamin-2, as expected from the high affinity of dynab for dynamin-2.</p><p>In order to check if dynab could interfere with clathrin-mediated cargo uptake, we assayed transferrin and EGF internalization in HeLa cells while overexpressing dynamin-1 or −2 in presence or absence of dynab. Although overexpression of either dynamin-1 and −2 slightly lowers transferrin and EGF endocytosis, we observed that the expression of dynab alone or together with dynamin-2 dramatically impairs transferrin internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), while it has a minor effect on clathrin-mediated EGF internalization (low concentration of EGF are internalized mostly by CME, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sigismund et al., 2008</xref>). When dynab is co-expressed with dynamin-1, transferrin internalization is similar to internalization of transferrin in cells overexpressing dynamin-1 or dynamin-2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, dynab does not interfere with dynamin-1 mediated endocytosis. We however wondered how dynab could specifically interfere with the transferrin uptake mediated by dynamin-2, and not dynamin-1. As discussed above, the overall higher affinity of dynab for dynamin-2 may cause dynab to bind stronger to dynamin, potentially interfering sterically with the required interaction of the transferrin receptor (TfR) with the clathrin coat.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25197.025</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Transferrin internalization assay and TfR immunofluorescence on HeLa cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transferrin internalization assay and TfR immunofluorescence on HeLa cells overexpressing dynamin1/2 and dynab (<bold>B</bold>) Transferrin internalization assay and TfR immunofluorescence on HeLa cells overexpressing dynamin1/2 or dynab alone.

To our knowledge, dynab is a unique conformation-specific nanobody in that it binds preferentially the intermediate hydrolytic state of an enzyme, allowing to follow in real time the enzymatic activity of dynamin in vivo. By using dynab in live cell imaging experiments, we showed that dynamin’s GTP hydrolysis occurs in bursts and is not time-correlated with dynamin assembly.</p><p>There is a large consensus that dynamin-mediated membrane fission reaction requires the energy of GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonny et al., 2016</xref>). Two models of dynamin’s mechanism differ by how the GTP hydrolytic energy is spent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonny et al., 2016</xref>). In the constriction model, this energy is proposed to be used to constrict the polymer, in which GTPase domains could act as myosins, sliding adjacent helical turns, tightening the dynamin helix. In the depolymerization model, dynamin is proposed to assemble into an already tightened helix. Fission occurs when depolymerization is triggered by GTP hydrolysis, which energy would be used for breaking non-covalent bonds between monomers. Our finding that GTPase activity of dynamin is not correlated with dynamin polymer disassembly challenges the second model.</p><p>A surprising finding is that dynamin GTPase activity occurs in burst, which suggest that it is strongly regulated. This is consistent with the requirement of a coordinated GTPase hydrolysis for efficient fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). However, assembly triggers immediate increase in dynamin GTPase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marks et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Warnock et al., 1996</xref>), which should lead to a perfect co-localization of dynab with dynamin-1 over time. Our finding of bursts of GTP hydrolysis uncoupled with the assembly/disassembly of dynamin suggests that in cells, a molecular trigger is required to allow for GTPase activation. It is even more striking that in approx. 30% of the cases, the burst of GTPase activity occurs while dynamin starts depolymerizing, suggesting that the molecular regulation of the GTPase activity is fully uncoupled from the assembly process.</p><p>Although the nature of this trigger is unknown, we can envisage several hypotheses. Various BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs) proteins have been proposed to modulate dynamin’s GTPase and fission activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farsad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neumann and Schmid, 2013</xref>). One of these BAR proteins, syndapin, sees its interaction with dynamin blocked when dynamin is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anggono et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, bursts of dynamin dephosphorylation occur at the synapse during active phases, suggesting that the activation of endocytosis could be triggered by dynamin-syndapin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armbruster et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, another trigger may come from the specific activation of dynamin GTPase activity provided by fueling of GTP by the nucleotide diphosphate kinase NM23 that binds to dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boissan et al., 2014</xref>). How the NM23-Dynamin interaction is regulated is still unknown, but these three triggers may all participate in the control of dynamin GTPase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Phage display</title><p>The phage display screening was performed using a library of the recombinant VHH library NaLi-H1 (21).

Our code classifies each individual spot in an image into an already detected candidate event or a new candidate event. All candidate events have to fulfill the following five criteria to be considered real events. First, the sequence of spots forming the event must show spatial correspondence over time. Second, the event has to last a minimum number of frames determined by a user threshold (set to 10 frames in our sequences), but can be missing or undetected for two consecutive frames. Third, the event peak intensity has to be at least a 40% of the highest peak detected in any other event of the whole sequence. Note that the intensity is the integral of the gray level intensity in a circle centered in the spot maximum, where the background has been subtracted. Fourth, there must be a correlation higher than 0.45 between the intensity profiles of both channels. Finally, each channel has to show a goodness-of-fit with a mixture Gaussian function higher than 0.6. The software does not discard any candidate event that does not fulfill all the criteria, but labels each of them for the final user to decide which should be considered real events.</p><p>Following, the gray-intensity profiles are shifted to ensure that the minimum intensity of the profile is zero, and the data are fitted to a cubic spline function to increase the temporal resolution fourfold, that is 0,25 frames. Next each channel of the real event profiles is fitted to a four Gaussian mixture. When only a single peak is observed in a profile the fit returns the principal Gaussian together with Gaussians fit to the background noise which are subsequently discarded. From the principal Gaussians the peak of each channel is obtained and the relative delay between them obtained with an accuracy of 0.25 frames. In addition, the parameters of the Gaussians selected are stored to obtain statistics (event duration, event intensity) and to perform the curve averaging of the functions instead of the sampled data.</p><p>All events were manually validated to correct fitting errors and remove inconsistencies.

We further screened these positive clones for with conformation-specific by pull-down assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-2"><title>Isolation of dynab, a GDP·AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>‾</sup>-conformation-specific nanobody against dynamin-1</title><p>To further screen dynamin-binding nanobodies for affinity changes with the nucleotidic states of dynamin, we adapted SUPported bilayers with Excess membrane Reservoir (SUPER) templates for pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pucadyil and Schmid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neumann et al., 2013</xref>). SUPER templates consist of silica-beads covered with lipid membranes that can be tubulated and fissioned by dynamin. As dynamin binds to SUPER templates in its functional form (helical collar around a membrane tube), and without the requirement of tagging dynamin, we performed pull-downs of 5 dynamin-binding nanobodies using magnetic SUPER templates – where silica beads were replaced by magnetic silica beads – and pelleted the beads with a magnet. Specific binding of dynamin to the lipid coating was checked by treating the beads with 0.5% saponin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Dynamin-binding clones to be tested were selected first for their binding intensity in dot blot assays, and second for their purification yield after recombinant expression in bacteria. The fast magnetic SUPER template procedure allowed us to test each clone for binding to dynamin-2 loaded with different nucleotides. Surprisingly all the clones we tested bound dynamin-2 efficiently regardless of its nucleotide load (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This may be because our selection procedure retained only nanobodies binding dynamin-2 with high affinity. Consistent with this idea, conformation-specific antibodies usually have a moderate affinity. Also, we noticed that GTP analogs substantially increased the amount of dynamin binding to magnetic SUPER templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), probably because they increase dynamin oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carr and Hinshaw, 1997</xref>). Thus, GMPPCP-loaded dynamin-2 was used as a reference instead of nucleotide-free dynamin in the following experiments.</p><p>Despite the unsuccessful results with dynamin-2, we reasoned that some of the dynamin-binding nanobodies may have lower affinity for dynamin-1, and thus tested them against dynamin-1. We found one clone, that we named dynab, that preferentially bind to the GDP·AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>‾</sup> loaded dynamin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but with an overall lower affinity for dynamin-1 than for dynamin-2. Interestingly, dynab specifically detected the transition state of dynamin (GDP·AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>‾</sup> bound state), which is supposed to be transient and concomitant with the GTP hydrolysis. We concluded that dynab could potentially track the GTPase activity of dynamin.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Marko Kaksonen for their critical reading of the manuscript and useful discussion and Christien Merrifield and Pietro De Camilli for the materials provided.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Uncoupling of dynamin polymerization and GTPase activity revealed by the conformation-specific nanobody Dynab&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, including Christien Merrifield (Reviewer #1) as the Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marjin Ford (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, the authors develop a nanobody (Dynab) that recognizes the GTP bound state of dyn1. They show that, in cells, the recruitment of dynab is more tightly coupled to dynamin-1 recruitment than to dynamin-2 recruitment. They interpret the temporal mismatch between Dynab and dynamin-1 recruitment to indicate that dynamin GTP hydrolysis occurs stochastically and is only weakly coupled to dynamin-1 recruitment. They propose that their finding that the GTPase activity of dynamin is not correlated with dynamin polymer disassembly challenges one published model of dynamin action. Three reviewers have now read your paper and have come to similar conclusions. Overall all reviewers found the paper interesting and certainly provocative. However, some common concerns were raised that warrant further experiments, which would clarify the specificity and cellular effects of Dynab.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be important to understand better where Dynab binds to dynamin-1 and what transition state dynamin is in. This is essential information for interpreting the data. Furthermore, it is unclear why Dynab recognizes dynamin-2 irrespective of GTP bound state while it only recognizes GTP-bound dynamin-1. Dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 are ~80% homologous and it is safe to presume that the core mechanism of GTP hydrolysis / membrane scission is common to both. So knowing where Dynab binds dynamin-1 and understanding what underlies the specificity of Dynab is key to interpreting the data and will inform (i) the core mechanism of dynamin mediated scission and (ii) the peculiarities of dynamin-1 versus dynamin-2 mediated scission. Using minimal constructs and perhaps dynamin1/2 chimeras would also be useful here for in vivo work.</p><p>While extending characterization of Dynab, we would like to ask you to take into account the considerations listed below and, where possible and not too time-consuming, address them.</p><p>a) Considering that Dynab recognizes the GDP-AlF bound state of dynamin-1, Dynab signals observed in the experiments could be of dynab binding to non-lipid bound soluble dynamin oligomers rather than to the helical collars that mediate membrane fission. The authors might consider fluorescently labeling the lipid in the in vitro assays, which will confirm if dynamin is still bound to the lipid in the presence of GDP.ALF<sup>-</sup>. Alternatively, negative stain electron microscopy with gold labeled Dynab might be employed to show if the nanobody is labeling dynamin tubes.</p><p>b) It would be nice if the authors could determine whether Dynab primarily recognizes the dynamin G domain dimer, which is known to be stabilized by dynamin binding to GDP-AlF. Preferential recognition of the dimer by the nanobody may alter the natural kinetics of dynamin when the nanobody is present.</p><p>c) In addition to dynamin bound to GTP, GMPCP and GDP-AlF<sub>4</sub>, the authors might consider looking at various dynamin mutants such as K44A, K142A, and ΔPRD bound to these same GTP analogues in vitro.</p><p>2) A second, related question concerns the coincidence of peak Dynab versus dynamin-1 recruitment. Dynab binds to dynamin in the crowded molecular scrum at sites of endocytosis and will presumably block or interfere with the recruitment of some of dynamins' partners – and likewise recruitment of Dynab to dynamin will be blocked by invisible players. This is important because, for any given endocytic event, this will (i) influence the amount of Dynab bound and so (ii) influence where peak Dynab recruitment falls relative to peak dynamin recruitment. A simple control could be to co-express dynamin-1-GFP and dynamin-1-mCherry in the TKO background and find how often the peaks of green/red dynamin recruitment coincide. This will give some crude insight into the 'power' of the measurement – i.e. whether it is even reasonable to presume that the fluorescence signal of Dynab and dynamin-1 will coincide given the noisy signals.</p><p>3) It would be advisable that the authors test the uptake of a model cargo (transferrin) in the presence/absence of Dynab expression.</p><p>4) There are several issues with the analysis. First, and in a related vein to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2</xref>) it is striking that in general the kinetics of dynamin recruitment are consistently slower in the presence of Dynab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>) and perhaps the pair-wise comparisons used here will mask this global trend. An ANOVA type analysis using all the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> would be more appropriate here. Also the metric of 'time divided by time' has no units and the authors should use a different way to express this (perhaps using fractional notation).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Uncoupling of dynamin polymerization and GTPase activity revealed by the conformation-specific nanobody Dynab&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

On the recommendation of the reviewers, we have thus performed pull-downs with Dyn1-ΔPRD, and the G-G construct (G domain+BSE) crystallized in Chappie et al. Nature 2010. We also performed pull-downs with the full-length dyn1 mutants K44A and K142A. The results are:</p><p>- Pulling down dynab with Dyn1-ΔPRD on magnetic SUPER templates gives essentially the same results than full-length Dyn1, showing that, as expected, dynab does not bind the PRD domain of dynamin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>).</p><p>- We were able to pull-down the G-G construct using dynab as a bait (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), as seen from the slightly more intense bands in the G-G monomer (no nucleotide) and dimer (in presence of GDP.AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) columns compared to the control w/o dynab, and the S41 mutant (no dimerization, no conformational change). As these results are not striking and that changes in intensity could be linked to several common technical issues in pull-down assays, we do not think these results are of sufficient quality to be published. We think that dynab probably binds to dynamin in the helical polymer predominantly, which would explain the very weak interaction characterized by this pull-down.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25197-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>- Pulling-down dynab with the full-length K44A and K142A mutants on SUPER magnetic templates in the presence of GMP-PCP or GDP.AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> gave essentially the same results than the WT full-length dynamin 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Since both mutants are not locked in only one state, as K44A has a minimal GTPase activity, and that K142A has a normal GTPase activity, we think the mutants can be put into the same state than the WT by loading them with the same non-hydrolysable GTP analog.</p><p>In short, since we observed dynab binding only when dynamin was oligomerized onto membranes, we think dynab detects the polymeric helix of dynamin, in the transition state. We think dynab could bind to two adjacent helix turns at the same time, which would mean that it binds when the turns are tightly paired together by G-G bonds in the transition state. However, it may not bind the G-G dimer only, which means it probably binds parts of the stalks that are closely apposed when the turns are paired.</p><p>In respect to the different binding of dynab to dynamin 1 and 2, the reviewers raised a very important point: since the sequence homology between the two proteins is higher than 80% and admitting that the mechanism and structure of dynamin 1 and 2 polymers are similar (although there is no crystal structure of Dyn2 and not many in vitro assays using Dyn2), dynab should bind the two proteins with the same conformation sensitivity, whereas in most of our in vitro assays, dynab exhibited binding to dynamin2 regardless of its nucleotide load.</p><p>But we also observed that dynab has an overall lower affinity for dynamin1 than dynamin2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>By highlighting the different amino acids (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>), it is possible to observe that in the BSE, G-domain and the stalk, these differences would be sufficient to cause at least a difference of affinity of dynab for Dynamin1 as compared to Dynamin2.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25197-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>Also, we think that this higher affinity of dynab for dynamin2 may mask its ability to recognize specifically the GDP.AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> state in the in vitro assays. With a higher affinity, dynab will bind anyway to dynamin2, even perhaps forcing dynamin2 to adopt the conformation dynab prefers to bind to. Several of our observations are in line with this hypothesis:</p><p>1) dynab seems to weakly inhibit the GTPase activity of dynamin2 in GTPase assays (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which may be due to the fact that dynab partially blocks a specific conformational step in the GTPase cycle.</p><p>2) The duration of dynab peak at CCPs in cells is smaller than the one of dynamin, both for dyn1 and dyn2, whereas the controls (dyn-mCherry vs. dyn-GFP, DYNctrl) are perfectly identical. This suggest that dynab recognize dyn2 in a similar way than dyn1 in cells.</p><p>3) In further support of this, max intensities of dynab are proportional to max intensities of both dyn1 and dyn2 in TKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that dynab could detect the same conformation in both dyn1 and dyn2.</p><p>In conclusion, we do not think that dynab is detecting dyn1 and dyn2 in a very different manner, and we even think that dynab could bind dyn2 in a conformation specific manner. However, due to its higher affinity for dyn2, this effect may be partially masked in our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While extending characterization of Dynab, we would like to ask you to take into account the considerations listed below and, where possible and not too time-consuming, address them.</p><p>a) Considering that Dynab recognizes the GDP-AlF bound state of dynamin-1, Dynab signals observed in the experiments could be of dynab binding to non-lipid bound soluble dynamin oligomers rather than to the helical collars that mediate membrane fission.

Alternatively, negative stain electron microscopy with gold labeled Dynab might be employed to show if the nanobody is labeling dynamin tubes.</p></disp-quote><p>It is a fair point to say that dynab could bind to the oligomers of dynamin regardless of whether they are bound to the membrane or not. This is however unlikely since in the in vitro experiments (membrane sheets assay), unbound dynamin (whether monomeric or oligomeric) was washed-out of the chamber before addition of dynab. Moreover, in previous publication, dynamin staining was colocalizing with membrane tubes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> in Roux et al. Nature 2006). But we still performed the control proposed by the reviewers and we now show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref> that, using fluorescent lipids, dynamin coats the membrane tubules while interacting with dynab in presence of GDP·AlF<sub>4</sub>‾.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It would be nice if the authors could determine whether Dynab primarily recognizes the dynamin G domain dimer, which is known to be stabilized by dynamin binding to GDP-AlF.

As said above, we were able to pull-down the G-G construct using dynab as a bait, with and without GDP.AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>. As described above, these results are not conclusive, and we are not able to definitively confirm that dynab binds to the dimeric G-G form. It probably means that dynab binds to the oligomeric form of dynamin, including some parts of the stalk.</p><p> <italic>c) In addition to dynamin bound to GTP, GMPCP and GDP-AlF<sub>4</sub>, the authors might consider looking at various dynamin mutants such as K44A, K142A, and ΔPRD bound to these same GTP analogues</italic> in vitro.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we pulled down dynab with the full-length K44A and K142A mutants on SUPER magnetic templates in the presence of GMP-PCP or GDP.AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, all statistical analyses are actually compared to the analysis in which both dynamin1-mCherry and dynamin1-GFP are co-expressed (called DYNctrl in the text). We find that the control shows the same duration of events for both channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), shows 67% of coincident events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which is significantly different from the dyn1+dynab and dyn2+dynab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Indeed, as stated by the reviewer, we find that about 33% of the events in the control are not concomitant, which is most likely due to the noise in the signal and the analysis we are performing. Still, up to 65% of events are not concomitant in Dyn1+dynab (reversed statistics compared to the DYNctrl control), which statistically shows that dynab detects non-concomitant events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be advisable that the authors test the uptake of a model cargo (transferrin) in the presence/absence of Dynab expression.</p></disp-quote><p>The point made by the reviewer is fair, and prompted us into performing transferrin uptake assays in cells overexpressing dynab. We obtained the very striking result that transferrin internalization is significantly lower when expressing dynab alone or in co-expression with dynamin 2 mCherry in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). This was even more striking that we did not observe significant change of the CCP dynamics in cells transfected with dynab (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We thus concluded that even if the Clathrin-Coat machinery was not affected by dynab expression, the internalization of transferrin was impaired, most probably because its receptor was not properly internalized. Indeed, when overexpressing dynab, the Transferrin receptor (TfR) stays at the plasma membrane, and no endosomal pool is visible, as opposed to control cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We interpreted these results in the light of the reviewer’s hypothesis that dynab could create molecular crowding, blocking the specific interaction between TfR and the clathrin coat required for proper internalization of transferrin.</p><p>Even though puzzled by these results, we wondered if other cargoes suffered the same internalization defect. We thus checked the clathrin mediated internalization of EGF (using low concentrations of EGF, see: Sigismund S, Argenzio E, Tosoni D, Cavallaro E, Polo S, Di Fiore PP. Clathrin-mediated internalization is essential for sustained EGFR signaling but dispensable for degradation. Dev Cell. 2008 Aug;15(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2</xref>):209-19). In this case, EGF uptake was not significantly affected (Figure 4—figure supplement 4), suggesting that the impact of dynab overexpression was specific to Transferrin. Even more striking, dynab overexpression had no effect when dyn1 was expressed, suggesting that the higher affinity of dynab for dyn2 could cause the impairment of TfR internalization.</p><p>The authors consider that these results, although striking, clearly show that when dynamin1 is used, dynab does not cause any noticeable CME defect, both at the cargo and at the coat level, strongly supporting our proposition that dynab detects the GTPase activity of dyn1 at the CPPs in conditions close to physiological conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are several issues with the analysis. First, and in a related vein to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2</xref>) it is striking that in general the kinetics of dynamin recruitment are consistently slower in the presence of Dynab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>) and perhaps the pair-wise comparisons used here will mask this global trend.</p></disp-quote><p>We point out that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the general trend seems to be that the kinetics of dynamin are faster (not slower) when dynab is overexpressed, even though non-significant using a P-test. The pair-wise comparisons used are in our opinion the only valid ones, since cell type and expressed dynamin isoform are the same, only dynab is co-expressed in one of the two conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An ANOVA type analysis using all the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> would be more appropriate here.</p></disp-quote><p>The point of this figure was to compare the effect of dynab overexpression on duration of dynamin events in the different cell types transfected with dyn1 or dyn2.
