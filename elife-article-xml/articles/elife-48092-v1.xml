However, which patients are most likely to benefit from FAK inhibitors, and what the optimal FAK/immunotherapy combinations are, is currently unknown. We identify that cancer cell expression of the T-cell co-stimulatory ligand CD80 sensitizes murine tumors to a FAK inhibitor and show that CD80 is expressed by human cancer cells originating from both solid epithelial cancers and some hematological malignancies in which FAK inhibitors have not been tested clinically. In the absence of CD80, we identify that targeting alternative T-cell co-stimulatory receptors, in particular OX-40 and 4-1BB in combination with FAK, can drive enhanced anti-tumor immunity and even complete regression of murine tumors. Our findings provide rationale supporting the clinical development of FAK inhibitors in combination with patient selection based on cancer cell CD80 expression, and alternatively with therapies targeting T-cell co-stimulatory pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FAK</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>T-cell costimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C54352/A22011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serrels</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001003</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serrels</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C39669/A25919</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serrels</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Cancer Research UK had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Initially identified as a protein highly phosphorylated in response to integrin activation and primarily located at cell–extracellular matrix adhesion sites termed focal adhesions, FAK is now known to regulate a number of cellular processes linked to the malignant phenotype including migration, invasion, adhesion, polarity, proliferation, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McLean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sulzmaier et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, FAK can also translocate to the nucleus of cancer cells where it regulates inflammatory gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lim et al., 2012</xref>). This includes chemokines and cytokines, which orchestrate the composition of tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy at least in some scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Serrels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Serrels et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, FAK has emerged as a potentially promising target as a modulator of anti-cancer immunotherapy.</p><p>A number of small molecule FAK kinase inhibitors have now either completed, or are currently in, Phase-I clinical trials and results thus far suggest that they are generally well tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Jonge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soria et al., 2012</xref>). Using panels of cancer cell lines, several studies have attempted to identify biomarkers that predict sensitivity to FAK inhibition. Loss of expression of the tumor suppressor protein Merlin (also known as Neurofibromin 2) and/or E-cadherin have both been suggested as potential markers of sensitivity to FAK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shapiro et al., 2014</xref>). However, a clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT01870609) testing Merlin as a predictive marker for sensitivity to the FAK inhibitor Defactinib did not prove successful. Therefore, biomarkers enabling identification of patient populations most likely to benefit from FAK kinase inhibitors are much needed.</p><p>The discovery of a role for FAK in regulating the immuno-suppressive TME in mouse models of skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Serrels et al., 2015</xref>) and pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stokes et al., 2011</xref>) has resulted in a shift in the clinical development of FAK kinase inhibitors, with new focus towards immune oncology. There are now at least two clinical trials testing FAK kinase inhibitors in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting anti-PD-1, across multiple tumor types including pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT02758587, NCT02546531). These trials stem from our previous work showing that FAK knockout or the FAK kinase inhibitor VS-4718 can drive complete CD8 T-cell dependent regression of established SCC tumors through shifting the balance of CD8 T-cells: Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in favor of tumor clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Serrels et al., 2015</xref>), and that of others showing that VS-4718 can drive reprogramming of the immuno-suppressive pancreatic TME, including a reduction in Tregs, CD206<sup>+</sup> macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and stromal fibroblasts. This renders pancreatic tumors responsive to the combination of dual immune checkpoint therapy and chemotherapy (anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4, and Gemcitabine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that expression of the T-cell co-stimulatory ligand CD80 on the surface of murine cancer cells sensitizes tumors to the highly selective and potent FAK kinase inhibitor BI 853520 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirt et al., 2018</xref>). Extrapolating these findings to human cancer, we show that murine CD80<sup>+</sup> SCC cells that are highly responsive to BI 853520 co-express a number of genes associated with a cancer stem phenotype that has previously been identified in human SCC tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oshimori et al., 2015</xref>) and that a substantial proportion of human cancer cell lines representing a broad range of cancer types express the <italic>CD80</italic> transcript, supporting the potential for patient stratification based on cancer cell CD80 expression. Using murine CD80 negative SCC and pancreatic cancer cell lines that exhibit little response to BI 853520, we show that the combination of BI 853520 together with agonistic antibodies targeting other T-cell co-stimulatory receptors, in particular OX40 and 4-1BB, results in enhanced anti-tumor immunity and even complete CD8 T-cell dependent tumor regression leading to lasting immunological memory. Contributing to the enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of these combinations, we identify a novel role for FAK in regulating the expression of the immune checkpoint ligand PD-L2 on tumor-associated macrophages, monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and cancer cells, and in regulating expression of the immune co-stimulatory receptor Inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) on effector CD8 T-cells. Therefore, FAK inhibition promotes greater responsiveness to the anti-tumor effects of T-cell co-stimulation through reprogramming multiple immune regulatory pathways, supporting further development of these combinations for clinical testing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spectrum of responses to BI 853520</title><p>We have previously shown using a murine model of skin SCC that depletion of FAK expression or treatment with a small molecule FAK kinase inhibitor can result in immune-mediated tumor regression in syngeneic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Serrels et al., 2015</xref>). Using this same model system we first determined the anti-tumor efficacy of a different FAK kinase inhibitor, that is BI 853520 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirt et al., 2018</xref>), by monitoring tumor growth following injection of FAK-deficient cells (FAK-/-) or FAK-deficient cells that re-expressed wild-type FAK (FAK-wt) at comparable levels to endogenous.

FVB/N mice were injected subcutaneously with SCC7.1 or SCC6.2 cells and treated daily with either Vehicle or 50 mg/kg BI 853520. We observed complete regression of SCC7.1 tumors by day 27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), while in contrast a different SCC cell line, SCC6.2, tumors exhibited only a modest growth delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Subcutaneous injection of Met01 cells into FVB/N mice followed by daily treatment with either Vehicle or BI 853520 identified a heterogeneous response to BI 853520, with 3 out of 10 tumors showing only a growth delay and 7 out of 10 tumors displaying stable disease for the duration of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Lastly, subcutaneous injection of Panc43, Panc47, or Panc117 cells into C57BL/6 mice followed by daily treatment with either Vehicle or BI 853520 identified that Panc43 tumors exhibit only a modest growth delay in response to FAK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), while Panc47 and Panc117 tumors exhibit no response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Collectively, these results identify a spectrum of response to treatment with BI 853520.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CD8 T-cells mediate tumor regression/stable disease after BI 853520 treatment</title><p>Next we used antibody-mediated CD8 T-cell depletion to determine whether SCC7.1 tumor regression and Met01 stable disease was CD8 T-cell dependent. In mice treated with a CD8 T-cell depleting antibody, SCC7.1 and Met01 tumors exhibited only a modest growth delay in response to treatment with BI 853520 when compared to Vehicle treated controls, while in mice treated with an isotype control antibody all SCC7.1 tumors underwent complete regression and all Met01 tumors exhibited stable disease following treatment with BI 853520 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). Thus, FAK kinase inhibition acts via CD8 T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity to induce SCC7.1 tumor regression and Met01 stable disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Expression of CD80 correlates with response to BI 853520</title><p>A number of FAK kinase inhibitors, including BI 853520, are now in early-phase (I/II) clinical trials as experimental cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Jonge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soria et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shapiro et al., 2014</xref>). However, we do not know which patients are most likely to benefit from these inhibitors, and to-date there are no validated biomarkers. Based on our findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we hypothesized that either CD8 T-cell infiltration or expression of immune regulatory molecules that can modulate CD8 T-cell function might underlie sensitivity to FAK inhibition. To test this, we established subcutaneous tumors from each of the cell line models, and 12 days after implantation used flow cytometry to profile the CD8 T-cell infiltrate. This identified that SCC7.1 and Met01 tumors have a higher frequency of CD8 T-cell infiltration than SCC6.2, Panc43 and Panc47 tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, Panc117 tumors also had a higher frequency of CD8 T-cell infiltration when compared to SCC6.2, Panc43, and Panc47 tumors. Therefore, CD8 T-cell infiltration alone does not accurately predict response to BI 853520.</p><p>CD8 T-cell function can be regulated in a number of ways, including by the modulation of immune checkpoint pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marin-Acevedo et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore sought to determine whether differential expression of these pathways correlated with response to BI 853520. Initially, we used flow cytometry to show that the immune checkpoint receptor Programmed Death Receptor 1 (PD-1) was expressed on activated (CD44<sup>+</sup>) CD8 T-cells in all tumor types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We next showed that none of the cell lines expressed PD-L1 or PD-L2 under basal culture conditions (not shown). However, when the cell lines were stimulated with 10 ng/ml interferon-gamma (IFNγ) for 24 hr all cell lines upregulated PD-L1 to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), implying that all were capable of engaging the PD-1-PD-L1 axis. None of the cell lines upregulated the expression of PD-L2 in response to IFNγ treatment (not shown). Therefore, we did not identify any relationship between the PD-1-PD-L1 axis and response to BI 853520. PD-L1 and 2 belong to the family of B7 ligands that can engage coinhibitory and costimulatory receptors to regulate CD8 T-cell activity. We therefore profiled the expression of the B7 family of proteins across the tumor cell lines. While many of these ligands were not expressed by any of the cell lines, CD80 (also known as B7.1) was expressed exclusively by the SCC7.1 and Met01 cell lines that respond best to FAK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), thus correlating with response to BI 853520.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Expression of the immune costimulatory ligand CD80 renders tumors responsive to BI 853520.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative flow cytometry scatter plots of CD80 expression on SCC7.1, Met01, SCC6.2, Panc43, Panc47, and Panc117 cells under normal culture conditions.

CTLA-4 is a co-inhibitory receptor associated with suppression of anti-tumor immune responses and has a higher affinity than CD28 for binding CD80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van der Merwe et al., 1997</xref>). Through the process of trans-endocytosis CTLA-4 can deplete CD80 from the surface of neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qureshi et al., 2011</xref>), preventing CD80 - CD28 interaction and resulting T-cell co-stimulation. Regulatory T-cells, which we have previously shown are depleted from the tumor environment in response to treatment with a FAK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Serrels et al., 2015</xref>), represent a major cellular source of CTLA-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walker and Sansom, 2015</xref>). We therefore postulated that treatment with BI 853520 may result in a reduction in CTLA-4 expressing cells within the TME and a concomitant increase in CD80 availability. To test this, FVB/N mice were injected subcutaneously with SCC7.1 cells and treated daily with either Vehicle or 50 mg/kg BI 853520. Mice were culled 12 days post-tumor cell implantation and tumors processed for analysis by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Treatment with BI 853520 resulted in a significant decrease in CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and an increase in the frequency of CD45<sup>-</sup> cells expressing CD80 on their cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Both CD80 and CD28 blockade significantly impaired the anti-tumor efficacy of BI 853520 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), implying an important role for CD80 in regulating response to a FAK inhibitor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Enforced expression of CD80 renders tumors responsive to FAK inhibition</title><p>To further investigate the relationship between CD80 expression on cancer cells and sensitivity of tumors to the BI 853520 FAK inhibitor, we next expressed CD80 into the BI 853520-resistant SCC6.2 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using nanostring gene expression analysis we first confirmed that SCC6.2 cells have a similar expression profile of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules to that of CD80<sup>+</sup> SCC7.1 cells that respond to BI 853520 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), ensuring that SCC6.2 cells express MHC-I molecules required for CD8 T-cell recognition and effective anti-tumor immunity. We next transfected SCC6.2 cells with either the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3, or pcDNA3-CD80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), and injected the cells subcutaneously into FVB/N mice and monitored tumor growth in response to either treatment with Vehicle or BI 853520 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Expression of CD80 had no impact on SCC6.2 tumor growth. However, SCC6.2 pcDNA3-CD80 tumors showed a significantly improved response to BI 853520 in comparison to either Vehicle treated controls or SCC6.2 pcDNA3 tumors treated with BI 853520. Thus, CD80 expression sensitizes SCC6.2 tumors to BI 853520. Collectively, these findings suggest that cancer cell expression of CD80, most likely in combination with MHC-I expression, has the potential to identify tumors with increased sensitivity to FAK kinase inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>CD80<sup>+</sup> SCC cells co-express genes associated with a cancer stem cell phenotype previously reported in murine and human SCC</title><p>CD80 is most notably expressed by antigen presenting cells.

To our knowledge FAK inhibitors have not been tested in patients diagnosed with these cancer types. Collectively, these results suggest that CD80-expressing cancer cells are present in some solid epithelial cancers and some blood cancers, supporting the potential to select patients based on cancer cell CD80 expression for treatment with a FAK inhibitor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>BI 853520 enhances the effects of T-cell costimulatory receptor agonistic antibodies</title><p>Given that not all cancer cell lines expressed CD80, we next considered the concept of T-cell co-stimulation in combination with FAK inhibition using a number of agonistic antibodies targeting T-cell costimulatory receptors, including glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR, also known as Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 18 (TNFRSF18)), CD40 (also known as Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 5 (TNFRSF5)), 4-1BB (also known as tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9 (TNFRSF9) and CD137), and OX40 (also known as Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4 (TNFRSF4) and CD134). To investigate the potential anti-tumor efficacy of the FAK inhibitor in combination with these antibodies, SCC6.2 cells were injected subcutaneously into FVB/N mice and mice treated with either Vehicle, Vehicle + 100 µg/mouse anti-GITR, Vehicle + 100 µg/mouse anti-CD40, Vehicle + 100 µg/mouse anti-4-1BB, Vehicle + 100 µg/mouse anti-OX40, BI 853520 + 100 µg/mouse anti-GITR, BI 853520 + 100 µg/mouse anti-CD40, BI 853520 + 100 µg/mouse anti-4-1BB or BI 853520 + 100 µg/mouse anti-OX40 (treatment schedule shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Treatment of SCC6.2 tumors with Vehicle + anti-GITR agonistic antibody resulted in a small growth delay when compared to control treated tumors, which was not improved when the anti-GITR antibody was combined with BI 853520 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similar results were observed using an anti-CD40 agonistic antibody alone or in combination with BI 853520 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, treatment of SCC6.2 tumors with Vehicle + anti-4-1BB agonistic antibody resulted in 2 out of 8 tumors undergoing complete regression and the remaining six tumors exhibiting a delay in growth when compared to control treated tumors. Combining anti-4-1BB with BI 853520 further improved this response, resulting in 4 out of 8 tumors undergoing complete regression, and the remaining four tumors exhibiting an improved growth delay when compared with Vehicle + anti-4-1BB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Treatment of SCC6.2 tumors with Vehicle + anti-OX40 agonistic antibody resulted in 2 out of 8 tumors undergoing complete regression, and the remaining six exhibiting a growth delay when compared to control treated tumors. Combining anti-OX40 with BI 853520 resulted in complete regression of all tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, the FAK kinase inhibitor in combination with activation of either OX40 or 4-1BB represents a potentially promising therapeutic strategy. To determine whether the potent anti-tumor efficacy of BI 853520 + anti-OX40 was dependent on CD8 T-cells, we depleted CD8 T-cells using an anti-CD8 antibody, and measured SCC6.2 tumor growth in FVB/N mice receiving either Vehicle or BI 853520 + anti-OX40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In mice receiving anti-CD8 antibody the combination of BI 853520 + anti-OX40 resulted in a growth delay when compared to mice treated with anti-CD8 antibody and Vehicle. However, only in mice receiving an isotype control antibody the combination of BI 853520 + anti-OX40 resulted in complete regression of all tumors, implying that tumor regression was dependent on CD8 T-cells. An anti-tumor CD8 T-cell response should also result in lasting immunological memory. We therefore aged mice for two months following regression of SCC6.2 tumors in response to treatment with BI 853520 + anti-OX40, and rechallenged these mice with a fresh preparation of SCC6.2 cells. All mice remained tumor free during the two months following initial regression of SCC6.2 tumors and following rechallenge no tumor growth was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In contrast, subcutaneous injection of the same SCC6.2 cell preparation into FVB/N mice that had never previously been challenged resulted in robust growth of all tumors. Therefore, SCC6.2 tumor regression in response to BI 853520 + anti-OX40 resulted in lasting immunological memory that renders mice resistant to further tumor growth.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>BI 853520 improves the response of SCC6.2 tumors to 4-1BB and OX40 agonistic antibodies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dosing schedule.

However, this did not explain why BI 853520 enhanced the anti-tumor immune response when used in combination with anti-OX40. We found no statistically significant difference in the frequency of CD8 T-cells co-expressing either PD-1 and LAG-3 or PD-1 and Tim-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), although there was a trend towards increased PD-1<sup>+</sup>Tim-3<sup>+</sup> CD8 T-cells in both OX40 and OX-40 + BI 853520 treated tumors.

Therefore, BI 853520 treatment generally depletes the availability of PD-L2 within the tumor microenvironment, likely impacting on decrease of PD-L2-PD-1 signaling and ultimately escape of CD8 T-cells from exhaustion. To ascertain whether treatment with a FAK inhibitor could directly regulate expression of PD-L2 on macrophages, in vitro bone marrow-derived macrophages were treated with 100 nM BI 853520 and stimulated with 10 ng/ml interleukin-4 (IL-4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>).

By day 21, 5 out of 10 tumors treated with anti-OX40 + anti-PD-L2 had undergone complete regression, while in contrast all tumors treated with anti-OX40 alone were still present, albeit small. Anti-PD-L2 in combination with anti-4-1BB resulted in a small decrease in the mean tumor volume at day 21 when compared to anti-4-1BB alone. However, this was not statistically significant. Therefore, regulation of PD-L2 likely contributes more towards the anti-tumor efficacy of BI 853520 when used in combination with anti-OX40.</p><p>Similar experiments were performed to investigate the role of ICOS in the anti-tumor response to either BI 853520 + anti-OX40 or BI 853520 + anti-4-1BB. Signaling through ICOS has been reported to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of OX40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Metzger et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore used an ICOS-ligand (ICOSL) blocking antibody to inhibit ICOS signaling. Blocking ICOSL had a significant impact on the anti-tumor efficacy of both BI 853520 + anti-OX40 and BI 853520 + anti-4-1BB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L,M</xref>), suggesting that enhanced T-cell expression of ICOS may be an important mechanism through which a FAK inhibitor can potentiate the anti-tumor activity of anti-OX40 and anti-4-1BB targeted therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>BI 853520 renders Panc47 tumors responsive to immune costimulatory antibodies</title><p>SCC6.2 cancer cells were generated using the DMBA/TPA chemical carcinogenesis protocol that results in a large number of somatic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nassar et al., 2015</xref>), and therefore likely increased immunogenicity. Hence, one would predict that these will respond better to immunotherapy than poorly immunogenic tumor models such as those derived from the KPC GEM model of pancreatic cancer. We therefore tested the same combinations of BI 853520 + /- immune costimulatory antibodies to determine whether a FAK inhibitor combined with T-cell co-stimulation could also influence a more poorly immunogenic tumor model. Panc47 cells were injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice and mice treated with either Vehicle or BI 853520 + /- immune costimulatory antibodies (treatment schedule shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Anti-GITR alone had no effect on the growth of Panc47 tumors, while in combination with BI 853520 we observed a small growth delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, treatment with an anti-CD40 agonistic antibody resulted in a significant delay in the growth of Panc47 tumors, and this was not further enhanced when used in combination with BI 853520 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

In particular, we identify CD80, 4-1BB, and OX40 as promising candidate pathways for co-targeting with a FAK inhibitor and show that these combinations can unlock anti-tumor immune responses capable of driving complete regression of at least some mouse tumor models. We provide novel mechanistic insight into the complex immune modulation that occurs in response to a FAK inhibitor, identifying not only changes in immune cell recruitment to tumors, but also in the expression of molecular pathways including PD-L2 and ICOS that fine tune the efficacy of the anti-tumor T-cell response. These data identify new strategies for the development of FAK inhibitors and enhance our understanding of how FAK regulates the immuno-suppressive tumor environment that can modulate response to immunotherapy.</p><p>A number of Phase-I clinical trials have now been completed testing FAK inhibitors in patients with a broad range of solid tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sulzmaier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Jonge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soria et al., 2012</xref>). Alongside this, there have been a number of studies aimed at defining potential strategies for identification of patients most likely to benefit from a FAK inhibitor. Both Merlin and E-cadherin have been proposed as potential biomarkers in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shapiro et al., 2014</xref>). However, a Phase-II clinical trial in which patients with Mesothelioma were treated with the FAK inhibitor Defactinib and tested for Merlin expression was terminated early due to lack of improved efficacy as a maintenance therapy for Merlin-low tumors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT01870609). To date, the relationship between E-cadherin status and sensitivity to FAK kinase inhibition has not been reported in the clinic. Our data provide a mechanistic justification supporting an alternative strategy for patient stratification based on cancer cell CD80 expression. CD80 has been linked to promoting anti-tumor immune responses in multiple mouse models of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marchiori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scarpa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baskar et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ganesan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Haile et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hodge et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Townsend and Allison, 1993</xref>), and exogenous administration of recombinant CD80 protein can promote anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horn et al., 2018</xref>). However, CD80 is a ligand for two receptors with opposing functions in regulating T-cell responses, namely CTLA-4 and CD28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Linsley et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Linsley et al., 1990</xref>). CTLA-4, which functions to suppress T-cell responses, has a higher avidity for CD80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van der Merwe et al., 1997</xref>) and depletes CD80 availability by the process of trans-endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qureshi et al., 2011</xref>), thereby impacting on CD80 - CD28 interaction and T-cell activation. We show that a FAK inhibitor can shift this balance in favor of CD80 - CD28 interaction, promoting an anti-tumor immune response that is dependent on both CD80 and CD28. The clinical translation of these findings will require an improved understanding of cancer cell CD80 expression in human malignancies. CD80 expressing cancer cells have been identified in human skin SCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miao et al., 2019</xref>) and pre-neoplastic colon lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marchiori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scarpa et al., 2015</xref>), and our analysis of human cancer cell line transcriptomics data further suggests that cancer cell <italic>CD80</italic> expression is present in a broad range of solid epithelial cancers. However, further investigation will be required in order to fully understand the extent of CD80 protein expression in human malignancies. In addition to solid cancers, we also identified a number of hematological malignancies that co-express high levels of <italic>CD80</italic> and <italic>PTK2</italic>, highlighting potential opportunities for the development of FAK inhibitors for the treatment of some blood cancers. To our knowledge, FAK kinase inhibitors have never been clinically tested in these tumor types.</p><p>Following the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors there has been growing interest in targeting T-cell co-stimulatory pathways as potential cancer therapies. Agonistic antibodies and/or RNA aptamers targeting receptors including 4-1BB, OX40, CD40, GITR, ICOS and CD28 are in pre-clinical development, and have shown anti-tumor activity in mouse models of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sanmamed et al., 2015</xref>). Humanized antibodies for several of these receptors have now progressed to clinical testing, with some results suggesting limited anti-tumor efficacy as a monotherapy. For example, a Phase-I clinical trial of the anti-4-1BB antibody PF-05082566 in patients with advanced solid tumors reported an objective response rate of 3.8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Segal et al., 2018</xref>), while MOXR0916 (anti-OX40) achieved stable disease in some patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaron Hansen et al., 2016</xref>). These and other antibodies are now being tested in combination with various other immune and non-immune targeted therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sanmamed et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linch et al., 2015</xref>). Our data suggest that a FAK inhibitor represents a promising candidate for combination with either anti-OX40 or anti-4-1BB antibodies. We propose that it is the complex reprogramming of multiple immune regulatory mechanisms in response to FAK inhibition that complements the immune stimulatory effects of these antibodies in order to fine tune the efficacy of the anti-tumor response. In support of this, we found a novel role for FAK in regulating expression of the immune checkpoint ligand PD-L2 and showed that this may contribute to the improved efficacy of the FAK/anti-OX40 combination. Concurrent administration of anti-PD-1 has previously been reported to suppress the therapeutic effect of anti-OX40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Messenheimer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shrimali et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings suggest that these previous observations are likely due to blockade of PD-L1 - PD-1 signaling which is not regulated by FAK. We also identified a novel role for FAK in regulating the expression of ICOS, primarily on CD8<sup>eff</sup> T-cells, and showed that blocking ICOS ligand could impair the anti-tumor efficacy of both FAK/anti-OX40 and FAK/anti-4-1BB combinations. The ICOS pathway has previously been implicated in regulating the therapeutic response to anti-OX40, but not 4-1BB, leading to the conclusion that ICOS signaling on CD4 T-cells was important for anti-OX40 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Metzger et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings suggest that at least in some circumstances ICOS may also play an important role in regulating CD8 T-cell responses. These disparities may represent differences in the cancer models used, or may perhaps be explained by our observation that anti-OX40 alone only results in a relatively small upregulation of ICOS on CD8<sup>eff</sup> T-cells, while anti-OX40 in combination with a FAK inhibitor results in a much greater upregulation of ICOS expression. While much of the research into ICOS function has focused on its role in CD4 T-cells, there is evidence supporting a role for ICOS in CD8 T-cell effector function. Ectopic expression of ICOS ligand can result in CD8 T-cell co-stimulation and tumor regression in the absence of CD4 T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wallin et al., 2001</xref>). ICOS-deficient patients have a reduced number of CD8 memory T-cells and impaired CD8 T-cell interferon-γ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, FAK-dependent induction of ICOS expression on CD8<sup>eff</sup> T-cells may represent an important and novel mechanism contributing to the efficacy of FAK/immunotherapy combinations that warrants further investigation.</p><p>Here, we have assessed individual co-stimulatory antibodies in combination with a FAK inhibitor. However, simultaneous administration of multiple co-stimulatory antibodies in combination with a FAK inhibitor may further improve efficacy. Pre-clinical studies have shown that anti-4-1BB when used in combination with anti-OX40 is more effective at boosting CD8 T-cell expansion, effector function, and anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler and Vella, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morales-Kastresana et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, this combination is reported to have synergistic effects that not only enhance CD8 T-cell clonal expansion, but also endow CD8 T-cells with supereffector function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2007</xref>).

The resulting cell pellet was re-suspended in PBS containing Zombie NIR viability dye [1:1000 dilution (BioLegend)] and incubated at 4°C for 30 min then pelleted by centrifugation at 1300 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS + 1% FBS + 0.1% sodium azide) and pelleted by centrifugation at 1300 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. This step was repeated twice. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of Fc block [1:200 dilution of Fc antibody (eBioscience) in FACS buffer] and incubated for 15 min. 100 µl of antibody mixture [diluted in FACS buffer (antibody details listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">supplementary files 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>)] was added to each well and the samples incubated for 30 min in the dark. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1300 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and washed twice with FACS buffer as above. Finally, cells were re-suspended in FACS buffer and analyzed using a BD Fortessa. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software. Statistics and graphs were calculated using Prism (GraphPad). For flow cytometry analysis of cell lines, growth medium was removed and cells washed twice in PBS. Adhered cells were dissociated from tissue culture flasks by incubating them in enzyme free cell dissociation solution (Millipore) for 10 min at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and then scraping with a cell scraper. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1300 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and washed with PBS. This step was repeated twice. Cells were then resuspended in viability dye and stained as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Nanostring analyses</title><p>RNA extracts were obtained using a RNeasy kit (Qiagen), following manufacturer’s instructions. 100 ng of RNA was analyzed using a mouse nanostring PanCancer Immune Profiling panel as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Hybridization was performed for 18 hr at 65°C and samples processed using the nanostring prep station set on high sensitivity. Images were analyzed at maximum (555 fields of view). Data were normalized using nSolver 4.0 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of CD80 expression in human cancer cell line data</title><p>The expression of CD80 and FAK were assessed across the panels of cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>) using data downloaded from The Broad Institute portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle">https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Generation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)</title><p>Bilateral tibias and femurs dissected from FVB/N mice were flushed with 5 ml of DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin into a 50 ml tube, washed in medium once and filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer. Cells were seeded at 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> per well in a 6-well plate and cultured in 2 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS and 25 ng/ml recombinant mouse M-CSF for 7 days. BMDMs generated this way were then washed with PBS followed by replacement with fresh media containing recombinant mouse IL-4 (10 ng/ml) and/or BI 853520 (100nM). BMDMs were cultured for a further 48 hr, washed with PBS and harvested using non-enzymatic dissociation buffer, stained with fluorescent conjugated antibodies and analyzed by Flow cytometry as described above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the Flow Cytometry facility at the University of Edinburgh Centre for Inflammation Research for their help with FACS analysis, the Central Biological Services animal technicians at Little France 2, University of Edinburgh for their assistance with animal research studies, and the Host and Tumour Profiling Unit at the University of Edinburgh CRUK Centre for help with nanostring analysis.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Employee of Boehringer Ingelheim</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Animal experimentation: All animal work was carried out in compliance with UK Home Office guidelines under project license number PPL 7008897, and in accordance with the principles of the 3Rs.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jeffrey Settleman as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Canel et al. present a study where they propose that targeting tumor FAK drives anti-tumor immunity in combination with anti-CD80, anti-OX40, and anti-41BB in models. The authors showed that CD80 expression in cancer cells was correlated with sensitivity to FAK inhibitors, and combination of FAK inhibitors and anti-OX40 or 4-1BB agonistic Ab is also effective for CD80 negative epithelial cancers partly through down-regulation of PD-L2 expression on cancer cells and macrophages.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major role of FAK and FAK inhibitors have been published in the context of cancer immunology and immunotherapy (Jiang et al., 2016; Serrels et al., 2015). The novelty and interest of the present study depends on whether the authors can convincingly show the mechanisms of combinatorial therapies and translational potential. In this regard, this manuscript is still descriptive with excessive association data, and lack of mechanistic analysis. If they had data demonstrating distinct mechanisms by which FAK inhibitor therapy can be utilized along with anti-CD80, anti-OX40, and anti-41BB, this would be an interesting observation, but such data was not provided. Therefore, further investigations are needed as described below to clarify the underlying mechanisms for both CD80 positive and negative cancers in murine and human cancers. Especially further clarification of the role of CD80 on CD80 positive cancer cells and PD-L2 on CD80 negative cancer cells in the sensitivity of FAK inhibitors by using gene manipulation or antibody study are essential for the revision.</p><p>The authors showed that CD80 expression in cancer cells was correlated with response to FAK inhibitors by comparing CD80 positive and negative murine cancer cell lines, and the anti-tumor activity was CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell dependent. The analysis of human cancer showed that high CD80 expression was only detected in hematological malignancies, not in epithelial cancers. The expression of both CD80 and PTK2 (FAK gene) was shown only in some of lymphomas including Burkitt's and Hodgkin's lymphoma, although the gene expression of CD80 and PTK2 is inversely correlated in general. Therefore, CD80 expression may be a marker for sensitivity to FAK inhibitors, although FAK inhibitors have not been evaluated before for hematologic malignancies. The authors did not evaluate the molecular mechanisms for high sensitivities of CD80+ cancer cells. The authors discussed the possibility that reduction of CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> Treg by FAK inhibitors may increase the availability of CD80 to CD28 on T-cells, but anti-CD28 agonistic Ab did not enhance anti-tumor activity of FAK inhibitors, so the role of CD80/CD28 interaction in the FAK inhibitor activity is not clear. In human cancers, CD80 is expressed only in some of the lymphomas, not in epithelial cancers. The authors did not use CD80 positive lymphoma models to confirm their sensitivity to FAK inhibitors. So they have insufficient human data indicating how to select and target patient populations, and their suggested translation is not well justified.</p><p>For the major conclusion &quot;CD80 expression on tumor cells plays a crucial role in the anti-tumor effects of FAK inhibitor&quot;, further studies may be necessary as follows: 1) Could the anti-tumor effects of FAK inhibitor be abrogated by a defect of CD80 on tumor cells by gene editing or blockade of CD80 by the injection with antagonistic mAb? 2) Is the interaction of CD80 with CD28 on T-cells important for the effects of FAK inhibitor? Do the anti-tumor effects of FAK inhibitor disappear in CD28-deficient mice? 3) The authors should investigate the effects of antagonistic anti-CD28 antibody on the tumor regression induced by administration of BI 853520 in various CD80-positive tumor cells including SCC7.1, Met01 or SCC6.2 pcDNA3-CD80, to evaluate a possible involvement of CD28 in BI 853520-mediated reinvigoration of anti-tumor immunity. The same is true for the study of combinatorial additive anti-tumor effects of BI 853520 and agonistic anti-OX40 or anti-4-1BB antibodies on CD80-negative and FAK (PTK2)-high tumor cells.</p><p>The authors should investigate various phenotypic changes by the treatment with BI 853520 in tumor micro environment (TME). If the authors would show the data obtained from any in vitro assay that can elucidate effects of BI 853520 on CD80+ FAK (PTK2) high cancer cells, immune cells and many other cells in TME, the significance of this study will be strengthened.</p><p>The authors evaluated immune-modulating and anti-tumor activities of FAK inhibitors also for FAK negative epithelial cancers, and found that OX40 or 4-1 BB agonistic Ab synergized with the FAK inhibitor for CD80 negative murine epithelial cancers. However, the authors did not show new mechanism for this combination other than their previously published findings such as reduction of Treg and MDSC/TAM. In this paper, they showed an interesting finding that FAK inhibitor decreased PD-L2, not PD-L1 on cancer cells and MDSC/TAM (Figure 6G and 6I), but the specific role of PD-L2 decrease in the anti-tumor effects by the combination treatment was not investigated. To address this question, anti-tumor effects of FAK inhibitor may be examined in the experiments using PD-L2-KO tumor cells or PD-L2-KO mice. To examine the direct effects of FAK inhibitor on tumor cells to down-regulate PD-L2 expression, in vitro experiment to test PD-L2 expression of tumor cells in the presence of FAK inhibitor needs to be performed. Similar experiments should be performed by using various human cancer cell lines to examine its applicability in clinical setting.</p><p>Data in Figure 1H and 1I suggested that the anti-tumor effects of FAK inhibitor are dependent on CD8 T-cells. On the other hand, Figure 6C indicated that treatment with FAK inhibitor did not increase the number of CD8 T-cells. To reconcile these results, the change of CD8 T-cell number in SCC7.1 or Met01 models should be shown. In addition, it may be better to analyze &quot;tumor-specific&quot; rather than &quot;whole&quot; CD8 T-cell number in these experiments.</p><p>In the first paragraph of the subsection “Spectrum of responses to BI 853520”, the authors claimed that BI 853520 did not show any off target effects on SCC FAK-wt tumor, because no significant effect on tumor growth was observed in SCC FAK-/- tumor. However because SCC FAK-/- did not grow well in vivo because they are sensitive to endogenous anti-tumor immunity, authors cannot exclude off target effects of BI 853520 by checking effects only on tumor growth.</p><p>The authors showed only similarity of cancer stem cell-associated gene expression in SCC7.1 cells, but they did not evaluate stem cell like biological characteristics of SCC7.1 on sensitivity to BI 853520 and subsequent enhancement of tumor immunity. To emphasize the cancer stem cell-like characteristics of SCC7.1, the authors should investigate the high transplantation rate of SCC7.1 in tumor transplantation experiment in vivo.</p><p>In Discussion section, the authors often repeated the results and did not describe much about the mechanisms of activated tumor immunity induced by BI 853520 alone or in combination with agonistic anti-OX40 or anti-4-1BB antibodies. If the authors describe this by referring appropriate publications instead of repeating the results, the readers may understand the significance of this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48092.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major role of FAK and FAK inhibitors have been published in the context of cancer immunology and immunotherapy (Jiang et al., 2016; Serrels et al., 2015).

While this is clearly an important function, we believe the data presented here implies that FAK regulates the anti-tumor immune response in a more extensive and complex manner that has yet to be fully understood. FAK kinase inhibitors are currently in Phase I/II clinical trials, and the major interest here is in their potential as immune oncology agents in combination with other immune targeted therapies. In this context, we identify potential combinations with immune costimulatory agonists that are readily clinically translatable, and provide mechanistic insights into why they are more effective than either monotherapy alone. These findings not only have the potential to impact on the clinical development of FAK inhibitors, but also on immune co-stimulatory agents such as anti-OX40 and anti-4-1BB antibodies which have not shown significant anti-tumour activity as a monotherapy but remain of significant interest to the immune oncology field. We thank the reviewers for their insightful comments that have helped to strengthen the conclusions of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors showed that CD80 expression in cancer cells was correlated with response to FAK inhibitors by comparing CD80 positive and negative murine cancer cell lines, and the anti-tumor activity was CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell dependent.

These data clearly show that blocking either CD80 or CD28 can abrogate the effects of the FAK inhibitor. It was not feasible to undertake these studies in multiple tumor models and so we have focused on the SCC7.1 tumor model which undergoes complete CD8 T-cell dependent regression in response to a FAK inhibitor. Furthermore, we have added flow cytometry data showing that treatment of SCC7.1 tumors with the FAK inhibitor results in a decrease in CTLA-4 expressing immune cells and an increase in CD80 surface expression on non-immune cells (Figure 2C, D). These findings further support the proposed mechanism i.e. FAK inhibition reshapes the tumor microenvironment to favor CD80: CD28 interaction through depleting immune cells such as regulatory T-cells that express CTLA-4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>The authors should investigate various phenotypic changes by the treatment with BI 853520 in tumor micro environment (TME).

Figure 6—figure supplement 7 also shows the effects of BI 853520 on PD-L2 expression by macrophages in vitro. In terms of the effects of BI 853520 on CD80<sup>+</sup> cancer cells, it is not clear what useful information would be generated from in vitro studies. The new and existing data presented in the manuscript implies that the mechanism of action of BI 853520 on CD80<sup>+</sup> tumors is likely through shifting the balance of CD80 signaling in favor of CD28 and T-cell activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>The authors evaluated immune-modulating and anti-tumor activities of FAK inhibitors also for FAK negative epithelial cancers, and found that OX40 or 4-1 BB agonistic Ab synergized with the FAK inhibitor for CD80 negative murine epithelial cancers.

In this paper, they showed an interesting finding that FAK inhibitor decreased PD-L2, not PD-L1 on cancer cells and MDSC/TAM (Figure 6G and 6I), but the specific role of PD-L2 decrease in the anti-tumor effects by the combination treatment was not investigated.

These data show individual tumor volumes and suggest that PD-L2 may contribute to the enhanced activity of OX40 with a FAK inhibitor but is less likely to contribute to combination with anti-4-1BB. The effects of anti-PD-L2 on anti-OX40 activity are not statistically significant. However, after 21 days 5 tumors in this group have undergone complete regression while none in the OX40 alone group have completely regressed. We believe that this is indicative of a role for PD-L2 in contributing to the enhanced activity of a FAK inhibitor in combination with anti-OX40.</p><p>We have addressed whether a FAK inhibitor regulates PD-L2 expression on macrophages directly (Figure 6—figure supplement 7). These studies have been performed using in vitro bone-marrow derived macrophages +/- treatment with interleukin-4 to stimulate PD-L2 expression. We observed a small decrease in IL-4 stimulated PD-L2 expression on macrophages following treatment with a FAK inhibitor. This regulation is not as extensive as we observe in vivo, implying that additional mechanisms may contribute to FAK-dependent regulation of PD-L2 expression in tumors. Similar studies were also undertaken using a variety of cancer cells, however none of these expressed PD-L2 in response to IL-4 stimulation.</p><p>We have also added new data showing a novel role for FAK in regulating ICOS expression, primarily on CD8<sup>eff</sup> T-cells, and have investigated the contribution of this to the combinatorial activity of the FAK inhibitor with OX40 and 4-1BB. Figure 6D shows that OX40 treatment increases ICOS expression on CD8<sup>eff</sup> T-cells and that this is markedly enhanced when OX40 is combined with the FAK inhibitor. An increase in ICOS expression is also observed on non-Treg CD4 T-cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 4). Further, regulation of ICOS on CD8<sup>eff</sup> T-cells in response to the FAK inhibitor is not restricted to combination with OX40, as we also identified this to occur in CD80+ SCC7.1 tumors (Figure 6—figure supplement 5). Using an ICOS ligand blocking antibody we show that ICOS plays an important role in the anti-tumor efficacy of both the FAK inhibitor in combination with OX40 and 4-1BB (Figure 6L, M).</p><p>These new data imply that regulation of PD-L2 and ICOS contributes to the mechanisms underlying improved anti-tumor activity of the FAK inhibitor in combination with OX40, and that ICOS plays an important role in the mechanism underpinning the combination with 4-1BB. Further, these studies are the first to identify a role for FAK in regulating molecular pathways, as opposed to immune cell recruitment, that contribute to immune suppression/activation and highlight the complexity of FAK-dependent immune modulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data in Figure 1H and 1I suggested that the anti-tumor effects of FAK inhibitor are dependent on CD8 T-cells. On the other hand, Figure 6C indicated that treatment with FAK inhibitor did not increase the number of CD8 T-cells. To reconcile these results, the change of CD8 T-cell number in SCC7.1 or Met01 models should be shown. In addition, it may be better to analyze &quot;tumor-specific&quot; rather than &quot;whole&quot; CD8 T-cell number in these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously published (Serrels et al., 2015) that treatment with a FAK inhibitor can increase CD8 T-cell number in the tumor model used in Figure 1A which also expresses CD80. The tumor models used in Figures 1B, C also express CD80 and therefore express a T-cell co-stimulatory signal that will drive T-cell expansion. In Figures 2C, D we show that the CD80, CTLA-4 pathway is modulated by a FAK inhibitor, likely in favor of CD80-CD28 interaction. This pathway is not present in CD80<sup>-</sup> tumors such as that used in Figure 6. Hence, in the absence of a T-cell co-stimulatory signal we do not see increased CD8 T-cell infiltration into tumors in response to a FAK inhibitor. The additional data included in Figure 6D, Figure 6—figure supplements 4, 5 also imply that a FAK inhibitor may regulate T-cell effector function through increasing expression of T-cell co-stimulatory receptors such as ICOS, and so it is not as simple as just increasing T-cell numbers. For example, Figure 6—figure supplement 5 shows that a FAK inhibitor increases ICOS expression on CD8<sup>eff</sup> T-cells in the CD80+ SCC7.1 tumors, while it does not in the SCC6.2 tumors which are negative for a T-cell co-stimulatory signal such as CD80 (Figure 6D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p> <italic>In the first paragraph of the subsection “Spectrum of responses to BI 853520”, the authors claimed that BI 853520 did not show any off target effects on SCC FAK-wt tumor, because no significant effect on tumor growth was observed in SCC FAK-/- tumor.

We therefore did not undertake limiting dilution assays as we believe this would represent an unnecessary use of animals that on this occasion would not strengthen the key conclusions from this figure. Rather, we have used flow cytometry to confirm the expression of CD34 and Integrin alpha-6, the key markers of the reported skin cancer cell population reported in Miao et al., 2019.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Discussion section, the authors often repeated the results and did not describe much about the mechanisms of activated tumor immunity induced by BI 853520 alone or in combination with agonistic anti-OX40 or anti-4-1BB antibodies. If the authors describe this by referring appropriate publications instead of repeating the results, the readers may understand the significance of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor Discussion and have redrafted this to be less repetitive of the results and better discuss the findings in relation to the broader literature.</p></body></sub-article></article>
